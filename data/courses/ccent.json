first\n\n3\n00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:17,493\nstep on your journey into\nCisco certifications.\n\n4\n00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,910\nIn particular, their routing and\nswitching certifications.\n\n5\n00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,350\nThe CCENT covers a wide\nrange of foundational\n\n6\n00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,550\ntopics that are very important\nto understand if you're gonna\n\n7\n00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,265\nbuild upon them in the more advanced\ncertifications down the road.\n\n8\n00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,040\nNot learning the base material\nreally does create that challenge.\n\n9\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,543\nYou can't learn advanced functionality\nif you don't understand basic\n\n10\n00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:38,100\nfunctionality first.\n\n11\n00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,670\nNow the CCENT, well that E stands for\nentry, and that describes the type of job\n\n12\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,120\nthat this employee, or someone certified\nwith the CCENT would be designed to fill.\n\n13\n00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,960\nEntry level, typically help desk,\ntechnical support type roles.\n\n14\n00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,600\nThese are small office,\nhome office type deployments.\n\n15\n00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,290\nEnvironments that might have one router,\nor one switch, or\n\n16\n00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,070\njust a couple of devices.\n\n17\n00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,785\nNot large or enterprise networks.\n\n18\n00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,800\nThat's where they start stepping\nup into the higher certifications.\n\n19\n00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,325\nIn fact,\nif you look at the certification path,\n\n20\n00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,850\nit's really just increasing the amount\nof devices that you're working with.\n\n21\n00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,190\nLet's take a look at that path real\nquick to get an idea of what I mean.\n\n22\n00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,665\nThis is CISCO's website for the CCENT page\nand they show the different certifications\n\n23\n00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:21,108\nand how they line up, and\nsee how they've arranged it as a pyramid.\n\n24\n00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:26,156\nEach one builds on the ones from before\nit, and the entry certification, that's\n\n25\n00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:31,150\nthat foundation, that's the base level\nthat everything else builds on top of.\n\n26\n00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,958\nSo very important and definitely something\nthat we need to make sure we grasp.\n\n27\n00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:35,740\nAll right.\n\n28\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,360\nAfter that, you progress to that CCNA,\nthe Cisco Certified Network Associate, and\n\n29\n00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,500\nthat's one of the most\nwell-known certifications, and\n\n30\n00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500\nthat's what most people\nare seeking to achieve.\n\n31\n00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,205\nNow you can skip over the CCENT, and\n\n32\n00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:53,215\ngo straight to the CCNA if you've already\nbeen working with Cisco equipment,\n\n33\n00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,025\nif you've already got some\nof the requisite knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,875\nYou'll see a lot of people do that if\nthey already have the network plus\n\n35\n00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,695\ncertification from CompTIA.\n\n36\n00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:05,200\nThe CompTIA network plus actually covers\na lot of the same stuff in the CCENT.\n\n37\n00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,830\nThe big difference is with CompTIA,\nit's vendor neutral training\n\n38\n00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,230\nversus the CCENT which is all from\nCisco and Cisco does have a slightly\n\n39\n00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,460\ndifferent perspective on some of the\ndifferent technologies you'll learn about.\n\n40\n00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,475\nSo, they're very close,\nbut they're not identical.\n\n41\n00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:24,775\nAnd if you do choose to skip the CCENT and\njump right to the CCNA,\n\n42\n00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:28,585\nyou'll have to take a composite exam\nthat's actually made up of both.\n\n43\n00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,197\nSo it's pulling questions from both pools.\n\n44\n00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:34,576\nSo, it's not like you get to skip that\none and not know the information.\n\n45\n00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,350\nYou do have to know the information.\n\n46\n00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,560\nNow for most people just\ngetting started with Cisco,\n\n47\n00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,610\nI do recommend that you start with the\nCCENT and do it separate from the CCNA and\n\n48\n00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,050\nwe'll see why when we get to the exam\nnumbers here in just a moment.\n\n49\n00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,440\nAll right now, the exam covers a wide\nrange of topics and most of them center\n\n50\n00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,900\naround the idea of taking a Cisco router\nor a Cisco switch out of the box,\n\n51\n00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,270\nbrand new, getting it configured and\nput in place in a small network.\n\n52\n00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,970\nAs you move up to the higher\nend certifications like\n\n53\n00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,900\nthe CCNA which is next, it starts to\nget to a slightly larger network,\n\n54\n00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,500\nmaybe 5 to 10 routers and 10 to 20\nswitches or something of that nature.\n\n55\n00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,850\nThen you move up to the CCNP.\n\n56\n00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,350\nAt the CCNP level, the professional level,\n\n57\n00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,890\nthat's where we're talking about hundreds\nor even thousands of routers and\n\n58\n00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,430\nswitches routing across the internet,\nmassive networks.\n\n59\n00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,250\nThis is where we get large,\nenterprise-scale networking knowledge.\n\n60\n00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,688\nAfter that,\nyou move into the expert level, the CCIE.\n\n61\n00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:38,590\nAnd the CCIE is one of those\nreally coveted, highly respected,\n\n62\n00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,630\nvery difficult certifications\nthat are out there, and\n\n63\n00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,180\nit is a level of experience that\nmost people aren't going to need.\n\n64\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,930\nIt's for enterprises.\n\n65\n00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,400\nPeople that have massive networks and\n\n66\n00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,540\nthey need somebody to not just design\na stable network, but maintain and\n\n67\n00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,810\nkeep it going, upgrades and all of that,\nand it's an expert level of knowledge.\n\n68\n00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,638\nIt's really in depth understanding of\nall the different technologies that\n\n69\n00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,980\nare involved.\n\n70\n00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,480\nEach of these certifications is building\noff of the knowledge from the previous\n\n71\n00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,960\none, so\nit forms together in one nice chain.\n\n72\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,400\nNow, the CCENT is one exam.\n\n73\n00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,690\nOne certification.\n\n74\n00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,570\nSo the exam for this one if we\njump over to it's exam page,\n\n75\n00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,540\nis the 100-101, or ICND1 exam.\n\n76\n00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,800\nNow that name, ICND1,\n\n77\n00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,060\nInterconnecting Cisco Network Devices,\nthat's the official Cisco course name.\n\n78\n00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,050\nIf you were to take the official\ncourse through Cisco,\n\n79\n00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,050\nyou'd actually be taking the ICND course.\n\n80\n00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,760\nYou'd then take the 100-101 exam, and\nyou'd receive the CCENT certification.\n\n81\n00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,220\nWith the ITProTV show, we cover all of\nthe exam objectives for the 100-101, so\n\n82\n00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,040\nwe're covering the same content, but\nwe don't call it ICND because, well,\n\n83\n00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,745\nit's not the official Cisco course, right?\n\n84\n00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:51,945\nThey have their own set of training\nthat they use, and we do it differently.\n\n85\n00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,245\nThe certification that you'll get though,\n\n86\n00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,835\nis the same CCENT that\neveryone else gets and\n\n87\n00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:00,635\nthen you progress up to the more advanced\nCCNA level certifications if you want.\n\n88\n00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,355\nNow, notice CCENT is\nkind of by itself here,\n\n89\n00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,975\nversus CCNA has all these specializations,\nrouting and switching,\n\n90\n00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,030\nsecurity, service provider,\nvoice, wireless.\n\n91\n00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,550\nWell CCENT is a prerequisite\nof all of those.\n\n92\n00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,567\nSo, regardless of which\nspecialization you're going for,\n\n93\n00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,081\nCCENT is that starting point.\n\n94\n00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:24,230\nThat's why this is the first\ncertification you'll pursue for Cisco.\n\n95\n00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,680\nNow, when you're ready to take that exam,\nyou can sign up for it.\n\n96\n00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,640\nCisco administers their exams through\na company called Pearson Vue.\n\n97\n00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,340\nYou can go to their website,\nit's www.pearsonvue, that's v-u-e, .com,\n\n98\n00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,600\nforward slash Cisco, that will take you\nto there page and you can go and sign up.\n\n99\n00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880\nIf you're not familiar with Pearson Vue,\nthey have testing centers\n\n100\n00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,990\nall over the world and on their website\nyou can find one that's near to you, so\n\n101\n00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,610\nit's easy to jump on over and\ntake the exam at your leisure, right?\n\n102\n00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,640\nSo it's definitely\na convenient thing to do.\n\n103\n00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,190\nOnce you pass that exam,\nyou get the CCENT certification and\n\n104\n00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,250\nyou're ready to progress beyond that.\n\n105\n00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,190\nLet's take a look at\nthose exam objectives.\n\n106\n00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,216\nThe exam is actually\nmade up of between 40 and\n\n107\n00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:09,120\n45 questions and\nyou have 90 minutes to do it in.\n\n108\n00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,530\nNow that sounds like you have about two\nminutes per question which is really\n\n109\n00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,560\nplenty of time, but the exam is not\njust multiple choice questions.\n\n110\n00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,505\nIt's made up of multiple choice, drag and\ndrop, choose all that apply, right?\n\n111\n00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:25,820\nMulti-answer type questions,\nand simulations.\n\n112\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,920\nSome questions will have\na simulated router or switch and\n\n113\n00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,230\nyou'll have to configure or\ntroubleshoot something.\n\n114\n00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,400\nThose questions take a lot longer\nthan a normal question and\n\n115\n00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,770\nyou'll find that 90 minutes is barely\nenough time to get through all of it.\n\n116\n00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,200\nCisco has done that on purpose.\n\n117\n00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,140\nThey want to make sure that\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n118\n00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,750\nThat you're not just\nsitting there guessing and\n\n119\n00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,140\ntrying to figure your way through it.\n\n120\n00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,070\nThat you know the right thing to do,\nand you move on.\n\n121\n00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,500\nThat does make it a pretty challenging\nexam, but it's pretty rewarding, too.\n\n122\n00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,720\nI definitely enjoy it.\n\n123\n00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,000\nFor the exam topics, the CCENT is\nspread over a large area of topics,\n\n124\n00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,550\nbecause it's all foundational knowledge.\n\n125\n00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,190\nYou're not expected to be an expert\non all of these things, but\n\n126\n00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,010\nyou are expected to have a basic\nunderstanding of the concepts in each.\n\n127\n00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,760\nWe start with just operation\nof IP data networks.\n\n128\n00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280\nHow do IP base networks function?\n\n129\n00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,580\nHow do IP addresses work?\n\n130\n00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,250\nHow do we have basic communications?\n\n131\n00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,520\nWhat is Ethernet?\n\n132\n00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380\nWhat is CSMA/CD?\n\n133\n00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,940\nThese are all things that\nyou need to understand\n\n134\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,390\njust to understand how\na basic network functions.\n\n135\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,670\nAfter that, we take a look at\nLAN switching technologies and\n\n136\n00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,000\nthat's the chance for the viewer to\nlearn how to configure a Cisco switch.\n\n137\n00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320\nWe take a blank brand new Cisco switch and\n\n138\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,940\nwe go through all the different\nconfiguration values that you can place on\n\n139\n00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,470\nit to get it operational\nin a small environment.\n\n140\n00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,280\nThen we tackle IP addressing specifically.\n\n141\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,970\nYou'll find that IP addresses are a lot\nmore complex than most people think, and\n\n142\n00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,970\nthere's a lot of neat stuff\nyou can do with them.\n\n143\n00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,615\nSo we spend a lot of\ntime discussing that and\n\n144\n00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:55,585\nnot just IPv4 but IPv6 also because that's\nthe way the networks are moving today.\n\n145\n00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,045\nThen we jump into routing.\n\n146\n00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:02,045\nIP routing technologies is where we take\na look at configuring a Cisco router and\n\n147\n00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:06,065\ngetting it in place to allow\ncommunication between networks.\n\n148\n00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,235\nWe also look at some dynamic routing\nprotocols and how the routers can\n\n149\n00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:13,030\ntalk to each other to learn the best\nroute between two different locations.\n\n150\n00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,050\nIP services is the next one and\n\n151\n00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,600\nthat expands upon the routing\nservices that we talked about before.\n\n152\n00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,820\nWe'll get a chance to see some of\nthe other things that our routers can do.\n\n153\n00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,370\nThey can do a lot of stuff.\n\n154\n00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,980\nYou'll find that routers can\nactually be used as firewalls, or\n\n155\n00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,300\nas VPN tunnel endpoints.\n\n156\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,480\nThere's all kinds of cool things\nthat a Cisco router can do,\n\n157\n00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640\nif you just know to turn it on.\n\n158\n00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,910\nNext we've got security and this is\nNetwork Device Security specifically,\n\n159\n00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,430\nwhich is saying if an attacker compromises\nyour router or if they compromise your\n\n160\n00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,470\nswitch, there's a lot of stuff they\ncould do to access your data and\n\n161\n00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,970\nyou won't even know it.\n\n162\n00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,510\nSo we need to secure our routers and\nswitches to ensure that\n\n163\n00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,180\nunauthorized access isn't allowed, and so\nwe focus on that in that sixth session.\n\n164\n00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,070\nAnd then the last section\nis troubleshooting.\n\n165\n00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,790\nOne of the basic troubleshooting steps for\nlocating issues in your network and\n\n166\n00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,890\nresolving them as quickly and\nefficiently as possible.\n\n167\n00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,920\nAll of this is great knowledge and\nyou'll see each topic has a certain\n\n168\n00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,370\npercentage value of the exam and\nit's pretty evenly spread.\n\n169\n00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,810\nSome were as small as 6% or as large\nas 26%, but every one of them weighs in\n\n170\n00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,370\na good bit, and it's all good\nfoundational knowledge to have.\n\n171\n00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,890\nAll right, now the ICND1 is\nthe first exam that you'll do,\n\n172\n00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,300\nand when you pass that,\nyou get your CCENT.\n\n173\n00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,590\nIf you move onto the CCNA,\nthe next level, well it has its own exam.\n\n174\n00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,960\nAnd if I jump back here, I'll just\nswitch over to the CCNA real quick so\n\n175\n00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,520\nwe can see it.\n\n176\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,616\nNotice on the CCNA it has two exams.\n\n177\n00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,414\nThe 100-101 and 200-101.\n\n178\n00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,481\nThat's ICND1 and ICND2.\n\n179\n00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:53,000\nBasically you have to have your\nCCENT in order to get your CCNA.\n\n180\n00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,520\nSo the first one is that same CCENT exam,\nand\n\n181\n00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,110\nthe second one is specifically for\nthe CCNA.\n\n182\n00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,910\nYou've gotta do both.\n\n183\n00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,114\nNow I said you could skip\nthe CCENT if you wanted.\n\n184\n00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:08,198\nIf you wanna skip it, if you've already\ngot the base knowledge, if you've already\n\n185\n00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:11,879\ngot a network plus certification for\nexample, you might choose to skip past\n\n186\n00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,870\nthe CCENT, and if you do, you can take\nthis exam right here, the composite exam.\n\n187\n00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,645\nThe 200-120.\n\n188\n00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:22,640\nIt's one exam and\nit covers both sets of knowledge.\n\n189\n00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,220\nAll of the ICND1 and 2, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,920\nThat's how you would go about\nskipping the CCENT, but\n\n191\n00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,590\nI'll tell you, it's not really worth it.\n\n192\n00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,210\nAnd the reason is,\nyou don't save any money,\n\n193\n00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,050\nthe composite exam actually costs as much\nas the two individual exams combined.\n\n194\n00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,630\nSo, you don't save any money by doing\nit and you open yourself up to risk.\n\n195\n00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,100\nWe always hope that we pass the exam\non the first time, but if for\n\n196\n00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,230\nsome reason you don't pass, well,\nif you took them separately,\n\n197\n00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,980\nyou may have passed the first one and\nnot the second, you get your CCEMT, right?\n\n198\n00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,670\nBut not your CCNA.\n\n199\n00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,280\nIf you don't pass the composite exam,\nyou get nothing, right?\n\n200\n00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,740\nYou get no certification.\n\n201\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,610\nSo it's almost like a safety net to\ngo ahead and take them separately.\n\n202\n00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,450\nIt just costs you time, right?\n\n203\n00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,280\nAn additional 90 minutes to go and\nsit the other exam, but\n\n204\n00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,900\nthat is how I recommend you do it.\n\n205\n00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,620\nSo CCENT, even if you already have\nthe knowledge, it's good to go ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,210\nget it cuz you'll get that certification\non your resume, and you've got\n\n207\n00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,900\na little bit less risk and a smaller area\nof data to focus in for that second exam.\n\n208\n00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,935\nAll right well, that's what the CCENT\nis designed for entry-level people\n\n209\n00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:34,160\ngetting ready for help desk and support\ntype positions, small networks, right?\n\n210\n00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,730\nAnd it's a good certification,\n\n211\n00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,100\ndefinitely a great way to get\nyour feet wet with Cisco.\n\n212\n00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,010\nIf that sounds exciting to you and\nit sounds like what you need to learn,\n\n213\n00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,600\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n214\n00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,820\nStay tuned because we've got CCENT\nepisodes coming up after this.\n\n215\n00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,770\nIf that doesn't sound right for you, for\nexample if you wanna skip past this and\n\n216\n00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,270\njump to CCNA, well, be sure to do that.\n\n217\n00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,570\nIt's all part of the ITProTV library and\nit's part of your subscription, so\n\n218\n00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,820\nyou can start wherever\nyou feel is appropriate.\n\n219\n00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,145\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n220\n00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,330\nThat's one of the nice\nthings about our service.\n\n221\n00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,098\nAll right well for those of you that\nare sticking with me, let's go ahead and\n\n222\n00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:05,627\nget started.\n\n223\n00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:09,784\n[SOUND]\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,761\nAnd welcome back to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,700\nYour host, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,571\n>> Nathan Copeland.\n\n8\n00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,360\n>> With that guy.\n\n9\n00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,894\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:43,481\n>> And [LAUGH] and\nwe are jumping into an exciting new\n\n11\n00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:49,470\nchapter in IT Pro TV as we\nopen up our first Cisco show.\n\n12\n00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,390\n>> This is the one I am most excited about\nto see running, a lot of good stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,020\n>> Yeah, you know it's funny,\nNate, you've been studying\n\n14\n00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,980\nin your own time to get your CCNA and\nkinda going through this.\n\n15\n00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,345\n>> Yeah, just enough to impress you.\n\n16\n00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And try to get respect among my peers.\n\n17\n00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,868\n>> It's failed so far.\n\n18\n00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,018\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n19\n00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,560\nI've been working with Cisco equipment for\na long time.\n\n20\n00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,730\nI've been CISCO certified since 1999,\nI think is what we figured yesterday.\n\n21\n00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,140\nSo about 14 years.\n\n22\n00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,940\nAnd so I work with it a lot and we've been\ndoing our network+ show, a lot of you guys\n\n23\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,630\nhave probably tuned in for network+, maybe\nyou've already watched that whole thing.\n\n24\n00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,930\nAnd in the network+ shows, that's CompTIA.\n\n25\n00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,160\nAnd everything we do has\nto be vendor neutral.\n\n26\n00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,470\nAnd I constantly find myself during\nthat show, having to say, all right,\n\n27\n00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,231\ndon't use this term.\n\n28\n00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,762\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's a Cisco term,\n\n29\n00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,680\nI gotta use the CompTIA generic term.\n\n30\n00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,930\nBut in this show, the gloves are off.\n\n31\n00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,710\nNo holds barred.\n\n32\n00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,540\nIt is straight up Cisco time.\n\n33\n00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,970\nThat vender neutrality\nstuff out the window.\n\n34\n00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,820\nSo before we get started into\nactual exam objectives and\n\n35\n00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,030\ncontent, let's just take a moment\nsince this is the very first show.\n\n36\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,220\nAnd talk a little bit about\nthe certification itself.\n\n37\n00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,610\n>> Which has just recently changed.\n\n38\n00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,320\n>> Absolutely.\n\n39\n00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,430\n>> Just recently depending on\nwhen you're watching this video.\n\n40\n00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,675\nCaptured for eternity in video.\n\n41\n00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,779\n[LAUGH].\n>> [LAUGH] l Good point.\n\n42\n00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:17,349\nGood point.\n\n43\n00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,601\n>> For our live viewers,\nboy this just changed.\n\n44\n00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:24,279\nSo the CCENT is a new certification.\n\n45\n00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:28,098\nIt is the Cisco Certified\nEntry Network Technician.\n\n46\n00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:33,498\nThe CCNA, or\nCisco Certified Network Associate.\n\n47\n00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,413\n>> Associate.\n>> Yeah, Associate that's right.\n\n48\n00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:36,446\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n49\n00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:41,264\nLike I said, I got my CCNA 14 years\nago and so it's been around a while.\n\n50\n00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,538\nIt's always been two exams\nto get the certification.\n\n51\n00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:48,465\nSo you do one exam and\nthen you do the second one.\n\n52\n00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:51,810\n[LAUGH] And when you pass that second\nexam then you get your certification.\n\n53\n00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,390\nYou pass the first exam\nyou don't get anything.\n\n54\n00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,910\nBragging rights I suppose.\n\n55\n00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,914\nSo, Cisco changed almost two\nyears ago now they changed it,\n\n56\n00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,277\nto introduce a new certification.\n\n57\n00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:07,976\nWhen you pass that first exam you\nactually get your CCENT which is awesome.\n\n58\n00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,856\nYou get credit for what you've done.\n\n59\n00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,688\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n60\n00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:19,052\nRing through some of the objectives and\neverything that CCENT,\n\n61\n00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:25,920\n[COUGH] at times it looks more of, yeah,\na lot of good skill and configuring stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,110\nAnd rather than just an entry level,\nit may be an entry level but\n\n63\n00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,840\nyeah, I mean it's, you can do\na lot of stuff once you've got it.\n\n64\n00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,340\n>> The way I always look at it\nis if you are CCENT, certified,\n\n65\n00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,140\nright that first certification.\n\n66\n00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,460\nThat certifies that you know\nhow to take a Cisco router\n\n67\n00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,940\n>> Or a Cisco switch, brand new,\n\n68\n00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,110\nout of the box, and get it configured and\nrunning on a network.\n\n69\n00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,990\nRight?\nSo one router or\n\n70\n00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,000\none switch, fired up, off you go.\n\n71\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,460\nCCNA, now that's a little bit higher,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,450\nThat's the next tier and if your CCNAs are\nfine, that shows that you're able to take\n\n73\n00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,220\nmore than one router or\nmore than one switch and\n\n74\n00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,580\nget us set up in a small office,\nhome office, branch office type topology.\n\n75\n00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,060\nAnd then Cisco's got\ntheir higher tier stuff.\n\n76\n00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,850\nLike the CCNP,\n\n77\n00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,870\nI'm a CCNP and that means you can handle\nhundreds of routers and switches.\n\n78\n00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,340\nA little more corporate size and\nlarger environments.\n\n79\n00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,140\nBut it all starts right here.\n\n80\n00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,320\nWith that first router or first switch.\n\n81\n00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,990\nA lot of you guys out there,\nyou've probably worked with routers and\n\n82\n00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,200\nswitches before.\n\n83\n00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000\nIf you haven't,\nthis may be your exposure to it.\n\n84\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,210\nAnd so we start with the basics, right?\n\n85\n00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,580\nAnd kinda getting in there, and so\nthat's basically where we start today.\n\n86\n00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,309\nThat we jump into our generalities, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,384\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We kinda summarize everything that we\n\n88\n00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:42,085\ndo in Network+.\n\n89\n00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,082\nBut we put it in CISCO terms.\n\n90\n00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,450\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n91\n00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,828\n>> The other thing worth mentioning here,\nnot that things aren't worth mentioning,\n\n92\n00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:54,848\nthe other thing that I want to mention,\nis that the exams did update, right.\n\n93\n00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,693\nAnd so, while the CCENT has been out for\nabout two years,\n\n94\n00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:02,030\nthe exams just changed,\nwhen did they change?\n\n95\n00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,320\nThey're in the process\nof changing right now.\n\n96\n00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,560\n>> Yeah, I think in March or\n\n97\n00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,680\nsomething it was starting to\ntransition things over and so now.\n\n98\n00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,800\n>> I'm just going to pull up\nthe Cisco page here real quick so\n\n99\n00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,550\nI can show everybody what I mean.\n\n100\n00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,730\nWhen we take a look at, and\nI'm just on Cisco's website.\n\n101\n00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,690\nIf you go to like, www.cisco.com/go/ccna,\n\n102\n00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,190\nit takes you right into there and\nyou can find everything.\n\n103\n00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,164\nBut basically, right on their website,\n\n104\n00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:42,464\nit shows where we've got the 640-882 exam.\n\n105\n00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:46,928\nThat's the old exam, and\nit expires September 30th, right?\n\n106\n00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:50,410\nSo that's like a month away.\n\n107\n00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,240\nSo you can still take that one today,\nbut it's going away.\n\n108\n00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,680\nFor everybody just starting out,\n\n109\n00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,760\nit's now the 100-101 exam is the one\nthat you need to take to get certified.\n\n110\n00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160\nAnd so that's what the show\nis going to be built around.\n\n111\n00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,300\nWe are going to be focusing\non that new stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,610\nWhat if, you were already\ncertified in the old stuff and\n\n113\n00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,050\nyou're just trying to learn the new stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,800\nOr what if you bought a bunch of books for\nthe old exam number.\n\n115\n00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,500\nAre you out of luck?\n\n116\n00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000\nDo you need to throw them away?\n\n117\n00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,130\nNo right, there's really not\nall that much that's changed.\n\n118\n00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,470\nThere's a bigger stress on IPv6,\n\n119\n00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,640\nso we see a lot more IPv6 stuff\nthan what we saw previously.\n\n120\n00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,790\nAnd they bumped the iOS version.\n\n121\n00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,162\nSo the operating system\nrunning on our routers and\n\n122\n00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:38,909\nswitches on the old exam,\nit was the 12.2 and 12.4 versions.\n\n123\n00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:46,372\nOn the new exam, it's the 15.0,\n15.1, I think 15.2.\n\n124\n00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,892\nThey constantly release new ones.\n\n125\n00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,087\nAnd millennium edition.\n\n126\n00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:51,854\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:52,643\n>> Oh, yeah!\n\n128\n00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:53,688\n>> Cisco IOS millennium edition.\n\n129\n00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,465\nThe special one?\n\n130\n00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:59,492\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's enough of an intro all right.\n\n131\n00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,130\nThink of anything else we\nwant to throw out there?\n\n132\n00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,311\n>> No, just exam stuff.\n\n133\n00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,423\nI mean,\nthe real good stuff that was coming.\n\n134\n00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,260\n>> All right.\n\n135\n00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,900\nSo let's jump into the goods.\n\n136\n00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,380\nLet's get right in there and\ntackle some of this.\n\n137\n00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,440\nSo we're gonna start out\nwith our first objective.\n\n138\n00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,690\nAnd basically we've got just the Cisco\nexam objectives, and we make sure that we\n\n139\n00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,270\ncover every single aspect of that so\nthat you're prepared for the exam.\n\n140\n00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,170\nAnd the objectives start out with a nice\nbig general section which is Operation of\n\n141\n00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,860\nIP Data Networks, or what I like to call,\nsummarizing Network+.\n\n142\n00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,554\nThat's basically what it is, so.\n\n143\n00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:39,195\n>> Yeah, and you know Don,\nlooking through the objectives and\n\n144\n00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:44,200\nwhatnot preparing for this,\nit really does just take everything\n\n145\n00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,478\nfrom network+ stuff and just crams\nit all into this first section and\n\n146\n00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,665\nthere's still a lot, so if- I would\nsay if some of these concepts or\n\n147\n00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:58,032\nthings are new, or not terribly familiar,\n\n148\n00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:03,690\nthen it would be beneficial then to\nget a little bit more in depth, right?\n\n149\n00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,650\n>> Absolutely.\n\n150\n00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,665\nAnd that's the cool thing about.\n\n151\n00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:11,285\nBy ITProTV is that, if any of this\nstuff is completely new to you,\n\n152\n00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,585\nwe're covering it here with an assumption\nthat you got that basic knowledge,\n\n153\n00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,175\ncause that's what Cisco assumes you have.\n\n154\n00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,115\nAnd if you don't have that\nbasic knowledge, well,\n\n155\n00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:19,125\njust jump right over to\nthe Network Plus show.\n\n156\n00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,800\nIt's part of your subscription.\n\n157\n00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,330\nAnd you can go in there and watch that,\nand get caught up, or get more in depth.\n\n158\n00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,012\nSo, things that we're\ngoing to talk about today,\n\n159\n00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,280\nactually I don't know if we'll\nget to it in today's show.\n\n160\n00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,572\nBut, like the OSI model, right?\n\n161\n00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,710\nWe're gonna talk about it in brief, but\n\n162\n00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,490\nwe go into that it in depth\nin the network plus show.\n\n163\n00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,955\nSo, definitely, take advantage\nof that if you haven't already.\n\n164\n00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,900\nNetwork plus is a great certification.\n\n165\n00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,410\nIt doesn't have the resume\nvisibility that a CCNA does, right?\n\n166\n00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,330\nPeople really like to see that on\na resume, but it is still good to have.\n\n167\n00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,848\n>> Yeah, I would agree.\n\n168\n00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:50,861\n>> All right.\n\n169\n00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n170\n00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,845\nthat we have Nate's blessing on that.\n\n171\n00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:54,840\n>> [LAUGH] So.\n\n172\n00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,600\n>> All right, lets go ahead and\njump into some stuff, right?\n\n173\n00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,580\nSo, the very first topic\nthat we're gonna hit on,\n\n174\n00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,200\nis just understanding what network devices\nwe're gonna be dealing with, right?\n\n175\n00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,190\nSo, we're talking about routers,\nswitches, bridges and hubs.\n\n176\n00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,880\nSo those are the four devices\nthat we need to be aware of\n\n177\n00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,110\nto make it through this show, right?\n\n178\n00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,430\nSo, let's just start out with hubs and\nkind of go from there, right?\n\n179\n00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,810\nDo you wanna tackle that?\n\n180\n00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n181\n00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,865\nSo hubs, they're pretty simple devices.\n\n182\n00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:25,455\nThis is in the way that they do things.\n\n183\n00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:30,425\nPorts or computers plug into it and\nwhen traffic travels\n\n184\n00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:35,035\nfrom one computer into another,\nthe hub will take that traffic and\n\n185\n00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:38,405\nflood it out all the other\nports to all the computers.\n\n186\n00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,305\nAnd so everybody hears the traffic,\n\n187\n00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:45,290\nthe computers that the traffic wasn't\nmean to, they'll just drop it.\n\n188\n00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,210\nAnd the other computer will get it.\n\n189\n00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,240\nAnd if you have multiple\nhubs than that traffic, and\n\n190\n00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,770\nthat flood will start going to everyone.\n\n191\n00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,310\n>> And\nthe purpose of a hub is really to be that\n\n192\n00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,890\nfirst building block of a network, right?\n\n193\n00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,280\nIn the original networks,\nthe networks back in the 70s.\n\n194\n00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,230\nYou would have two computers which\nwere the size of a house, and\n\n195\n00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,740\nyou'd run a network cable from\none to the other and that was it.\n\n196\n00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,360\nIt just connected two systems, but as the\nfunctions and network started to grow we\n\n197\n00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,310\nneeded more than two computers and\nI say we, I was in diapers.\n\n198\n00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:25,360\nBut a so in the 80s, we really started\nto see the proliferation of hubs.\n\n199\n00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,200\nAnd it functions exactly like Nate\ndescribed, let me do a little picture\n\n200\n00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,780\nbecause I'm a visual person myself-\n>> I like your pictures.\n\n201\n00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:41,450\n>> I'm the Bob Ross of network diagrams,\n[INAUDIBLE] happy tree, so basically\n\n202\n00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,970\nif we take a look at a hub it's a box,\nand it'll have a series of ports on it.\n\n203\n00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,690\nNow, the smallest hub I've\never seen had four ports.\n\n204\n00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,220\nIf you go to the store,\nmost of them seem to have five ports, but\n\n205\n00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,600\nyou can get big ones.\n\n206\n00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,130\nYou can get 24 port ones, and 48 port.\n\n207\n00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,250\nI think the biggest hub\nI've seen is 48 ports, but\n\n208\n00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,100\nbasically it just has\na bunch of ports on it.\n\n209\n00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,780\nAnd you take your PCs, and\nyou plug your PCs into that device, right?\n\n210\n00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,030\nSo each PC would have a cable, and\n\n211\n00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,290\nthat would plug it into a port on the hub,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,350\nOn a hub, it doesn't really matter what\nport you plug into, they're all the same.\n\n213\n00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n214\n00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,886\nbasically when one computer wants to talk\nanother if PC1 wants to talk to PC4.\n\n215\n00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:31,820\nWell, it sends its communication up to\nthe hub, and the hub just blasts it out\n\n216\n00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,400\nto everybody, and so that communication\nmakes it over there to PC4 gets it.\n\n217\n00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,900\nAnd off we go, right?\n\n218\n00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,090\nSo, the hub facilitates allowing multiple\npeople to communicate together, right?\n\n219\n00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,170\nHere's four computers that can now\nall talk to each other just fine.\n\n220\n00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,530\nAll right, so that's a hub.\n\n221\n00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,100\nThe next thing is a bridge, all right?\n\n222\n00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,800\nIt's Cisco specific, a bridge.\n\n223\n00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,180\nNow, the first thing that I guess I need\nto mention is when we talk about hubs and\n\n224\n00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,360\nbridges, these are two devices that\nCisco calls out specifically, but\n\n225\n00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,290\nyou're not really gonna see in real life.\n\n226\n00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,050\nOr at least not in their true form,\n\n227\n00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,280\nso hubs have a slight\nproblem they're inefficient.\n\n228\n00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,080\nWhen I drew that diagram,\nI showed how data went in one port, and\n\n229\n00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,238\nit was thrown out every other port, right?\n\n230\n00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:24,520\nAd on a five port hub that's not a big\ndeal, and if you have ten computers on\n\n231\n00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,665\nyour network, it's not a big deal,\nbut if you have 80 computers.\n\n232\n00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,535\nOr if you have 100, or\n\n233\n00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:32,345\n200, or 1000 computers,\nthe hubs are horribly inefficient.\n\n234\n00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:35,275\nSo, they don't scale well to big networks.\n\n235\n00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:39,445\nSo, in the late 80s,\nthey realized there was an issue.\n\n236\n00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:42,300\nThe that as your network grew\nit just got too bogged down, and\n\n237\n00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,190\nyou couldn't get very big.\n\n238\n00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,460\nAnd so that's where bridges comes in.\n\n239\n00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,680\nAnd bridges were a special device\nthat usually just had two ports.\n\n240\n00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,790\nA left and a right-side or a one and\na two or whatever it was labeled.\n\n241\n00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,250\nAnd you'd stick it in\nthe middle of your network, and\n\n242\n00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,030\nit would effectively divide\nthe network in half.\n\n243\n00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,350\nFiltering some of the traffic passing\nfrom one side to another, right?\n\n244\n00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,450\nAnd that made things\na lot more efficient and\n\n245\n00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,490\nthat allowed us to have more\ncomputers on the network.\n\n246\n00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,680\nSo this bridge,\nactually did a special function.\n\n247\n00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,660\nI'm going to hold off on that.\n\n248\n00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,950\nI don't want to get too technical,\non how it works exactly right now.\n\n249\n00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,900\nWe'll do that probably\nin the next episode.\n\n250\n00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,520\nBut basically,\n\n251\n00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,537\nit just will allow that network to scale\na lot larger by making it more efficient.\n\n252\n00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,056\n>> Nice.\nAnd [COUGH] a bridges picture, right,\n\n253\n00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:31,206\non network diagrams and whatnot.\n\n254\n00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:34,723\nIt's a rectangle with\na little circle cut out.\n\n255\n00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:41,692\n>> Yeah, and Cisco,\ntheir logo is the golden gate bridge, and.\n\n256\n00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,115\n>> [LAUGH] It plays off of that?\n\n257\n00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,190\n>> Well, a bridge is the very\nfirst product they manufactured.\n\n258\n00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,840\n>> All right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n259\n00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,380\nIt's kind of history of the company,\nright?\n\n260\n00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,070\nI'll tell you I have the unofficial\nhistory of Cisco if you're,\n\n261\n00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,060\nare you familiar with it?\n\n262\n00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,150\n>> I-\n>> So, I'm gonna screw some of this up,\n\n263\n00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,830\ncuz I don't have all\nthe details memorized.\n\n264\n00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,380\nBut basically, the company was\nfounded by a husband and wife.\n\n265\n00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,140\nAnd they worked at a college and\nI want to say it was UC Berkley, but\n\n266\n00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,570\nI could be wrong on that.\n\n267\n00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,490\nI guess I could look it up?\n\n268\n00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,400\nBut anyhow, they were at a college and\nthe college had networks, right?\n\n269\n00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,780\nThey were small networks and\nthey were departmental.\n\n270\n00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,900\nThe husband and wife work in two different\ndepartments, and they had computers, but\n\n271\n00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,620\nthey couldn't send each other emails,\nbecause the two systems were separate.\n\n272\n00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,790\nThey were separate networks and\nthey had to be because the networks were\n\n273\n00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,290\nlarge enough they were getting\ninefficient with the hums.\n\n274\n00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,440\nAnd so, they built a computer\nthat had two network cards, and\n\n275\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,030\nit was their first bridge.\n\n276\n00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,350\nAnd it allowed them to connect\nthese two networks and\n\n277\n00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,010\nsend each other emails, and\nsay you want to go to lunch today, right?\n\n278\n00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,340\nVery important stuff.\n\n279\n00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,810\nSo they created this bridge, and at a lot\nof universities when you invent something\n\n280\n00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,820\nnew, it becomes the intellectual\nproperty of the university.\n\n281\n00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,520\nAnd so they went to the university and\nthey said, we built this bridge and\n\n282\n00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,660\nwe used it on your network, so\ndo you want the rights for it?\n\n283\n00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,520\nAnd the university said no,\nwe don't think that's gonna go anywhere.\n\n284\n00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,700\nYou can have it.\n\n285\n00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,540\nAnd so they got the rights for\nit, and then they built Cisco.\n\n286\n00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,270\nAnd a few years later, sold it, so\n\n287\n00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,100\nthey're not Involved in\nthe company at all any more.\n\n288\n00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,180\nAnd made millions of dollars, or whatever.\n\n289\n00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,500\nand that's how Cisco started.\n\n290\n00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,880\nIt was in California,\nthe Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n291\n00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,710\nA bridge was the first\nprivately manufactured,\n\n292\n00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,950\nit all kind of goes full circle.\n\n293\n00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,680\n>> Good.\n\n294\n00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,980\nThat's nice.\n\n295\n00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,030\n>> The point was history of the company,\nI suppose.\n\n296\n00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,740\nAnyhow, so that leads us to our\nnext device, which is the switch.\n\n297\n00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,970\n>> Yep.\nAnd the switch makes some changes.\n\n298\n00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,456\nIt's a lot more efficient.\n\n299\n00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:42,086\nAnd now when traffic comes in on one port,\nit only gets sent out the port for\n\n300\n00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,738\nwhich it is destined for.\n\n301\n00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:44,375\n>> Yes.\n\n302\n00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,870\nSo a switch actually combines.\n\n303\n00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,156\nA hub and a bridge,\nit combines them into a single product and\n\n304\n00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:56,357\non a switch, every single port\nis effectively a bridge, so\n\n305\n00:15:56,357 --> 00:16:01,570\nif I have a five port switch,\nwhat I really have is a five port bridge.\n\n306\n00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,940\nAnd so then the terms in a network plus\nthe terms are not interchangeable.\n\n307\n00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,460\nBut in Cisco land, referring to your\nswitch as a bridge is perfectly acceptable\n\n308\n00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,770\nand you will see on the Cisco web site and\nCisco documentation,\n\n309\n00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,010\nthey constantly interchange\nthose terms between bridging and\n\n310\n00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,120\nswitching, it really is\nbasically the same thing.\n\n311\n00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,010\nBut it does exactly whats being said,\nso using my diagram as an example,\n\n312\n00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,996\nif PC1 wants to talk to PC4,\ninstead of bogging everybody down with it,\n\n313\n00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:37,590\nthe switch just sends that traffic to PC4.\n\n314\n00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,182\nAnd that leaves the other computers\nfree to talk, so for example,\n\n315\n00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:45,390\nPC3 could be talking to PC2 independently.\n\n316\n00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,550\nSo switches can handle multiply,\nsimultaneous communications.\n\n317\n00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,650\nAnd that's a real important thing.\n\n318\n00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,980\nAnd we'll talk about more\nspecifically how that\n\n319\n00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,490\nworks back exactly when we get\ninto the switching section.\n\n320\n00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,500\nBut for right now, just understand\nthat a switch is very efficient and\n\n321\n00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,928\nit combines the functions of a hub and\na bridge.\n\n322\n00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,336\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n323\n00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,220\nYeah, nice.\n\n324\n00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,890\n>> And in the early days,\nswitches were really expensive, so\n\n325\n00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,260\nit would be, I remember the first\ntime I bought a switch.\n\n326\n00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,740\nNot for myself, for the company, but\n\n327\n00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,590\nyou can get a hub at the time for\nabout $100 a port.\n\n328\n00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,670\nSo if you wanted a five port hub,\nit was about $500.\n\n329\n00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,360\nAnd a switch was $1,000 a port,\nso a five port switch was $5,000.\n\n330\n00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,250\nIt was ridiculous.\n\n331\n00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,140\nIt was basically ten times the cost.\n\n332\n00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,350\nWell, that's really changed these days,\nand the costs are so\n\n333\n00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,210\nlow you can a five port switch\ndown at Best Buy for 50 bucks,\n\n334\n00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,525\nor probably less, probably $30 if\nyou get one of the off brands.\n\n335\n00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:47,300\nBut the prices are so\n\n336\n00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,250\nlow now in this technology that\nyou really don't see hubs anymore.\n\n337\n00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,630\nIt's pretty much just\nall switches out there.\n\n338\n00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,470\n>> And [COUGH] so switches, sorry.\n\n339\n00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,850\nI mean there's, you know,\nswitches can do different things.\n\n340\n00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,590\nBut a switch generally would be for\nlocal traffic.\n\n341\n00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,090\n>> Yes.\n\n342\n00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,620\nSo, what if we have non local traffic,\nright?\n\n343\n00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,440\nAnd and\nwe're connected to a wide area network.\n\n344\n00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,000\nAnd we haven't used that term right?\n\n345\n00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,682\nSo if we're connected to like,\nthe Internet?\n\n346\n00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:19,480\nAll right, or if we're connected\nto some kind of telephone network,\n\n347\n00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,960\nmeaningless terms right, frame relay,\nT1, stuff like that, the types of\n\n348\n00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,950\nconnections you buy from a phone company,\nif you're connected to those networks.\n\n349\n00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,180\nSwitches aren't designed\nto work with them.\n\n350\n00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,940\nAnd that's where our last device come in,\nwhich is the router.\n\n351\n00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,570\n>> So, routers will take\ntraffic from one network, and\n\n352\n00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,680\nsend it over to another network.\n\n353\n00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,220\nIt will, route the traffic.\n\n354\n00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,260\n>> It just allows you to communicate\nto machines that are connected\n\n355\n00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,840\nto a separate network somewhere.\n\n356\n00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,920\nAnd, router are extremely efficient and\n\n357\n00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,760\nthey allow us to do conversions\nfrom one network type to another.\n\n358\n00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840\nSo it really makes things powerful.\n\n359\n00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,010\nYou guys at home,\n\n360\n00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,770\nyou more than likely are going through\nsome of these devices right now.\n\n361\n00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,390\nAlthough at home, it's really common for\npeople to get the combo device,\n\n362\n00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,280\nthe device that is a switch and a router\nand a wireless access point all combined.\n\n363\n00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,230\nIt is providing all those functions,\nbut it is basically\n\n364\n00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,376\neach of those things just\nstuck in one plastic case.\n\n365\n00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,895\n>> Mm-hm, yep, nice.\n\n366\n00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:31,700\n>> All right, so router, very common if\nyou're gonna be connected to the Internet,\n\n367\n00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,740\nyou're gonna have one.\n\n368\n00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,300\nSwitches, you only need a switch if you\nhave more than two computers, right,\n\n369\n00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,920\nwhich most networks do.\n\n370\n00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,770\nSo if you have more than two computers,\nyou probably have a switch also.\n\n371\n00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,680\nAnd then we'll talk about wireless and\nstuff later on.\n\n372\n00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,800\n>> Those are the main devices that\nCisco calls out right at the beginning.\n\n374\n00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,557\nIsn't it?\n\n375\n00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,334\nAnything else.\n\n376\n00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:56,570\n>> Yeah,\nit does mention network devices, right?\n\n377\n00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,604\nYou know, things on the network, right?\n\n378\n00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:02,290\nSo I mean, it includes things and\ndevices, right?\n\n379\n00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:09,150\nYour printers and\nnetwork attached stores, right?\n\n380\n00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,430\nNetwork devices.\n\n381\n00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,190\nThings on there.\n\n382\n00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,990\nOther stuff that can be\nattached to the network.\n\n383\n00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,980\n>> It's a great point.\n\n384\n00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,700\nSo when I refer to routers,\nhubs, switches, bridges,\n\n385\n00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,650\nI always say these are things that allow\ncomputers to talk to each other, but\n\n386\n00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,470\nnetworks are a lot more than\njust computers these days.\n\n387\n00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,610\nNow we do have network attached storage,\n\n388\n00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,300\nand I'm trying to think of the devices\nI have on my network at home.\n\n389\n00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,422\nSo I've got my little voice over IP,\nOB, high box or whatever.\n\n390\n00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:40,800\n[COUGH] You also have things like\nyour wireless access points,\n\n391\n00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,930\nnetwork storage, I have a network\nattached TV tuner at home.\n\n392\n00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,475\nThese are all things that your network\nis allowing to intercommunicate.\n\n393\n00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,140\nYup.\nAll connected with the wires and\n\n395\n00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,750\neverything into our switches,\nand hubs, and routers.\n\n396\n00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,950\nAnd take your traffic,\nand out into the world.\n\n397\n00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,460\n>> Yeah,\nyou wouldn't get very far without it.\n\n398\n00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,865\nSo it's kinda the heart of\neverything that you do.\n\n399\n00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:03,751\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:04,346\nYeah.\n\n401\n00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,140\n>> All right, so\n\n402\n00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,870\nall these devices, Here's where we start\nto get into why I like network so much.\n\n403\n00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,015\nNetworking is kinda my\npersonal comfort zone.\n\n404\n00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:17,440\n[LAUGH] When I work on servers, so\n\n405\n00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,620\nif I'm working on a Windows server or\na Linux server or whatever.\n\n406\n00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:28,010\nWhen you are working on those you'd think\ncomputers are ones and zeros, on and off.\n\n407\n00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,010\nYou'd think things would work or not work,\nbut if you've worked with Windows at all,\n\n408\n00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,060\nyou know that it is not consistent.\n\n409\n00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,680\nBut there's a middle ground that\nyou hit more often than not and so\n\n410\n00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,520\nthings partially work, and\n\n411\n00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,750\nthere's this mystery as to what\nthe hell's going on at any given time.\n\n412\n00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,150\nAnd so\n\n413\n00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,400\nit's frustrating, in the networking world\nthough things are a lot easier right?\n\n414\n00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,020\nI shouldn't say easier,\nthey're a lot more stable,\n\n415\n00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,740\nthat you don't really care what\nsoftware somebody's running.\n\n416\n00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,500\nYou don't care what operating\nsystem they're running.\n\n417\n00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,700\nYou don't care who it is\nthey're trying to talk to.\n\n418\n00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,340\nAll you care about is getting data from\npoint A to point B, and that's it.\n\n419\n00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,410\nAnd the routing operating systems and\nthe switch operating systems are extremely\n\n420\n00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,380\nfocused on just the duties\nthat they perform.\n\n421\n00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,740\nAnd so, when you configure\nthings in the routing and\n\n422\n00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,500\nswitching world,\ntypically they either work or they don't.\n\n423\n00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,540\nYou don't have that middle ground, and\nthat's a lot more comforting to me,\n\n424\n00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,260\nyou know?\n\n425\n00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,460\nIt's a lot easier for me to diagnose\na problem, find it and fix it, when\n\n426\n00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,685\nthings work in a consistent manner, which\nis what networking gear typically does.\n\n427\n00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,700\nOne thing I would say that\nCisco is known for, and\n\n429\n00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,715\nthat is to have a real high reliability.\n\n430\n00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:44,420\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo things, when you do configure your\n\n431\n00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,780\nthing and it just runs and runs, and runs\n,and runs, and needs little maintenance.\n\n432\n00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,560\n>> It's funny,\nyou guys can't see it but I've got\n\n433\n00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,100\na stash behind our podium over here, I've\ngot a Cisco switch and a Cisco router.\n\n434\n00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,440\nBoth of them I believe\nare just one year old.\n\n435\n00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,350\nSo it's a current model switch and\na current model router.\n\n436\n00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,950\nBut, way over there on the side of\nthe studio, I've got some of my older\n\n437\n00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,890\nequipment, and I've got one router over\nthere that I know is ten years old.\n\n438\n00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,920\nAnd it still runs fine today.\n\n439\n00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,831\nI could hook it up,\nIt's only 10 megabit, right?\n\n440\n00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's that.\n\n441\n00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,750\nBut I could hook it up right now and\nit would run just fine.\n\n442\n00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,020\nIt would route IPV4 traffic.\n\n443\n00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,790\nIt might even route IPV6 traffic,\nI'd go look.\n\n444\n00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,815\nBut Cisco equipment has a long,\nthey call it a MT, what,\n\n445\n00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,900\nMTBF, meantime between failure.\n\n446\n00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,195\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, they'll run for\n\n447\n00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:34,965\nyears and years.\n\n448\n00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,295\n>> Before failure.\n\n449\n00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,595\n>> Is it before failure?\n\n450\n00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:38,595\nMeantime, oh yeah.\n\n451\n00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,250\nBetween failure would mean that you got.\n\n452\n00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,315\nHow much time between the failures.\n\n454\n00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,495\nYou're going to have more than one.\n\n455\n00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:44,465\nMeantime before failure.\n\n456\n00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,294\nThat sounds good.\nI like that better.\n\n457\n00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,483\n>> Thanks Don.\n\n458\n00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:48,482\n>> More reassuring.\n>> Thank you.\n\n459\n00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:49,782\n>> All right.\n\n460\n00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:52,255\nSo So that's some of the devices.\n\n461\n00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:58,350\nWhat we're gonna tackle now is some of\nthe applications that run on our network.\n\n462\n00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,700\nNow I just got done saying how you\ndon't care what OS people run,\n\n463\n00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,980\nyou just want to get data\nfrom point a to point b.\n\n464\n00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,682\nBut some data has special needs, right?\n\n465\n00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,580\nAnd we need to make sure\nthat we address that and\n\n466\n00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,690\nit is kind of independent\nof the operating system and\n\n467\n00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,810\nindependent of who they're talking to,\nit's what they're talking with right?\n\n468\n00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,560\nAnd it didn't use to be like this.\n\n469\n00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,350\nIn the old days we sent computer data,\nall the data was the same, and\n\n470\n00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,250\nit was all handled the same.\n\n471\n00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,160\nBut in today's world now things\nare new and different and\n\n472\n00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,310\nwe have to do a little more planning.\n\n473\n00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,470\n>> Yeah, so then\n>> So back in the day you have\n\n474\n00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,370\nsome applications on\nthe network things like FTP so\n\n475\n00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,461\nyou queue up a bunch of files and\nupload them somewhere.\n\n476\n00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,860\n>> Bandwidth wasn't so much of a concern.\n\n477\n00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,710\nHow quickly it went, as long as it\ndidn't take weeks to get there.\n\n478\n00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,660\n>> Right.\n\n479\n00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,720\n>> And you just send it and\noff it goes, right?\n\n480\n00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,110\nSo it wasn't super critical yet.\n\n481\n00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,270\nRight.\nBut then you know,\n\n482\n00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,100\nthere's other stuff now that we get into.\n\n483\n00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,670\n>> Yeah and you know, Cisco groups these\napplications know a couple of different\n\n484\n00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,755\nprofiles, or terms or whatever.\n\n485\n00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:11,930\n>> Classes?\n\n486\n00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,240\n>> Classes, that sounds good.\n\n487\n00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,460\nSo we've got, for\nexample Real-time applications.\n\n488\n00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,860\nReal time applications are,\nwell hang on, let's see,\n\n489\n00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,250\nthere's real time,\ninteractive and batch, right.\n\n490\n00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,230\nAren't those the three categories?\n\n491\n00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,580\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah there you go.\n\n492\n00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,270\n>> Okay, so let's start with\nthe one you reference right,\n\n493\n00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,800\nso Nate mentioned like FTP, all right.\n\n494\n00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,710\nFTP is considered a batch application and\n\n495\n00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,860\nthat means we might start it\n>> But then we walk away, and\n\n496\n00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,330\nwe just let the FTP run.\n\n497\n00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,600\nNow FTP is File Transfer Protocol.\n\n498\n00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,960\nAnd it's something that we use to\ncopy files from computer to another.\n\n499\n00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,535\nAnd like Nate said, if it takes two\nminutes, or if it takes ten minutes.\n\n500\n00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:54,615\n>> Doesn't really matter because we\njust start it and then let it run.\n\n501\n00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,775\nAnd so if it has to run over night or\nwhatever, it's not a big deal.\n\n502\n00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,875\nWe don't have to sit there and\nhold it's hand while it runs.\n\n503\n00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,495\nRight?\n\n504\n00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,695\nIt's a batch application.\n\n505\n00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,585\nRuns in the background and that's it.\n\n506\n00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:06,795\nAnd in the old days,\nthat pretty much how everything was.\n\n507\n00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:07,495\nRight?\nSo\n\n508\n00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,105\nwe didn't have a lot of\nconcerns on the network.\n\n509\n00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,900\nNow we have like interactive, right?\n\n510\n00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,115\n>> Interactive.\n>> You want to tackle interactive?\n\n511\n00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:14,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n512\n00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,180\nYeah so you know, interactive stuff right?\n\n513\n00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,300\nInteractive and\nentering in your database things.\n\n514\n00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,110\nThings that you know,\na person does on the computer and\n\n515\n00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,390\nyou know waiting and\ngetting information back, feedback, right?\n\n516\n00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,790\nAnd so network performance and\nthe impact on the network,\n\n517\n00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,730\nit gets a little bit more critical.\n\n518\n00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,950\nAnd cause there's the whole\npatience thing, right?\n\n519\n00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,780\n>> Absolutely.\n\n520\n00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,930\n>> Getting some feedback and\ngetting on with your job and\n\n521\n00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,890\neverything so\n>> You gotta get a little bit quicker,\n\n522\n00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,220\npay more attention too.\n\n523\n00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,920\n>> And the example I use in\nthat one is like a web browser.\n\n524\n00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,130\nA web browser is like\nan interactive application.\n\n525\n00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,640\nAnd amazon.com,\n\n526\n00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,240\ngiant Internet retailer, I can't\nimagine any of you don't know that one.\n\n527\n00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,020\nBut Amazon, they did a study on this and\n\n528\n00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,860\nthey said if somebody comes to our\nwebsite, and they search for a product,\n\n529\n00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,700\nand they're browsing around, if there's\never a delay of more than four seconds,\n\n530\n00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,490\nthe percentage of likelihood of them\ngetting a sale goes down significantly.\n\n531\n00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,980\nThey have what's called an escape rate,\nwhich is the,\n\n532\n00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,900\nor sometimes they call it an abandon rate.\n\n533\n00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,730\nWhich is where a user says, you know,\nscrew it and moves on to another page\n\n534\n00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,990\nsomewhere else cuz they, you know,\nthey get tired of waiting.\n\n535\n00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,420\nSo, that kind of a delay has\na direct impact not just on\n\n536\n00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,490\nour experience on the site,\nbut on their revenue.\n\n537\n00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,596\nYou know, they generate less revenue\nif their website runs slowly.\n\n538\n00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:39,941\n>> Those are interactive.\n\n539\n00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,578\nWe click a button and\nwe wait for that response.\n\n540\n00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,468\nWe're waiting for it to happen, so\n\n541\n00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:47,815\nwe can't have big delays like\nwe can with batch applications.\n\n542\n00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:49,578\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n543\n00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:53,090\n>> And then the last one is the real-time.\n\n544\n00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,640\nRight?\n\n545\n00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,302\nAnd real-time, well,\nwhat we're doing right now, right?\n\n546\n00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n547\n00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,565\nVideo over IP, voiceover IPoice over IP.\n\n548\n00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:03,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n549\n00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,195\n>> And\nthings where then your network impact IP.\n\n550\n00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:11,595\nIt has on the network and the performance\nbecomes even more critical.\n\n551\n00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:15,465\nAny little bit of information that's lost\n\n552\n00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:19,805\nnow really breaks the application and\nhow things come across.\n\n553\n00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:21,035\n>> Yeah, and just delays, right?\n\n554\n00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,475\nVoice over IP is where\nyou see it the biggest.\n\n555\n00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:26,855\nSo, for example, with video,\nyou guys are watching us, and\n\n556\n00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,640\nif you're watching us live,\n>> And\n\n557\n00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,910\nthen the network starts to get slow or\nwhatever, it's gonna start skipping ahead.\n\n558\n00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,370\nYou're gonna notice dropped frames,\nbad audio quality, things like that.\n\n559\n00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,990\nIt really becomes an issue.\n\n560\n00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,400\nIf you're watching this in the archive,\nit just buffers, right?\n\n561\n00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,960\nSo your network slows down or whatever,\nyou get a little buffering thing,\n\n562\n00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760\nit's annoying, but\nyou didn't miss anything, right?\n\n563\n00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,200\nSo when it's live, though,\nthat's when we need that real-time.\n\n564\n00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,330\nAnd with Voice over IP\nyou really see that.\n\n565\n00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,700\nIf you're on the phone with somebody and\n\n566\n00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,552\nyour getting network latency it\nresults in delays in the conversation.\n\n567\n00:28:56,552 --> 00:29:00,250\nIt's kind of like if you\never watch the news and\n\n568\n00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,020\nthey're talking to a war\ncorrespondent in Afghanistan and\n\n569\n00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,590\nthey're like, how about telling us\nwhat it's like on the field, Tom?\n\n570\n00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,021\nAnd then there's that silence,\nright, and it's quiet.\n\n571\n00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:12,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And all of the sudden Tom goes, well,\n\n572\n00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,397\nyou know it's sunny.\n\n573\n00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:14,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With a chance of rain, and\n\n574\n00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,650\nthere's a big delay.\n\n575\n00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,190\nIn their case, it's because the\ncommunication's going so far away, right,\n\n576\n00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,780\nthe other side of the planet.\n\n577\n00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,360\nWell, from where we are.\n\n578\n00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,250\nSo it's far away.\n\n579\n00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,210\nBut it could happen just\nright on your local network.\n\n580\n00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,000\nIf your network is not designed properly,\nyou could get that kind of latency\n\n581\n00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,540\njust between two people and\nphone calls become very unpleasant.\n\n582\n00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:40,760\nSo then I guess a business or a company or\nwhat not, let's say is gonna make the move\n\n583\n00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,100\ninto things like Voice over IP, then\nyou know the network and what they have\n\n584\n00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,970\nset up would need to be evaluated to make\nsure that they can sustain that traffic.\n\n585\n00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,975\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n586\n00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:55,720\nYou've gotta plan for the applications\nyou have when you design your network.\n\n587\n00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,670\nSo it's not as easy as it used to be,\nyou know,\n\n588\n00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,170\nwhere you just threw the equipment\ntogether and you were done.\n\n589\n00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,550\nNow, we do have to have at least a basic\nunderstand of the applications that\n\n590\n00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,372\nare going to be used on our network.\n\n591\n00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,030\nAll right.\n\n592\n00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,360\nWe've run a little past our break time.\n\n593\n00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,780\nSo, why don't stop here and take a break.\n\n594\n00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,930\nAnd when we get back, we're gonna continue\ntalking a little more about general\n\n595\n00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,840\nnetworks, and\nthen we're gonna get into the OSI models.\n\n596\n00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,130\n>> Nice.\n>> So good times will be had there.\n\n597\n00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,180\nAnything else?\n\n598\n00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,780\n>> We're good.\n\n599\n00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,570\n>> All right.\n\n600\n00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,181\nSo stay tuned for\nmore exciting Cisco action, and\n\n601\n00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:26,117\nwe'll see you back in a few minutes.\n\n602\n00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:33,031\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,491\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n604\n00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:40,133\nSo I had an excellent conversation during\nthe break about the official authorized\n\n605\n00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,645\nRambo 2 survival knife.\n\n606\n00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:45,690\n[LAUGH] Excellent tool for\nanybody getting into networking.\n\n607\n00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,259\nA Rambo 2 survival knife.\n\n608\n00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,328\nReally bare necessity.\n\n609\n00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:54,480\n[LAUGH] All right, so we were talking\nabout applications on our network.\n\n610\n00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,068\nBack to stuff that actually\nmakes it on the exam.\n\n611\n00:30:57,068 --> 00:31:01,940\n[LAUGH] The next thing that we\nwanna talk about are the specific\n\n612\n00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,250\ncomponents that we need in\nour network as we build it.\n\n613\n00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,920\nAs we start to put things together.\n\n614\n00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,460\nAnd what we're gonna have to have\nto meet certain requirements.\n\n615\n00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,980\nNow I'll tell you.\n\n616\n00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,580\nI've worked for several companies over\nthe years, and I've been a contractor so\n\n617\n00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,160\nI've gone out and worked on people's\nsystems on a temporary basis too.\n\n618\n00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,080\nAnd only, I could probably count on\none hand the amount of times I've\n\n619\n00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,640\nhad an opportunity to design\na network from scratch.\n\n620\n00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,000\nJust blank slate redesign,\nhere's two million dollars.\n\n621\n00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,150\nBuild us a better network, right?\n\n622\n00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,928\nI can count the times that's\nhappened on one hand.\n\n623\n00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:43,272\n[LAUGH] So, it is more than one so\nI can at least say that.\n\n624\n00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:46,097\nI can count them on one hand\nbecause there were none.\n\n625\n00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:51,054\n[LAUGH] I have had that opportunity and\nit's great, right.\n\n626\n00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:54,930\nBecause then, it's a clean slate you\ncan build things the way you want.\n\n627\n00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,290\nBut the majority of the time you're going\nsomeplace that already has a network.\n\n628\n00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,080\nIt's already got one and you need to\nevaluate it to find out, does it meet\n\n629\n00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,230\nthe needs of that organization or do you\nneed to improve upon it and normally,\n\n630\n00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,150\nit's a constant process of improving,\nright?\n\n631\n00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,440\nCause new stuff comes out every year.\n\n632\n00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,630\n>> So there's some things that\nyou would need to evaluate.\n\n633\n00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,870\nThings like the cost of a network,\nor if its some,\n\n634\n00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,840\nyou know, a new wing onto something.\n\n635\n00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or a pick up bridge.\n\n636\n00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,160\nRight?\n\n637\n00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,970\n>> And let's tackle them one at a time so\nwe don't get confused.\n\n638\n00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,770\n>> All right.\n>> Cost is important and for\n\n639\n00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,600\na lot of people,\ncost is the most important, right?\n\n640\n00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,570\nSo I know for me,\nI went to look at a network for\n\n641\n00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,290\na nonprofit organization, right?\n\n642\n00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,920\nSo they were running on a shoestring\nbudget, and I walked in and\n\n643\n00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,410\nhere was this network, and\nit was a ten megabit network.\n\n644\n00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,150\nIn my mind i am thinking gee can't\neven buy ten megs stuff anymore,\n\n645\n00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,870\nthey should go to at least 100 mega\nbits but their budget was zero dollars.\n\n646\n00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,410\nSo they had no budget to buy new equipment\nand reality was when i sat down and looked\n\n647\n00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,730\nat it, for what they were doing a ten meg\nnetwork was fine it was enough right?\n\n648\n00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:08,510\nSo based on the cost of upgrading,\njust wasn't worth the cost, right?\n\n649\n00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,470\nOr me at home, my home network,\n\n650\n00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,960\nI've got a 100 megabit network at home and\nyou're gig at home aren't you?\n\n651\n00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,700\n>> Yeah I made the jump.\n\n652\n00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,220\n>> Made the switch,\nI'm still a hundred megabit.\n\n653\n00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,813\nNow you might say, Don,\nwait a minute what are you, a tightwad?\n\n654\n00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:27,370\nThe answer is yes, yes I am but the other\nreason is, I don't really push more than\n\n655\n00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,975\n100 megabit of traffic at home and so I\nhaven't felt the need to upgrade to a gig,\n\n656\n00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,560\ncuz I've got I've got three\ndifferent switches in my house so\n\n657\n00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,870\nif I had to upgrade all three\nof them it gets expensive.\n\n658\n00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,330\n>> Well Don, if you do get to a point\nwhere you need to make a network upgrade,\n\n659\n00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,110\nI'd be able to come over,\nevaluate your network needs,\n\n660\n00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,740\nand design your network upgrade for you.\n\n661\n00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,830\n>> You want to know my upgrade plan?\n\n662\n00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,040\nMy upgrade plan is simple.\n\n663\n00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,373\nI'm going to wait until Nate\nupgrades to ten gigabit [LAUGH] and\n\n664\n00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,075\nI'll just take his old stuff.\n\n665\n00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:57,470\n[LAUGH] But at home,\nI have a cable modem and so\n\n666\n00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,770\nmy Internet connection is 20 megabit,\nquote unquote.\n\n667\n00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,500\nIt's 12 megabit or whatever you actually\nget but let's say I get what they actually\n\n668\n00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,469\nadvertise and I get 20 megabit\non my Internet connection.\n\n669\n00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,330\nA hundred megabit is more than\ncapable of handling that and\n\n670\n00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,830\nthen I have my little TV tuner that's on\nthe network, so I put some HD channels.\n\n671\n00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,040\nBut even when that thing's\nrunning full steam,\n\n672\n00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,680\nI'm really not hitting a hundred megabit\nand so, I'm fine with that bandwidth.\n\n673\n00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,410\nI don't need to upgrade my home network.\n\n674\n00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,230\nRight.\n\n675\n00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,500\nBut if you're working for a hospital and\nthey get a new MRI machine that's\n\n676\n00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,520\npushing those high, enhanced digital\nimages of the human brain or whatever.\n\n677\n00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,530\nYou probably need more than a gigabit,\nyou probably need ten gig and so it does\n\n678\n00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,290\ndepend on what your network needs are and\nhow much money is available, right?\n\n679\n00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,245\nCost is always a factor.\n\n680\n00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,330\n>> Yup.\nWhat's our number two?\n\n681\n00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,400\nSecurity stuff.\n\n682\n00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920\n>> Security, yup.\n\n683\n00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,110\n>> You've got to evaluate\nthe security aspect of things.\n\n684\n00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,340\n>> We're going to learn, later on in\nthe show, not in this episode, but\n\n685\n00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:06,128\nin other episodes, we'll talk about things\nlike 802.1X network authentication,\n\n686\n00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:09,300\nand on wireless networks\nlike WPA2 enterprise and\n\n687\n00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,590\nstuff like that,\nnot all hardware supports that.\n\n688\n00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,010\nSo if those are needs, if you have a need\nfor those security protocols, you may have\n\n689\n00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,280\nto buy special or more expensive\nequipment to be able to support that.\n\n690\n00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,923\nSo security needs are a big influencer.\n\n691\n00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:26,226\n>> Things like, reliability and\n\n692\n00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:32,100\navailability right now\nthey're not the same thing.\n\n693\n00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,430\n>> Right.\n\n694\n00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,270\nSo reliability, and this is Cisco\nterminology we need to know for the exam\n\n695\n00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,960\nso this is important, reliability is how\nlong a device can run without failing.\n\n696\n00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,040\nWe are talking about one device, how long\ncan it run and stay running and be happy.\n\n697\n00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,990\nAvailability says if that device fails, is\nthere something else that can step in and\n\n698\n00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,110\ntake its place so\nwe don't even see the down time so\n\n699\n00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,450\nreliability is how long we\ncan run without failure.\n\n700\n00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,320\nAvailability is when a failure happens,\ncan we keep running?\n\n701\n00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,390\nIs there something else that\nacts as a backup, right?\n\n702\n00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,600\nIf we're worrying about availability,\nwe need duplicate equipment, right?\n\n703\n00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,350\nYou can't just have one router,\nyou gotta have two.\n\n704\n00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,880\nIf one fails,\nthe other router's gotta kick in.\n\n705\n00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,870\nYou can't have one switch,\nyou gotta have two,\n\n706\n00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,460\nthat way you know you can be\nPlugged into multiple switches.\n\n707\n00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,030\nSo it does get expensive and\nthen reliability is just buying better\n\n708\n00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:30,070\nequipment and that's a matter of like, I\ncan go and buy a Cisco switch for $2,000.\n\n709\n00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,580\nI can go buy a D-Link switch for 50 bucks.\n\n710\n00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,740\nAll right.\n\n711\n00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,650\nWhat's the price difference?\n\n712\n00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,210\nWell that Cisco switch will run for\nyears and years and\n\n713\n00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,600\nyears, that d link might only run for\n\n714\n00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,250\na single year and that's how a lot of\nthat consumer grade technology is.\n\n715\n00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:51,280\n>> And some of that stuff, then,\nwould rule into, like, scalability, right?\n\n716\n00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,390\n>> Yep.\n>> If the company is growing, expanding.\n\n717\n00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,560\nThen, you know, you might need to\naccount for changes onto the network.\n\n718\n00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,240\n>> Yeah, you know?\n\n719\n00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,350\nI said, like, at my house,\nI have three switches, right?\n\n720\n00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,220\nSo my house has got an annoying\ndesign I've got an A frame\n\n721\n00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,080\nin the middle of it and so\nthe house is divided in half.\n\n722\n00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,520\nI've got one set of\nbedrooms on one side and\n\n723\n00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,860\nthe master bedroom on the other side and\nreally hard to run cabling between them,\n\n724\n00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,820\nso I've got an eight port switch on one\nside and an eight port switch on the other\n\n725\n00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,120\nside, and so for me,\nthese little eight port switches are fine.\n\n726\n00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,380\nI think I paid maybe 50 bucks for each one\nof them, and it's not an expensive thing.\n\n727\n00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,310\nBut if you're in a corporate environment,\nan enterprise environment,\n\n728\n00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,060\nyou might need hundreds of ports, and\n\n729\n00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,350\nthose little eight port switches\naren't going to cut it any more.\n\n730\n00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,000\nSo now you start moving in to your higher\nend switches to be able to get that\n\n731\n00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,330\nscalability to be able to grow your\nnetwork to be able to handle more and\n\n732\n00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,820\nmore hosts.\n\n733\n00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,005\n>> And so that would kind of you know\nmentioning how your house is divided into\n\n734\n00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:55,045\ntwo things, then that would\ntransition things into the topology.\n\n735\n00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:55,595\n>> Yeah.\n\n736\n00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:58,535\n>> Your physical topology and\nyour logical topology.\n\n737\n00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:02,280\n>> That is a big component of\nfiguring out what equipment we need.\n\n738\n00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,660\nSo if you are in a normal house,not\none like, not that my house is crappy,\n\n739\n00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,790\nit's just that it's designed\nin a strange manner.\n\n740\n00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,672\nThe things you learn, right, the next\nhouse, the next house you do it right.\n\n741\n00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:18,610\nSo but if you are in a normal house, you\nmight be able to just have one switch and\n\n742\n00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,045\neverything wires to it,\nand I wish I had that.\n\n743\n00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:25,690\n[LAUGH] If you are working for\na university and you have multiple\n\n744\n00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,480\nbuildings, now you can't have just one\nswitch, you've got have switches for\n\n745\n00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,940\nevery building and you've got to have\ninner-connects between the buildings.\n\n746\n00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,330\nNow, you are talking about\nseparate geographical entities.\n\n747\n00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,980\nThings get really complex really fast.\n\n748\n00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,770\nSo these are all things we need to be\naware of as we start to design or plan for\n\n749\n00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,410\nour network and isn't that the last one or\ndid we have another.\n\n750\n00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,240\n>> No, that.\n\n751\n00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,250\n>> I thought there was one more.\n\n752\n00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,750\nI guess not.\n\n753\n00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,600\n>> Connections into the Internet,\nor your WAN, right?\n\n754\n00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,650\nSo how a company goes out there,\n\n755\n00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,010\nsome of those things will\nbe needing consideration.\n\n756\n00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,210\n>> Yeah, it's a good point so\nI mentioned for me.\n\n757\n00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,760\nLet's just continue to use my house as\nan example, cuz it's a small network and\n\n758\n00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,750\nit's kind of like what'll\nshow up on the exam.\n\n759\n00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,710\nI have a cable modem, so\nthat means that I have a cable television\n\n760\n00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,200\ncable that runs in the house and\nit runs into a cable modem,\n\n761\n00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,300\nwhich then gives me a network jack,\nright?, an RJ45 network jack.\n\n762\n00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:30,780\nAnd because it's a standard ethernet jack\nat that point, I just run it right into\n\n763\n00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,410\nmy router if I used a router and then\nit connects to the rest of the network.\n\n764\n00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,165\nNow I say if I used a router.\n\n765\n00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,010\nI actually have a firewall at home,\nso it runs into my firewall and\n\n766\n00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,135\nthen the firewall runs a so\nthe firewall is acting as my router.\n\n767\n00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:44,974\nDifferent needs for\ndifferent networks, right?\n\n768\n00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:50,610\nSo if we had a traditional router there,\nit could just run in to it and be done.\n\n769\n00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,190\nThat's because cable modems give us\nthat nice, normal ethernet connection.\n\n770\n00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,010\nAnd if we had a DSL line,\nsame thing, right?\n\n771\n00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,160\nThey normally come off\nthat same connection.\n\n772\n00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,480\nBut if you have fiber optic.\n\n773\n00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480\nOr FIOS or something.\n\n774\n00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,040\nOr if you had a T1 line, MPLS,\nframe relay, ISDN, any of these other\n\n775\n00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,550\ncrazy technologies that are out there,\nyou'll need a special router for that.\n\n776\n00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,060\nYou'll need a router that\nhandles that media type,\n\n777\n00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,590\nthat handles that type of connection.\n\n778\n00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,890\nSo that will influence the components\nthat we use, absolutely.\n\n779\n00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,960\n>> Yep.\nSo then as far as components required\n\n780\n00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,090\nto meet the networks needs, right?\n\n781\n00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,920\nSo cost, speed, reliability, scalability,\nthe technology of everything, and yeah.\n\n782\n00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,190\nQuite a few things to go in for\nnetwork design.\n\n783\n00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,120\n>> Yeah, and\nwhat we're really trying to emphasize here\n\n784\n00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,350\nis that networks aren't\na one size fits all.\n\n785\n00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,380\nThere's not one network design\nthat everybody should follow.\n\n786\n00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,980\nThere's recommendations, but\nthe reality is, it's all situational.\n\n787\n00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,770\nWe need to look at what are client or\ncustomer needs, and design around them.\n\n788\n00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,150\nThis particular show is\nfocused around the CCENT.\n\n789\n00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,700\nAnd then our next show that we'll do,\nwe'll move on into this CCNA, which is for\n\n790\n00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,170\nrouting and switching.\n\n791\n00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,210\nCISCO actually has a sister certification\nto this one called the CCDA,\n\n792\n00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,100\nthe Cisco Certified Design Associate.\n\n793\n00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,950\nAnd that certification focuses\nsolely on designing network.\n\n794\n00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,940\nSo, for this exam, we don't really\nneed to know all the nitty gritty\n\n795\n00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,240\ndetails of exactly how many switches and\nrouters and so on.\n\n796\n00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,640\nWe're just concerned with getting one\nrouter and one switch configured, but for\n\n797\n00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:32,650\nthose of you that have a real interest in\nthis, pursuing the CCDA is a good idea.\n\n798\n00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,685\n>> Now we figured out\nwhat our network needs.\n\n799\n00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:40,510\nAnd so now we can move on into how\nthe data then travels along that network,\n\n800\n00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,380\nsomething like the OSI model.\n\n801\n00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,020\n>> Absolutely.\n\n802\n00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,820\nAbsolutely.\n\n803\n00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,580\nAnd like we said at the beginning of\nthe show, this is kind of a summary or\n\n804\n00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,890\nwhatever of the Network Plus show.\n\n805\n00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,300\nIf you've already watched Network Plus,\nyou've probably already seen this,\n\n806\n00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,030\nbut it's a good idea to watch it again.\n\n807\n00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,400\nBecause the more times you see it,\nthe more it gets ingrained in your mind,\n\n808\n00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,270\nthe easier it is to recall on the exam.\n\n809\n00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,200\nIn Network Plus,\nI really emphasize something.\n\n810\n00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,780\nAnd I'm gonna emphasize it here too\nbecause it's just as important.\n\n811\n00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,560\nYou need to have the OSI model memorized.\n\n812\n00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,010\nAnd I mean the names, the numbers.\n\n813\n00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,700\nIt needs to be committed to memory,\n\n814\n00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,980\nbecause you will get\nquestions on the exam for it.\n\n815\n00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,520\nSo before I get ahead of myself,\nwhat the heck is the OSI model, right?\n\n816\n00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,100\nWhat if this is the first\ntime you're hearing about it?\n\n817\n00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,380\nAnd the OSI model is\nthe Open System Interconnect model.\n\n818\n00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,640\nAnd it is a framework that defines\nhow network communications function.\n\n819\n00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,460\nSo you can see why it's important\nin a class like this where\n\n820\n00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,070\nall we talk about\nare network communications.\n\n821\n00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,670\nVersus the RC car show that\ndoesn't care about it.\n\n822\n00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,890\nSo anyhow the OSI model's important.\n\n823\n00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,070\nEvery single network communication\nthat we do, runs through this model,\n\n824\n00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,830\nthrough this framework.\n\n825\n00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,210\nAnd so, it is important.\n\n826\n00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,590\nIt does get used all the time.\n\n827\n00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,870\nAnd it is on the exam.\n\n828\n00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,070\nSo, it's definitely something\nyou wanna memorize.\n\n829\n00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,620\n>> And used in trouble shooting.\n\n830\n00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,590\nRight?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n831\n00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,440\nYeah.\nGives you kind of a starting point and\n\n832\n00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,080\nan ending point for troubleshooting.\n\n833\n00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,780\nSo, let me just do a diagram here.\n\n834\n00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,770\nI'm gonna bring up a Pictor.\n\n835\n00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,590\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat what the OSI model is.\n\n836\n00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,105\nNow, the OSI model,\nI said is the open system interconnect,\n\n837\n00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:22,920\nthat open part means that this is an open\nstandard, and everyone designs around it.\n\n838\n00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,450\nSo if you're a Mac, a Linux box,\na Windows machine, you use the OSI model.\n\n839\n00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,749\n>> If you used TCP/IP, or Apple Talk,\nNetbui, IPX, SPX, you use the OSI model.\n\n840\n00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:38,653\nSo regardless of what protocols or\nwhat OS or whatever,\n\n841\n00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:44,051\nyou are using the OSI model any time that\nyou communicate on a modern network,\n\n842\n00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:46,810\na network built in the last 20 years.\n\n843\n00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,180\nAll right so, the OSI model, what it does,\n\n844\n00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,420\nis it divides our communications\nup into multiple pieces.\n\n845\n00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,550\nAnd we see it here represented as layers.\n\n846\n00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,866\nIt's a seven layer model.\n\n847\n00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:04,510\nAnd let me start with\nthe real generalities,\n\n848\n00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,970\nbecause it does get confusing.\n\n849\n00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,750\nSo, there's layers, and\nit starts from the bottom up.\n\n850\n00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,070\nAnd the example they always\nuse in the textbooks and\n\n851\n00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,960\nstuff is that it's like a cake.\n\n852\n00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,160\nWhen you make a cake,\nyou don't start with the top.\n\n853\n00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,190\nYou got to start with the bottom right.\n\n854\n00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,210\nSo you make that first layer of the cake.\n\n855\n00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,138\nAnd then you add the next one and\nthe next one and the next one.\n\n856\n00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:26,820\nOr you can think of it as like the floors\nof a building or whatever, right.\n\n857\n00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,390\nWe start at the bottom.\n\n858\n00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,350\nAnd each layer represents\n\n859\n00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:35,350\na particular function required in\ncommunicating on a network, right?\n\n860\n00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,180\nNow, as human beings,\nwe don't see a lot of this stuff,\n\n861\n00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,450\nit's all hidden from us in the background.\n\n862\n00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,170\nWe interact way up here at layer 7.\n\n863\n00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,700\nLayer 7 is the Application layer.\n\n864\n00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,680\nAnd those are the programs and\n\n865\n00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,530\nthe interface that we use as human\nbeings to communicate with the network.\n\n866\n00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,910\nSo for us, that's really all we see, and\n\n867\n00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,330\noccasionally we get a glimpse\nof this next layer.\n\n868\n00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,890\nAll the rest of it is really completely\nhidden from us, but it's there.\n\n869\n00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,850\nAnd it is important to understand, right?\n\n870\n00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,350\nSo-\n>> So one of the examples that I liked\n\n871\n00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,040\nthat I heard once.\n\n872\n00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,730\nI think it's been used for other things as\nwell, but it was like sending a letter.\n\n873\n00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,190\nSo to go through some of the layers,\nhere's your person.\n\n874\n00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,490\nYou write letter,\nletter goes in an envelope and so\n\n875\n00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,450\nas it moves down it goes out to\nthe truck and the truck drives,\n\n876\n00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,730\ngoing along the lines and it gets to\nthe person and then it goes back up.\n\n877\n00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,880\nRight?\nThe OSI model and so\n\n878\n00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,570\nthen the person gets it from the guy.\n\n879\n00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,970\nAnd then they go and they open it.\n\n880\n00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,009\nAnd then there it is\n>> Yeah and there's a whole,\n\n881\n00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:42,860\nsee that's the US government right there,\nit shows a whole bureaucracy around that.\n\n882\n00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,570\nRight?\nGetting that letter from one\n\n883\n00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,800\ndoor to another.\n\n884\n00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,970\nThe OSI model is kinda like that.\n\n885\n00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,745\nIt's kinda like that bureaucracy, and\nexcept you don't have a surly postman.\n\n886\n00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:52,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know about everybody else, but\n\n887\n00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,930\nmy postman, he's an angry man, but\n>> Mails like all like crumpled and\n\n888\n00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:58,780\nshoved in there.\n\n889\n00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,310\n>> He gets so frustrated like if you have\nthe garbage cans too close the mailbox.\n\n890\n00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,220\nYou'll hear about it.\n\n891\n00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,100\n>> Oh dang.\n\n892\n00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,412\n>> So anyhow\n>> So,\n\n893\n00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:08,830\ndealing with networking is kind of\nlike that, minus the surly postman.\n\n894\n00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,940\nSo let's go through each layer,\nand describe what they do.\n\n895\n00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,480\nActually, let's do this.\n\n896\n00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,140\nLet's put it end to end with an example.\n\n897\n00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,720\nBecause for a lot of people,\nthey've already seen this before.\n\n898\n00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,530\nOr they've already watched the Network\nPlus show, for those of you that haven't,\n\n899\n00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,680\nlet's just do a straight up example,\nand it will make a lot more sense.\n\n900\n00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,530\nAnd let's use email.\n\n901\n00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,760\n>> All right.\n\n902\n00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,740\n>> I think we used email on\nthe Network Plus show, so\n\n903\n00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,560\nlet's use something different.\n\n904\n00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,640\nLet's use me going to Google.com, right?\n\n905\n00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,210\nSo I'm gonna go to my web browser,\nI'm gonna type www.google.com, and\n\n906\n00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,290\nI'm gonna pull up a website.\n\n907\n00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,660\nSo we start at layer 7,\nat the application layer.\n\n908\n00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,220\nAnd at the application layer,\nthat's where we have applications.\n\n909\n00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,290\n>> So your browser.\n\n910\n00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,735\n>> Yeah.\nAnd my browser might be\n\n911\n00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,492\nInternet Explorer or\n\n912\n00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:09,718\nChrome or Firefox or Safari-\n\n913\n00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:14,590\n>> Navigator or communicator.\n\n914\n00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,187\n>> Oh yeah, my Netscape Navigator.\n\n915\n00:47:16,187 --> 00:47:17,000\nI'll fire that up.\n\n916\n00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,790\nI might have Lynx.\n\n917\n00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,310\n>> Lynx?\n>> Have you ever used Lynx?\n\n918\n00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,310\n>> I have heard of it, but no.\n\n919\n00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,750\n>> Command line web browser?\n\n920\n00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,330\n>> All right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n921\n00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,658\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n922\n00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:30,340\n[LAUGH] So, back in the early days of the\nweb, command line web browser was a must.\n\n923\n00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,040\nSo these are the programs, I guess I\ndon't really need to put a browser here.\n\n924\n00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,090\nEverybody knows the browsers these days.\n\n925\n00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,520\nSo we'll just change it there.\n\n926\n00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,300\nOkay.\nSo if my web browser, right?\n\n927\n00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,266\nI fire up my web browser,\nand as a human being,\n\n928\n00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:44,456\nthat's how I'm interacting with\nThe Internet, with the World Wide Web.\n\n929\n00:47:44,456 --> 00:47:50,950\nSo I fired my web browser, and I type\nin www.google.com, and I press enter.\n\n930\n00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:59,470\nNow when I press enter, then we move\nfrom layer 7 down to layer 6, okay?\n\n931\n00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,510\nThe presentation layer is what\ntranslates things from stuff,\n\n932\n00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,850\nthat makes sense to us to stuff,\nthat makes sense to the computer.\n\n933\n00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,880\n>> Like HTML?\n\n934\n00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,436\n>> Like HTML.\n\n935\n00:48:11,436 --> 00:48:15,640\nSo when you look at a web page,\nif you go to itpro.tv, a little self-plug.\n\n936\n00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You go to itpro.tv.\n\n937\n00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,480\n>> When you go to our website, you see\nimages, and menus, and all that stuff.\n\n938\n00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,420\nBut on the back end,\nit's all HTML and PHP.\n\n939\n00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,590\nSo HTML is the HyperText Markup Language,\nand that's the way that,\n\n940\n00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:31,870\nthat page is written.\n\n941\n00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,980\nIf you were to look straight at the HTML,\nit doesn't make a lot of sense,\n\n942\n00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,970\nit's a mess.\n\n943\n00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,770\nBut then the computer renders it\ninto a way that's pretty for us, and\n\n944\n00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,270\nthat's what the presentation layer does.\n\n945\n00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,620\nIn reverse, it takes what's pretty to us,\n\n946\n00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:50,450\nlike me typing www.google.com\nin the address bar, and\n\n947\n00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,200\nit turns that into something,\nthat makes sense for the computer.\n\n948\n00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,140\nAnd the computer, when you dealing with\na web browser, it is expecting what's\n\n949\n00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,245\ncall HTTP Get Request,\n\n950\n00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:08,720\nand that, That Get Request,\n\n951\n00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,660\nthat's us saying, hey,\nI need a copy of this web page.\n\n952\n00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,170\nWe build a Hyper Text Transport\nProtocol Get Request.\n\n953\n00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,940\nAnd you have gets, and puts, and sends,\nand all sorts of various HTTP commands,\n\n954\n00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,420\nbut when you ask for a web page,\nyou're using a Get Request.\n\n955\n00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,470\nSo that's what's happening\nat the presentation layer.\n\n956\n00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,870\nThen we get to layer five, and\nlayer five is the session layer.\n\n957\n00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,830\nWhen our data makes it\nover to this other server,\n\n958\n00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:41,250\nwhen we get to google server, how do they\nknow what software needs to handle it?\n\n959\n00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,465\nBecause we've got all sorts of software,\ne-mail, web browsers, video streamers,\n\n960\n00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:48,380\nBitTorrent clients, all sorts of stuff.\n\n961\n00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,320\nNot that we'd use those,\nwe got all sorts of stuff.\n\n962\n00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,580\nHow does the other end know\nwhat we're communicating with?\n\n963\n00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,510\nAnd the session layer's,\nwhat's responsible here.\n\n964\n00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,610\nIt steps in, and it gets involved.\n\n965\n00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:02,010\nAnd when we're talking about web requests,\n\n966\n00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:09,550\nwe're normally talking about HTTP, or\nit could be HTTPS, if it's secure.\n\n967\n00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,050\nYou know, is it too much to ask, to get\nit to use the same font size every time?\n\n968\n00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,960\nIs that-\n>> Looks like it's just\n\n969\n00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,920\ngetting slightly bigger.\n\n970\n00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,740\nBy the end,\n\n971\n00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,770\nit's just gonna be this massive,\nI can fit one letter on the screen.\n\n972\n00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:32,620\nSo if I'm browsing to a non secure\nwebpage, I'm just using HTTP,\n\n973\n00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,110\nthe Hypertext Transport Protocol\non port 80.\n\n974\n00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,660\nAnd if I'm doing it securely with SSL,\nsecure socket layer,\n\n975\n00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,280\nthe certificate system,\nthen it's on port 443.\n\n976\n00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,840\nThe session layer identifies that, so\nat the other side, when it receives this\n\n977\n00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,770\ntraffic, the server at the other\nside will get it, and say, oh look.\n\n978\n00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:55,370\nIt's on port 80, let me send it to my web\nserver, and that might be, who knows.\n\n979\n00:50:55,370 --> 00:51:00,440\nApache, IIS, what's the big one now?\n\n980\n00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,620\nInJinx?\n\n981\n00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,160\nEnGenX.\n\n982\n00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,960\nI think it's pronounced EnGenX,\nI'm saying it wrong.\n\n983\n00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,510\nJust took the lead in the web server wars.\n\n984\n00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,350\nYou've not heard of it so-\n>> No.\n\n985\n00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,390\n>> You learned something new today.\n\n986\n00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,470\nBecause Apache was the market leader for\nthe longest time, and\n\n987\n00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,052\nnow EnGenX has jumped on there.\n\n988\n00:51:16,052 --> 00:51:19,142\nI keep saying InJinx, but it is EnGenX is-\n>> Engine X?\n\n989\n00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,842\n>> How it's suppose to be said,\nso I'm screwing it up.\n\n990\n00:51:20,842 --> 00:51:23,349\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n991\n00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:28,265\nthe other side is going to know what our\ntraffic is, based on this session four.\n\n992\n00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:33,175\nAs we keep going down,\nwe get to our transport layer.\n\n993\n00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:38,385\nNow when you communicate on the network,\nthere is a limit to the size of the data\n\n994\n00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:43,110\nyou can reliably send, and we don't\nwanna fuss about the limits too much,\n\n995\n00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:47,440\nright now, but just for your own\nreference, it's roughly 1500 bytes.\n\n996\n00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,900\nSo at about 1500 bytes, that's the,\n\n997\n00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,652\nall right I think maybe the actual number,\nis it 1518?\n\n998\n00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,305\nDo you know?\n\n999\n00:51:57,305 --> 00:51:59,090\n>> 1500 jumps out.\nI was totally on board with that one.\n\n1000\n00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,170\n>> Okay, so\na lot of systems are set at 1500, but\n\n1001\n00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,520\nthere is an actual limit, and\nI wanna say, it's 1518 bytes, and\n\n1002\n00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,565\nthen you get like 18 extra bytes, but most\nof the time, I'm going more than I should.\n\n1003\n00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:15,665\nBut just so you know, Nate, most of\nthe time, we don't use those last 18.\n\n1004\n00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,055\nWe are 18 or 12, I can't remember.\n\n1005\n00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:19,845\nIt's a handful of bytes.\n\n1006\n00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:24,373\nWe leave them, because switches and\nstuff, will do like vlan tagging, and\n\n1007\n00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,090\nthey need that extra space.\n\n1008\n00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,295\nSo if you've never heard of vlan tagging,\nthat's the awesome part about this show.\n\n1009\n00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:32,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is we're going to get into that,\n\n1010\n00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,230\nwhen we get into our,\nour switching segments.\n\n1011\n00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,782\nWhich, it'll probably be next episode.\n\n1012\n00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:39,060\nSo, anyhow.\n\n1013\n00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,460\nSo there's a reason,\nwhy there's an empty bed.\n\n1014\n00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,460\nSo let's just say,\n1500 bytes, for right now.\n\n1015\n00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,840\nBecause that is pretty common for\nWindows and Linux boxes, and so on.\n\n1016\n00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,420\nSo, at the transport layer,\nif we are sending more than 1500 bytes,\n\n1017\n00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,670\nwhich a Get Request is\nprobably isn't going to be.\n\n1018\n00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,710\nIf I'm downloading an image, or whatever,\n\n1019\n00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,850\nit is almost guaranteed to\nbe more than 1500 bytes.\n\n1020\n00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,450\nSo at the transport layer, it says,\nokay we are going to have to\n\n1021\n00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,960\nbreak this up into multiple\ndata units to be able to send.\n\n1022\n00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,050\nAnd so it's gonna break them up, and\nwhen it breaks them up, at the other end,\n\n1023\n00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,750\nit has to be able to reassemble it.\n\n1024\n00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:15,160\nSo we have to have some kind of Transport\nprotocol, that is handling that.\n\n1025\n00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,900\nAnd with a normal Internet communication,\nthat protocol.\n\n1026\n00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,280\n>> TCP.\n>> Is TCP, which oddly enough stands for\n\n1027\n00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,419\nTransmission Control Protocol,\nand it is, come on,\n\n1028\n00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:33,580\njust remember the font size.\n\n1029\n00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,960\nIt is TCP, it's what's handling,\nthat making sure that traffic is broken up\n\n1030\n00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,280\nto be able to reach out there, and\nbe received on the other side intact.\n\n1031\n00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,210\nLater on, we are gonna talk about\nanother protocol that can operate here,\n\n1032\n00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,355\nwhich is UDP, but for right now,\nlet's just stick with this one.\n\n1033\n00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:51,370\n>> Yep, that was good.\n\n1034\n00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:56,890\n>> All right, next, now we need to\ndetermine, are we talking to somebody\n\n1035\n00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,265\non the same network as us, or are they\non a different network somewhere else?\n\n1036\n00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:03,815\nIf I'm talking to a computer\nright here on the studio,\n\n1037\n00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:05,435\nthey're on the same network as me.\n\n1038\n00:54:05,435 --> 00:54:07,085\nThat's cool.\nI can talk right to them.\n\n1039\n00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:09,525\nBut if I'm talking to Google,\nthey're out there on the Internet.\n\n1040\n00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:14,545\nI may have to pass through a number of\nrouters, to get out there to Google.\n\n1041\n00:54:14,545 --> 00:54:18,565\nAnd if that's the case,\nI need to go through a router or whatever.\n\n1042\n00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,365\nSo I need something that\nhelps me to determine that,\n\n1043\n00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:23,910\nto know whether somebody's on\nthe same network as me, and\n\n1044\n00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,730\nwith a normal Internet communication,\nthat protocol is IP.\n\n1045\n00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,700\nNow, a lot of people, well,\nwe normally refer to this as TCP/IP,\n\n1046\n00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,880\nand it's written TCP/IP.\n\n1047\n00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,740\nBut it is two separate protocols.\n\n1048\n00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,770\nTCP handles the transport part,\nand IP handles the network part.\n\n1049\n00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,950\n>> And so at this layer,\nthat's where our routers would sit.\n\n1050\n00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:48,530\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1051\n00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,700\n>> So routers are a layer three device.\n\n1052\n00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,300\n>> Yes.\n\n1053\n00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,270\nAnd you'll hear us, reference things\nlike that throughout the show,\n\n1054\n00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:01,220\nas we go on, more so, later on,\nwhere every device, every router,\n\n1055\n00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:06,180\nswitch, firewall, bridge, whatever, they\nperform functions, that certain layers.\n\n1056\n00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,650\nAnd routers are all about moving traffic,\nfrom one network to another.\n\n1057\n00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,150\nAnd at layer three,\nthe IP address is how we know,\n\n1058\n00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,070\nwhether somebody's on\na different network or not.\n\n1059\n00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,580\nAnd how we know,\nif we need to go through routers, so\n\n1060\n00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,180\nit is a layer three device, yep.\n\n1061\n00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,720\n>> Right on.\n\n1062\n00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,830\n>> I just wanna throw that in,\n\n1063\n00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,556\nsince that's one thing that\nI can throw in there, Don.\n\n1064\n00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:23,441\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like, all right, yay,\n\n1065\n00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:24,015\nyeah, router's, yep!\n\n1066\n00:55:24,015 --> 00:55:25,095\n>> Sweet!\n>> I know this one.\n\n1067\n00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:26,305\n>> Whoo, got it!\nOn it!\n\n1068\n00:55:26,305 --> 00:55:29,857\nSo Nate's excited, for\nus to get to the command line stuff,\n\n1069\n00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:31,400\nthat's where he shines.\n\n1070\n00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,140\nBut we've gotta cover our basics first,\nso.\n\n1071\n00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,490\nAnd you guys are probably\nthinking that too, at home.\n\n1072\n00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,196\nYou're like, oh God,\nwhen is Don gonna shut up.\n\n1073\n00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:39,246\n>> Yeah, type.\n\n1074\n00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:42,008\n>> And [LAUGH] so if you are really\nexcited about the command line stuff,\n\n1075\n00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:43,569\nyou can jump ahead to those episodes.\n\n1076\n00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:46,918\nBut this stuff is on the exam too,\nso we've gotta make sure we know it.\n\n1077\n00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:49,350\nIt's not as fun, but that's how life is.\n\n1078\n00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,475\nLife is pain.\n\n1079\n00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:58,550\nOnce we got the IP stuff squared away,\nnow we're ready to talk.\n\n1080\n00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,400\nAnd when we go to talk on the network,\nthere's this whole\n\n1081\n00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,630\nprocess that happens where we find the\nother host on the network and communicate.\n\n1082\n00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:10,270\nI don't want to get too crazy about it\nbecause we are gonna delve into it in more\n\n1083\n00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,390\ndepth later, but basically any\ntime we communicate on the network\n\n1084\n00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:18,120\nwe use what's called a media\naccess control address.\n\n1085\n00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,740\nOr a MAC Address.\n\n1086\n00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,340\nIt's an address that's burned\ninto your network hardware.\n\n1087\n00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,510\nIt's burned into your network card or\nwireless card or whatever.\n\n1088\n00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,830\nYou're not supposed to\nbe able to change it.\n\n1089\n00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,650\nThere are ways but\nit's supposed to be hard set.\n\n1090\n00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,200\nAnd it's what you actually use\nwhen you start to communicate.\n\n1091\n00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,980\nSo down here at layer two, that's where we\nhave that extra address part kicking in.\n\n1092\n00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,100\nAnd so\nwe have things like our Mac addresses, our\n\n1093\n00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,030\nmedia access control as well as something\ncalled the link layer control protocol.\n\n1094\n00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,960\nWhich again, we'll delve into.\n\n1095\n00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,360\nLater because it gets pretty\ntechnical pretty fast.\n\n1096\n00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,770\n>> Yup, and so it switches,\nit switches around here.\n\n1097\n00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,390\n>> Switches do.\n\n1098\n00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,590\nSo switches work with Mac addresses\na lot and remember when I say Mac,\n\n1099\n00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,800\nI'm not talking Macintosh,\nI'm talking about media access control.\n\n1100\n00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,240\nAnd switches really deal with this and so\nthey are considered layer two devices.\n\n1101\n00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,200\nAnd that brings us to our last one, and\n\n1102\n00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,690\nthe physical layer, it's gonna vary\nbased on what your network is.\n\n1103\n00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:23,740\nSo if we've got a 100\nmegabit copper cable network.\n\n1104\n00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:29,390\nThen, this is going to be your Cat5 cable,\nyour electrical impulses that you send or\n\n1105\n00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,740\nif you've got a fiber optic network,\nthen this is glass with light beams,\n\n1106\n00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,340\nif it's a wireless network\nit's RF transmitters.\n\n1107\n00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,290\nSo it just depends on\nwhat your network is.\n\n1108\n00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:45,380\nIt might be fiber, might be copper,\nmight be wireless,\n\n1109\n00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,810\nor who knows whatever other technologies\nnamed between now and tomorrow.\n\n1110\n00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:57,500\n>> So it's just whatever media\nyou have to send your data along.\n\n1111\n00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,457\nHowever, you're plugged in.\n\n1112\n00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:01,030\nNice.\n\n1113\n00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:04,840\n>> So each layer is performing\nan important function.\n\n1114\n00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,690\nAnd the really cool part about this is,\nif you decide that you wanna write\n\n1115\n00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,090\nyour own protocol or\ncome up with your own technology.\n\n1116\n00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,080\nYou don't have to rebuild\nall seven layers.\n\n1117\n00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,040\nYou just pick the layers\nyou wanna overwrite.\n\n1118\n00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,220\nSo if you wanna write a replacement for\nTCPIP, you can.\n\n1119\n00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,148\nAnd Novell for\nthe longest time, had IPXSPX.\n\n1120\n00:58:21,148 --> 00:58:22,830\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> A very popular protocol.\n\n1121\n00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,350\nAnd it replaced layer three and four.\n\n1122\n00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,850\nAll the other layers were the same.\n\n1123\n00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,715\nBut it was just IPXSPX on layers three and\nfour.\n\n1124\n00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,770\n>> Yeah.\nI remember that.\n\n1125\n00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,280\nBack in the day.\n\n1126\n00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,425\n>> Definitely back in the day.\n\n1127\n00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:35,946\n[LAUGH]\n>> Setting\n\n1128\n00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:37,570\nup\n>> Yeah.\n\n1129\n00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:41,080\nYou know, IPXSPX, not trying to\nget too far off on a tangent,\n\n1130\n00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,240\nwas a great protocol.\n\n1131\n00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,910\nSuper easy to get up and\nrunning and configured, so for\n\n1132\n00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,230\nthings like games in your house,\nit was really easy\n\n1133\n00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,750\nTCPIP on the other hand can be a little\nmore annoying but it's royalty free.\n\n1134\n00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,380\nSo that's why we see it more than IPXSPX.\n\n1135\n00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,040\n>> Yep.\n\n1136\n00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,540\nNice.\n\n1137\n00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,470\n>> Well, we have blown way past our break,\n\n1138\n00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,380\nI'm not even sure how far cuz\nthe clock is gone past its limit.\n\n1139\n00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,260\n>> Well,\nit's important to finish that little bit.\n\n1140\n00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:09,170\n>> Yeah, just wanted to kind of tackle it\nall, so there's our high level overview of\n\n1141\n00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,470\nthe OSI model, and then we'll talk just a\nlittle bit more about it after the break,\n\n1142\n00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,970\nbut it is a good spot for us to stop.\n\n1143\n00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,850\nAnything else to throw in before we go for\nbreak?\n\n1144\n00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,260\n>> I'm good for now.\n\n1145\n00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,400\n>> Well ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1146\n00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,847\nWhen we get back,\nwe'll look at more networking stuff.\n\n1147\n00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:30,044\n[MUSIC]\n\n1148\n00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:31,620\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1149\n00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:35,130\nSo before the break we were\ntalking about the OSI model and\n\n1150\n00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:39,380\nI just had a little bit more to say\nabout the OSI model before we move on to\n\n1151\n00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,170\nsomething a little more exciting, but\nwhen we did that little diagram and\n\n1152\n00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:47,560\nkinda went through, and I know I told our\n\n1153\n00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:54,230\ndirector before the set that I wouldn't\nshow my desktop and here I am.\n\n1154\n00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,428\nSo you know Jason,\nwe don't need to bring it up.\n\n1155\n00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:57,410\nOh!\n[LAUGH] Look at that!\n\n1156\n00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,089\nNever [SOUND] underestimate\nthe talents of our staff.\n\n1157\n01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:04,762\n[LAUGH] Anyhow, the one thing that\nI do want to mention back on this,\n\n1158\n01:00:04,762 --> 01:00:09,768\nis that when we go to communicate I\nshowed you guys the top of the model and\n\n1159\n01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:11,840\ngoing all the way down.\n\n1160\n01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,630\nThis trafficking destination\ngets sent to Google servers, and\n\n1161\n01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,830\nat google's servers,\nit goes back up the model.\n\n1162\n01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,600\nIt goes through the same\nprocess kind of in reverse.\n\n1163\n01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,400\nSo on their end they receive\nit most likely fiber,\n\n1164\n01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,760\nbecause they have a ton of money.\n\n1165\n01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,720\nAnd then after that they have MAC and\n\n1166\n01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,870\nLLC, going on just like\nin our first example and\n\n1167\n01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:40,680\nthey're on the internet, so\nit is an IP based communication and\n\n1168\n01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,760\nTCP reassembles the packet if it was\nbroken up in to multiple pieces.\n\n1169\n01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,100\nWhen they receive it,\nthey know that it was web traffic\n\n1170\n01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,741\nthat I was sending because\nit comes in on HTTP port 80.\n\n1171\n01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,420\nAnd they see that it's a get request, and\n\n1172\n01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,640\nthey send that to their\nweb server software.\n\n1173\n01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,470\nSo it's still a HTTP get\nrequest when they receive it.\n\n1174\n01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:12,070\nThe only difference is instead of being\nhandle by a web browser on their end,\n\n1175\n01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,930\nit's handled by their web server.\n\n1176\n01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:19,410\nAnd I think Google is apache based still,\nso I'll say apache.\n\n1177\n01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:23,689\nBut you know,\nit could be IIS doubtfully, or\n\n1178\n01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:28,418\nEngine X, so\nI mentioned a few times earlier which\n\n1179\n01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:32,810\nbefore I knew any better\nI called it enginex and\n\n1180\n01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,565\nthen I heard it was actually\npronounced Engine X.\n\n1181\n01:01:37,565 --> 01:01:40,875\nSo whatever web browser or\nweb server it is that they're using,\n\n1182\n01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:45,415\nthe traffic basically passes down\nthe model, and then backup again.\n\n1183\n01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:50,700\nSo on our end we pass down the model,\nwe cross the network,\n\n1184\n01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,330\nand then we pass right backup it again\nat the other side when they receive it.\n\n1185\n01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,770\nSo the OSI model is a two way process.\n\n1186\n01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,280\nWhen you send, it goes from the top down.\n\n1187\n01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,420\nWhen you receive,\nit goes from the bottom up.\n\n1188\n01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,940\nSo it's a pretty straightforward system.\n\n1189\n01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:09,790\n>> So then this isn't, so of course\nthe HTTP, you know, the Google, example\n\n1190\n01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:15,450\ngiven here, but this is for every kind of\ncommunication that goes on at all times.\n\n1191\n01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:19,270\nEverything will go through the model and\non its way back up.\n\n1192\n01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,830\n>> Yeah.\nWe would just substitute out, like,\n\n1193\n01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:25,260\nif this was email, maybe I fire up\n\n1194\n01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,960\nMicrosoft Outlook or\nMozilla Thunderbird or whatever.\n\n1195\n01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,830\nSo I fire up my email client.\n\n1196\n01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,950\nThat would take the place of application\nand instead of an HTTP Get Request,\n\n1197\n01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,080\nif we're sending email\nthen it'll be an SMTP.\n\n1198\n01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,170\nIt'll usually be MIME encoded or\nHTML encoded if it's an email.\n\n1199\n01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,815\nAnd then we send it using SMTP on port 25.\n\n1200\n01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:46,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1201\n01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,860\n>> And then it's TCP, IP, MAC.\n\n1202\n01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,175\nEverything else is the same.\n\n1203\n01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:49,734\n>> Mm-hm.\nNice.\n\n1204\n01:02:49,734 --> 01:02:52,345\n>> So we just substitute in whatever\nsoftware it is that we're using.\n\n1205\n01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:52,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1206\n01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,370\nSweet.\n\n1207\n01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,050\n>> So\nthat's all I've got on the OSI model.\n\n1208\n01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,350\nCan you think of anything else we\nneed to throw in on the OSI model?\n\n1209\n01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:04,670\n>> Not at this point, works pretty good,\ni suppose when we get into other things\n\n1210\n01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:10,510\ngoing down here, i suppose that we will be\nrevisiting it or reference it time again.\n\n1211\n01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,800\n>> What we've shown is what you\nneed to know for the exam, but\n\n1212\n01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,800\nif this is the first time you're being\nexposed to the OSI model, I encourage you\n\n1213\n01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,890\nguys to jump over to the Network Plus\nshow and catch the episode on that.\n\n1214\n01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:25,910\nIt's all really in the very first episode\nof Network Plus, so you can catch it there\n\n1215\n01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:31,060\nand we go a little more in depth on it and\ngive a little more of a description.\n\n1216\n01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,120\nBut for CISCO land, that's all we need.\n\n1217\n01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,370\nOur last objective that we're\ngonna tackle today, is the,\n\n1218\n01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,100\nlet's read,\nit's got a nice big formal name here.\n\n1219\n01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,030\nIdentify the appropriate media,\ncables, ports and connectors to connect\n\n1220\n01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:51,030\nCISCO network devices to other\nnetwork devices and hosts.\n\n1221\n01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,155\nIn a LAN.\n\n1222\n01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:53,880\nIt's like the longest objective name ever.\n\n1223\n01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,475\n>> But it does tell you exactly what.\n\n1224\n01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:57,432\nYeah.\n\n1225\n01:03:57,432 --> 01:03:58,105\n>> What it's gonna cover.\n\n1226\n01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:02,368\n>> So what they're getting at here,\nwith that big long name,\n\n1227\n01:04:02,368 --> 01:04:06,740\nis when you buy Cisco equipment,\nit's got some ports on it.\n\n1228\n01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:10,880\nAnd you have to make sure you get\nthe right ports for your need.\n\n1229\n01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,553\nSometimes it can be a little unforgiving\nand let me explain what I mean.\n\n1230\n01:04:14,553 --> 01:04:16,881\nIf you're buying a Cisco switch,\n\n1231\n01:04:16,881 --> 01:04:21,710\nmost Cisco switches are what\nare called fixed configuration devices.\n\n1232\n01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:25,620\nThat means when you buy them, they've got\na certain amount of ports, and that's it.\n\n1233\n01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,460\nYou can't expand them,\nyou can't add more ports to the switch.\n\n1234\n01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,350\nIf you need more ports,\nyou just buy more switches.\n\n1235\n01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,840\nAll right, there are some Cisco switches,\nsome of the high end ones,\n\n1236\n01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,370\nthat are what are called modular.\n\n1237\n01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,040\nI'm gonna do exactly what I told\nour producer I wouldn't do.\n\n1238\n01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,519\nLet me pull up Cisco's web page.\n\n1239\n01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,250\nAnd show you guys the Cisco product line.\n\n1240\n01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,474\nSo, Cisco has changed their web page so\nit's nice and\n\n1241\n01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:52,065\ndifficult to find anything anymore.\n\n1242\n01:04:52,065 --> 01:04:56,924\nHere we go, so I'm just going\nto go into their switches and\n\n1243\n01:04:56,924 --> 01:04:59,809\nI'll pull up their LAN switches.\n\n1244\n01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:04,816\nAll right, so with Cisco switches, there\nare a several different tiers of switch.\n\n1245\n01:05:04,816 --> 01:05:09,036\nAnd on the exam you're gonna\nsee these switches right here,\n\n1246\n01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:13,150\nthe Cisco Catalyst 3560 switches, right?\n\n1247\n01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,470\nThese are the 3560-X's, on the exam\nthey're still the regular 3560,\n\n1248\n01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:22,330\nthe difference is the 10 gigabit ports on\nthe end, which most people don't need.\n\n1249\n01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,030\nBut everything else is\nidentical about them.\n\n1250\n01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:27,770\nSo the 3560 is what you're gonna see on\nthe exam, they are fixed configuration,\n\n1251\n01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,350\nwhen you buy them,\nthey have a certain amount of ports.\n\n1252\n01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,030\nAnd that's it.\nYou can't add ports.\n\n1253\n01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,230\nSo if you buy a 48 port one, great.\n\n1254\n01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:39,260\nIf you buy a 24 port one,\nyou can't upgrade it to 48.\n\n1255\n01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,360\nIt's a 24 port switch and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n1256\n01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,260\nThe higher end switches,\nthe ones that aren't on the exams.\n\n1257\n01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,070\nLet me move up to them.\n\n1258\n01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,930\nAre these guys, the 4500s and the 6500s,\nand let me see if you I can get a better\n\n1259\n01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:57,410\npicture that is not all granular or\nwhatever.\n\n1260\n01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,318\nYeah, trying to do Java and ActiveX.\n\n1261\n01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:00,444\nI just, seriously, want a picture.\n\n1262\n01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:08,090\nSo, let's see if I can get a nice\nlittle text picture there.\n\n1263\n01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,760\nLet me go to the, I know the 6500\npage has just a normal picture.\n\n1264\n01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,050\nWhich they don't have linked on here.\n\n1265\n01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,420\nLet me just do a Google search.\n\n1266\n01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,670\nSo basically,\nthese are big chassis based switches.\n\n1267\n01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:24,890\nThey're a big, like a box, and you buy\nthese cards that you slide into them,\n\n1268\n01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:29,640\nand you can add ports as you need them,\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n1269\n01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,635\nAnd kind of a nice thing to have because\nyou can buy them with only one card\n\n1270\n01:06:34,635 --> 01:06:38,310\nat the beginning, and\nthen just add cards as you go.\n\n1271\n01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,510\nAnd that's a really bad picture there.\n\n1272\n01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,270\nBut you can see where it's a big box and\nyou have all these\n\n1273\n01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:47,210\ncards that go into the device, and\nso you can expand them as you go.\n\n1274\n01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,330\nThose are not the ones\nthat are on the exam.\n\n1275\n01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:54,250\nSo on the exam, you just have\nthe regular 3500's, 3560's, and\n\n1276\n01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,050\nthey have a fixed set of ports.\n\n1277\n01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,510\nLet me show you what I\nmean on a physical switch.\n\n1278\n01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:04,920\nSo I've got a 3560 right here,\nthe same one that's on the exam,\n\n1279\n01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,280\nand I'm just going to throw it\nup on our bench here, all right.\n\n1280\n01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,160\nSo this is a Cisco 3560.\n\n1281\n01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,280\nAnd if you look at it, you got your\nlittle status lights here, and\n\n1282\n01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,050\nthis is a 48 port switch,\nso it's got 48 ports.\n\n1283\n01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,420\nAnd then it's got four extra special\nports over here for uplinks or\n\n1284\n01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,010\nhigh bandwidth connections.\n\n1285\n01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,650\nSo this is a fixed configuration switch.\n\n1286\n01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:34,690\nIf I need 48 ports, I've got them, right?\n\n1287\n01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,130\nIf need 50 ports,\nI don't have them, right?\n\n1288\n01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,985\nSo I guess maybe if you count\nthese guys down here, but\n\n1289\n01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:43,655\nif I need 60 ports, I don't,\nI have to buy a second switch.\n\n1290\n01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:46,935\nYou can't really expand on this.\n\n1291\n01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:49,785\nSo when we're buying a switch,\nwe need to think about that.\n\n1292\n01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:53,570\nWe need to pick the right hardware for\nour needs.\n\n1293\n01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,720\nKnowing that some of it can't be expanded,\nall right.\n\n1294\n01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,600\nRouters are not like that.\n\n1295\n01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,100\nWith routers, they have all sorts\nof ports that are on them and\n\n1296\n01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,590\nusually when you buy them,\nthey come mostly empty.\n\n1297\n01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,890\nAnd you buy the individual\nports that are needed.\n\n1298\n01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:10,459\nSo, this was a 3560 switch,\n\n1299\n01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:15,780\nlet me bring up, cuz that one's heavy.\n\n1300\n01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,460\nSo this one is a 2800 series router.\n\n1301\n01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,240\nAnd this is the router that's on the exam.\n\n1302\n01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,630\nAnd the front side of it has\na nice pretty faceplate, but\n\n1303\n01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,310\nthe backside is where the action is.\n\n1304\n01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:32,670\nAnd on this particular router, you'll\nsee where it's got all sorts of slots.\n\n1305\n01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:36,290\nNate, do we still have a screw\ndriver under the table?\n\n1306\n01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,110\nBut basically when you buy a router,\nit'll have some ports built in.\n\n1307\n01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:45,450\nSo right here, I have two gigabit ports,\ngigabit 00, and 01, so that's what\n\n1308\n01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:50,430\nit comes with, and\neverything else is just empty, all right?\n\n1309\n01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:54,600\nAnd you buy the cards that you\nneed to suit your purpose.\n\n1310\n01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,360\nSo on this one,\nit's got a blank cover here.\n\n1311\n01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,290\nAnd a big blank cover here and\na big blank cover here.\n\n1312\n01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:04,910\nBut then it's got three\nlittle cards inserted here.\n\n1313\n01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,830\nThese are called WAN interface cards.\n\n1314\n01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:10,380\nAnd basically they look like this.\n\n1315\n01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,910\nThis is a WAN interface card right here.\n\n1316\n01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:17,560\nAnd this one adds a single T1 port.\n\n1317\n01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,160\nSo if we had a T1 line,\nwe could buy this card and\n\n1318\n01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,440\npop it right into the router, and\nnow I've got a T1 port, right?\n\n1319\n01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,850\n>> Now, does that card, can you put\nit in one of these bigger ones?\n\n1320\n01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,410\nAnd get other little things?\n\n1321\n01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:34,170\n>> So these big slots, these are called\nnetwork modular slots, right.\n\n1322\n01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,330\nAnd you have to have\na network module card.\n\n1323\n01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:41,040\nAnd you can get a network module\ncard that has one, two, or\n\n1324\n01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,120\nfour WIC slots, which are these.\n\n1325\n01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,190\nSo I can actually add more slots for\nthese with a network module,\n\n1326\n01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,020\nso I couldn't just put this in by itself.\n\n1327\n01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,925\nI'd have to get the bigger\ncard to go in there, yep.\n\n1328\n01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:55,840\nSo there's a whole array of\noptions that are out there.\n\n1329\n01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,808\nSo with routers you have\na lot of flexibility.\n\n1330\n01:09:57,808 --> 01:10:01,430\nAnd that's because so many people have so\nmany different needs for the routers,\n\n1331\n01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,490\nthat Cisco designs them to be modular.\n\n1332\n01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:08,370\nNow this is a 2U router which\nmeans it's pretty tall.\n\n1333\n01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,900\nIt's a big one.\n\n1334\n01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,170\nA lot of Cisco routers are only\n1U which means this whole bottom\n\n1335\n01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,611\npart wouldn't be here, right?\n\n1336\n01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:17,860\nSo the router would just be\nthis part across the top.\n\n1337\n01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:22,310\nThat gives you less room for expansion,\nbut most people don't need a ton of room.\n\n1338\n01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:27,380\nThis is a bigger one because this one\nalso has the voice over IP add-in,\n\n1339\n01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,940\nso this one is designed to\nbe a phone system too, so\n\n1340\n01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,590\nthey needed more physical room,\nit's a bigger device.\n\n1341\n01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,090\n>> Nice.\n\n1342\n01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,169\n>> But yeah, so these cards,\nyou can pop them in, pop them out,\n\n1343\n01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:40,610\nyou do have to turn the device off to do\nit, right, you can't do it while it's on.\n\n1344\n01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,290\nBut you can add in whatever you need.\n\n1345\n01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:45,017\nSo, like on this one, it's got, well,\nlet's see what all we have here.\n\n1346\n01:10:45,017 --> 01:10:47,618\nWe've got a T1 card right here.\n\n1347\n01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:51,750\nSo to just, actually, I think it's\nthe same one as what I had in my hand.\n\n1348\n01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:54,390\nSo we got a T1 card\nthat's already in there.\n\n1349\n01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:58,290\nWe've got a dual voice card.\n\n1350\n01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,830\nThese are our regular analog phone lines,\nright?\n\n1351\n01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,580\nSo if we wanted to hook\nup some phones to it.\n\n1352\n01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:09,000\nHere, this is a 3G card for\nconnecting to a 3G wireless network.\n\n1353\n01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,560\nIt's useful for backup, out of band\nmanagement, that kind of thing.\n\n1354\n01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,127\nThis is a blank so there's nothing there.\n\n1355\n01:11:14,127 --> 01:11:17,355\nSo we could add in a card here,\nwe could add in some network modules so\n\n1356\n01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:18,727\nwe can expand and contract.\n\n1357\n01:11:18,727 --> 01:11:24,788\nAnd they make a whole variety of cards for\nall sorts of stuff, frame relay,\n\n1358\n01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:29,711\nT1's, ISDN, dialup modems,\nDSL, there's a DSL card.\n\n1359\n01:11:29,711 --> 01:11:33,893\nThere's even some switch modules, so you\ncan get like a 16 port switch that can go\n\n1360\n01:11:33,893 --> 01:11:36,550\nright in here, and\nnow your router is a switch also.\n\n1361\n01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:39,844\n>> So then Don, so\nwhen you have stuff in here, right?\n\n1362\n01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:42,931\nSo when you had referenced\none of these right, so\n\n1363\n01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:46,772\non the command line stuff,\nthen you've got 0/0/0, so\n\n1364\n01:11:46,772 --> 01:11:51,766\nyou've got your module, your slot, and\nyour port, to then you can address.\n\n1365\n01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,427\nEach one of these guys.\n\n1366\n01:11:53,427 --> 01:11:54,235\n>> Yeah, absolutely and\n\n1367\n01:11:54,235 --> 01:11:56,411\nwe're gonna see that more when\nwe get into the command line.\n\n1368\n01:11:56,411 --> 01:11:59,060\nIt gets really confusing really fast.\n\n1369\n01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,370\nSo as you look at the switch,\n\n1370\n01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:05,050\nsome of these ports actually have written\non them what the name of the port is.\n\n1371\n01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:10,650\nSo, you'll see this one is GE0/1 and\nthis one is GE0/0.\n\n1372\n01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,523\nThat's letting us know the 0, the first 0,\n\n1373\n01:12:13,523 --> 01:12:17,149\nis letting us know that it's\na port built into the system.\n\n1374\n01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:24,616\nAnd then the /0 or /1, lets us know that 0\nis the first port, 1 is the second port.\n\n1375\n01:12:24,616 --> 01:12:28,774\nSo, I have 0/0 is the first built in port.\n\n1376\n01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:32,634\nAnd 0/1 is the second built in port.\n\n1377\n01:12:32,634 --> 01:12:36,540\nBut, then you start getting into these\nmodular cards, and it gets really\n\n1378\n01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,583\nconfusing really fast, because then\nyou'll usually have three numbers.\n\n1379\n01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:44,840\nOne number that identifies,\nwhether it's built in or not.\n\n1380\n01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,587\nA second number that\nidentifies the module, and\n\n1381\n01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:49,939\na third number that identifies the port.\n\n1382\n01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:55,850\nAnd so you may have a port that\nis 0/0/5 or something like that.\n\n1383\n01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:59,530\nSo, we don't really worry about\nthat on the physical side of\n\n1384\n01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:00,190\ninstalling the device.\n\n1385\n01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:02,130\nBut, once we get into the command line and\nstart configuring,\n\n1386\n01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,100\nwe'll have to pay attention to that.\n\n1387\n01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,390\nSo, we'll revisit that\nwhen we get into it.\n\n1388\n01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,060\nBut it is challenging and\nI have some little tricks,\n\n1389\n01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,350\nI use to remember it and\nbe able to figure it out.\n\n1390\n01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:16,310\nIt doesn't help that it's different\non every device you go to it seems.\n\n1391\n01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:19,670\n>> Yeah,\nI just wanna throw that out to try to.\n\n1392\n01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,151\n>> Impress with the knowledge.\n\n1393\n01:13:22,151 --> 01:13:23,940\n>> [LAUGH] And it is important.\n\n1394\n01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,240\nYou'll see that when we actually\nget to the command line,\n\n1395\n01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,110\nthat you've gotta know that.\n\n1396\n01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,330\nSo we'll definitely see that.\n\n1397\n01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,530\nAll right, so when we buy a Cisco switch,\n\n1398\n01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:37,360\nit's important that we buy it spec'd the\nway we need it from the factory, right?\n\n1399\n01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,170\nOn a router we have flexibility cuz\nwe can go out, and buy these cards,\n\n1400\n01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,780\nthrow them in and so on, right?\n\n1401\n01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,827\nLet's go back to the switch, and I wanna\nshow you guys some of the stuff there.\n\n1402\n01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:58,648\nNow there is a little bit of flexibility\nhere on the switch with these SFP ports.\n\n1403\n01:13:58,648 --> 01:14:01,790\nSFP stands for Small Form Factor port.\n\n1404\n01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:07,330\nMost Cisco switches either\nhave SFP ports GBic slots.\n\n1405\n01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:10,350\nSo, SFP is small form factor port.\n\n1406\n01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:15,640\nGBIC is gigabit interface card,\nor interface connector.\n\n1407\n01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,900\nI've heard both.\n\n1408\n01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,770\nBut, here's some examples.\n\n1409\n01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:25,380\nThis right here is a SFP module,\nand you can buy an SFP module and\n\n1410\n01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:30,520\nit's either going to have a fiber\noptic connector like this one does.\n\n1411\n01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,810\nOr you can get ones that they\nswell up at the end, and\n\n1412\n01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:39,280\nit's got a RJ-45 connector for\na normal network cable, right?\n\n1413\n01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,830\nSo, if I had a copper\nnetwork versus a fiber one.\n\n1414\n01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:46,220\nSo basically you buy the one you need,\neither fiber or copper.\n\n1415\n01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,570\nAnd you pop it in there and\nnow you got a functional port.\n\n1416\n01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:51,820\nThe port does not work\nwithout an SFP in it.\n\n1417\n01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,410\nSo these other three ports here,\nthey don't work until I put an SFP in.\n\n1418\n01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,260\nOnce I've got an SFP,\n\n1419\n01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:02,300\nI can take a fiber optic cable\nlike this one, I can plug it in.\n\n1420\n01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,790\nAnd now I've got a fiber optic connection,\nand\n\n1421\n01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,420\nthis is a gigabit port here on the switch.\n\n1422\n01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,292\nSo, I can run this fiber up to\nanother floor in the building or\n\n1423\n01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:15,509\nup linking switches right next to each\nother, or whatever it is that I need.\n\n1424\n01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,642\n>> Based on the needs of your network.\n\n1425\n01:15:18,642 --> 01:15:19,440\n>> Exactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1426\n01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,780\n>> Which is what Cisco wants us to know.\n\n1427\n01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:26,270\nSo, the cool part about fiber is\nyour cables can have different ends.\n\n1428\n01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:31,190\nSo this one, it has the,\nwhat is it, the LC connector?\n\n1429\n01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,380\nYes, LC.\n\n1430\n01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,210\nLC on that end.\n\n1431\n01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:39,010\nAnd on this end,\nI've got the SC connector.\n\n1432\n01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:42,710\nSo, we've got a different\nconnector on this side.\n\n1433\n01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,580\nAnd that's useful because you'll see\na lot of equipment that still uses this\n\n1434\n01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,320\nconnector.\n\n1435\n01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,961\nEven new equipment manufactured today.\n\n1436\n01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,820\nIf you use a GBIC,\nif your switch has that larger connector.\n\n1437\n01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,680\nWhat did I?\n\n1438\n01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,290\n>> Right over there.\n\n1439\n01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:55,865\nOver on the top.\n\n1440\n01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right in front of me.\n\n1441\n01:15:57,330 --> 01:16:00,930\nSo here is that GBIC that i was\ntalking about, and if your switch uses\n\n1442\n01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:05,360\nthis is one of these, well it'll be\na wider slot that you pop it in.\n\n1443\n01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,480\nAnd you'll notice this one has the fiber\nconnector that I've got in my hand,\n\n1444\n01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,980\nI've got it upside down,\nthere we go, so we just pop that in.\n\n1445\n01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,790\nAnd then I can run this to another switch\nthat had a g big slot, pop it in there,\n\n1446\n01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:19,760\nand off we go.\n\n1447\n01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,440\nOr maybe it's not another\nswitch that I'm running to.\n\n1448\n01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:22,990\nMaybe.\n\n1449\n01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,460\nI have some other device that's out\nthere that I need to connect to.\n\n1450\n01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,300\nSo, just keep in mind that while a switch.\n\n1451\n01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,810\nWe can't add ports to it.\n\n1452\n01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:36,230\nWe do normally have some flexible\nports down here at the end, and\n\n1453\n01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:39,720\nthey'll take either a small\nform factor adapter this,\n\n1454\n01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,260\nwhich what almost what\nall the new ones do.\n\n1455\n01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:48,500\nOr they'll take the larger gigabit ones.\n\n1456\n01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,240\nWith both of these, just keep in mind that\nthey usually come in two flavors, so for\n\n1457\n01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:52,849\nexample.\n\n1458\n01:16:55,030 --> 01:17:01,540\nSo the one I was holding in my hand a\nmoment ago, this guy right here is an SX.\n\n1459\n01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:06,160\nOr a single mode module which means\n\n1460\n01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,570\nthe fiber cable coming out of this\ncan go up to 10 kilometers away.\n\n1461\n01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:14,449\nThe one over here, is an LX and it's multi\nmode and that means it can only go like,\n\n1462\n01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:21,340\nit's under a kilometer, it's something\nlike 700 meters or something like that.\n\n1463\n01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:25,970\nThe distances are affected, because the\nlasers are actually a part of this module.\n\n1464\n01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,400\nSo when you buy, you just have to\nbuy the appropriate standard for\n\n1465\n01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,490\nwhatever you're doing.\n\n1466\n01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:34,440\nThis one is SX, so I've got 2SX, and 1LX.\n\n1467\n01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,660\nSo, you just get the appropriate one and\nyou're in business.\n\n1468\n01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,160\n>> Nice.\n\n1469\n01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,140\nWe're good.\n\n1470\n01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:41,780\n>> All right.\n\n1471\n01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,350\nYep.\nThe last thing I wanna mention is,\n\n1472\n01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,200\nour internet connection here, we have a 40\nmegabit internet connection here, and\n\n1473\n01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,640\nit's fiber optic.\n\n1474\n01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:54,180\nA lot of cities are starting it,\nfiber optic connections for consumers, for\n\n1475\n01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,880\nbusiness, we've always\nbeen able to get it.\n\n1476\n01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,080\nIt's just really expensive.\n\n1477\n01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,450\nBut for home users,\nyou're starting to see Verizon's FiOS or\n\n1478\n01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:03,040\nGoogle's Fiber to the household or\nwhatever they call it.\n\n1479\n01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,280\nSo, you're starting to\nsee a lot more of that.\n\n1480\n01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,290\nWhen they run fiber into your house,\n\n1481\n01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:11,140\nyour home grade network equipment doesn't\ntypically have fiber optic ports, and\n\n1482\n01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,730\nit's rare to find a router\nthat has fiber optic ports.\n\n1483\n01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:17,960\nSo, a lot of times you'll have\nto implement another device.\n\n1484\n01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:23,100\nOne of these guys right here,\nwhich is called a fiber transceiver,\n\n1485\n01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:27,360\nI've heard some other names for it,\nbut basically it's a media converter.\n\n1486\n01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,120\nAnd what it does is it allows\nyou to run fiber into it, and\n\n1487\n01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,070\nthen converts it over to ethernet.\n\n1488\n01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:37,630\nSo, I've got the fiber optic that\nruns into my house, or whatever.\n\n1489\n01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,935\nNot my house, unfortunately.\n\n1490\n01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:42,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it runs into our building and\n\n1491\n01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:46,370\nthen after that, it just becomes\na standard network connection.\n\n1492\n01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,760\nYou throw that in there, and\n\n1493\n01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,250\nnow you can run it into your consumer\ngrade router or firewall, or whatever.\n\n1494\n01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:58,510\nSo, you may need additional hardware\nlike this if your equipment doesn't have\n\n1495\n01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:04,260\nall the necessary ports.\n\n1496\n01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,410\n>> Yep, so let's see.\n\n1497\n01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,794\nAm I leaving anything out?\n\n1498\n01:19:07,794 --> 01:19:13,170\nI think We covered\nthe additional modules for\n\n1499\n01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:17,700\nrouters, we covered the SFPs and G bits\nfor switches, and I even talked a little\n\n1500\n01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,090\nbit about the higher end devices\nthat have the big line cards.\n\n1501\n01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,560\n>> Yeah, maybe in the beginning\njust to glaze over it.\n\n1502\n01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,800\n>> All right, so\nlike we said at the beginning of the show,\n\n1503\n01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,450\nthis was designed to be\nour high level overview.\n\n1504\n01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:34,700\nWe didn't really get nitty gritty\ninto any of the details on this one.\n\n1505\n01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,380\nJust kind of high level stuff.\n\n1506\n01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,930\nIn our next episode,\nwe're going to start on switches, and\n\n1507\n01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,210\nthat's when we're gonna start\ngetting into the nitty gritty.\n\n1508\n01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,990\nHow they work,\nhow they make the decisions,\n\n1509\n01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:45,190\nhow they know what traffic\nto send to what port?\n\n1510\n01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:49,460\nWe're also gonna start with the command\nline, actually working with the devices.\n\n1511\n01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,370\nA lot of Cisco devices today\ncome with a web interface, but\n\n1512\n01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,720\non the exam you gotta know\nthe command line interface.\n\n1513\n01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,190\nSo that's what we're gonna\nsee as we work with those and\n\n1514\n01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:01,500\nkind of manipulate them, so\nthat's all on the horizon.\n\n1515\n01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,850\nYou think of anything else, we need to\nthrow in here before we wrap it up?\n\n1516\n01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:06,790\n>> No.\n\n1517\n01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,620\nI think we're all right.\n\n1518\n01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,170\nI do have one question though\nI've been thinking about.\n\n1519\n01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:14,300\nI'll ask you before we end.\n\n1520\n01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,550\n>> Off script, this never ends well.\n\n1521\n01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:19,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let me just get your opinion.\n\n1522\n01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,788\n>> Okay.\n>> If Duke Nukem and\n\n1523\n01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:26,157\nBlake Stone got in a fight, who would win?\n\n1524\n01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:27,335\n>> That's not even a question.\n\n1525\n01:20:27,335 --> 01:20:29,122\nSo it's when Duke Nukem wins?\n\n1526\n01:20:29,122 --> 01:20:31,641\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is Blake Stone\n\n1527\n01:20:31,641 --> 01:20:33,952\nstill recognizable or not?\n\n1528\n01:20:33,952 --> 01:20:35,280\nThat's what the question should have been.\n\n1529\n01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,431\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's all I got.\n\n1530\n01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:38,735\n>> All right.\n\n1531\n01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:41,127\nSo, let's tie that into Cisco somehow.\n\n1532\n01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:45,192\nWe used to do the Network Deathmatches\nwith Duke Nukem, and\n\n1533\n01:20:45,192 --> 01:20:50,010\nvery low bandwidth requirements but\nyou want it to be low latency too.\n\n1534\n01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:50,880\nVery important.\n\n1535\n01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,310\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n1536\n01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:58,316\nSo, half our viewers are like Duke who?\n\n1537\n01:20:58,316 --> 01:20:59,079\n>> Man.\n>> All right.\n\n1538\n01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:01,850\nWell, ladies and gentleman,\nas always I hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1539\n01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,001\nDefinitely stay tuned as we\ncontinue on with the Cisco stuff.\n\n1540\n01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:08,160\nI know today was a little lecturey, but\n\n1541\n01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,432\nwe're gonna get into the exciting\nstuff the next episode,\n\n1542\n01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:15,438\nas we start to actually configure\nthe things and see how stuff gets done.\n\n1543\n01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:19,024\n>> Yeah.\nAnd a good foundation for what's to come.\n\n1544\n01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:23,410\nSo now, as things come up, then we can\nreference those kinds of things and.\n\n1545\n01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1546\n01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:28,190\n>> And for those of you that need more\ninformation, you wanna go more in depth.\n\n1547\n01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:31,330\nAlways keep in mind that you can jump over\nthe network, plus show and catch those.\n\n1548\n01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:34,800\nWe go a little more in depth onto\nsome of the more foundational ideas.\n\n1549\n01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,250\nAs well as for our premium subscribers.\n\n1550\n01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,740\nYou can always go into the Q&A, post\nquestions there, and we'll get back to you\n\n1551\n01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,880\nwith an answer in a pretty reasonable\namount of time, typically.\n\n1552\n01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,300\n>> Yep.\n>> Depending on the week.\n\n1553\n01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,420\nSo, all right.\n\n1554\n01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,046\nSo ladies and gentlemen, as always,\nI hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1555\n01:21:48,046 --> 01:21:49,168\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n1556\n01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:50,325\n>> I am Nathan Copeland.\n\n1557\n01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:51,974\n>> And we'll catch you next time around.\n\n1558\n01:21:51,974 --> 01:22:01,974\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,270\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,860\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,890\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,840\n>> I am doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,550\n>> It's been forever.\n\n10\n00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,060\n>> It's been a long time.\n\n11\n00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,190\nIt's been a long time.\n\n12\n00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,510\n>> The masses have been clamouring,\n\n13\n00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,000\nsaying when are we going\nto do another Cisco show.\n\n14\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,320\nAnd Ronnie was actually out, teaching\nanother class at a military base last\n\n15\n00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,240\nweek, so we didn't do any Cisco shows.\n\n16\n00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,460\nBut we're back on track.\n\n17\n00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,220\n>> That's right.\n\n18\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,530\n>> We're ready to get\ninto the world of CCENT,\n\n19\n00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,940\nI think we should add more\nletters to that acronym there.\n\n20\n00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,175\n>> Is it that had more of the routing so\nnow it's the CCNA routing and\n\n21\n00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:16,029\nswitching so we could add more\nto that one, but not CCENT.\n\n22\n00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:16,618\n>> That's right.\n\n23\n00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,951\n>> All right, so\ntoday we got a cool episode.\n\n24\n00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,927\nFor those of you that have watched our\nother CCENT episodes it's been kinda like\n\n25\n00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,040\nnetworking terminology and\ntheory up until now.\n\n26\n00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600\nAnd today, we're actually gonna\nbreak out the gear, the hardware.\n\n27\n00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,050\n>> And so for us especially at this level,\n\n28\n00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,020\nwhat we wanna make sure of is that you\nunderstand the basic infrastructure\n\n29\n00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,760\ncomponents that everybody that's working\nwith Cisco equipment is gonna need to.\n\n30\n00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,360\nSo we're gonna show you how to configure\na basic router and a switcher,\n\n31\n00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,500\nat least get it up and running.\n\n32\n00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,200\nShowing you actually the components\nthat we are doing, and\n\n33\n00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,820\nalso the basic config’s that\nwe're also gonna be running too.\n\n34\n00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,332\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n35\n00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:53,510\n>> All right, so\n\n36\n00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,750\none of the things I want to start out\nwith, even before we start powering\n\n37\n00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,430\nequipment on, hooking cables up,\nand all that crazy stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,970\nI want to start off with just a piece of\nCisco hardware to show you guys what it\n\n39\n00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,160\nlooks like, how it functions,\nwhat it does, all that good stuff.\n\n40\n00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,130\nSo I got a couple of pieces of equipment\nbehind us and you can't see it on camera,\n\n41\n00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,040\nbut we've got a nice 2800 series router,\nwhich is exactly what's on the exam.\n\n42\n00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,440\nWe've got a 3560 switch,\nwhich also is what's on the exam.\n\n43\n00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,860\nSo kinda handy to have.\n\n44\n00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,563\nBut then I've also got a 2620, a 2600.\n\n45\n00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:29,100\nThese are what was on the exam\nup until mid last year.\n\n46\n00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,654\n>> The reason I got it here is because\nI can take it apart and not feel so\n\n47\n00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:32,221\nbad about it.\n\n48\n00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,514\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wanna break this guy out and\n\n49\n00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,804\nkinda show you guys what\na Cisco router is like and\n\n50\n00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:42,750\nkinda how its configuration is,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,730\nSo let me kinda just\nflip this thing around.\n\n52\n00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,880\nSo you can see here just\non the wide shot it,\n\n53\n00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,500\nI don't know,\nit's a little bit wider than a pizza box,\n\n54\n00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,010\nit's about the same size as\na large pizza box and not as tall.\n\n55\n00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,279\nAnd it is one U tall which is 1.75 inches,\nRonnie?\n\n56\n00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,041\n>> Yeah, one and three quarters.\n>> So it is basically one and\n\n57\n00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,385\nthree quarters inches.\n\n58\n00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:14,870\n[LAUGH] And I don't know why that\nthrew me, but there not giant devices.\n\n59\n00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,810\nThey are bigger than that like Linksys\nrouter that you might have at home.\n\n60\n00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,080\nThe other thing I wanna point out is\nthere's actually a number of Internet\n\n61\n00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,510\narguments over this, over which is the\nfront and which is the back of the router.\n\n62\n00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,445\n>> Yeah, that is actually a good\nquestion on that one, yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:31,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if you're like me,\n\n64\n00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,990\na lot of times you look at this equipment\nand you see a nice pretty facade on it.\n\n65\n00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,510\nAnd you say, well that's\nthe front of the router, right?\n\n66\n00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,640\nBut then you go into network closets\nwhere people have racked these things up.\n\n67\n00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,390\nAnd they've racked them with this end\nforward, which you might look at and say,\n\n68\n00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,810\nwell that's the back end because\nthere's the power adapter.\n\n69\n00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,550\nOkay?\n\n70\n00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,980\nBut on Cisco equipment like this router,\nyou'll notice that all the jacks,\n\n71\n00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,310\nall the interfaces and plugs and\n\n72\n00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,650\nstuff are on the back side and\nthere are none on the front.\n\n73\n00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,360\nAnd so if you mount it into your\nrack forward like this then,\n\n74\n00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,420\nthere's not much you can do on a front\nside other than see the power light.\n\n75\n00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,360\n>> That's it, yep.\n\n76\n00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,140\n>> Now when we talk about\nthe idea of a router here Don.\n\n77\n00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,940\nA lot of people are again are probably\nmore familiar with the idea of a home\n\n78\n00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,460\nwireless router versus this.\n\n79\n00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,260\nSo let's talk about that,\njust briefly here and put this in context.\n\n80\n00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,020\nA regular home wireless router for\n\n81\n00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,500\nus really is not going to have a lot\nof other parts in it except for\n\n82\n00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,860\nmaybe a circuit board inside and maybe\na little bit of RAM, but not really much.\n\n83\n00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,130\nSo when we take a look at this, why\nthe heck would I ever need this if I have\n\n84\n00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,320\na wireless router on it,\na router like that?\n\n85\n00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240\n>> So the main reason is, and you guys\nmight have heard us use the term gateway\n\n86\n00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,170\non some of the other shows like\nin Network Plus show or whatever.\n\n87\n00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:53,210\nA lot of your home routers,\nthey have multiple Ethernet ports, right?\n\n88\n00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,700\nRJ 45 jacks for regular networks.\n\n89\n00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,590\nBut if you're in a business or enterprise\nenvironment you might have T1 lines,\n\n90\n00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,160\nframe relay, MPLS, stuff like that.\n\n91\n00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,170\nThose home routers don't support that.\n\n92\n00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,890\nSo we need a higher-end router that's\nable to support these other media types.\n\n93\n00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,600\n>> So for us, there's actually other\ncomponents we'll actually break down\n\n94\n00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,390\ninside and we'll talk about and this is\nmore akin to an actual computer, right?\n\n95\n00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,180\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n96\n00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,920\n>> And it's just like a little\nwireless router so remember that,\n\n97\n00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,450\nwhen you do actually\nthink about this device.\n\n98\n00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,150\n>> Yeah, there's a lot more\nmuscle behind one of these.\n\n99\n00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,600\nThe first difference we'll notice,\nand let's go to our sky cam.\n\n100\n00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,070\nOne of the first things you'll\nnotice on a router like this\n\n101\n00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,500\nis that on the back side\nwe've got network jacks, and\n\n102\n00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,330\nthere are several jacks that\nare built right in to the unit.\n\n103\n00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,120\nBut there's also a number of slots,\nand bays or whatever.\n\n104\n00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,061\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:43,610\n>> It's a network module is\n\n106\n00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,161\nwhat it's called.\nSo\n\n107\n00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,150\nthere's a lot of these different\nports on the back side.\n\n108\n00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,760\nWhen you buy a home router.\n\n109\n00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760\n>> Yeah, there's nothing.\n\n110\n00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,620\n>> It's configured one way.\n\n111\n00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,980\n>> That's it.\n>> And that's the end of it.\n\n112\n00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,640\nBut when you buy a Cisco router like this,\n\n113\n00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,900\nyou can buy various cards,\nlet's see if I can do this by hand.\n\n114\n00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,380\nI might need a screwdriver.\n\n115\n00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,970\nThere we go.\n\n116\n00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,350\nIt comes with various modules that you\ncan pop in and out based on your needs.\n\n117\n00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,860\nSo this particular interface here is\nwhat's called a WAN interface card\n\n118\n00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,409\nor a WIC.\n\n119\n00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,370\nAnd the WAN interface cards are just\nthese little guys right here.\n\n120\n00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,570\nAnd you buy them based on what you need.\n\n121\n00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,270\nSo this one, for example, is a T1 WIC,\n\n122\n00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,500\nit's designed to hook up,\nthis one's a fractional T1, not a full T1.\n\n123\n00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,030\nBut it's designed to be able to hook there\nso you can get that serial communication.\n\n124\n00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,710\nAnd if you don't need it, the router comes\nwith a little blanking cover over here.\n\n125\n00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,310\nWhich is, yeah,\nexactly what we're seeing on these.\n\n126\n00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,690\nAnd then if you need it,\nbuy the WIC, and you pop it in here.\n\n127\n00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,790\nAnd now you can plug in a T1, right?\n\n128\n00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,290\nAnd if you're gonna be doing DSL or\nwhatever, you can get WICs for those.\n\n129\n00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,890\nAnd you pop them in, and\nyou gain access to those ports.\n\n130\n00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,240\n>> And it makes highly configurable.\n\n131\n00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,380\nSo, whatever the needs are in your\nnetwork is what you'll actually have.\n\n132\n00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,830\nSo remember that this device for\nus, fully configurable,\n\n133\n00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,360\nallows us to be able to meet\nthe needs that we're actually given.\n\n134\n00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,700\nOr maybe we're only allowed a particular\ntype of service provider in\n\n135\n00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,950\nwhatever building we're in and we have to\nkinda configure our router to do that too.\n\n136\n00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n137\n00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,450\nRonnie, you wanna talk about\nthis big guy for a second?\n\n138\n00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,850\n>> This particular port or bay here\nis what we call the network module.\n\n139\n00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,710\nNow, this allows us to\nactually have more expansion.\n\n140\n00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,170\nNow, so\nthese cards are of course a lot bigger\n\n141\n00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,010\nthan the idea of the WAN interface card.\n\n142\n00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,810\nSometimes these can include\njust a single port on them,\n\n143\n00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,370\nand that can even go up to\nwhat they call a 16 switch.\n\n144\n00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,250\nSo, in other words,\nwe can add in a switching component\n\n145\n00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,850\nto actually allow this router\nto become also a switch as well.\n\n146\n00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,450\nSo in this particular one,\nthere's actually-\n\n147\n00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,290\n>> A big empty area.\n\n148\n00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,820\n>> Yeah, a big gigantic empty area\nif we were to open this up here.\n\n149\n00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,930\n>> Yeah, we can take that off.\n\n150\n00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,990\nBut it's exactly like Ronnie said.\n\n151\n00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,470\nIn the early days, like when 100\nMB networks were just coming out,\n\n152\n00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,010\nthey made a giant network module that\njust had one 100 MB interface on there.\n\n153\n00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,176\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> But, in today's day-\n>> There you go.\n\n154\n00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,026\n>> You can get all sorts of\ndifferent modules in here,\n\n155\n00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,194\nlike ones that add four WICs or.\n\n156\n00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:01,394\nThe 16 port switch module is pretty cool,\nthe one Ronnie was talking about,\n\n157\n00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:04,630\nyou pop it right in here and it's like\nhaving a switch built into the router.\n\n158\n00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,220\n>> And you can see the main\nconnection back there.\n\n159\n00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,920\nIt works almost just like if you were to\nplug in another device directly into it.\n\n160\n00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,060\nIt can house multiple\ncomponent devices for us here.\n\n161\n00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,860\nAnd always nice to actually have\nthese handy and never to lose these,\n\n162\n00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,970\nthese are always good.\n\n163\n00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,080\nIf not,\nbecause of how much air gets generated,\n\n164\n00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,790\nthen you can get a lot of dust inside.\n\n165\n00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,900\n>> Yeah, if you leave that open it does\ndisrupt the airflow inside the unit.\n\n166\n00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,260\nIt can cause it to overheat, so\n\n167\n00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,150\nit's always a good idea to have\nthe covers on any empty port.\n\n168\n00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,354\nNow, this particular router\n[CROSSTALK] Do I have it upside down?\n\n169\n00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:36,934\n>> Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,050\n>> All right.\n\n171\n00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,373\nSo this particular router is only one\nU tall, so it has two WIC slots and\n\n172\n00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:46,560\nit's got one network module slot.\n\n173\n00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,680\nYou can get larger routers like the 3640s,\nthe 3840s,\n\n174\n00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,640\nthe bigger routers like that that are 2U.\n\n175\n00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,020\nThey've got a lot more modules on them.\n\n176\n00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,190\nThey'll have four WICs and\ntwo network modules, or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,550\nAnd that's actually what we've got down\nhere is a much, much larger router.\n\n178\n00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,750\nThe problem is, the larger they are,\nthe harder it is to throw them up here on\n\n179\n00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,730\nthe cabinet [LAUGH] and\nshow them on camera.\n\n180\n00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,480\nSo that's why I picked this smaller router\nto be able to show us all right here on\n\n181\n00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,650\nthe air.\n\n182\n00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,520\nSo this is an example.\n\n183\n00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,328\nNow, the other thing I wanted to\nshow you while we had this here,\n\n184\n00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:21,590\nwas the innards of it.\n\n185\n00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,950\nA lot of us never get to crack\none of these babies open and\n\n186\n00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,230\nI want to show you guys what is found\ninside of one of these devices.\n\n187\n00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,350\nOuch and I want to pinch\nthe junk out of my finger there.\n\n188\n00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,400\nThat's a safety hazard,\nright safety first.\n\n189\n00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,600\n>> So remember when we were talking about\nthe idea of a router being more like a PC,\n\n190\n00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,050\nyou can also see inside\nof a regular router.\n\n191\n00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,546\nYou can see something like a motherboard,\nthat's also gonna be in there.\n\n192\n00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,130\nYou're gonna see RAM.\n\n193\n00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,450\nYou're gonna see something equivalent to\nlike a hard drive and as well as a CPU.\n\n194\n00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,844\n>> Yeah, when you look inside of this one,\n\n195\n00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,970\nlet me scoot it over just a little bit\nhere, you can see here's a power supply.\n\n196\n00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,660\nAnd it's not a standard ATX\npower supply or whatever.\n\n197\n00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,613\nIt is proprietary but\nit's just right here.\n\n198\n00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:07,380\nIf the power supply dies out,\nyou can swap it.\n\n199\n00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,310\nIt's got a fan and\n\n200\n00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,950\nthere's actually vent holes on the bottom\nof this thing to allow that air out.\n\n201\n00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,630\nSo it does have a fan for air circulation.\n\n202\n00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,130\nWhen we look at the motherboard.\n\n203\n00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,820\nSo this board here.\n\n204\n00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,060\nWe can see processors and\n\n205\n00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,008\nwhat are called ASICS,\napplication specific integrated circuits.\n\n206\n00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,264\nThese are what accelerates routing and\nother things.\n\n207\n00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:28,820\nAnd there's two sets of memory sticks,\n\n208\n00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,120\nnow on this particular unit I am not sure\nwhich one is RAM and which one is flash.\n\n209\n00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,518\nOne of them is RAM and that's going\nto be what you run off of, right?\n\n210\n00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:41,150\nYour RAM just like you have in a PC\nthat's the memory you're running from.\n\n211\n00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,060\nAnd the other one is flash,\nwhich is where your operating system and\n\n212\n00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,140\nfile storage occurs.\n\n213\n00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,440\nSo it's like the hard drive,\nit's kind of taking that role over.\n\n214\n00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,572\nI'm pretty sure this is the RAM and\nthis is the flash.\n\n215\n00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:55,450\nYou know sometimes I can tell by looking\nat the chip, I'll just pop it out.\n\n216\n00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,640\n>> And I can't tell by looking at them.\n\n217\n00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,189\nYeah this one doesn't have\nthe markings I'm used to on it, so\n\n218\n00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:04,610\nI do not know on that one.\n\n219\n00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,340\nI guess I could look at this other one and\nmaybe it's marked.\n\n220\n00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,420\nAnd maybe it's not.\n\n221\n00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,439\nSo, the key thing to remember\non this is a [NOISE].\n\n222\n00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,800\nYeah that one's not\njumping out at me either.\n\n223\n00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,460\nBut the key thing to remember on this\nis you see me popping these memory\n\n224\n00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,990\nmodules out.\n\n225\n00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,150\nThey can be replaced.\n\n226\n00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,380\nThat when you buy a router.\n\n227\n00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,390\nLike this router might have\nonly come with 64 megs of RAM.\n\n228\n00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,990\nI might want to up it to 128 or\n256 megs of RAM.\n\n229\n00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,155\nSome of the newer ones are starting\nto come with a gig of RAM now.\n\n230\n00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you guys at home are saying a gig?\n\n231\n00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,310\nWell I can't remember the last time I\nowned a computer with only a gig of RAM.\n\n232\n00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,000\n>> On a router.\n\n233\n00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,020\n>> On a router, that's plenty.\n\n234\n00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,660\nYep, yep.\n>> Right.\n\n235\n00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,680\nYeah.\n\n236\n00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,780\nSo the internal components again,\na basic computer is what we have here, but\n\n237\n00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,400\nreally focused in on the idea\nof routing for us as well.\n\n238\n00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,730\nSo notice that there's not a ton of moving\nparts that we have to deal with, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,000\nReally the only real moving part for\nus is that fan over there, and\n\n240\n00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,030\nit keeps it lightweight because only doing\none thing, it's gonna take that CPU and\n\n241\n00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,930\nrun it as hard as it can just\nto perform that one thing.\n\n242\n00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,910\nSo that's what we have here too.\n\n243\n00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,490\n>> And then there's one last thing\nthat I wanted to point out in here\n\n244\n00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,440\nis this add-in board right here.\n\n245\n00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,300\nWe pointed out the WICs, the Wan Interface\nCards, and the network modules right?\n\n246\n00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,920\nAnd you can actually see\nall those back here, right?\n\n247\n00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,550\nHere's that WIC I was\npointing out earlier.\n\n248\n00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,750\nLet me just scoot that up some so\nyou can see like the tabs back here, and\n\n249\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,160\nit just slides right into this module,\nif I pop it out.\n\n250\n00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,770\nThere we go.\nSo you can kinda see where it just slides\n\n251\n00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,085\nin, so there's those WAN interface\ncards and where they're going.\n\n252\n00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:38,630\nIf I can,\nI got it off its little track there we go.\n\n253\n00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,570\nSo that's where they're going but\nthere are some cards that don't go into\n\n254\n00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,070\nan external slot but\ninstead go inside, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,010\nThis particular router has\na VPN accelerator board, and\n\n256\n00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,120\nthat's this board right here.\n\n257\n00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,370\nMost of us terminate our firewall,\nour VPN's on a firewall right?\n\n258\n00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,800\nSo if you have a Cisco PIX or\na Cisco ASA then\n\n259\n00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,220\nit has VPN acceleration\nbuilt into the motherboard.\n\n260\n00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,240\nBut on a router you don't and so\non a router if you need that,\n\n261\n00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,360\nif you're gonna be doing heavy VPN work,\nyou can buy a VPN accelerator board.\n\n262\n00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,310\nAnd this is an example right here,\nand it says right on it AIMVPN, so\n\n263\n00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,840\nthat's the VPN add in modules,\nwhat AIM is.\n\n264\n00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,488\nAnd it's just a board with special\ncircuitry on it designed solely for\n\n265\n00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:29,585\nVPN acceleration, and\nit pops right onto the motherboard and\n\n266\n00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:32,054\nadds that extended functionality.\n\n267\n00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:32,554\n>> Yep.\n\n268\n00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,180\nSo a lot of extra components\nthat we have here.\n\n269\n00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,260\nAnd this helps, right?\n\n270\n00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,903\nCuz that means you can start\noff with a basic router and\n\n271\n00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,460\nthen end up buying more\nas your company needs it.\n\n272\n00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,619\nAnd again, that can change too as\nyour company also needs as well.\n\n273\n00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,980\nSo for us here, having a configurable\ndevice, of course, making sure that we can\n\n274\n00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,850\nactually replace these components\nis good inside the enterprise.\n\n275\n00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,160\nSometimes it's just easier, saying, oh,\n\n276\n00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,536\nwe'll just buy another one,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,527\n>> Like a regular home router\n\n278\n00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,700\nwhen they burn out.\n\n279\n00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,720\nOn most enterprises\nyou're not gonna do that.\n\n280\n00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,230\nIf a power supply burns out,\nwe're gonna replace that.\n\n281\n00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,260\nIf we actually need more RAM,\nwe're gonna replace that device as well.\n\n282\n00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,550\nIf we need more functionality\nin terms of a router,\n\n283\n00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,090\nit gives us this ability to change\nthat out or to add in more too.\n\n284\n00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,130\n>> Now this router is a little dated but\njust to give you guys an idea.\n\n285\n00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,010\nYour home router probably\ncost between 50 and $100.\n\n286\n00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,540\nThe 2800 series router\nI've got behind us here,\n\n287\n00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,530\nthe one that's on the exam,\nthey really start at about $2000.\n\n288\n00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,190\nAnd this one has the voiceover\nIP module add-in to it.\n\n289\n00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,480\nSo configured the way it is, that's\nprobably a $4000 router right there.\n\n290\n00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,870\nSo If the power supply breaks,\nyou don't say screw it,\n\n291\n00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,140\nI'll just go buy another one.\n\n292\n00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,550\nNot when it costs four grand, right?\n\n293\n00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,560\nSo you say I'll go by that $100\npower supply and replace that so\n\n294\n00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720\nwe're a lot more likely to do maintenance.\n\n295\n00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,050\nNow that being said,\nCisco designs this stuff to last forever.\n\n296\n00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,560\nThis right here is\na 2600 series router and\n\n297\n00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,090\nit'll say on here somewhere\nthe date that we got it.\n\n298\n00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,040\n>> Usually in the yellow box.\n\n299\n00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,310\n>> 2002, this is an 11 year old router,\nthis thing's pretty ancient.\n\n300\n00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,390\nBut, it runs perfectly today,\nI could fire this up right now and\n\n301\n00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,380\nI know that it works.\n\n302\n00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,060\nSo, I know that that works.\n\n303\n00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,900\nThe 2800 series router I have\nbehind me is only a year old, so\n\n304\n00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,607\nit was bought last year,\nand it still runs.\n\n305\n00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:25,330\n[LAUGH] But it's not unusual to see a\nCisco router last seven years, ten years.\n\n306\n00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,340\nWay beyond the lifespan of a PC.\n\n307\n00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,670\n>> Yep.\n\n308\n00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,360\n>> Now one other thing before we actually,\nkind of get this going away here.\n\n309\n00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,620\nOkay?\nIs what we're about to also do.\n\n310\n00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,290\nNow I want to talk about this idea of\nthese ports just for a moment again.\n\n311\n00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,160\nSo we bring that back up here.\n\n312\n00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,940\nSo we talked about the idea\nof the networking and\n\n313\n00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,370\nwhat we can actually expand here.\n\n314\n00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,490\nAnd we also talked about these two,\noh no there's one fast ethernet port too.\n\n315\n00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,762\nWe're actually gonna get into\nexplaining these, right?\n\n316\n00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:51,235\nThe idea of actually\nthe management interfaces.\n\n317\n00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,435\nAnd that's where we're gonna focus in\non we start the idea configuration in\n\n318\n00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:55,437\njust a little bit here.\n\n319\n00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:56,877\nAbsolutely.\n\n320\n00:15:56,877 --> 00:16:00,646\nWe're gonna be starting on routers, but\na lot of what we talk about today it's\n\n321\n00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:04,200\nthe same on switches, the same on\nfirewalls, the same on access points.\n\n322\n00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,310\nSo Cisco does keep it consistent\nacross the different devices.\n\n323\n00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,740\nOh, I've got it backwards, I'm all about\nputting these things on backwards today.\n\n324\n00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,340\nSo I'll just let you handle it Ronnie.\n\n325\n00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna screw this thing up.\n\n326\n00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,890\nSo anyhow, in a normal Cisco device,\n\n327\n00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,250\nyou really shouldn't have\nto take it apart, right?\n\n328\n00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,900\nSo it really should run fine.\n\n329\n00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,610\nIf you get it under a Cisco Smartnet\nagreement, which is their warranty.\n\n330\n00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,450\nThen if something breaks\nyou just call it in.\n\n331\n00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,760\nAnd a lot of times they'll\nsend you a replacement unit.\n\n332\n00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,600\nAnd you just swap them out,\nsend the bad one back.\n\n333\n00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,000\nSo taking apart, not something\nthat you're normally gonna do.\n\n334\n00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,640\nBut I wanted to give you guys a chance\nto see kind of what's inside of there.\n\n335\n00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,400\nAnd maybe at the end of\nthe show when we're done,\n\n336\n00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,660\nmaybe we'll throw the 2800 up here and\nopen it up.\n\n337\n00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,952\nCuz this is a nice big one, and it'd be\nkinda cool for everybody to see that all\n\n338\n00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:52,036\nright, let me get these magnetic\nscrewdrivers away from my computer.\n\n339\n00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n340\n00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,420\nthen we'll jump into getting\nconnected to a new device.\n\n341\n00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,090\nAll right, so let's say, Ronnie,\n\n342\n00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,840\nthat I get a brand new Cisco router that\nshows up at the door, that's in its box.\n\n343\n00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,220\nI cut open the tape.\n\n344\n00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,640\nI take it out.\n\n345\n00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640\nWhat do I do now?\n\n346\n00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,430\n>> Well, when we actually get\nthe router that actually comes out,\n\n347\n00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,330\na lot of times you're gonna already\nhave installed on it the Cisco iOS.\n\n348\n00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,230\nAnd so what we need to do of\ncourse is we need to turn it on.\n\n349\n00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,300\nBut unlike an actual switch,\n\n350\n00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,110\nwhich we'll talk about later on here,\nthe router has to be configured first.\n\n351\n00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,370\nSo in other words, you can't just throw\nthe device into your network rack here,\n\n352\n00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,000\nplug a cable into it,\nand go, okay, I'm done.\n\n353\n00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,870\nI've done my particular job here.\n\n354\n00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,430\nWe need to begin with the idea of being\nable to configure this, and that means for\n\n355\n00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,380\nus to be able to connect to it.\n\n356\n00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,500\nSo the two ports that we're\ntalking about here, and\n\n357\n00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,140\nI can't remember what the name of the\nother one is, the one is a console port.\n\n358\n00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,030\nThe other one is the auxiliary.\n\n359\n00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,290\nAuxiliary port for us is what\nwe're actually about to get into.\n\n360\n00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,720\nOnce we actually get the device,\n\n361\n00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,160\nwe need to have a way to\nconnect into that device here.\n\n362\n00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,340\nSo when we talk about\nthe idea of connection.\n\n363\n00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,820\n>> Yup.\nWe got a couple of devices here\n\n364\n00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820\nand cables.\n\n365\n00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,460\n>> Yup.\nAnd it has actually kind of be this way,\n\n366\n00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,170\ndepending on the equipment that\nyou also have ready to go.\n\n367\n00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,060\nSo a lot of times,\nmost people are going to have a laptop.\n\n368\n00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,350\nSo here we've got a couple laptops for\nus here hooked up.\n\n369\n00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,720\nAnd usually,\nyou actually have to have a cable.\n\n370\n00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,770\nAnd the good thing is,\n\n371\n00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,530\nif it's brand new out of the Cisco box,\none of these is gonna come with it.\n\n372\n00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,800\nNow, this particular cable here it\nwhat is called a console cable, okay?\n\n373\n00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,159\nAnd this is a serial port cable,\na standard RS.\n\n374\n00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,190\nThis end is, an RS-232.\n\n375\n00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,210\nOkay, this is what we have.\n\n376\n00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,940\nAnd this light blue color is very\ndistinctive, maybe even proprietary for\n\n377\n00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,035\nall I know, okay?\n\n378\n00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For all I know.\n\n379\n00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,050\nAnd even though at one end, you have this\ncable, or this particular connector,\n\n380\n00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,840\nthat goes into a serial port on the back\nof your computer, you have this end that\n\n381\n00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,140\nlooks like an RJ-45 connector I'm trying\nto hold it up here so we can see it.\n\n382\n00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,160\n>> Hold it over the black disk here,\nit'll be easier to see.\n\n383\n00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,660\n>> Yep.\n\n384\n00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,800\nSo you have this RS two, oh,\nno, this is RJ-45 connector.\n\n385\n00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,806\nI was about to say RJ-11.\n\n386\n00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:12,530\nRJ-45 connector for\nus that goes into that console port, and\n\n387\n00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,340\nthis is what allows us to be able\nto do some initial configuration.\n\n388\n00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,230\nWithout needing to go through any\ntype of networking port at all, so\n\n389\n00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,910\nwe need to make sure that we have\none of these cables on hand.\n\n390\n00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,740\nIt's actually key here.\n\n391\n00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,640\n>> And it is a proprietary cable.\n\n392\n00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,990\nCisco uses these with all their equipment,\nand when I say all I literally mean all.\n\n393\n00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,940\nSo that older router that we had.\n\n394\n00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,740\nLet me throw this back on the screen.\n\n395\n00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,950\nSo this is that older\nrouter that I brought up.\n\n396\n00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,280\nYou can see a light blue port labeled.\n\n397\n00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000\nLight blue and it says console,\nthat's the port we'd use for\n\n398\n00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,080\ninitial configuration and we've got a few\nother devices here's a Cisco firewall.\n\n399\n00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,470\nYou can see right here again,\n\n400\n00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,460\na light blue port labeled console\n>> And\n\n401\n00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,640\nwho would've guessed that this\nwould also be the same way.\n\n402\n00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,950\n>> Here is a wireless access point\nfrom Cisco again, light blue console.\n\n403\n00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,640\nIt is extremely common across all\n\n404\n00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,960\nthe various Cisco equipment\nto have this light blue port.\n\n405\n00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,870\nThe switch and\nrouter behind me both have it too.\n\n406\n00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,150\nNow, there is a little variation.\n\n407\n00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,410\nSometimes it's on the front of the device,\nsometimes it's on the back of the device,\n\n408\n00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,680\nso you may have to look\naround a bit to find it.\n\n409\n00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,950\nAnd it just varies.\n\n410\n00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,430\n>> You know, the nice thing about\nCisco is that they've labeled it, and\n\n411\n00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,410\nthey've even painted that\nlittle light blue port,\n\n412\n00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,816\nwhich actually helps out so that you\ncan match the actual cable to that.\n\n413\n00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:28,340\nNow this particular cable again is not for\nsending data and it’s not for networking.\n\n414\n00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,380\nIt is for the sole purpose of\nmanaging the actual device or\n\n415\n00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,960\nbeing able to configure the device and\nat least the initial configuration.\n\n416\n00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,885\nSo we need a list this\nparticular cable here.\n\n417\n00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,825\nNow the other thing that you may need.\n\n418\n00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:41,505\nOkay?\n\n419\n00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:44,015\nLike my laptop there is\nno RS-232 port on it.\n\n420\n00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:47,435\nSo I don't have a serial port on the back.\n\n421\n00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:51,037\nSo at that point I need to\nactually have maybe a converter.\n\n422\n00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:51,677\n>> Okay.\n\n423\n00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:54,957\n>> So depending on your\nnetworking that you're doing,\n\n424\n00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,707\nif you're on a standard PC\nyou probably still have one.\n\n425\n00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:58,447\nBut you may not.\n\n426\n00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,487\nSo, here I have a relatively generic one.\n\n427\n00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:08,075\nAnd this allows me to\nconnect in the RS-232 port\n\n428\n00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:13,920\ninto my jack there, and I'm just gonna\nsnug it down to make sure its connected.\n\n429\n00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,200\nAnd then I would plug this into the back\nof my, or into a USB port on my laptop.\n\n430\n00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,110\nAnd once I get it plug in I have\nto make sure, of course, that\n\n431\n00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,770\nthe computer can recognize it, from that\npoint there I am now physically connected.\n\n432\n00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,945\nThat doesn't mean I'm done yet, okay?\n\n433\n00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:32,800\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I need to have some type of software\n\n434\n00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,430\nthat then allows me to be able\nto connect into the device.\n\n435\n00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,150\nNow, the software that I use is Putty.\n\n436\n00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,440\n>> Yep.\nPutty is pretty common.\n\n437\n00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n438\n00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,500\n>> So\nbefore we jump into the software though,\n\n439\n00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,890\nlet me just throw in a little\nmore about that cable.\n\n440\n00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,620\nThis is really becoming\nrequired because less and\n\n441\n00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,780\nless computers are coming\nwith a serial port on them.\n\n442\n00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,040\nThese adapters,\nthey used to be pretty expensive.\n\n443\n00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,140\nBut the prices dropped a lot, so\nyou can buy them on Newegg or Amazon or\n\n444\n00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,790\nplaces like that and you should pay\nin the $15 to $25 region, right?\n\n445\n00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,100\nAnd the reason I say that is you\ncan actually buy these from Cisco.\n\n446\n00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,521\nThey charge $175 for them.\n\n447\n00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:10,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can also buy them from\n\n448\n00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,070\nsome of the other network vendors\nthat are out there and stuff.\n\n449\n00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,220\nThey charge a lot of money,\nbut they're all the same.\n\n450\n00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,110\nOn the inside,\n\n451\n00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,440\nalmost every one of them has the same\nchip from a company called Prolific.\n\n452\n00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,889\n>> And so you can go and buy them for\n15 bucks and save a lot of money.\n\n454\n00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,960\nWhere do we get these, Ronnie?\n\n455\n00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,437\nI think I got these off of Newegg.\n\n456\n00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,550\n>> Yep\n>> When I ordered them.\n\n457\n00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,500\nBut anyhow, so you can get them\nin a number of different places.\n\n458\n00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,220\nThey're really handy to have,\nbecause it does give you that serial port.\n\n459\n00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,830\nAnd I just keep one screwed into my\nCisco console cable all the time.\n\n460\n00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,580\n>> Yep.\n\n461\n00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,360\nSo I have one with me.\n\n462\n00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,970\nI keep it in my bag just in case we do\nneed to configure something as well.\n\n463\n00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,430\nBut having these here is actually the key.\n\n464\n00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,925\nSo if you don't have this, good luck in\ngetting access into your Cisco device.\n\n465\n00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:51,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So without the console cable,\n\n466\n00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,670\nwithout you having a way of course to\nconnect to that RS-232 on your end,\n\n467\n00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,460\nin terms of laptop or a regular PC,\nwell, then you're gonna be out of luck.\n\n468\n00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460\n>> At least in the beginning, right?\n\n469\n00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, when we\n\n470\n00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,120\nfirst\n>> Right.\n\n471\n00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,270\n>> Get it out of the box,\nwe need that console cable to get it\n\n472\n00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,130\nset up\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n473\n00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,720\n>> But once we do the initial set up\non it, from there we can get we can\n\n474\n00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,280\nget it set up where we can Telnet or\nSSH, we can remote into the device, and\n\n475\n00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,270\nwe no longer need the console cable\n>> Yeah.\n\n476\n00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,360\n>> So we do just need it in the beginning\n>> Yeah.\n\n477\n00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,150\nA lot of times what ends up happening and\n\n478\n00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,810\nwhy we just want it in the beginning\nis relatively simple, right.\n\n479\n00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,630\nI'm going to take this out.\n\n480\n00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,320\nI'm probably going to go head and\nslam it into the rack.\n\n481\n00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,900\nI say slam it in.\n\n482\n00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,080\nScrew it into the rack, I should say.\n\n483\n00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,600\nWe're going to put it in the rack here.\n\n484\n00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,350\nAnd we're in this noisy, noisy closet so\nI want to configure just the bear minimal\n\n485\n00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,470\namount that I need to, and\nthen I want to plug a network cable in and\n\n486\n00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,309\ngo into a nice air conditioned office and\nbe able to kind of work at my leisure.\n\n487\n00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,940\n>> So once we got the cable hooked up,\n\n488\n00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,809\nthen we need some kind of software\nto actually display what's going on.\n\n489\n00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,449\nCisco does not make software that displays\nwhat's going on in with the equipment,\n\n490\n00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:52,443\nwhich is kinda funny.\n\n491\n00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:55,531\nBut the reason they don't is that many,\nmany other people do, and\n\n492\n00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:57,919\nthey make software that is\nbetter in a lot of cases.\n\n493\n00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,161\nSo they leave it up to you to use\nwhatever terminal software you want.\n\n494\n00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,054\nAnd that's what it called,\nterminal software.\n\n495\n00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:07,250\nTerminal software, is software's that\nable to communicate on a serial port.\n\n496\n00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,845\nAnd for years and years, Cisco\nrecommended a program called Tera Term,\n\n497\n00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:14,685\nwhich is no longer updated,\nit was abandoned years ago.\n\n498\n00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:17,945\nThey used to recommend Hyper Term,\nwhich was included in Windows 95 and\n\n499\n00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:21,785\n98, when did they drop that,\nWindows XP I think?\n\n500\n00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:24,645\n>> Yup.\n>> So that one hasn't been around for\n\n501\n00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:25,275\na while, you can go out and\n\n502\n00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:30,440\nbuy it if you want, but\nthe most popular one today is PuTTY.\n\n503\n00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,750\nIt's not open source,\nright, but it is free.\n\n504\n00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,920\nAnd so you can go and download it.\n\n505\n00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,630\nAnd let me just show you here in my\ncomputer the way I always find it.\n\n506\n00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,690\nI always just jump straight\ninto to good old Google.\n\n507\n00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,170\nAnd I do a search for PuTTY download.\n\n508\n00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,960\nAnd putty is P U T T Y it's\nactually a play on words.\n\n509\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,430\nT T Y is the teletype protocol and\nthat's actually what's being\n\n510\n00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,700\nused on this serial connection,\nit's a virtual teletype or a VTY, and so\n\n511\n00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,290\nwhen they called it putty, P U T T Y,\nthat's the joke they're trying to make.\n\n512\n00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,360\nAnd that's why you'll see the weird\ncapitalization when they write it,\n\n513\n00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,730\nthe lowercase U and\nthen capital TTY for teletype.\n\n514\n00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,540\nThe author is actually based out of\nEngland, and so that very first link that\n\n515\n00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,920\nI got right there, might look weird,\nbut that is the original site.\n\n516\n00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,490\nYou'll see other ones like putty.org.\n\n517\n00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,360\nThat's actually not the official site,\nand so it's a little misleading.\n\n518\n00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,380\nI'll go to this one up here.\n\n519\n00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,710\nYeah, that page has remained the same for\nyears.\n\n520\n00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,430\nEver since I've seen it,\nwhich is definitely at least ten years.\n\n521\n00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,490\nBasically you can go in here and\nyou can find PuTTY.\n\n522\n00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,250\nIf you are running Windows,\nthen they actually have an installer\n\n523\n00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,230\nin here somewhere, right down here, the\nPuTTY installer you can download and load.\n\n524\n00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,250\nThey have a couple of other ones.\n\n525\n00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,270\nThey really design for Windows though,\nso what if you're running OSX or Linux?\n\n526\n00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,500\nWhat do you do?\n\n527\n00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,150\nWell, if you're running Linux,\nLinux has microterm built into it, so\n\n528\n00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,510\nit's already got a terminal program.\n\n529\n00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,290\nYou can just fire that up, I don't\nknow if OS X has Micro Terminal on it.\n\n530\n00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,250\n>> Yeah, that I don't know.\n\n531\n00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:58,790\nYeah.\n>> But\n\n532\n00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,570\nyou can get other terminal\nsoftware out there.\n\n533\n00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,330\nThere's plenty of them.\n\n534\n00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,450\nJust anything that can\ncommunicate over a serial port.\n\n535\n00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,070\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the nice thing about PuTTY,\n\n536\n00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,910\nyou don't even have to install it, right?\n\n537\n00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,750\nYou can actually download just that exe,\nand it runs directly in RAM.\n\n538\n00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,960\nYeah.\n>> So if you don't want to install it,\n\n539\n00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,750\nyou don't have to.\n\n540\n00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,280\nYou just simply run it and\nthen it disappears.\n\n541\n00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,850\n>> But I usually install it, and\nthe reason is, we can use it as a serial\n\n542\n00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,470\ncommunications program, which you only\nneed on day one for a Cisco device.\n\n543\n00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,070\nBut after that,\nit also does Telnet and SSH.\n\n544\n00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n545\n00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,430\nSo you can use it for\nyour remote connections,\n\n546\n00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,900\nand SSH is the key part, right?\n\n547\n00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,560\n>> Yep.\n>> You want a secure client.\n\n548\n00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,370\nAgain, if you're running Linux,\nyou got it built in.\n\n549\n00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,990\nYou don't need a client.\n\n550\n00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,250\n>> Right.\n>> But in Windows,\n\n551\n00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,745\nthis is a really nice GUI\nthat you can fire up and use.\n\n552\n00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's ideal.\n\n553\n00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,140\n>> Yeah, good customization.\n\n554\n00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,620\nAllows you to be able to\nchange the font size,\n\n555\n00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,695\nwhich is important for people like me.\n\n556\n00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:43,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Since I can't see.\n\n557\n00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,420\nYep.\n>> Yep, now when you install PuTTY and\n\n558\n00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,390\nfire it up the first time, so\nI'm gonna launch PuTTY here.\n\n559\n00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,330\nWhen we fire up PuTTY,\nwe get a basic configuration screen, and\n\n560\n00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,660\nif you missed it there, just after I\ninstalled it in my little start screen,\n\n561\n00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660\nI get my PuTTY icon right here.\n\n562\n00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,000\nand when we run PuTTY,\n\n563\n00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,560\nwe get this screen, and there's not all\nthat much information that it needs.\n\n564\n00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,070\nBy default, it goes to SSH, and\nI can punch in an IP to connect to.\n\n565\n00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,300\nAll right.\n\n566\n00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,850\nBut, I'm connecting to my Cisco\nrouter via console port, so\n\n567\n00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,140\nI need to do a serial communication.\n\n568\n00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,300\nAnd when you do that,\nthe speed is going to change,\n\n569\n00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,590\nand it's going to list a com\nport instead of an IP address.\n\n570\n00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,830\n>> On that com port, it's important,\nespecially if you're doing this in Window,\n\n571\n00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,500\nto make sure you know what\nport they have now addressed,\n\n572\n00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,150\nespecially if you're using a converter.\n\n573\n00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,000\nOkay.\nSo if you use a converter like we\n\n574\n00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,720\ndid here, you need to make sure that\nyou find that pick report number.\n\n575\n00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,040\nAnd the easiest way to find that number?\n\n576\n00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,920\n>> Device manager.\n\n577\n00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,410\n>> Device manager,\nyeah that's where I'd go.\n\n578\n00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,160\n>> Wasn't sure if you\nwould know an easier way.\n\n579\n00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,140\n>> No, I don't have an easier way,\nI was just assuming that that was it.\n\n580\n00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,640\nSo easily go under device manager,\nlook under the COM Ports or\n\n581\n00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,290\nPorts, and\nthen whatever number that they list there,\n\n582\n00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,556\nhopefully that's gonna be the one\nserial port that you'll have.\n\n583\n00:27:56,556 --> 00:28:00,270\nIf your Comport is built into your system,\nit'll have a hard set number,\n\n584\n00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,810\nit'll always be Com 1 or Com 2, but\n\n585\n00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,800\nif you're using a USB adapter it changes\nall the time, it's super annoying.\n\n586\n00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,105\nSo we can go into our device manager and\nlet me just get in there.\n\n587\n00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:14,165\nAnd in the device manager,\nyou'll see ports.\n\n588\n00:28:14,165 --> 00:28:15,365\nAnd you can expand that out.\n\n589\n00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:17,915\nAnd I can see that mine\nended up on com four.\n\n590\n00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:18,875\nRight?\nSo, so\n\n591\n00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,562\nwhen I want to connect to my CISCO device,\nI need to chose com four.\n\n592\n00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:27,382\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just punch\nthat in here as COM4, all right?\n\n593\n00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:29,542\nNow, couple other things to remember.\n\n594\n00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,542\nThe author of PuTTY,\n\n595\n00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:34,822\nhe knows that most people are using\nthis to connect to Cisco equipment.\n\n596\n00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:37,632\nSo he's actually set it to\nuse all the Cisco defaults.\n\n597\n00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,082\nSo it's really ready to go.\n\n598\n00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:43,862\nBut if you use your own\nthird-party terminal software, or\n\n599\n00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:48,210\nwhatever, there's actually a few other\nsettings you might need to adjust.\n\n600\n00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,340\nAnd let me just kind of\nthrow those over here.\n\n601\n00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,891\nSo, the first one is the com port.\n\n602\n00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,600\nAnd you just set that for\nwhatever it is on your system.\n\n603\n00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,420\nWhatever it is that your com port is.\n\n604\n00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,380\nRight?\n\n605\n00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,070\nThen there's the speed.\n\n606\n00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,820\nThat needs to be 9600bp.\n\n607\n00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,000\nninety-six hundred bits per second, or\nBaud is what it's called in some software.\n\n608\n00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,580\nBut it needs to be 9,600, that's what\nCisco devices are set to by default.\n\n609\n00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,000\n>> And then we need Bits.\n\n610\n00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,180\nIs that next?\n\n611\n00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,230\n>> Next, we have three other\nvalues that we always do together.\n\n612\n00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,900\nSo I'm just going to pull\nthem up here on the screen.\n\n613\n00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,870\nI just went down to the serial\noption over here on the left.\n\n614\n00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,490\nAnd you'll see the other\nthree options we need to set.\n\n615\n00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:36,650\nWe've got Data Bits, and\nthen we've got the Stop Bits -1,\n\n616\n00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,980\nand we've got Parity right there.\n\n617\n00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,410\nNow, the order of these three can be\nlisted differently in different software.\n\n618\n00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,096\nA lot of people call this 9600bps 8-N-1.\n\n619\n00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:54,710\nAnd 8-N-1, they mean 8 data\nbits No parity, one stop bit.\n\n620\n00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,110\nSo, look for those options in your system.\n\n621\n00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,800\nAnd what that's basically saying is,\nwe need to send eight bits at a time.\n\n622\n00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,620\nAnd then every eight bits,\nwe need to send one stop bit.\n\n623\n00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,310\nAnd then the next eight bits and\na stop bit.\n\n624\n00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,610\nAnd the next eight and a stop bit.\n\n625\n00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,510\nAnd so on.\n\n626\n00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,390\nAnd then there is no error\ncorrection going on, no parity,\n\n627\n00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,620\nits just disabled on\nCisco devices by default.\n\n628\n00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,900\nSo, these are the default settings,\n\n629\n00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,350\nif you use other terminal software\nyou have to set it yourself.\n\n630\n00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,206\nWith PuTTY it's already there and\nconfigured.\n\n631\n00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,890\n>> So this is the most common for us, so\n\n632\n00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,100\nthat's what we are going to end up\nusing the majority of the times.\n\n633\n00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,980\nSo as we go back into PuTTY now,\nand we start taking a look.\n\n634\n00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,590\nWhat we now need of course is,\nafter we have our software ready,\n\n635\n00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,760\nand we have our cables ready,\nwe would then take the console port, and\n\n636\n00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,810\nwe plug it into the console\nport of the device itself.\n\n637\n00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,550\nNow, I don't know if it really matters or\n\n638\n00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,910\nnot Don, do I need to have the device off\nor on, or can I just plug it in anytime?\n\n639\n00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,020\n>> You can plug it in whenever you want.\n\n640\n00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,230\nIf you want to watch it boot up,\n\n641\n00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,370\nthen you want to turn the device off while\nyou plug in, and then you can power it on.\n\n642\n00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,480\nBut you can plug in at any time.\n\n643\n00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,450\nIf you plug in after it's already on,\n\n644\n00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,535\nthen you may need to hit Enter\na few times to get a prompt.\n\n645\n00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:04,095\nBut otherwise it'll be fine so.\n\n646\n00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,285\nRonnie, we are right up on our break here.\n\n647\n00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,745\nSo let's do this.\n\n648\n00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:09,805\nWe talked about our settings for Putty.\n\n649\n00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:12,065\nLet's stop here and take a break,\nand when we get back,\n\n650\n00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:15,045\nwe'll actually fire up the router, and\nconnect to it and get a chance to see.\n\n651\n00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:18,090\nSo can you think of anything else\nto throw out here before the break?\n\n652\n00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,320\n>> Nope.\nLet's go ahead and continue, and\n\n653\n00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,540\nthen we'll be ready to get into\nthe exciting world of console, or\n\n654\n00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,520\ncommand line interface here.\n\n655\n00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,100\n>> Awesome.\n\n656\n00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,890\nAll right, let's stop here.\n\n657\n00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,725\nWe'll see you guys back in a few minutes.\n\n658\n00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:36,058\n[MUSIC]\n\n659\n00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:37,760\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n660\n00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,788\nSo before the break we\nwere talking about the,\n\n661\n00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:42,401\nwell during the break we were\ntalking about Power Rangers.\n\n662\n00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:47,251\n[LAUGH] But before the break,\nwe were talking about stuff, right?\n\n663\n00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:48,346\nPuTTY.\n\n664\n00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:50,673\n[LAUGH] Gotta get-\n>> Right before the actual, yeah.\n\n665\n00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,263\n>> Stop, no, no more Power Rangers.\n\n666\n00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:56,551\n>> Yep, right before the actual break\nhere, We had talked about what we need to\n\n667\n00:31:56,551 --> 00:32:00,150\ndo to be able to connect to\na national router or switch.\n\n668\n00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,340\nSo we've talked about the cables that we\nneed and also of course the device itself.\n\n669\n00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,210\nAnd then we were talking\nabout the software.\n\n670\n00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which was for us funny.\n\n671\n00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,810\nAnd so for us now, we've got it\nconfigured and we're ready to go.\n\n672\n00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,102\nSo at this point Don,\nwhat do we do next here?\n\n673\n00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,500\n>> All right let's jump over to\nmy computer for a second here.\n\n674\n00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,730\nI'm gonna minimize these requirements.\n\n675\n00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,940\nSo I've got Putty fired up.\n\n676\n00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,070\nAnd I've got it set for COM port 4 cuz\nthat's what my USB adapter is connect on.\n\n677\n00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,350\nI've got is set for a serial\nconnection and the speed is 9,600.\n\n678\n00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,120\nSo I'm ready to go.\n\n679\n00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,370\nI'm going to hit Open.\n\n680\n00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,180\n>> Oh, that's exciting.\n\n681\n00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,680\n>> And there we are.\n\n682\n00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680\n>> Nice.\n>> So it's not very exciting.\n\n683\n00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,230\nThe main reason it's not very exciting\nis the fact that router is turned off.\n\n684\n00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,270\nSo I probably need to turn that router on.\n\n685\n00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,360\nNow, you might ask yourself, Don come on\nyou knew you were gonna use your router,\n\n686\n00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,350\nwhy didn't you turn it on.\n\n687\n00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,480\nAnd the reason I didn't turn them on is\nbecause I wanted you guys to see the boot\n\n688\n00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,150\nprocess that we go through.\n\n689\n00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,220\nEarlier Ronnie mentioned the Cisco IOS.\n\n690\n00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,800\nAnd were not talking about\nthe iPhone operating system here.\n\n691\n00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,890\nWe're talking about the Cisco Internet\nOperating System, the IOS, right?\n\n692\n00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,830\nWhich it's been known as the IOS for\nover 20 years, and\n\n693\n00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,120\nwhen Apple created their phone, they\nactually had to license that from Cisco.\n\n694\n00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,960\nSo every time you buy an iPhone, you're\nactually paying a little bit to Cisco,\n\n695\n00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,000\nnot for technology, just for the name.\n\n696\n00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,660\nBut anyhow, so I wanted to show you guys\nthat process, so the system is turned off.\n\n697\n00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,710\nI've got my USB adapter connected, and\nmy console cable plugged into that.\n\n698\n00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,600\nIt then runs all the way around\ndown to this router behind me here,\n\n699\n00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,060\nwhich is kinda a big router, and\nI'm gonna power it on right now.\n\n700\n00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,300\nCisco routers usually have an on\noff switch on the front of them.\n\n701\n00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,080\nCisco switches usually don't.\n\n702\n00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,742\n>> And the routers are generally noisy so\n\n703\n00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:41,444\nif you do hear something\nin the background,\n\n704\n00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:43,238\nthat's what you're actually hearing here.\n\n705\n00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:46,100\nSo you're beginning to see\nthe actual start up process now.\n\n706\n00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,339\n>> This one's a little noisier than\nmost because it's one of the bigger,\n\n707\n00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:49,024\nhigher end routers.\n\n708\n00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:52,000\n>> It'll be noisy now.\n\n709\n00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,930\nAfter the boot process goes through,\nthe fans will slow it down a bit.\n\n710\n00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,480\nBut for the first little bit here,\n\n711\n00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,960\nyou guys will probably\nhear these fans behind me.\n\n712\n00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,140\n>> So just like in any particular device\nthat we start up that's computing,\n\n713\n00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,320\nit's running through post.\n\n714\n00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,970\nSo we're actually getting in that process\nwhere it's checking the hardware and\n\n715\n00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,360\nthe components, verifying that\neverything is actually ready to run.\n\n716\n00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,390\nAnd right now, it is just waiting on\nthe ROMMON getting initialized here.\n\n717\n00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,290\nTo begin the rest of\nthe process to boot up.\n\n718\n00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,400\n>> So the first thing we see,\nis the system bootstrap.\n\n719\n00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,860\nAnd on a Cisco router,\nthat's like the BIOS, okay?\n\n720\n00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,220\nSo that's like the BIOS\nof the router kicking in.\n\n721\n00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,630\nNow notice how it says Copyright 2005.\n\n722\n00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,090\nThe BIOS on these, the bootstrap,\nis usually not upgradable.\n\n723\n00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,350\nSo when you buy the hardware, it's on\nthere Cisco does not update it very often.\n\n724\n00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,405\nSo I mentioned this router\nwas purchased last year.\n\n725\n00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:42,080\nWell, it shipped with a BIOS on it\nthat was already six years old.\n\n726\n00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,510\nBut that's fine because we don't run\nthe BIOS, it's just in the initial boot.\n\n727\n00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,240\nThen we can see it checking the memory.\n\n728\n00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,420\nThis system has 256 megabits of RAM.\n\n729\n00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:58,083\nNow, it shows as 262,144,\nbut it is a 256 meg stick.\n\n730\n00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:01,813\nThat's tied to the little extra\nbits of memory that you get,\n\n731\n00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:06,069\ncuz 1 meg is actually 1,024 kilobytes and\nall that good stuff.\n\n732\n00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,410\n>> And then when you actually add it up,\nthat's what it comes out to be.\n\n733\n00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,360\n>> Yep.\n\n734\n00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,080\nAnd so it's going to turn along\nthe ROMMON is a recovery system.\n\n735\n00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,300\nIt stands for the ROM monitor.\n\n736\n00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,430\nROM is read only memory monitor.\n\n737\n00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,070\nAnd if you ever have a problem where\nyour operating system gets corrupted,\n\n738\n00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,660\nwell the ROMMON is what will save the day.\n\n739\n00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,490\nIt's a little command interface that you\ncan get into and try to rescue the system.\n\n740\n00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,420\n>> And then at this point it's going to\nlook for something to boot up into and\n\n741\n00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,740\nthat's what you're seeing right there.\n\n742\n00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,610\nThe bunch of little today\nwe call them hashmarks but\n\n743\n00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,200\nwe used tp call them pound signs.\n\n744\n00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,140\nWhat you're actually seeing is\nthe expansion of the operating system\n\n745\n00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,340\ngetting loaded in the RAM at this point.\n\n746\n00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> And is beginning to load up there.\n\n747\n00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,040\n>> Those fans just got quiet.\n\n748\n00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,720\n>> Yeah, nice.\n\n749\n00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,310\n>> Now, unlike Windows, or Linux, or OSX,\n\n750\n00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,000\nwhere the operating system is hundreds\nof thousands of files on the hard drive,\n\n751\n00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,690\non a Cisco router,\nthe operating system is one file.\n\n752\n00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,200\n>> One file.\n\n753\n00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,740\n>> One single file stored right\non the flash of the device.\n\n754\n00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,110\nBut that file was compressed it's actually\nzipped up with just regular old zip.\n\n755\n00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,990\nAnd so when you saw those hash\nmarks going across the screen or\n\n756\n00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,070\npound signs whatever we want to call them.\n\n757\n00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,160\nWhen those were coming up\nthat was it unzipping or\n\n758\n00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720\ndecompressing that\noperating system into RAM.\n\n759\n00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,240\nSo it's reading it from flash and\nloading it into RAM.\n\n760\n00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,070\nBecause it's decompressed\nin RAM it will run faster.\n\n761\n00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,330\nAnd on a router that means you're\ngoing to need more RAM than flash and\n\n762\n00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,720\nthat's almost always the case.\n\n763\n00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,480\nYou might have a gig of RAM and\nonly 256 megs of flash.\n\n764\n00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,720\nThat's a pretty common\nconfiguration today.\n\n765\n00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,340\n>> Yep.\n\n766\n00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,020\nSo as it actually boots up, you start\nseeing things might be restricted\n\n767\n00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,320\nrights legend and\nsome of the stuff they're telling you,\n\n768\n00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,280\nyou shouldn't be duplicating this,\nand how it's prohibited.\n\n769\n00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,380\nAnd then down at the bottom of\nthe screen is where you get specific.\n\n770\n00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,940\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n771\n00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,500\nWe start actually seeing\nthe IOS is running here.\n\n772\n00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,560\nSo you see that it detects\nthe actual device model number here.\n\n773\n00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,220\nThe 2800 software and\nthis is what it's gonna be.\n\n774\n00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,040\nAnd then you begin to see that\nthe IOS is actually specific for\n\n775\n00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,301\nthat particular model.\n\n776\n00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:56,801\nRight?\n>> Yep.\n\n777\n00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:57,630\n>> That's where we see that.\n\n778\n00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,040\n>> And look at this one, Ronnie,\nthis one's running IOS 12.4, release 22.\n\n779\n00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,453\n>> Yep.\n>> Let me scroll back up, IOS 12.4,\n\n780\n00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:05,380\nrelease 22.\n\n781\n00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,250\n>> Yep.\n>> And I can see here,\n\n782\n00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,040\nit was compiled June 19, 2009.\n\n783\n00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,210\n>> There you go.\n\n784\n00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,335\n>> That's actually\na pretty old IOS on there.\n\n785\n00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:11,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n786\n00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,710\n>> So we need to upgrade this one.\n\n787\n00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,555\nIf we time at the end of the show,\nwe'll upgrade it.\n\n788\n00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:15,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n789\n00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,950\n>> If not, we'll do it in the next show.\n\n790\n00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,130\nSo we'll upgrade this guy\nto the latest and greatest.\n\n791\n00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,890\n>> Yep.\n\n792\n00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,730\nSo once that's actually done, and\neverything is now running inside of RAM,\n\n793\n00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,980\nyou're actually starting to see some\nother things coming up here, too.\n\n794\n00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,460\nSo remember that a lot of times when\nit comes out of the box from Cisco,\n\n795\n00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,350\nthey've already installed the actual\nIOS onto the flash itself.\n\n796\n00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,374\nSo sometimes you might even get a disk\nthat comes along with a copy of\n\n797\n00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:37,540\nthe IOS as well.\n\n798\n00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,330\nBut usually it's actually\ninstalled on there for you and\n\n799\n00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,770\nit's actually ready in there.\n\n800\n00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,160\nAnd so next you start seeing\nthe hardware that is on the device.\n\n801\n00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,880\nSo you actually see where it\nsays system image archive.\n\n802\n00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,060\nIt was installed.\n\n803\n00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060\nAnd notice the processor.\n\n804\n00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,110\nAnd it tells you the ports\nthat it actually sees.\n\n805\n00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,140\nAnd it even has a cellular interface.\n\n806\n00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,180\nThat's actually a new one for me.\n\n807\n00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,110\nI haven't seen that one.\n\n808\n00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,530\n>> Yeah, this router actually\nbelongs to our GM here and\n\n809\n00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,260\nhe stuck in a whole bunch\nof crazy stuff on it.\n\n810\n00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,380\nSo, the 2800 series routers,\nthey have two gigabit ports built in.\n\n811\n00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,530\nSo I see that right here,\ntwo gigabit Ethernet interfaces.\n\n812\n00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,090\nAnd then there's things that we've added.\n\n813\n00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,320\nSo we added a serial WIC that's on there.\n\n814\n00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,840\nAnd that's used for connecting to a T1,\nor frame relay line.\n\n815\n00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,870\nThere's one terminal line, which is\nused for like connecting to a modem.\n\n816\n00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,030\nThere is a VPN module-\n>> Nice.\n\n817\n00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,140\n>> So it's got a VPN accelerator in it.\n\n818\n00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,960\n>> Voice.\n>> It has two voice FSX interfaces,\n\n819\n00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,100\nthose are phone jacks.\n\n820\n00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,960\nSo this one has the voice module in it, so\nit can actually do voice communication.\n\n821\n00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,970\nSo that's what you plug your handset into.\n\n822\n00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,470\nAnd then lastly,\nit's got a cellular interface.\n\n823\n00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,510\nThat means that it can\njump onto GSM networks,\n\n824\n00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,840\nreplacing cellular calls or\ncellular data communication.\n\n825\n00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,100\nSo pretty neat feature set to have.\n\n826\n00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,700\n>> Yep.\nAnd then you see the RAM there that says\n\n827\n00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,300\nthe nonvolatile,\nNVRAM is what we see right there.\n\n828\n00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,090\nAnd that's normally where we will store\nour next configuration files once\n\n829\n00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,210\nwe make them.\n\n830\n00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,810\nAnd then that's where you see\nthe actual flash as well.\n\n831\n00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,061\nSo this one is, that 64K?\n\n832\n00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:09,733\nIs that what I see?\n\n833\n00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,180\n>> It's 64 megs.\n>> 64 megs, sorry.\n\n834\n00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,096\n64 megs there on the compact flash.\n\n835\n00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:17,060\nAnd we didn't really talk about\nthe idea of the compact flash.\n\n836\n00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,630\nIs that different from the regular flash?\n\n837\n00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,060\n>> It depends on the router right?\n\n838\n00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,125\nOn this particular router,\nthat is the flash.\n\n839\n00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,110\n>> Okay.\n\n840\n00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,610\n>> Some routers will have removable flash,\nthe higher ends do.\n\n841\n00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,440\nAnd it'll be a compact flash card\nthat you can pop out and pop back in.\n\n842\n00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,790\nIt's just a little card.\n\n843\n00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,675\nThis router, well it's on now,\nso I don't wanna take it out.\n\n844\n00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it is just a little flash card.\n\n845\n00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,024\nIt's standard compact flash.\n\n846\n00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,385\nAnd so some routers have that.\n\n847\n00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,916\nThat's nice because it's\nreally easy to upgrade.\n\n848\n00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,062\nOther routers like that 2600 we had,\n\n849\n00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:50,000\nthe flash was actually chips on the\nmotherboard so a different story there.\n\n850\n00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,430\nIt all shows up pretty much the same\nInstead of saying ATA Compact Flash,\n\n851\n00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,970\non a router where it's built in,\nit would just say flash, read/write.\n\n852\n00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,270\nSo this one has 64 megs\nof compact flash and\n\n853\n00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,680\nthat's where our IOS is stored and\nother files might be stored.\n\n854\n00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,509\nThis one also has NVRAM,\nthe non volatile RAM.\n\n855\n00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:12,610\nIt's got about 256 K of it.\n\n856\n00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,470\nIt shows 239.\n\n857\n00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,990\nThat's where our configuration is stored.\n\n858\n00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,649\nAnd your configuration is just a text file\nthat has a list of all the commands you\n\n859\n00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:23,800\nneed to run to get the system configured\nthe way that you had it before, right.\n\n860\n00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,830\nAnd that may not sound like a whole lot,\n239K, but it's just a text file.\n\n861\n00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:34,680\nAnd 239K is a lot of text so\nit is really plenty of room.\n\n862\n00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,880\n>> So once everything is settled down, you\nshould hear the fans kinda kick down, and\n\n863\n00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,640\nthen we'll come to this particular screen\nif there is no previous startup config.\n\n864\n00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,650\nSo in other words, if we have not\nconfigured this router before,\n\n865\n00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,355\nthis is what we would\nactually end up seeing here.\n\n866\n00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:51,980\nAnd the system configuration\ndialogue on this particular line,\n\n867\n00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,900\nit's gonna ask us if we want to walk\nthrough, essentially, a wizard, okay?\n\n868\n00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,700\nIt's gonna say, hey, I can take you\nthrough this and guide you through this.\n\n869\n00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,890\nNow why would I actually do that?\n\n870\n00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,960\nWell, I may not be experienced at the\ncommands that I need to actually put in.\n\n871\n00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,770\nSo being able to answer simple questions.\n\n872\n00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,392\nAnd then it actually build the commands\nand allows me to load them at the end,\n\n873\n00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:10,530\nmay be a way for me to go.\n\n874\n00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,857\nSo good for someone like a network admin\nthat may not be familiar with the Cisco\n\n875\n00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:14,430\nequipment.\n\n876\n00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,596\nBut because you're\nactually becoming CCEMT's,\n\n877\n00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:19,730\nthis is something you're actually going\nto have to bypass a lot of times.\n\n878\n00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,435\n>> So for the exam, they want you to\nknow that the system configuration\n\n879\n00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:27,010\ndialogue exists, that there is\na wizard for configuring it, but\n\n880\n00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,640\non the exam they're not\ngonna let you use this.\n\n881\n00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,640\nYou're gonna have to do your configuration\nby hand, you know all the various things,\n\n882\n00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,990\nyou gotta do it on your own.\n\n883\n00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,365\nBut, you may see a question\nasking about this and\n\n884\n00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:40,590\nthey'll usually center around things\nlike when would you see it, right?\n\n885\n00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,939\nAnd like Ronnie said,\nwhen it's brand new, out of the box,\n\n886\n00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:44,940\nyou'll see it launch into this wizard.\n\n887\n00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,260\nYou may also see it if somebody\nhas erased the NVRAM, right?\n\n888\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,740\nAnd you'll see it then, or\nif the NVRAM has become damaged somehow.\n\n889\n00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,500\n>> So for us in the process here,\n\n890\n00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,240\nremember it really boots up just\nlike a regular computer does.\n\n891\n00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,390\nIt starts off with post it goes and\nchecks everything and\n\n892\n00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,130\nmakes sure everything is done here.\n\n893\n00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,030\nThen it looks for\nsomething to boot up into,\n\n894\n00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,580\nonce it finds that we're ready to boot up.\n\n895\n00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,680\nThen it looks and sees if there is aLready\nsome type of configuration on there,\n\n896\n00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,526\nif there is it will load\nup that configuration.\n\n897\n00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:19,420\nBut if not, we actually get this, is\nwhat we have here at the very beginning.\n\n898\n00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420\nSo we'll probably get in to\nthat a little bit later on.\n\n899\n00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,910\n>> And I know you guys won't be\nable to use this on the exam, but\n\n900\n00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,660\nlet me show you the wizard,\ncuz a lot of people have never seen it.\n\n901\n00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,620\nSo let's just kinda walk through it\nreal quick, to get an example of it.\n\n902\n00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,800\nI was gonna say yes here to enter\nthe initial configuration dialogue, and\n\n903\n00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,050\nit's gonna ask us a few things\nabout our configuration.\n\n904\n00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,330\nSo the first one here is saying,\ndo we wanna go ahead and\n\n905\n00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,090\nenter a basic management setup?\n\n906\n00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,945\nIn other words do,\nwe wanna set it up to be able to telnet or\n\n907\n00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:46,420\nSSH into the system and\nhave basic network communications?\n\n908\n00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,780\nSo I am going to say yes to that.\n\n909\n00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,340\n>> Now as Don is typing this in,\nsome of the things you may wanna\n\n910\n00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,230\nalso notices here, is that when\nyou see those square brackets,\n\n911\n00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,970\nif there is only one word there,\nthat means it's a default.\n\n912\n00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,110\nWe don't have to actually enter anything,\n\n913\n00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,380\nwe just have to press Enter and\nwe're ready.\n\n914\n00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,530\nBut if you have two, like yes/no,\nyou have to type something in.\n\n915\n00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n916\n00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n917\n00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,900\n>> Yep.\nSo I'll punch that in.\n\n918\n00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,570\nSo it's asking for a host name.\n\n919\n00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,260\nThis is gonna be the name\nwe give the router.\n\n920\n00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,340\nIt's purely a aesthetic setting.\n\n921\n00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,310\nAnd your end users will never see it,\njust us as the admins will see it.\n\n922\n00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,449\nSo you can call it whatever you want.\n\n923\n00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,940\nI might call it the ITPROTV-RTR.\n\n924\n00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,020\nRight?\nBut you could call it whatever you wanted,\n\n925\n00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,750\nand I did all caps, but\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n926\n00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,400\nSo I'll give it that name.\n\n927\n00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,440\nNow it's asking for a password.\n\n928\n00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,460\nIf somebody wants to gain\nadministrative access to the system,\n\n929\n00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,460\nthey're gonna have to punch in a password.\n\n930\n00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,390\nSo maybe I'll set that to itprotv.\n\n931\n00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,010\n>> Super secure, absolutely, yes.\n\n932\n00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,351\n>> And let's see,\nthat was the enable secret, now it's, oh,\n\n933\n00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:48,830\nactually is it just asking me to\ntype it again, what is it doing?\n\n934\n00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,275\n>> Now it's asking, your first one was\nthe enable secret, this one's just for\n\n935\n00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:51,810\nyour password.\n\n936\n00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,090\n>> Oh, now it's the enable password.\n\n937\n00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,340\nGood question to hear,\nsomething that could show up on the exam.\n\n938\n00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,530\nThese two look like\nthey're almost the same.\n\n939\n00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:04,800\nWe have what's called a enable secret, and\nwe have what's called an enable password.\n\n940\n00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,860\nNow, they're both invoked when you try and\ngain administrative access to the system.\n\n941\n00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,790\nSo if you wanna gain administrative\naccess, it's gonna prompt you for\n\n942\n00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,780\na password.\n\n943\n00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,830\nAnd either one of these will do,\nso what's the difference?\n\n944\n00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,140\n>> Yeah, when we talk about\nthe idea of the difference here,\n\n945\n00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,020\nthe enable password for\nus is gonna be stored in plain text.\n\n946\n00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,810\nSo that means if you take\na look at the configuration,\n\n947\n00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,570\nwhen we use that command to show\nyou how the configuration looks,\n\n948\n00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,290\nyou'll actually be able to\nread whatever the password is.\n\n949\n00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,550\nWhen you actually put in\nthe enable secret here.\n\n950\n00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,270\nThat means that the password's\ngonna be stored in a hidden way.\n\n951\n00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,910\nSo in other words, you'll see a password,\n\n952\n00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,320\nbut it'll actually be\na hash of a password.\n\n953\n00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,780\nSo you can't take the hash and\n\n954\n00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,580\nreverse engineer it to get\nthe real password out of it.\n\n955\n00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,410\nYou have to actually have the real\npassword so it can match the hash.\n\n956\n00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,240\n>> And for those of you that are out\nthere that are cryptologists,\n\n957\n00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,970\nit's just an MD5 hash.\n\n958\n00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,520\nAnd so it's non-reversable encryption.\n\n959\n00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,270\nIt's very secure.\n\n960\n00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,910\nSo I could punch in and enable password.\n\n961\n00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,470\nI wonder if it'll let me leave that out?\n\n962\n00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,000\nNo, it's gonna make me put one in, so\nlet's see if it'll take the same one.\n\n963\n00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,560\nProbably not.\n\n964\n00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,920\nNo, no, all right.\n\n965\n00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680\nSo we'll just do good old Cisco123.\n\n966\n00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,210\n>> Yep.\nOnce again,\n\n967\n00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,610\nanother super secure password for us here.\n\n968\n00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,700\nOh, now it's asking us about the id\nof the virtual terminal password.\n\n969\n00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,270\nNow, when we talk about the id of\nthe virtual terminal, this is for\n\n970\n00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,850\nus to be able to access the router\nfrom a network jack, okay.\n\n971\n00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,450\nSo in other words,\nI'm sitting across the network,\n\n972\n00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,590\nI want to be able to get\naccess into the device.\n\n973\n00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,720\nI'm not directly plugged\ninto the console port.\n\n974\n00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,980\nI don't have any other way in,\nI have to go through a network connection.\n\n975\n00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,740\nThis is what we're gonna use here instead.\n\n976\n00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,330\nSo we also need a password here.\n\n977\n00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,230\n>> So when we use Telnet or SSH this is\nthe password we're going to be using and\n\n978\n00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,340\nso I'll just punch in, well just use\nitprotv for that one, there you go.\n\n979\n00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,470\nAnd then it's asking if we wanna do SNMP,\nsimple network management protocol.\n\n980\n00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,205\nYou might have software like\nSolarWinds Network Monitor or\n\n981\n00:45:52,205 --> 00:45:55,520\nOrion Network Monitor,\nwhatever they call it these days.\n\n982\n00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:03,080\nYou might have WhatsUp Gold or\nMicrosoft System Center, I don't remember.\n\n983\n00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,064\nShoot, what is it.\nSystems Center Operations Manager,\n\n984\n00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:04,650\nthat's the one, there we go.\n\n985\n00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,960\n>> Spiceworks or whatever.\n\n986\n00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,630\n>> Spiceworks, yeah.\n\n987\n00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,400\nAny of those software programs\nthat are out there that can\n\n988\n00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,210\nmonitor your performance or\n\n989\n00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,970\nyour systems, they use SNMP,\nif we want to configure that now we could.\n\n990\n00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,690\nI'm gonna say no.\n\n991\n00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,230\n>> So notice that even though it defaults\nto yes, we can actually change that, and\n\n992\n00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,620\nactually say no here, as well.\n\n993\n00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,998\nSo that's actually good.\n\n994\n00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:23,890\nAnd now we're seeing the actual\ncurrent summary here,\n\n995\n00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:28,190\nabout the interfaces that are actually\neither up, or enabled, or down here.\n\n996\n00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,695\nSo notice there's the two gigabit\ninterfaces, as well as the serial, and\n\n997\n00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:34,398\nthe cellular interface\nright there as well.\n\n998\n00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:38,680\nAnd that actually shows that we haven't\nassigned any particular IP address, and\n\n999\n00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,220\nwhether it's actually up.\n\n1000\n00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,050\nProtocols down.\n\n1001\n00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,450\nWe'll talk about that\na little later on too.\n\n1002\n00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:47,170\n>> Yep, so I'm just going to pick\nan interface to use as my management\n\n1003\n00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,430\ninterface to assign an IP address to.\n\n1004\n00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,120\nI'll use the first one,\ngigabit ethenet 0/0.\n\n1005\n00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,590\nThat's that first port.\n\n1006\n00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,880\nAnd it's going to ask if\nwe want to configure IP.\n\n1007\n00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,830\nNow yes is the\n>> Default.\n\n1008\n00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,340\nDefault, it's in the brackets, so\nI can just press Enter and it'll say yes.\n\n1009\n00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,130\nAnd I can punch in an IP address for it.\n\n1010\n00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,260\nAnd a subnet mask.\n\n1011\n00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,720\nNow it saw that I typed\nin a Class C address, so\n\n1012\n00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,410\nit's defaulting to a Class C subnet.\n\n1013\n00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,350\nI'll take that.\n\n1014\n00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,690\nAnd then there's my summary configuration.\n\n1015\n00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,820\n>> And notice that the configuration\nisn't entered as we type it in.\n\n1016\n00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,920\nWhat it does is it takes all\nthose configurations that we made\n\n1017\n00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,450\npreviously inside of this wizard,\nand then it lists it out for us,\n\n1018\n00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,340\nessentially holding inside of RAM.\n\n1019\n00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,920\nAnd then at the end,\nit gives us options here, okay?\n\n1020\n00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,650\nI would pay attention to these options.\n\n1021\n00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,480\nEvery once in a while you\ndo see things like this.\n\n1022\n00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,290\n>> Yep.\n\n1023\n00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,848\nYeah, and it's just asking whether we\nwanna save or discard the changes.\n\n1024\n00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:41,132\nSo if everything's set the way we want,\nwe choose number two, it saves it, and\n\n1025\n00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:42,173\nnow we're in business.\n\n1026\n00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:44,626\nIt's applied enough of a configuration for\n\n1027\n00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:49,211\nus to then go to our computer and remotely\nconnect into this device and get to work.\n\n1028\n00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:50,280\n>> There you go.\n>> All right.\n\n1029\n00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,966\n>> Yep.\nBut,\n\n1030\n00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:53,224\nit's important that you\nknow this wizard exists.\n\n1031\n00:47:53,224 --> 00:47:53,967\n>> Right.\n\n1032\n00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:56,019\n>> And on the exam, they may ask\nyou about whether it exists, but\n\n1033\n00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:57,220\nyou're not allowed to use this\n>> Right.\n\n1034\n00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,590\n>> On the exam.\n\n1035\n00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,290\nSo we need to do things the hard way.\n\n1036\n00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,310\nSo I'm gonna say zero on here,\nwhich is going to basically\n\n1037\n00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,150\ndiscard everything we just did\n>> Right\n\n1038\n00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,210\n>> So I'll do that.\n\n1039\n00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,040\n>> And there you go.\n\n1040\n00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,390\nOnce you see where it says\npress return to get started,\n\n1041\n00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,610\nit means now you're going to get\nlaunched into the command prompt here.\n\n1042\n00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,430\nSo you're starting to see some\nother information again now,\n\n1043\n00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,470\nas it's starting to turn on\ndifferent things and run through.\n\n1044\n00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,050\nWe are now getting a whole bunch\nof messages on our screen.\n\n1045\n00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,240\n>> Yeah, these are really\ncorresponding to your interfaces.\n\n1046\n00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,790\n>> Right.\n>> I don't have any cables\n\n1047\n00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,910\nplugged into the router, so it's\nbringing a lot of these interfaces up,\n\n1048\n00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,660\nrealizing that there's nothing plugged\nin and then taking them back down again.\n\n1049\n00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,530\nSo you'll see a lot of things do that\nwhere they go up and then down, and so on.\n\n1050\n00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,280\nIt usually takes just a second for\nit all to settle down, and once it's done,\n\n1051\n00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,260\nyou can just press Enter a couple of\ntimes and you'll get your prompt.\n\n1052\n00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,150\n>> Yep.\nAnd so\n\n1053\n00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,660\nyou actually see a lot of information\nflash across the screen, and\n\n1054\n00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,090\nwe'll talk about again how to configure it\na little bit later on to take care of that\n\n1055\n00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,070\nwhen we need to, all right?\n\n1056\n00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,750\n>> All right, now when you first get\ninto a Cisco router,or a switch,\n\n1057\n00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,740\nyou're gonna see a simple prompt like the\none that I've got on the screen right now.\n\n1058\n00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,860\nThe name is gonna default\nto either router or switch.\n\n1059\n00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,380\nOn a router it defaults to router,\nand on a switch it defaults to switch.\n\n1060\n00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,330\nSo that's what we're seeing here.\n\n1061\n00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,720\n>> And along with that name,\nwhich is going to be very important for\n\n1062\n00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,520\nus as well, is to pay attention to\nthe symbol that follows that name too.\n\n1063\n00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,140\nSo the symbol we have here\nis the greater than symbol.\n\n1064\n00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,990\nI don't know.\nIs there a technical term for\n\n1065\n00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,930\nthat in Cisco that I know of?\n\n1066\n00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,840\n>> I call it the greater than symbol.\n\n1067\n00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,790\n>> The greater than symbol.\n\n1068\n00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,140\nJust wanted to make sure.\n\n1069\n00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n1070\n00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,180\non the actual router itself,\nthis particular symbol here\n\n1071\n00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,560\nindicates the idea of a particular mode\nthat we call the idea of user mode here.\n\n1072\n00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,950\nOkay, it's what we see.\n\n1073\n00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,840\nSo Don is actually typing up the most\ncommon ones that you as a CCNT should,\n\n1074\n00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,135\nin your sleep,\nbe able to actually identify these.\n\n1075\n00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:50,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, overall.\n\n1076\n00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,580\nSo here, we actually have four\nof the most common ones here.\n\n1077\n00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,380\nThe first one is the one that\nwe initially get launched into\n\n1078\n00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,600\nright from the actual start\nup screen as we begin.\n\n1079\n00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,860\nThat one gives us the least amount\nof things that we can actually do.\n\n1080\n00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,800\nAs far as configurations go,\nreally nothing.\n\n1081\n00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,040\nIt allows me to have view access.\n\n1082\n00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,630\nThis is what actually\ngives needed ability.\n\n1083\n00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,910\n>> This prompt is called\nthe unprivileged user mode prompt.\n\n1084\n00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,420\nOkay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1085\n00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,100\n>> So, let me just write that on here.\n\n1086\n00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,540\nCause it is kind of a long name.\n\n1087\n00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,795\nSo it's the Unprivileged User-Mode Prompt.\n\n1088\n00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:26,965\nIs that spelled right?\n\n1089\n00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,945\n>> Yeah, looks good\n>> Okay, unprivileged user mode prompt.\n\n1090\n00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:32,955\nSo a user that's sitting\nhere at this prompt does not\n\n1091\n00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:34,405\nhave a lot of stuff that they can do.\n\n1092\n00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:39,875\nIt's a fairly limited world in terms\nof what they can really get at.\n\n1093\n00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:46,473\nVersus the router pound symbol prompt,\nwhich is the privileged mode,\n\n1094\n00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,360\nPrompt or privileged user mode.\n\n1095\n00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n1096\n00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,070\n>> There you go.\n\n1097\n00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,055\nAnd that's a user that has\nelevated privileges or\n\n1098\n00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,655\nadministrative access, and\nthey can do all sorts of crazy stuff\n\n1099\n00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,735\non the router that\nan unprivileged user cannot.\n\n1100\n00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:05,345\n>> Yeah.\n\n1101\n00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:09,215\nFor us, this is actually going to be\ngood because this is what we need to\n\n1102\n00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,950\nbe able to begin\nthe initial configuration.\n\n1103\n00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,250\nIf I can't move from the idea of\nthe user mode prompt that I have here,\n\n1104\n00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,230\nto the privilege mode, I can't begin\nany type of configuration at all.\n\n1105\n00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,980\nSo being able to distinguish the\ndifference between these two is key for\n\n1106\n00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,010\nus, especially on the CCENT exam.\n\n1107\n00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:25,720\n>> Yep.\n\n1108\n00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,250\nAll right, now.\n\n1109\n00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,480\nIt's time for\nus to learn our first command.\n\n1110\n00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,530\nWe haven't really entered any\ncommands on this router yet.\n\n1111\n00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,620\nSo we're going to learn our first one.\n\n1112\n00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,110\nAnd I'm going to start off with\nthe single most important command you're\n\n1113\n00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:37,850\never going to learn and\n\n1114\n00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:42,790\nit's also very easy to remember,\nwhich is the question mark command.\n\n1115\n00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:45,900\nCisco routers and the Cisco IOS,\nswitches, firewalls,\n\n1116\n00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,910\nall of them have what is\ncalled context sensitive help.\n\n1117\n00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,690\nAnd that means that no matter where you're\nat in your system, in your configuration.\n\n1118\n00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,000\nAnywhere that you're at.\n\n1119\n00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,060\nYou can always type a question mark,\nand you'll get a help screen.\n\n1120\n00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,750\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1121\n00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,790\nI'm just sitting here\nat the initial prompt.\n\n1122\n00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,930\nI don't know what to do.\n\n1123\n00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,250\nI'm confused the first time\nI've gotten into this.\n\n1124\n00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,840\nI can type a question mark, and\n\n1125\n00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,380\nit will give me a list of all\nof the commands available to me.\n\n1126\n00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,200\nAnd each command will be accompanied\nby a brief description letting me know\n\n1127\n00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,360\nwhat it is.\n\n1128\n00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,550\n>> And last thing also is that it's\nin alphabetical order, all right?\n\n1129\n00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,100\nSo in other words, if you're looking for\na specific command.\n\n1130\n00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,740\nYou can at least know that you have lists.\n\n1131\n00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,940\nWhenever you see that word more, the way\nthat you can see the next full screen,\n\n1132\n00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,940\ninstead of hitting Enter, which actually\ni'll show you one line at a time.\n\n1133\n00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,480\nYou can hit your space bar and\n\n1134\n00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,440\nthat will show you the next screen of the\nactual commands that you have available.\n\n1135\n00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,680\n>> Yeah,\nI didn't even think of that Ronnie.\n\n1136\n00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,440\nCuz you get used to doing the stuff so\nmuch, but yeah, if I do a question mark\n\n1137\n00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,090\nand I get here, see how the M\nstack command is the last one.\n\n1138\n00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,420\nIf I press Enter, it just advances\none line so M stat moves up one and\n\n1139\n00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,662\nI can sit here all day long and do that.\n\n1140\n00:52:50,662 --> 00:52:52,630\n>> [LAUGH] l\n>> Or you can hit spacebar and\n\n1141\n00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,185\ngo forward an entire space.\n\n1142\n00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:58,330\nNow let's say that I punch\nin that question mark.\n\n1143\n00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:02,550\nAnd, I find the command that I'm looking\nfor right there on the first screen.\n\n1144\n00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:08,080\nYou can hit the letter Q, and Q will\nquit out of the list, so Q for quit.\n\n1145\n00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,420\nAnd then you're out, right?\n\n1146\n00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,730\nSo, enter goes ahead on line,\n\n1147\n00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,070\nspacebar goes ahead an entire screen,\nQ quits out of the list.\n\n1148\n00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,080\n>> Yep.\n\n1149\n00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,330\nSo here, once we start seeing this stuff,\nthe thing that you gonna actually have to\n\n1150\n00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,030\ndo is learn how to do is just\nbegin to know at least the most\n\n1151\n00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,400\nbasic commands that we'll have at this\npoint for the configurations that we need.\n\n1152\n00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,240\nYou see that at this point\nhere on the user mode.\n\n1153\n00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,080\nYou see that you have a lot of\nthings that you can look at, but\n\n1154\n00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,660\nnothing that actually gives you\nthe ability to configure anything so far.\n\n1155\n00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,820\n>> Yeah.\nIf you look at the list,\n\n1156\n00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,400\nthere's a lot of stuff in here for\ndoing like ping and trace route, right,\n\n1157\n00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,020\ndiagnostic stuff.\n\n1158\n00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,050\n>> Right.\n>> There's the show command\n\n1159\n00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,820\nwhich is one more we're\ngonna work with a lot.\n\n1160\n00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,100\nWhich let's us get information\nout of the router.\n\n1161\n00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,440\nBut there isn't anything in here that\nactually makes a change to the system.\n\n1162\n00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,380\nSo it is pretty limited.\n\n1163\n00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,030\nIf we want to really do some work,\n\n1164\n00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,790\nthen we're going to need to\nget into our privileged mode.\n\n1165\n00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:05,370\nAnd when we do our question mark,\nyou see all the commands.\n\n1166\n00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,310\nI mentioned that is\ncontext sensitive help.\n\n1167\n00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,780\nSo where the question mark\nis makes a difference.\n\n1168\n00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,460\nI know that I want to get to privilege\nmode, and so I might be looking for\n\n1169\n00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,390\na command that can do that.\n\n1170\n00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,660\nSo if I want to see the commands\nthat are available,\n\n1171\n00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,940\nwe can just do a question mark and\nwe get a bunch, right?\n\n1172\n00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,740\nAnd I can start reading down the line\nuntil I find one, like this guy right\n\n1173\n00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:34,140\nhere, that says enable, and\nthen it says turn on privileged commands,\n\n1174\n00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,050\nbut let's say that I sort of remember that\nit's a command and it starts with an e.\n\n1175\n00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,100\nRight, I'm like, I know it starts with\nan e but I can't remember what it is.\n\n1176\n00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,020\nI could use that context\nsensitive help and\n\n1177\n00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:50,080\ntype E followed by a question mark and\nit will give me a list,\n\n1178\n00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,200\nnot of all the commands,\njust the commands that start with an E.\n\n1179\n00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,040\nThat's that context sensitive help.\n\n1180\n00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,950\n>> This helps you to filter and\nlimit down what you may be looking for,\n\n1181\n00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,320\nespecially if you know what\nthe beginning is here, too, 'kay?\n\n1182\n00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,740\nAnd the other nice thing about Cisco, even\nthough we don't really wanna emphasize\n\n1183\n00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,300\nthat too much here, is that accepts\nabbreviations relatively easily, too.\n\n1184\n00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,570\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1185\n00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,339\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, you take a look at a command\n\n1186\n00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,009\n>> like enable.\n\n1187\n00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:17,262\nIf I run enable.\n\n1188\n00:55:17,262 --> 00:55:19,355\nIf I run that fold command.\n\n1189\n00:55:19,355 --> 00:55:22,075\nWhen I press Enter,\nsee how my prompt changed?\n\n1190\n00:55:22,075 --> 00:55:24,215\nIt just moved me to the privileged mode.\n\n1191\n00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:26,790\nI'm not in an administrative mode.\n\n1192\n00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,030\nI can run the opposite of that\ncommand which is disable, and\n\n1193\n00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,830\nnow I'm back to the unprivileged user.\n\n1194\n00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,000\nBut I didn't have to\ntype the entire command.\n\n1195\n00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,586\nFor example, if I typed enab and\nleft off the le,\n\n1196\n00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:45,848\nIt knows what I'm talking about and\nit moved me in to the enable prompt.\n\n1197\n00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:49,342\nNow, how did it know\nwhat I was talking about?\n\n1198\n00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:55,903\nWell, the way it does it is when I\ntyped in enab, it basically looks for\n\n1199\n00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:01,410\ncommands that start with enab,\nand there's only one.\n\n1200\n00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,020\nThe only one is enable.\n\n1201\n00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,800\nYou can shorten any command as much\nas you want, even down to one letter.\n\n1202\n00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,340\nAs long as it's the only command\nthat starts with that letter.\n\n1203\n00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,450\nGood luck finding that.\n\n1204\n00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,360\n>> Yeah.\nBut it is something that we have to\n\n1205\n00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,190\nactually be aware of,\n\n1206\n00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,300\nespecially in the production environment\nwhen you're trying to do things quickly.\n\n1207\n00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,970\nOne the exam though,\neven though sometimes you will\n\n1208\n00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,840\nget to where you are doing\nthe simulation that will accept these.\n\n1209\n00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,130\nThere is no guarantee it will accept it.\n\n1210\n00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:31,920\nSo if you try picker abbreviation and\nit doesn't accept it, and you go,\n\n1211\n00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,670\nI know this worked when I tried that.\n\n1212\n00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,810\nWell again it means you have\nto know the actual command,\n\n1213\n00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,810\nso as much as we want to tell\nyou how it actually does work,\n\n1214\n00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:42,620\nyou have to know what the commands\nare as well, so please pay attention.\n\n1215\n00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,670\n>> You know on the exam you'll have,\n\n1216\n00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,000\nthe bulk of your exam is gonna\nbe multiple choice questions.\n\n1217\n00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,820\n>> Right.\n>> And so the command's\n\n1218\n00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,040\nview right there on the screen, as long\nas you can recognize the right ones, but\n\n1219\n00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,690\nsome of the questions\nare simulation questions.\n\n1220\n00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,690\nYou'll be in a router or\nin a switch making changes.\n\n1221\n00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,610\nAnd it does accept most abbreviations.\n\n1222\n00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:03,310\nSome, it may not, and\nthe question mark does work.\n\n1223\n00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> You do have the contact sensitive help\n\n1224\n00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,740\non the exam\n>> Yep.\n\n1225\n00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,340\n>> So dont panic,\nif you can't remember the exact command,\n\n1226\n00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,880\nfire up that question mark and\nlook for it.\n\n1227\n00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,510\n>> Yep.\n>> The only negative is,\n\n1228\n00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,690\nit's time consuming\n>> Yep.\n\n1229\n00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,550\n>> And\nyou don't have a lot of time on the exam.\n\n1230\n00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,010\n>> No.\n>> So you don't want to waste your\n\n1231\n00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,360\ntime digging through lists.\n\n1232\n00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,650\nInstead you want to make sure\nyou've got your commands memorized.\n\n1233\n00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,980\n>> So more repetition, the more times\nyou're doing this is key here for you.\n\n1234\n00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:32,050\nSo there is the first absolute\ncommand that we must know,\n\n1235\n00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,270\nby far is the question mark.\n\n1236\n00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,860\nIs gonna help us out more than any\nother command that we're gonna learn\n\n1237\n00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,820\nright now what.\n\n1238\n00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,320\n>> Let's look a little bit more\nabout abbreviations, right?\n\n1239\n00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,550\nSo the enable command,\nif I do an e question mark,\n\n1240\n00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,650\nI can see that there are four\ncommands that start with an e, so\n\n1241\n00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:51,270\nif I just run an e and press Enter,\nI get an error, ambiguous command 'e'.\n\n1242\n00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:53,590\nThat means there's more than one\ncommand that starts with an e.\n\n1243\n00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,340\nIt couldn't figure out what I meant.\n\n1244\n00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,650\nBut if I look, enable is\nthe only one that starts with en.\n\n1245\n00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,940\nNo other command starts with en.\n\n1246\n00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,220\nSo I can run en and\nit knows what I'm talking about.\n\n1247\n00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,590\n>> Right.\n>> Because there was only\n\n1248\n00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,050\none command that match that.\n\n1249\n00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,840\nSo you can abbreviate commands\ndown as far as you want so\n\n1250\n00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,870\nthat there isn't a duplicate\nwith another command.\n\n1251\n00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,740\n>> And that is a very good,\nagain, for time consumption here,\n\n1252\n00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,840\nthat's something you may want to actually\nmake sure that you do remember there.\n\n1253\n00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,990\nSo again, abbreviations are good for us.\n\n1254\n00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,530\nPay attention and make sure you already\nknow what the commands actually mean or\n\n1255\n00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,790\nif you try to type the [INAUDIBLE] and\nall of a sudden you get several and\n\n1256\n00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:35,820\nyou are not sure which one, that's where\nyou are going to find yourself in trouble.\n\n1257\n00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,170\n>> Another tool you can use\nis the tab auto complete.\n\n1258\n00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,940\nWhen you start to type a command,\nif you've typed enough letters\n\n1259\n00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,460\nthat no other command matches,\nyou can hit Tab on your keyboard, and\n\n1260\n00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:53,230\nwhen you hit Tab, it will actually\ntype out the rest of the command.\n\n1261\n00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:57,790\nThat's really handy if you're gonna\nbe typing some kind of long command.\n\n1262\n00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:02,490\nIf I start to do a show, there we go.\n\n1263\n00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:03,780\nShow start up config.\n\n1264\n00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:08,530\nI can hit Tab and it'll type the rest for\nme instead of me having to type it, right?\n\n1265\n00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,160\nIt's also helpful if I think\nI've typed enough letters, and\n\n1266\n00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,080\nI hit Tab and it just beeps at me.\n\n1267\n00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,550\nI don't know if you guys\ncan hear the beep or not.\n\n1268\n00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,690\nBut that's letting me know I\nhaven't typed enough letters for\n\n1269\n00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,250\nit to know what command I'm talking about.\n\n1270\n00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,715\nSo I add one more letter,\nand now it knows.\n\n1271\n00:59:23,715 --> 00:59:25,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1272\n00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,460\nYeah, so some of these shortcuts\nagain are really helpful,\n\n1273\n00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,100\nespecially when you do see them.\n\n1274\n00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,050\nAnd on the simulators you'll actually get\nthe same types of errors that you may see.\n\n1275\n00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,660\nSo do pay attention, especially\nwhen it doesn't show you anything,\n\n1276\n00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,540\nit may mean ambiguous again.\n\n1277\n00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,200\nHere, we don't have enough\nletters in there for\n\n1278\n00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,640\nus to be able to figure\nout what's going on.\n\n1279\n00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,820\n>> Now the two commands I've used so\nfar are enable and disable, right?\n\n1280\n00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,550\n>> That's it.\n\n1281\n00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,980\n>> Enable, got me into my privilege mode.\n\n1282\n00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,240\nDisable, got me back out again.\n\n1283\n00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,270\nThere we go.\n\n1284\n00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:53,890\nDisable got me back out again.\n\n1285\n00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,980\nThose commands are just single commands,\nyou just run one word,\n\n1286\n00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,560\nit tells us to do something and\nit does it.\n\n1287\n00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,860\nMany commands though,\nrequire more than one thing, so for\n\n1288\n01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,900\nexample if I look at the show command.\n\n1289\n01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,820\nLet me just find it in my list here.\n\n1290\n01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,640\nShow.\n\n1291\n01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,210\nSo it says right here,\nshow running system information.\n\n1292\n01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,880\nIf I just run show by itself,\n\n1293\n01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,430\nI get a message that says Type \"show?\" for\na list of subcommands.\n\n1294\n01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:29,560\nNow that means that there's more\ncommand modifiers to this command.\n\n1295\n01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,030\nIf I run show question\nmark without a space.\n\n1296\n01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:38,640\nThat's gonna give me a list of all\nthe commands that start with show.\n\n1297\n01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,260\nBut if I run show ?, it's\n\n1298\n01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,765\ngonna give me a list of all of the command\nmodifiers for the show command.\n\n1299\n01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:49,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And there's a lot of them.\n\n1300\n01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,260\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n1301\n01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:54,125\nNow, if you look at the list, you got\ntriple A, AA12 or AAL2, whatever that is.\n\n1302\n01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:55,310\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1303\n01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,600\n>> Adjacency, alarm interface and so on.\n\n1304\n01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,530\nEach one of these is a modifier,\nso it would actually read.\n\n1305\n01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,180\nShow AAA.\n\n1306\n01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,130\nShow AAA 12.\n\n1307\n01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,330\nShow adjacency.\n\n1308\n01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,820\nShow alarm dash interface.\n\n1309\n01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,170\nSo each one of those being\na it's not A 12, it is AAA L2.\n\n1310\n01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:16,090\nSo, to do each one of those\nwith the show command.\n\n1311\n01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,490\nSo if I wanted to find out, for\n\n1312\n01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,300\nexample, what version of\nthe iOS I'm running, right?\n\n1313\n01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,970\nI can continue down this list and\nthis is a big list right here.\n\n1314\n01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,135\nAs we continue down.\n\n1315\n01:01:27,135 --> 01:01:30,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Somewhere in here,\n\n1316\n01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:34,470\nthere we go,\nwe've got the show version command.\n\n1317\n01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,860\nSystem hardware and software status.\n\n1318\n01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,140\nI can do show version to find out\nwhat operating system I'm running.\n\n1319\n01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:44,120\nNow, how do I know this is\nthe end of the command?\n\n1320\n01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,670\nI can do a question mark and\nsay what else can I type in?\n\n1321\n01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,412\nAnd it'll tell me cr or carriage return.\n\n1322\n01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:53,545\nThat mean it's ready for\nyou to press Enter.\n\n1323\n01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:56,775\n>> Yeah.\n>> Show version and then press Enter and\n\n1324\n01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:59,445\nit will tell you what version\nof the iOS you're running.\n\n1325\n01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:02,765\n>> Especially in relation to that cr,\nwhenever you see that,\n\n1326\n01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:05,760\neven if you see another list of\nmodifiers that are out there.\n\n1327\n01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,030\nWhenever you see the cr, it means\nyou can just enter that command and\n\n1328\n01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:11,115\nnot worry about having to enter any\nadditional modifiers if you need to.\n\n1329\n01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:11,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1330\n01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,430\n>> So, sometimes you may get\na little bit confused like,\n\n1331\n01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,570\noh which one of these should I enter?\n\n1332\n01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,530\nAnd you just go,\nI don't want to enter anything else.\n\n1333\n01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,380\nAnd you don't see that if you see that\ncr there, it means you're ready to go.\n\n1334\n01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:19,890\nIf you don't,\n\n1335\n01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,970\nit means you do have to enter in more to\nmake it specific to what you need here.\n\n1336\n01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:24,530\nYeah.\n\n1337\n01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,290\n>> Yeah.\nSo really cool stuff, the show command,\n\n1338\n01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,550\nvery powerful right?\n\n1339\n01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:33,230\nThe question mark,\nthat is the most useful command, bar none.\n\n1340\n01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,130\nThe show command is second.\n\n1341\n01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:39,470\nAll through this show, as we could be\na network show, but all through this\n\n1342\n01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:43,510\nshow and all through the additional\nepisodes we film on the CCENT and CCNA and\n\n1343\n01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,170\nCCMP and all that good stuff,\nyou'll configure something and\n\n1344\n01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,440\nthen you'll use the show command\nto verify it, so real important.\n\n1345\n01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,000\n>> Yeah.\nAnd very important on the exam as well.\n\n1346\n01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,740\nMake sure you pay attention to as many\nof those show commands as you can and\n\n1347\n01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,200\nif you do have the devices, make sure you\nrun those as often as you can as well\n\n1348\n01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,105\ncuz we don't wanna be stuck with just\nknowing one way to verify something.\n\n1349\n01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:06,320\n>> Ronnie, i am not sure about you but\ni haven't looked at the clock once and\n\n1350\n01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,430\nwe are out of time, so let's do this.\n\n1351\n01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:10,020\nYou get carried away.\n\n1352\n01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,400\nLet's stop here.\n\n1353\n01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,160\nWe haven't really configured anything yet,\nso when we get back,\n\n1354\n01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,620\nwe will actually configure something,\nwe will make some headway.\n\n1355\n01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,430\nAll very important stuff though,\nespecially these foundational skills\n\n1356\n01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,150\nespecially early days working with\nCisco come in very, very useful.\n\n1357\n01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,670\nSo let's stop here.\n\n1358\n01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,207\nWe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n1359\n01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,345\nStay tuned.\n\n1360\n01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:35,808\n[SOUND].\n\n1361\n01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:37,747\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1362\n01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,398\nSo before the break we got\nto see three plans, right?\n\n1363\n01:03:41,398 --> 01:03:42,698\n>> Can we [LAUGH].\n\n1364\n01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,115\nWe're incredibly fast.\n\n1365\n01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:46,397\n>> We're an hour into the show and\nwe've covered three commands.\n\n1366\n01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:51,334\nSo, hopefully the question mark\nis a context sensitive help, and\n\n1367\n01:03:51,334 --> 01:03:53,670\nwe saw enable and disable.\n\n1368\n01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,095\nSo let's go further, Ronnie.\n\n1369\n01:03:56,095 --> 01:03:59,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's take a look at a couple\n\n1370\n01:03:59,260 --> 01:03:59,790\nother commands.\n\n1371\n01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:00,860\n>> Right.\n>> That are available to us.\n\n1372\n01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,770\nSome commands, like the show command,\nis really just giving us information about\n\n1373\n01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:12,600\nthe router, but\nnot actually making a change.\n\n1374\n01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,190\n>> Now, that's what we want to do.\n\n1375\n01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:18,860\nWe want to make sure that we now get into\nthe part where we get the router ready,\n\n1376\n01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,750\nand configured so\nit can at least be up and running,\n\n1377\n01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,890\nand then we configure it\nfurther a little bit more.\n\n1378\n01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:26,530\nSo we're moving away from\njust the idea of viewing, and\n\n1379\n01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,400\nbeing able to see different things.\n\n1380\n01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,410\nOf course,\nthose are actually important for us, for\n\n1381\n01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:34,255\nverification that they're actually\ndone the correct way and were working.\n\n1382\n01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:37,105\nBut now we want to get into\nthose configuration commands.\n\n1383\n01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:41,645\nAnd so this brings us past just the idea\nof being able to take a look at SHO.\n\n1384\n01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:43,415\nThe enable is one of those commands,\n\n1385\n01:04:43,415 --> 01:04:46,295\nthat we do need to have that\nmoves us away from the user mode,\n\n1386\n01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:50,650\ninto the privileged exec mode, but\nnow we need to get into configuration.\n\n1387\n01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:51,490\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n1388\n01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,980\n>> And even when you're in that privilege\nmode, when you've got that pound symbol on\n\n1389\n01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,820\nyour prompt, it's still one more step to\nget to where you can get to configuration.\n\n1390\n01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,460\nSo that's going to be our next command.\n\n1391\n01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,994\nOur next command is the configure command,\nand by itself, that's not enough.\n\n1392\n01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:06,950\nRight.\n\n1393\n01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,539\nI'm gonna run configure?, all right.\n\n1394\n01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:13,530\nAnd you'll see that there's a couple of\ndifferent commands that are available, and\n\n1395\n01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,440\nfor the exam there's really just\ntwo we want to worry about here.\n\n1396\n01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,940\nWhich is configure memory and\nconfigure terminal.\n\n1397\n01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,090\nOn your Cisco router, Cisco switch,\n\n1398\n01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,070\nwhatever, you actually\nhave two configurations.\n\n1399\n01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,870\nYou have what's called your\nrunning configuration, and\n\n1400\n01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,800\nyour startup configuration.\n\n1401\n01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,460\nAnd, like their names imply,\n\n1402\n01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,600\nthe running configuration is what's\nrunning on your system right now.\n\n1403\n01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,640\nAnd your startup\nconfiguration is what will be\n\n1404\n01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,680\nused the next time you reboot the router.\n\n1405\n01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,210\nWhen you boot the router up, that's when\nit loads that startup configuration, and\n\n1406\n01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,340\nputs it in place.\n\n1407\n01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:47,950\n>> Yep.\n\n1408\n01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:52,810\nSo when we begin to actually configure\nhere, right now, our picker routers,\n\n1409\n01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:56,320\nactually is just up, even though we\nstarted off with a configuration through\n\n1410\n01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,270\nthat system initial configuration idea,\nwe kind of got rid of it.\n\n1411\n01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,785\nWe really dont have any other\nconfiguration on here, okay?\n\n1412\n01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:03,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So,\n\n1413\n01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,480\nwhen we begin the idea of using configure,\n\n1414\n01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,340\nnotice all the different options that we\nhave, and again we're gonna pay attention\n\n1415\n01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,070\nto that memory and terminal\n>> The one that I'm more familiar with\n\n1416\n01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:11,800\nis the terminal.\n\n1417\n01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1418\n01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,340\nAnd that's normally what\nyou're going to use, right?\n\n1419\n01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,570\nIf I wanted to make\na change to the router, but\n\n1420\n01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,240\nI didn't want it to take effect right now,\n\n1421\n01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,120\nI want it to take effect the next time I\nreboot, then I would do Configure, Memory.\n\n1422\n01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,760\nThat would modify the one that will\nbe loaded the next time I reboot.\n\n1423\n01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,270\n>> Right.\n>> If I want to make a change to\n\n1424\n01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,580\nthe router right now,\n>> I want configure terminal and\n\n1425\n01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,470\nthat's the one that we\nuse 99.9% of the time.\n\n1426\n01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:39,060\nAnd the reality is, once you make\na change to the router right now,\n\n1427\n01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,170\nyou can then save that, to be there\nwhen the system starts up the next time.\n\n1428\n01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,500\nSo by saying configure terminal,\n\n1429\n01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,460\nthat's saying let's modify what's\ngoing on in this router right now.\n\n1430\n01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,070\n>> Yep, and if you take a look at\nthe command prompt change here, right?\n\n1431\n01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,840\nSo notice we've moved from\nthe privileged mode, and\n\n1432\n01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,900\nnow you actually have inside of the\nparentheses here, where it says config,\n\n1433\n01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,750\nand then you see the actual\npound symbol as well.\n\n1434\n01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,460\nSo we're getting another\nprompt change here.\n\n1435\n01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,810\n>> Now technically we're still in\nprivilege mode, we still have that prompt.\n\n1436\n01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,760\nThat's how we know we're logged\nin as an administrator, right.\n\n1437\n01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,120\nI can see that there.\n\n1438\n01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,560\nBut the config, that lets me know that I'm\nnow about to make changes to my system.\n\n1439\n01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,520\nAll right.\n\n1440\n01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,800\nAnd if I do a question mark here,\nyou'll see tons of commands,\n\n1441\n01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,780\ntons of things that I can change.\n\n1442\n01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,860\nAnd it is just a whole heck of a lot.\n\n1443\n01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:30,226\nWe're going to show you\nthe most common ones,\n\n1444\n01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:34,250\nthe basics ones that we need to get\nan initial configuration on our system.\n\n1445\n01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,020\n>> Yep.\n\n1446\n01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,810\nWhen we start here with this,\n\n1447\n01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:40,140\nyou want to know what the name of that\nparticular prompt is also called here.\n\n1448\n01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:40,980\nA lot of times times,\n\n1449\n01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,780\npeople actually again kind of, they\ndefault to what they actually call it.\n\n1450\n01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,620\nA lot of times you could say, oh,\nit's just a config prompt here.\n\n1451\n01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,780\nTechnically, it's called our\nglobal configuration prompt.\n\n1452\n01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,020\nAnd when we talk about that\nidea of global configuration,\n\n1453\n01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,920\nwe're affecting the entire overall router.\n\n1454\n01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,500\nOr switch at this point.\n\n1455\n01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,030\nSo any command that we enter in here,\nactually affects all of it.\n\n1456\n01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:02,480\nSo that's actually the key for us,\n\n1457\n01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,510\nis knowing that that term is actually\ncalled the global configuration.\n\n1458\n01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:08,845\nAs much as I want to call it the config\nprompt, it's not that on the exam.\n\n1459\n01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:11,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna make a change here.\n\n1460\n01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,445\nOne of the first changes that we make on\na system is normally to rename it, right?\n\n1461\n01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:18,480\nRight now, the system is called router,\nwhich is pretty generic.\n\n1462\n01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,300\nI'm gonna change it by using\nthe host name command.\n\n1463\n01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:29,779\nSo I'll say,\nHostName ITProTV-router, right?\n\n1464\n01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:34,680\nAnd when I run that,\nthe change takes effect immediately.\n\n1465\n01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,600\nImmediately my prompt changes\nto ITProTV router, and\n\n1466\n01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,600\nI got my config prompt and it's in place.\n\n1467\n01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,770\nSo I know that took effect\nbecause I did configure terminal.\n\n1468\n01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:48,780\nIf I did configure memory,\nthe change wouldn't take effect right now.\n\n1469\n01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,340\nAnd I'd have to reboot for it to happen.\n\n1470\n01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,880\n>> So once we have the host name up here,\n\n1471\n01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,020\nthis helps us to uniquely\nidentify this device.\n\n1472\n01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,050\nIf I were to get four\ndifferent routers up and\n\n1473\n01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,560\nrunning, I might actually move\nbetween those routers too rapidly ,and\n\n1474\n01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,000\nnot remember what configs I went, or\nput on what particular router here.\n\n1475\n01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,810\nSo by actually identifying a host name,\n\n1476\n01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,770\nis actually one of the key things that\nwe're gonna actually need, especially to\n\n1477\n01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:14,460\nhelp other types of commands run a little\nbit later on, and to identify this device.\n\n1478\n01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,570\nSo having the host name's\nactually very important for us.\n\n1479\n01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,310\nYeah, and now that it's set,\nI can type end, and\n\n1480\n01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:25,560\nthat will get me out of configuration, and\nI get my little message letting me know\n\n1481\n01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,820\nthat it was configured, and\nnow I'm in business, right?\n\n1482\n01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,390\n>> Yep.\n>> Well, sorta.\n\n1483\n01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1484\n01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:35,880\n>> Right now, I made that change to how\nthe router's running right at this moment.\n\n1485\n01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,740\nIf I were to reboot right now,\nI would lose my changes.\n\n1486\n01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,820\nWe always need to save our work.\n\n1487\n01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,950\nOn your router, you have two\nconfigurations, the running and\n\n1488\n01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:46,910\nthe startup.\n\n1489\n01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:50,400\nSo when we make a change like this,\nwe need to make sure we save it\n\n1490\n01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,750\nfrom the running configuration,\nInto the startup configuration.\n\n1491\n01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,090\n>> And the nice thing about\nthe way that CISCO does it,\n\n1492\n01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,300\nis that it's relatively intuitive.\n\n1493\n01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,640\nBecause of the way that it actually...\n\n1494\n01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,560\nThey don't want you to make these\nlong drawn out commands here.\n\n1495\n01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,530\nThey try to make it relatively short.\n\n1496\n01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:11,480\nSo our ticker command here is actually\ncopy running-config space, startup-config.\n\n1497\n01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,800\nSo if you read it out logically,\nyou should hear something in your mind\n\n1498\n01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,040\nlike copy what's in\nrunning config right now.\n\n1499\n01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,070\nIn other words, the changes I just made\ninside of the terminal configuration, and\n\n1500\n01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:24,120\ncopy that into the start up dash config.\n\n1501\n01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,140\nNow, that start up dash config for\nus, is going to end up being a file,\n\n1502\n01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,150\nthat's going to be stored inside\nof what we call an MV ram here.\n\n1503\n01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,670\nAnd that means that that's going to\nbe persistent through the bootup.\n\n1504\n01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,700\nSo if I restart the router at that point,\nafter I press enter here.\n\n1505\n01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,670\nYou're gonna see where it actually does\nsay, what is the destination file name?\n\n1506\n01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:44,370\nNow we can name it something if\nwe choose to, but the default for\n\n1507\n01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,920\nus should be startup-config.\n\n1508\n01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,650\n>> You can call it something else.\n\n1509\n01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:50,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> It won't work, but you can do it.\n\n1510\n01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:50,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n1511\n01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,440\nYou shouldn't need to rename this,\nbut if for some reason you wanna\n\n1512\n01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,940\nname a backup copy or something,\nI guess you could do that if you want to.\n\n1513\n01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,830\nBut startup-config is normally\nthe one that will accept,\n\n1514\n01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,650\nso without having to retype it\nwe just simply press Enter.\n\n1515\n01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:06,390\nWe should get building configuration,\nand you should see the word okay.\n\n1516\n01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,208\nAnd that now means that\nwhatever is in running config,\n\n1517\n01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,770\nhas now been copied into the NVRAM here.\n\n1518\n01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:15,910\nWhen the actual router restarts and it\ngoes through that process again, it looks\n\n1519\n01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,560\nover to the startup config and it says,\nhey, let's pull that into the RAM now.\n\n1520\n01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,960\nNow that's a pretty long command, right?\n\n1521\n01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:28,710\nSo copy running-config startup-config,\nthat's a pretty long one.\n\n1522\n01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,000\nThere are ways to abbreviate it.\n\n1523\n01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,241\nFor those of you studying for the exam,\nthe shortest I would really go on\n\n1524\n01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:37,435\nsomething like this would\nbe copy run start, right?\n\n1525\n01:11:37,435 --> 01:11:40,668\nIf you abbreviated down to that,\nit keeps the spirit of the command so\n\n1526\n01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:44,124\nyou can remember what it is,\nto what's running, to what's startup, so\n\n1527\n01:11:44,124 --> 01:11:45,654\ncopy run start is pretty short.\n\n1528\n01:11:45,654 --> 01:11:49,519\nYou can actually get it a little\nshorter if you really wanted to.\n\n1529\n01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:52,178\nIf you go out on the Internet and\nsearch around,\n\n1530\n01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:55,985\nyou'll find a lot of people talking\nabout an even shorter command.\n\n1531\n01:11:55,985 --> 01:12:01,565\nThere's a very old Cisco command\nout there called Right memory.\n\n1532\n01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:06,315\nAnd on older Cisco equipment, that was the\ncommand that saved your configuration, and\n\n1533\n01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:08,145\nsee how it does the build and Config.\n\n1534\n01:12:08,145 --> 01:12:11,725\nAnd you can abbreviate that all\nthe way down to two letters.\n\n1535\n01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:12,295\n>> Yeah.\nWR.\n\n1536\n01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:12,795\n>> WR.\n\n1537\n01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,980\nJust plain old WR and it will save it.\n\n1538\n01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:19,560\nSo in a lot of videos and stuff that are\nout there by Cisco experts, and whatever.\n\n1539\n01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,770\nThey'll use WR all the time.\n\n1540\n01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,910\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\nI use it all the time.\n\n1541\n01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:23,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1542\n01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,180\n>> But, don't use it on the exams, okay?\n\n1543\n01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:27,940\n>> That's right.\n>> In fact,\n\n1544\n01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,120\non some of them it doesn't\neven work on the exam.\n\n1545\n01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,870\nThe right memory command is\na deprecated command, and\n\n1546\n01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,580\nwhat that means is that it's going away.\n\n1547\n01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:37,960\nSisco is not gonna be supporting\nit on newer iOSs, and so\n\n1548\n01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,770\nas a result, some of the newer equipment\nthat's out there doesn't work.\n\n1549\n01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:45,000\nSo on the exam, make sure you use the copy\n\n1550\n01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,880\nrunning dash configs startup dash Config\ncommand fet in you head just use it.\n\n1551\n01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,750\nIn real life you can\nuse whatever you want.\n\n1552\n01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,620\nOn the exam you use copy run star.\n\n1553\n01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,250\n>> Make sure you have the word order\n\n1554\n01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,830\nalso to\n>> Okay.\n\n1555\n01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:01,320\nIf copy run start is actually important.\n\n1556\n01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,740\nIf you do copy start run,\nthat's a totally different command.\n\n1557\n01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,100\nThat tells us to copy what's in\nstart up into the running Config.\n\n1558\n01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,970\nThat's a valid command for us.\n\n1559\n01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,810\nBut it's not one that's gonna help you\nsave the changes the changes that you've\n\n1560\n01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,830\njust made into the start up here.\n\n1561\n01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,410\nSo remember the order's important.\n\n1562\n01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:20,580\n>> Copy, Run,\nStart is actually the key for us.\n\n1563\n01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,040\n>> Now, these configuration files\nare actually really simple.\n\n1564\n01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,860\nThey're just a text file, and they just\nstore all the various commands you'd need\n\n1565\n01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,470\nto run, in order to get your system\nset back up the way you had it So\n\n1566\n01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,700\nIf I do show startup-config.\n\n1567\n01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:41,190\nWhen I run that it's going to show\nme what's in my startup config.\n\n1568\n01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,300\nAnd it really is just a list of commands.\n\n1569\n01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,330\nNow some of these I didn't type.\n\n1570\n01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:49,250\nYou've guys have been watching this show,\nI never typed service times stamps debug.\n\n1571\n01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,100\nRight?\n\n1572\n01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:54,930\nBut those are default commands,\nones that Cisco puts in at the factory.\n\n1573\n01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,880\n>> But here is one that you did\ntype right there, hostname.\n\n1574\n01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,500\n>> Right there.\n\n1575\n01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,640\n>> There it is, yep.\n\n1576\n01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,980\n>> And so when you boot up,\n\n1577\n01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,665\nthe router reads this text file\n>> File, and\n\n1578\n01:14:02,665 --> 01:14:04,925\nit basically just runs\nthese commands really fast.\n\n1579\n01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:07,575\nReal fast, typing in all\nthe stuff that you;re already done\n\n1580\n01:14:07,575 --> 01:14:09,655\nto get it all configured and\nback in place.\n\n1581\n01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:11,005\n>> Yep.\n\n1582\n01:14:11,005 --> 01:14:13,835\nSo there;s our initial saving\nconfiguration that we've done,\n\n1583\n01:14:13,835 --> 01:14:16,040\nwhich is just the ID of the host name.\n\n1584\n01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,720\n>> Add this bigger point here so\n\n1585\n01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,940\nidentifying the actual router\nis a good one as we begin here.\n\n1586\n01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,770\nNow we may be ready to\nconfigure an interface or\n\n1587\n01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,400\ndo we want to actually talk about\nconfiguring something else next?\n\n1588\n01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,430\n>> Let's look just a little\nbit more at files,\n\n1589\n01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:30,279\n>> Alright, sure,\n\n1590\n01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,330\nyep before we start jumping to Configs.\n\n1591\n01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,290\nSo the running Config and\n\n1592\n01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,650\nthe starting Config,\nthe running config I mentioned is in RAM.\n\n1593\n01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,350\nIt's running on the system right now.\n\n1594\n01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:39,950\nIt's floating around in RAM.\n\n1595\n01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,510\nThat means it's a nebulous thing.\n\n1596\n01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,200\n>> Right.\n>> That actually, it's not a true file.\n\n1597\n01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,020\n>> Right.\n>> If I do a show running-config\n\n1598\n01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,820\nyou'll see a message at\nthe very top where it\n\n1599\n01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,760\nsays-\n>> There we go.\n\n1600\n01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,400\n>> Building configuration.\n\n1601\n01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,990\n>> It has to look at what's in RAM and\n\n1602\n01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,760\nthen turn around and represent it\nto us as a string of commands.\n\n1603\n01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,340\nThe startup config is not like that.\n\n1604\n01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:07,600\nIf I do a show start up-config,\nit does not say building config,\n\n1605\n01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,370\ninstead it immediately says\n>> Here's how big the file is, and\n\n1606\n01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,080\nhere's the output okay?\n\n1607\n01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,540\nAnd that's because the startup config\nis actually saved as a text file.\n\n1608\n01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,110\nAt the beginning of the episode Ronnie and\n\n1609\n01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,720\nI were talking about the memory\nin the router right?\n\n1610\n01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,660\nAnd we mentioned how there's RAM that's\nwhere we run from, there's flash, that's\n\n1611\n01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:31,515\nwhere our iOS is stored and there's NVRAM\nand that's where our Config is stored.\n\n1612\n01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:36,860\nNVRAM, that stands for\nnon volatile RAM, that means it's RAM,\n\n1613\n01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,350\nbut unlike normal RAM where you power\noff the system, it gets blanked out,\n\n1614\n01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:45,160\nwith NVRAM, it's usually battery backed,\nso there's a battery that keeps it active.\n\n1615\n01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,990\nSo it doesn't get erased when\nyou power the system off.\n\n1616\n01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,010\nOn a lot of the newer routers,\n\n1617\n01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:54,770\nthey will use simulated NVRAM,\nwhich means it's just stored in Flash.\n\n1618\n01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,206\nAll right?\nAnd Flash doesn't wipe.\n\n1619\n01:15:57,206 --> 01:15:59,000\n>> Right.\n>> But on a lot of the higher end ones,\n\n1620\n01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,800\nit's still battery back.\n\n1621\n01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,340\n>> Right.\n>> Like in this one right here.\n\n1622\n01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,320\nAnd so we have true NVRAM, here.\n\n1623\n01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:03,900\n>> Yep.\n\n1624\n01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,385\n>> We can utilize the DIR

drive.\n\n1629\n01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,160\nHere I'm saying DIR flash colon,\nshow me what's in flash.\n\n1630\n01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:27,610\nAnd when I run that I can see\nthere's only one file, it's my iOS,\n\n1631\n01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:28,490\nmy Operating system.\n\n1632\n01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:33,308\nSo that's C 2800 NM advanced IP\n\n1633\n01:16:33,308 --> 01:16:38,070\nservices K9 MZ 124-22-T.2\n>> Wow.\n\n1634\n01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,045\n>> Yeah, it rolls right off the tongue.\n\n1635\n01:16:40,045 --> 01:16:42,410\n[LAUGH] So, there's no Windows 8.1.\n\n1636\n01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,030\n>> That's right.\n\n1637\n01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,160\n>> It's a nice long one.\n\n1638\n01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,770\nSo, but that's our iOS file and\n\n1639\n01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:48,540\nthat's the only thing that\nI've got in Flash right now.\n\n1640\n01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,313\nIf I do DIR NV RAM,\nthat'll show me what's in NV RAM, and\n\n1641\n01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:59,690\nright there I can see startup-config and\nmy Configuration file right now.\n\n1642\n01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:02,410\nThis is actually in bytes, so it's 1K.\n\n1643\n01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,020\nIn size.\n\n1644\n01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n1645\n01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:09,020\nSo that's going to be important for us to\nbe able to identify that if we need to.\n\n1646\n01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:09,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n1647\n01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:13,320\n>> So, making sure that we understand\nthe differences in RAM and\n\n1648\n01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,320\nthe flash drive is actually going\nto be pretty cool for us here, and\n\n1649\n01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,390\nnot only that here,\nessential for the exam.\n\n1650\n01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,580\nSo that's important too.\n\n1651\n01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,640\n>> Yeah, we're going to work later on.\n\n1652\n01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,320\nIt's not in this episode, but\nlater on, on like file management.\n\n1653\n01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,390\nBecause we're going to need to see like\nhow to back up our configurations and\n\n1654\n01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,640\nhow to upgrade our router.\n\n1655\n01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,500\nLike this router's running an older IOS.\n\n1656\n01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,220\nSo we'll need to upgrade\nit to the latest and\n\n1657\n01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:36,635\ngreatest, like 15.1,\n15.2s that are out there.\n\n1658\n01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:41,235\nSo that sounds like a big jump,\nCisco skipped over 13 and 14.\n\n1659\n01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:47,865\nThey went from 12.4 right to 15.0,\nso it's not that big of a jump.\n\n1660\n01:17:47,865 --> 01:17:50,245\nBut yeah, we'll have to upgrade\nto get a chance to see that.\n\n1661\n01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,080\nAll right, so\nthat's kind of the file systems there.\n\n1662\n01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,070\nI wanted to show you guys that,\nshow running-config, show startup-config.\n\n1663\n01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,800\nThat's how we can see those commands and\n\n1664\n01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,890\nget an idea of what needs to be\ndone to configure our system.\n\n1665\n01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,600\nAll right?\n\n1666\n01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,330\nThe other thing I wanted to\nmention before we got too far\n\n1667\n01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:12,140\nis that there are a lot of keyboard\nshortcuts in the Cisco world.\n\n1668\n01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,200\nAs we type in commands,\n\n1669\n01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,010\nthe router's actually remembering the\ncommands that we type, like if I do a show\n\n1670\n01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:22,365\nhistory, show history will show all\nthe commands that I've typed so far.\n\n1671\n01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:23,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n1672\n01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,900\nNow, that history is pretty cool,\nbecause if I need to run something again.\n\n1673\n01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,520\nIf I want to run showstartup-config,\n\n1674\n01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,006\nI could type out\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1675\n01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,580\n>> showstartup-config.\n\n1676\n01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,690\nOr I can press the up arrow on my keyboard\n\n1677\n01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,050\njust scroll back until I\nfind show startup-config.\n\n1678\n01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,970\nAnd you can hit the down\narrow to scroll forward, too.\n\n1679\n01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:45,950\nSo it goes up and down, can scroll\nyou back and forth to get through and\n\n1680\n01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,050\nfind the different commands\nthat you're looking for.\n\n1681\n01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,590\n>> And this really helps out especially\nwhen you do have a lot of commands, but\n\n1682\n01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,810\nalso you happen to be like I do and\nyou tend to actually.\n\n1683\n01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,600\nNot being able to type very well,\nyou have a lot of mistypes as well.\n\n1684\n01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,460\nSo being able to actually scroll through\nthose commands are also helpful too.\n\n1685\n01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:02,960\n>> Now here is one I see a lot.\n\n1686\n01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,890\nRight?\nSo let's say I type a command and\n\n1687\n01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:10,340\nI'm writing it out and that would be bad.\n\n1688\n01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,310\nSo I do [LAUGH].\n\n1689\n01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,960\nSo I'm trying to save.\n\n1690\n01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,640\nRight?\nAnd I run this command.\n\n1691\n01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,860\nand I've got a typo and\nI look and I go oh shoot!\n\n1692\n01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:22,250\nI left the h out of show and\nI just put sow.\n\n1693\n01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,820\nSo when you get this you can\nuse your left and right arrows.\n\n1694\n01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,766\nNow I see this a lot, a lot of people\nwill take their mouse and go and\n\n1695\n01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:30,706\nclick right over,\noh I need to insert an H.\n\n1696\n01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:35,093\nWell, this is a terminal program, and when\nyou're connected via terminal programs,\n\n1697\n01:19:35,093 --> 01:19:37,299\nand telnet SSH, your mouse doesn't work.\n\n1698\n01:19:37,299 --> 01:19:39,203\nThe system doesn't even\nregister your mouse.\n\n1699\n01:19:39,203 --> 01:19:43,765\nSo if you click there, and start to type,\nsee how the h just appeared at the end?\n\n1700\n01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:44,786\nIt doesn't do any good.\n\n1701\n01:19:44,786 --> 01:19:48,910\nSo just get your mouse cursor out of\nthe way, pretend it doesn't exist, right?\n\n1702\n01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,620\nYou don't use your mouse.\n\n1703\n01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:55,590\nYou can use your left and right arrows to\nscroll all the way back if you want, or\n\n1704\n01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:59,350\non some keyboards, you can use like\nthe home key to jump to the beginning.\n\n1705\n01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,730\nIt's not working on mine.\n\n1706\n01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:03,840\nYou'll see that sometimes keys\ndon't work in the terminal program.\n\n1707\n01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,890\nSo Cisco built in a number of\nother shortcuts to help with this.\n\n1708\n01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:11,480\nSo, for example,\nmy typo is all the way at the beginning.\n\n1709\n01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,320\nI can hit Ctrl + A.\n\n1710\n01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:20,860\nCtrl + A jumps my cursor to the beginning\nand Ctrl + E jumps me to the end.\n\n1711\n01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:25,510\nSo control A and control E, are quick\nways to jump your cursor back and\n\n1712\n01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,800\nforth on the command line.\n\n1713\n01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,700\n>> Yup.\n\n1714\n01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,440\nSo those are actually very\nfast commands for us,\n\n1715\n01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,042\nthe other one's of course is it control,\npage down?\n\n1716\n01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:34,018\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, so if your up and\n\n1717\n01:20:34,018 --> 01:20:40,230\ndown arrows don't work you can use control\nP, LP, which is basically previous.\n\n1718\n01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,590\nAnd Ctrl+N for next.\n\n1719\n01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:44,870\nAnd so that simulates,\nthe up and down arrows.\n\n1720\n01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,841\nIf you're arrows keys don't work,\nwhich often times they don't.\n\n1721\n01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:51,810\nThen Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N do the same\nthing as those arrow keys.\n\n1722\n01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:52,380\n>> Yep.\n\n1723\n01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,740\nSo by using that in combination with\nthings like we've already shown you,\n\n1724\n01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,800\nlike the tab that helps autocomplete.\n\n1725\n01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,230\nAll these help us to, again,\nget rid of the errors we may face.\n\n1726\n01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:04,610\nAs well as to actually work quicker\ninside the command line interface.\n\n1727\n01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,950\nSo these are always good to help us here.\n\n1728\n01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:11,830\n>> Let me show, I wanna show off one more\ncommand that really comes in handy for me.\n\n1729\n01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,120\nLet's say that we're working real fast.\n\n1730\n01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,400\nRight?\nSo, whoops.\n\n1731\n01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,080\nNot that fast.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1732\n01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,710\n>> I can't even type.\n\n1733\n01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,140\nBut we're working fast.\n\n1734\n01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,650\nRight?\n\n1735\n01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,570\nSo, I get into my configuration,\nand I set a value.\n\n1736\n01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,820\nRight?\nSo, I get in here, and set a value.\n\n1737\n01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:32,390\nAnd, I get out, and I start to save.\n\n1738\n01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,130\nAnd, as I was typing.\n\n1739\n01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:34,820\n>> There it is.\n\n1740\n01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:39,010\n>> I was typing copy running-config,\nstartup-config.\n\n1741\n01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:42,180\nAs I was typing,\na system message popped up, and\n\n1742\n01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,390\ninterrupted my comman,d and\nthat really frustrates the heck out of me.\n\n1743\n01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:52,070\nBecause now, if I need to backspace,\nonce you backspace, after a certain point.\n\n1744\n01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:54,210\n>> Hey, look at that.\n>> It stops working.\n\n1745\n01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,870\nit's deleting another message.\n\n1746\n01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:59,940\nSo I don't know where I'm\nat anymore in the command.\n\n1747\n01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,320\nThere's a cool command which is CTRL+ R.\n\n1748\n01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:08,640\nAnd CTRL+ R will redraw or\nrepaint the line, and it'll lay it out,\n\n1749\n01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,850\nand you can see exactly where you\nleft off, and you can continue on.\n\n1750\n01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,300\nRight.\n\n1751\n01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:18,080\nIf you get interrupted mid command,\nCTRL+ R.\n\n1752\n01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,380\nThat's a real handy one to use.\n\n1753\n01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,860\nAnd yeah, so the shortcuts again,\nyou might see some of them on the exam.\n\n1754\n01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,410\nEspecially about being able to\nget the beginning of the line, or\n\n1755\n01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,010\nthe end of the line quickly.\n\n1756\n01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:33,200\nDoing the up arrows and down arrows, again\nbeing able to scroll through those again.\n\n1757\n01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:33,890\nYou'll probably see.\n\n1758\n01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,260\n>> All right so now.\n\n1759\n01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,820\n>> Now that we've kinda seen a little bit,\nand\n\n1760\n01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,350\nthe reason I wanted to\ncover that now Ronnie,\n\n1761\n01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,250\nis I know I'm about to make mistakes-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1762\n01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,495\nSure.\n>> And so I want everybody to know how I\n\n1763\n01:22:43,495 --> 01:22:44,980\ncorrect them.\n\n1764\n01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,640\nBut now let's take a look\nsome configurations.\n\n1765\n01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,150\nNow Ronnie, you mentioned that when we do,\n\n1766\n01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:54,520\nconfigure terminal, that that's taking\nus to the global configuration.\n\n1767\n01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,190\nAnd changes that I make here,\neffect the entire router,\n\n1768\n01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,056\nlike changing the host name.\n\n1769\n01:22:59,056 --> 01:23:00,614\nAll right.\n\n1770\n01:23:00,614 --> 01:23:06,030\nBut, I might want to make a change to\nsomething small, like an interface.\n\n1771\n01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,550\n>> Right.\n\n1772\n01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,520\n>> And I want a change to affect just\none interface, not all the interfaces.\n\n1773\n01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,110\nSo for that,\nwe need to get out of global mode.\n\n1774\n01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:14,430\nRight.\n\n1775\n01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:15,210\n>> Yup.\n\n1776\n01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:17,770\nSo here's another one that also\ngets you out of global mode, right.\n\n1777\n01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,550\nThe idea of CTRL+ Z or is it CTRL.\n\n1778\n01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:22,950\n>> Well, that gets you\ncompletely out of config, right.\n\n1779\n01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,000\nSo I use the N command earlier.\n\n1780\n01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,530\n>> Oh that's right.\n\n1781\n01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:29,020\n>> And if I do CTRL+l Z,\nthat does the N command\n\n1782\n01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:29,710\n>> There you go.\n\n1783\n01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,040\n>> Yeah, so same thing as end.\n\n1784\n01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,222\nWe can do Ctrl+Z.\n\n1785\n01:23:35,222 --> 01:23:37,530\nThere we go.\n\n1786\n01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:41,580\nAll right, but if I want to make a change\nto an interface, right,I would actually\n\n1787\n01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:46,350\nuse the interface command, and\nspecify a particular interface.\n\n1788\n01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:49,350\nSo maybe it's gigabitethernet0/0.\n\n1789\n01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:54,770\nAnd when I run that,\n>> Notice how my prompt changes.\n\n1790\n01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:58,140\nI'm no longer in global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n1791\n01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,510\nI'm now in interface configuration mode.\n\n1792\n01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:06,140\nAny change I make now,\nonly affects the interface that I'm in.\n\n1793\n01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,790\nIt doesn't affect any other interface.\n\n1794\n01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:11,750\n>> And so\nwhen you do see that 'config-if'.\n\n1795\n01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,620\n>> Again that shows you that you're only\ngonna make changes in that interface, and\n\n1796\n01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,300\nthats gonna be key for us.\n\n1797\n01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,580\nA lot of times, some particular commands\nare only gonna show up in that interface,\n\n1798\n01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,310\nso if you happen to look\nin the global config, and\n\n1799\n01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:25,760\nyou go, wait a minute why am\nI not seeing the IP address?\n\n1800\n01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,370\nOr something like that\n>> Take a look, make sure that the prompt\n\n1801\n01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:31,410\nis showing you what it's showing you,\nand then you'll be able to do so.\n\n1802\n01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:33,730\nNormally once we get to an interface,\na lot of times,\n\n1803\n01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:38,750\nwhat we want to make sure that we can now\ndo, is assign things like an IP address\n\n1804\n01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:43,410\nas well, and then of course we need to\nenable the actual interface as well.\n\n1805\n01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,590\nYeah.\n\n1806\n01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:48,375\nWhich brings up a good command,\nwhich is the shutdown command.\n\n1807\n01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,790\nRight.\nThe shut down command is what turns\n\n1808\n01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:55,660\nan interface off, and so that'll shut\nit down and stop it from working.\n\n1809\n01:24:55,660 --> 01:25:00,740\nThe no shutdown command is what turns\nit back on again, so when I run that,\n\n1810\n01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,730\nit's gonna enable the interface and\nbring it up and get it ready to go.\n\n1811\n01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,200\nNow, see how my interface\nis gonna come up, but\n\n1812\n01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,100\nit's gonna go down again here in a second,\nand that's because I don't have any\n\n1813\n01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,870\ncables plugged into it, so\nit's just kinda dead in the water.\n\n1814\n01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:16,400\nOh, you know, it didn't fully come up,\n\n1815\n01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,420\nso I guess we should\nprobably talk about that.\n\n1816\n01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:24,260\nEvery Cisco interface\nactually has two statuses, so\n\n1817\n01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,110\nyou have a line status, and\nyou have a protocol status, right.\n\n1818\n01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:32,260\nThe line status is simply whether\nthe physical port is turned on or off.\n\n1819\n01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:36,550\nAnd so that's the message that I'm getting\nright here, is the link status here,\n\n1820\n01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,820\nletting me know that the state is up.\n\n1821\n01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,880\nBut I never received a message\nabout the protocol right.\n\n1822\n01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,130\nWhich means that the TCP IP side,\n\n1823\n01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:46,770\nthe actual functionality of it,\nnever truly came up.\n\n1824\n01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:49,250\nAnd that's cuz there's no cable\nplugged in, there's no link light.\n\n1825\n01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,740\n>> Yup.\nAnd the other thing\n\n1826\n01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,220\nthat Don just mentioned here,\nwhich is actually very important for\n\n1827\n01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,810\nus as well,\nis the use of the word, enable.\n\n1828\n01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:58,590\nA lot of times,\na command like shutdown, and\n\n1829\n01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:02,710\nno shutdown When we actually do them fast,\nthat's all we think of.\n\n1830\n01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:03,240\nOn the exam,\n\n1831\n01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,560\nyou may see they talk about the idea\nof enabling the gigabit interface.\n\n1832\n01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,000\nSo you've gotta remember,\n\n1833\n01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,630\nthat that actually means that you have\nto enable the no shut down command.\n\n1834\n01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,520\nOr if they ask you to\ndisable the interface,\n\n1835\n01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,680\nmeans that you actually\nenter the shut down command.\n\n1836\n01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,260\nYep.\n>> Sometimes the terms get confusing,\n\n1837\n01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,210\nespecially when you're\nunder the time pressure.\n\n1838\n01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,650\nSo make sure you pay attention\nto that terminology as well.\n\n1839\n01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:24,610\n>> Now this was the first time we\nget to see negating a command.\n\n1840\n01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:25,410\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1841\n01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:28,660\n>> In the Cisco world, it's really cool,\nif you want to do something.\n\n1842\n01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:32,080\nAnd then you wanna undo it,\nit's not a separate command.\n\n1843\n01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,870\n>> No.\n>> You just add the word, no,\n\n1844\n01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:35,290\nto whatever you did.\n\n1845\n01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,970\nSo if I issue the shutdown command\nto turn the interface off.\n\n1846\n01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,050\nAnd I wanna turn it back on,\n\n1847\n01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:45,440\nI just say no, shut down, and\nalmost every command works that way.\n\n1848\n01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,590\nIf I assign an IP address,\nso I assign this guy,\n\n1849\n01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:55,090\nthat's getting annoying, we should\nfix that, we're running low on time.\n\n1850\n01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:57,930\nSo if I go in there and\nI assign an IP address to this interface,\n\n1851\n01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:00,377\nby saying IP address, 192.168.0.1.\n\n1852\n01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:02,800\n255.255.255.0.\nThat assigns an IP, great.\n\n1853\n01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:09,580\nIf I wanna remove the IP,\nI can just say no IP address, like that.\n\n1854\n01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:16,390\nAnd now the IP address has been removed.\n\n1855\n01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:20,340\nSo you really only have one command\nto learn, you learn the command to\n\n1856\n01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:24,520\nconfigure it, and then to undo it ,you\njust stick the word no at the beginning.\n\n1857\n01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:28,770\nVery important for us,\nespecially in this configuration.\n\n1858\n01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:31,570\nThe reason why we need to put an IP\naddress on this particular interface,\n\n1859\n01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:38,320\nis so that we can now again get access to\nthat interface across the network as well.\n\n1860\n01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,563\nSo I want to set this up,\nwe actually need the host name.\n\n1861\n01:27:41,563 --> 01:27:46,143\nWe need to get into an interface here,\nassign at least an IP address for us,\n\n1862\n01:27:46,143 --> 01:27:47,611\nenable the interface.\n\n1863\n01:27:47,611 --> 01:27:53,150\nAnd then we may also need to at this\npoint configure the teletype access?\n\n1864\n01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:56,250\n>> Yeah, let's do this Ronnie.\n\n1865\n01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,500\nI think we've covered all\nour basic commands now.\n\n1866\n01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,230\nWe covered interacting with the CLI,\nwe covered saving the config.\n\n1867\n01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:06,160\nNow it is time to get in there and\nreally do some true configuration stuff.\n\n1868\n01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:13,650\nSo let's do this, I'm going to wipe\nthe configuration on this router,\n\n1869\n01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:18,260\nand I mentioned how the start up config is\nwhat is used when you boot your system up,\n\n1870\n01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,510\nwhen you start it.\n\n1871\n01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:22,800\nWhat I'm gonna do is,\n\n1872\n01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,861\nI'm gonna say delete start up-config,\n\n1873\n01:28:28,861 --> 01:28:34,610\nI'm sorry, clear start up-config.\n\n1874\n01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,940\nThere we go.\n\n1875\n01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,230\nSo I'm going to clear up\nthe start up config just so\n\n1876\n01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,560\nthat I know my router is blank.\n\n1877\n01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,070\nAnd I'm going to reboot it.\n\n1878\n01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:45,160\nNow, you reboot a router\nusing the reload command.\n\n1879\n01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,520\nReload is the equivalent of reboot for\na Cisco device, so\n\n1880\n01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:53,190\nI ran clear startup dash config\nthat erases the startup config, and\n\n1881\n01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:55,660\nnow my system has no\nconfiguration when it boots up.\n\n1882\n01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,070\nIt'll be fresh and clean and brand new.\n\n1883\n01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:02,600\nReload is gonna reboot it, and once it\nreboots it'll be a nice blank router.\n\n1884\n01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,160\nAnd now that we have a understanding\nof the command prompt when we get\n\n1885\n01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,170\nback from break, we're gonna\nrun through that initial setup.\n\n1886\n01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,040\nWhat you need to do to\nget your system ready.\n\n1887\n01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> To remote into it and\n\n1888\n01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,180\nstart to do some work.\n\n1889\n01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,080\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1890\n01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,150\n>> So I'll reboot it during the break,\nthat way,\n\n1891\n01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,520\nwe don't have to hear the loud fans and\nall that stuff while it runs.\n\n1892\n01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,540\nAnd when we get back, more configuration.\n\n1893\n01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:20,680\nAnything else to throw in?\n\n1894\n01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,420\n>> Nope, we're ready to go.\n\n1895\n01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,610\n>> All right, let's stop here.\n\n1896\n01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:26,360\nStay tuned for the exciting conclusion\nof configuring our router and\n\n1897\n01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,215\nwe'll see you in a few minutes.\n\n1898\n01:29:29,215 --> 01:29:36,551\n[SOUND] [SOUND] Just\ngonna break out in song?\n\n1899\n01:29:36,551 --> 01:29:38,357\n>> [LAUGH] Hey.\n\n1900\n01:29:38,357 --> 01:29:38,857\n>> I hope not.\n>> Oh my [LAUGH].\n\n1901\n01:29:38,857 --> 01:29:40,130\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1902\n01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:43,470\nSo [LAUGH] it's the musical\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n1903\n01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,060\n>> I know.\n\n1904\n01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,530\n>> All right, so.\n\n1905\n01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,450\nDuring the break, I went ahead and\nreset the router so\n\n1906\n01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:51,160\nit's all back to factory defaults and\nwhat I want to do now, is I want to\n\n1907\n01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:55,370\nrun through all the commands that we'd\nhave to use to basically set things up\n\n1908\n01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:58,380\nthe way that that initial configuration\nwizard would have done it for us.\n\n1909\n01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,780\nSo we're just going to run through those,\n\n1910\n01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,540\nthere's a lot more to configure\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1911\n01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,300\n>> On the routers, but we're just hitting\non the initial ones here because this is\n\n1912\n01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,870\nour first configuration episode.\n\n1913\n01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:06,710\n>> That's right, yep.\n\n1914\n01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:09,840\nSo for us, we're gonna go back\nthrough these commands manually so\n\n1915\n01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,320\nas we actually get changed back here.\n\n1916\n01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,990\nWe wanna make sure we set up a host name,\nwe wanna also make sure that we get in and\n\n1917\n01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,830\nwe are able to configure an interface so\n\n1918\n01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:23,040\nthat we can give access to it, and then\nwe're gonna configure some passwords and\n\n1919\n01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,450\nwhat we need to make sure\nthat we have passwords for.\n\n1920\n01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:28,740\nAnd then we'll also configure\na password for telnet access.\n\n1921\n01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:32,560\n>> Yep, so let's dive in,\nlet's get into our command line here so.\n\n1922\n01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,470\nYou'll see I've got the router up now\nwhere it's asking me if I wanna go through\n\n1923\n01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,610\nthat initial setup, and\nI'm just gonna say no.\n\n1924\n01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:42,030\nAnd that's when we start to see that\ndeluge of interfaces initializing, right?\n\n1925\n01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:46,300\nSo we're about to see all those interfaces\ntell me that their status is going up,\n\n1926\n01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,730\nsome of them go back down, various things.\n\n1927\n01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:51,960\nAnd as soon as it settles down,\nand then we can get into action.\n\n1928\n01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,660\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n1929\n01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,170\nI say that and\n>> There it goes.\n\n1930\n01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:56,785\n>> There we go, I'm being impatient.\n\n1931\n01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,280\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1932\n01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,780\n>> So there it is.\n\n1933\n01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:00,470\nIt's gonna take a little bit of time here\n\n1934\n01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:02,580\nbecause this is a fancy router.\n\n1935\n01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,210\nAnd so there we are.\n\n1936\n01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:07,030\nWe are starting off with the initial\nblank configuration there.\n\n1937\n01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:09,010\nOnce everything settles down here.\n\n1938\n01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:11,840\nWe're inside of our user mode and\nso at this point,\n\n1939\n01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,110\nwe want to be able to assign a host name.\n\n1940\n01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,680\nThat means for us, we need to\nget into our privileged mode and\n\n1941\n01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,590\nthen go directly into the global\nconfiguration prompt.\n\n1942\n01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,890\nSo by typing enable we\nget in privilege and\n\n1943\n01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:26,216\nthen configure terminal, we go into our\nglobal configuration prompt at this point.\n\n1944\n01:31:26,216 --> 01:31:29,920\nNow, once we're here, we of course\nnow need to assign a host name.\n\n1945\n01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,420\nNow, in terms of the host name,\n\n1946\n01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,570\nthis should be of course a unique name\nthat you can use inside your network.\n\n1947\n01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,390\nDoesn't have to be unique\nacross the entire world, but\n\n1948\n01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,760\nat least inside your network here.\n\n1949\n01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,130\nWanna make sure that we do have\nour host name ready and available.\n\n1950\n01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,380\nAnd remember, your end users are never\ngoing to see this host name.\n\n1951\n01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,330\nIt's for you.\n\n1952\n01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:48,010\nIt's for the network admin to keep\ntrack of what router this is.\n\n1953\n01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:51,050\n>> So once we have the host name on it,\nif I want to provide for\n\n1954\n01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:54,160\nnetwork access because I want to\ndo something like telnet access,\n\n1955\n01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,290\nI need an interface for\nus to able to get access into.\n\n1956\n01:31:57,290 --> 01:32:01,970\nSo we're gonna go ahead and get into\nan interface configuration prompt here.\n\n1957\n01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:05,120\nSo we're going into our\ngigabit interface 0/0, and\n\n1958\n01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:11,550\nnow at our interface configuration prompt,\nwe are now ready to assign an IP address.\n\n1959\n01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:12,590\nGood thing about, again,\n\n1960\n01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:16,000\nCisco commands is that it's\na relatively easy command for us.\n\n1961\n01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,330\nIP address and then, of course, we assign\nthe IP address and the subnet mask.\n\n1962\n01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:23,810\nAnd we do have to type\nout the subnet mask here.\n\n1963\n01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,110\n>> And\nif you don't remember what to type next.\n\n1964\n01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,550\n>> Yep.\n>> You can always use your question mark.\n\n1965\n01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,050\n>> That's right.\n>> Right?\n\n1966\n01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,740\nSo if I say like IP address and\n\n1967\n01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:36,320\nthen I do a question it tells me to\ntype in A.B.C.D, the IP address, right?\n\n1968\n01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,690\nAnd then if I do another question mark\nit'll tell me, now the subnet mask right?\n\n1969\n01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:45,310\n255, 255, 255, 0 and if I do\nanother question mark it says, hey,\n\n1970\n01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:49,030\nnow's a good time to press return,\nthere is that carriage return.\n\n1971\n01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,371\nPress Enter now.\n\n1972\n01:32:50,371 --> 01:32:51,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1973\n01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,370\nthat's exactly what I'm going to do.\n\n1974\n01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:54,730\n>> Don't forget that on a router,\n\n1975\n01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:58,680\nthe physical interfaces\nare normally turned off by default.\n\n1976\n01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,520\nSo we want to make sure we enable this\nby issuing the no shutdown command.\n\n1977\n01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,340\nThis will bring that interface up and\nready for us to go, and\n\n1978\n01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:10,530\nso once it actually does\nchange to the upstate,\n\n1979\n01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:13,880\nwe are now ready to start talking\nabout the idea of passwords here.\n\n1980\n01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,150\n>> There we go, so I got my link up and\nI got my line protocol,\n\n1981\n01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:20,440\nthe protocol status is up because\nduring the break I went ahead and\n\n1982\n01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,310\nplugged a cable in there, so\nit is up and that interface is happy.\n\n1983\n01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:26,900\nNow, when I'm in a sub interface,\n\n1984\n01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,310\nif I wanna get back to\nthe global configuration.\n\n1985\n01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:34,790\nIf I use the end command like earlier, it\ntakes me all the way out of configuration.\n\n1986\n01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:39,900\nBut if I just type Exit,\nexit will exit a individual interface or\n\n1987\n01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,920\nindividual configuration prompt and\ntake you back to global mode, so\n\n1988\n01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:46,510\nI'm still in config,\nI've just gotten out of that sub prompt.\n\n1989\n01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:47,420\n>> So usually for us,\n\n1990\n01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:53,110\nwe have to assign at least one password\nto be able to give us the administrative\n\n1991\n01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:57,180\nprivileges that we need which we call\nthe idea of that enable password.\n\n1992\n01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:00,020\nNow remember, we have two different\ntypes that we can do here, right?\n\n1993\n01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:03,650\nWe have the enable password and\nwe have enable secret.\n\n1994\n01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:07,340\nRemember that we want to actually again,\nwe can assign one or the other.\n\n1995\n01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,770\nSo here, Don is configuring the ID of\nenable secret and then enable password.\n\n1996\n01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:14,850\nRemember what the differences here are.\n\n1997\n01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:18,190\nEnable secret means we're storing\nthe password as a hash, and\n\n1998\n01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,140\nenable password means we're\nstoring it in the clear text here.\n\n1999\n01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,968\nNow Don, before I go on here, because this\ncan get a little bit confusing, right?\n\n2000\n01:34:23,968 --> 01:34:25,510\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n2001\n01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:26,552\nLet me show them.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2002\n01:34:26,552 --> 01:34:27,430\n>> Is that where you're headed?\n\n2003\n01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,020\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's it.\n\n2004\n01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,920\n>> Yeah.\nSo let's take a look at how this actually\n\n2005\n01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,350\nlooks in the configuration.\n\n2006\n01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,170\nNormally for me, I don't even\nbother to set an enable password.\n\n2007\n01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,230\nI just leave that off.\n\n2008\n01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,850\nThere's no point in having it\ncuz it is stored unencrypted and\n\n2009\n01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:40,840\nit is a security weakness.\n\n2010\n01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,750\nThat's right, so, on most modern\nequipment and on the exam, enable secret\n\n2011\n01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:49,640\nis the one you want to use because it\nis the one that provides encryption.\n\n2012\n01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,730\nI'm gonna use a long drawn out command\nhere because I want to view the config\n\n2013\n01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:57,060\nthat just shows these lines so\ndon't worry about this one just yet.\n\n2014\n01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,360\nI'm going to just kind\nof filter a little bit.\n\n2015\n01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,452\nThere we go.\n\n2016\n01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:07,400\nAll right, so here's the two lines as\nthey're stored in the Cisco configuration.\n\n2017\n01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,670\nAnd you can see enable password Cisco321.\n\n2018\n01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,110\nI can read it plain as day right\nthere in the configuration.\n\n2019\n01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:14,680\nThere's my password.\n\n2020\n01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:19,560\nI also see enable secret Five,\nthat lets me know it's\n\n2021\n01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:25,500\nan MD5 hash,\nfollowed by $1$QQ30 and so on.\n\n2022\n01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,560\nSo that is the salt and\n\n2023\n01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,530\nthe hash that is the encrypted value\nthat represents the hash for my type.\n\n2024\n01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:37,050\nNow I know that that means Cisco 123,\nbut if somebody gets a hold of that,\n\n2025\n01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:42,020\nthey're not going to know what that is,\nand so it's not gonna do them any good.\n\n2026\n01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:45,058\n>> And so this actually helps us\nespecially if somebody's walking past us,\n\n2027\n01:35:45,058 --> 01:35:47,561\nand us typing in the show running config,\nand they see that.\n\n2028\n01:35:47,561 --> 01:35:51,138\nNow they take a look and they see enable\nsecret here and they're like, and\n\n2029\n01:35:51,138 --> 01:35:54,607\nhow do I remember that, that's\na little harder to actually remember.\n\n2030\n01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:57,127\nSo here Don is removing\nthe actual enable password.\n\n2031\n01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,560\nNow Don, before we go on,\nwhat if I leave them both configured?\n\n2032\n01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,280\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n2033\n01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,730\nWhich one do I actually enter in?\n\n2034\n01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:06,760\n>> If you leave them both configured, they\nactually both work, and so there's your\n\n2035\n01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,996\nrisk is that if somebody gets the weaker\none, they can still get in with it.\n\n2036\n01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:13,620\nNow, the router will always try\nthe secret one first but if it fails,\n\n2037\n01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:16,580\nit will use the other one, so\nit is a bit of a vulnerability.\n\n2038\n01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:20,720\nLike I said, you're better off just\nnot setting an enable password but\n\n2039\n01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,040\ndo set enable secret.\n\n2040\n01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:27,170\n>> So this will give us that ability to\nbe able to get in to that administrator\n\n2041\n01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,440\nmode where we need.\n\n2042\n01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,640\nSo when we do try to connect in,\nwe're gonna end up in the user prompt.\n\n2043\n01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:36,210\nFor us to be able to type in the word,\nenable, this is what's gonna ask us for\n\n2044\n01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:37,540\nthe password, here.\n\n2045\n01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:41,300\nSo if we have both set,\nit's gonna try the enable secret first.\n\n2046\n01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:44,310\nIf that doesn't work,\nwe can always try the enable password.\n\n2047\n01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:47,050\nSo Don is telling us,\nleave the enable password off.\n\n2048\n01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:48,110\nAnd just leave the secret in here.\n\n2049\n01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:50,460\nAnd that means you and I will\nactually be the only ones that know.\n\n2050\n01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:53,670\nAlong with anyone that's\nwatching us right now.\n\n2051\n01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:54,230\nOkay?\nYeah.\n\n2052\n01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,750\n>> All right.\nSo, so far,\n\n2053\n01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,590\nwe have set an IP address on the interface\nand turned the interface on.\n\n2054\n01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:00,470\nWe have set a host name.\n\n2055\n01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:04,130\nWe set a enable password to\nsecure our privilege mode.\n\n2056\n01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:08,840\nThe other thing that this set up wizard\ndid was to set a password up for\n\n2057\n01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,130\na remote connections for\ntelnet and SSH connections.\n\n2058\n01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:15,380\nSo that's the last thing that we needed\nto do to completely mirror it exactly\n\n2059\n01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,240\nwhat that set up wizard does.\n\n2060\n01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,420\nLet's go set up a password for that.\n\n2061\n01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:21,460\nWhen you telnet into a router or\n\n2062\n01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:25,880\na switch, what you're connecting to\nare virtual teletype lines or VTY lines.\n\n2063\n01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:26,390\nAll right.\n\n2064\n01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:31,920\nYour router comes with\nfive VTY lines by default.\n\n2065\n01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,990\nYour switches come with 16 by default.\n\n2066\n01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:38,630\nNow, they're virtual, so\nwhen I say by default, you can change it,\n\n2067\n01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:41,630\nif you want your router to\nhave 16 you can, if you want\n\n2068\n01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:45,800\nyour switch to have more or less you can,\nthere's not really a need for it, but\n\n2069\n01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,880\nthey do have a slightly different\nnumber based on the device by default.\n\n2070\n01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:53,180\n>> So for us that's our next configuration\nthat we want to be able to get\n\n2071\n01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:54,310\nin and do here.\n\n2072\n01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:58,630\nSo for us to access those\nvirtual lines for us, and\n\n2073\n01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:03,230\nto only affect those virtual lines with\nthis, we have to get into that command.\n\n2074\n01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:05,390\nSo for us here,\nDon is ready to type it in.\n\n2075\n01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:10,638\nNotice the command is line vty 0 4.\n\n2076\n01:38:10,638 --> 01:38:14,315\nAnd that means affect all five\nteletype lines at this point.\n\n2077\n01:38:14,315 --> 01:38:16,250\n>> Now Cisco starts numbering with 0.\n\n2078\n01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,930\nEverything starts with 0.\n\n2079\n01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:20,630\nSo your first interface is interface 0.\n\n2080\n01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:23,120\nYour first VTY line is VTY 0.\n\n2081\n01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:26,140\nSo I'm saying VTY 0 through 4,\n\n2082\n01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:29,190\nthat's the five lines that\nwe have built in by default.\n\n2083\n01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:31,860\nOn a switch, it would be 0, 15, right.\n\n2084\n01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:34,120\nRemember I said there were 16 by default.\n\n2085\n01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,850\nIf we start numbering at 0, it's 0 to 15.\n\n2086\n01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:40,620\n>> Yeah, so at this point if we go ahead\nand press Enter, we now let's go ahead and\n\n2087\n01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,530\nuse a question mark here.\n\n2088\n01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:45,560\nFor us, we wanna set up a password here.\n\n2089\n01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,860\nOkay, so that we can log on using\nthese virtual teletype lines, so\n\n2090\n01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,620\nthe good thing is I can\nactually just use my,\n\n2091\n01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,510\nagain the question mark here\nuntil I see how I set a password.\n\n2092\n01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:59,400\nAnd look at that, it's fairly easy for me.\n\n2093\n01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,290\nNow what if I forget to set a password?\n\n2094\n01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:04,370\nWell it will prompt me for it,\nif I actually do another command here.\n\n2095\n01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:08,010\nBut let's go ahead and\nset our password at this point.\n\n2096\n01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:14,320\nAnd you'll see here the password\nfollowed by line and\n\n2097\n01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,130\nit says the unencrypted\ncleartext line password.\n\n2098\n01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:19,360\nSo I can just say password and\nwhatever I want it to be.\n\n2099\n01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,220\nI'll do Cisco123.\n\n2100\n01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,060\n>> And so this is actually a very\nimportant point for us to too.\n\n2101\n01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,710\nWhenever you see that word LINE and\nit's all in capital letters.\n\n2102\n01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,780\nThat doesn't mean you type in the word,\nline.\n\n2103\n01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:31,840\nAs much as I think I remember trying to do\nthat, why the heck isn't it working here,\n\n2104\n01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,250\nit actually means for you to make a word\nor to actually create a different word for\n\n2105\n01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:37,710\nyou, to actually type it in.\n\n2106\n01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,400\nSo don't be confused by it.\n\n2107\n01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,332\nSo when I use it that in all capital\nletters it means create a work, okay,\n\n2108\n01:39:42,332 --> 01:39:42,850\nand paste here.\n\n2109\n01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:46,670\nSo now that we have the patchwork,\nwe're not really done yet, are we?\n\n2110\n01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:50,190\n>> Yeah, this is where ti gets really\nconfusing, on some routers you are done.\n\n2111\n01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,680\nBut on a lot of them you're not,\njust setting the password isn't enough.\n\n2112\n01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,810\nYou also need to tell the router\nto ask for the password.\n\n2113\n01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,190\nSome of them do it by default.\n\n2114\n01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:00,300\nYeah.\n>> Some don't.\n\n2115\n01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,620\n>> I make it a rule of thumb\nto just assume they don't.\n\n2116\n01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,650\n>> Yeah.\n>> And the way you tell it to ask for\n\n2117\n01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:07,110\nthe password is to issue\nthe login command.\n\n2118\n01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:07,620\nAll right?\n\n2119\n01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:10,810\nIt's a simple command just login,\nit's got no modifiers.\n\n2120\n01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,555\nI don't think it has any modifiers,\ndoes it?\n\n2121\n01:40:12,555 --> 01:40:13,310\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it can!\n\n2122\n01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:14,790\n>> It does have local, yeah.\n\n2123\n01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:17,570\nAll right, but\nlog in by itself is the one that we want.\n\n2124\n01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:22,480\nAnd that tells it if somebody\nconnects to a VTY, make them log in,\n\n2125\n01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:27,110\nrequire them to provide some kind of a\npassword to be able to get into the system\n\n2126\n01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,050\nand to work with it.\n\n2127\n01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:30,900\n>> And the nice thing about the way\nthat Cisco does this here too.\n\n2128\n01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,030\nIs that if we were to\njust enter in login and\n\n2129\n01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:36,910\nforgot to actually have set a password,\nit will tell us.\n\n2130\n01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:39,200\nIt's not gonna actually set\nuntil you create a password.\n\n2131\n01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:43,260\nSo it's kind of nice to remind\nyou on some of these things.\n\n2132\n01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,080\n>> So once we've got that in place\n>> Now I've done\n\n2133\n01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,660\nall the things that the Set Up Wizard did,\nwe've done it by hand.\n\n2134\n01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,840\n>> Right\n>> I'm gonna get\n\n2135\n01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,080\nout of the config by typing end.\n\n2136\n01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,890\nNow the end command takes you all the way\nout of config, but that's what I want.\n\n2137\n01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,770\nIf I just did exit,\nit would take me to global config.\n\n2138\n01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:02,000\nI'll do ending it all the way out.\n\n2139\n01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,450\nAnd I'll save my configuration.\n\n2140\n01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:06,580\n>> And that is one of the most important\nthings that we can do here, okay?\n\n2141\n01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,210\nSo, if we do the whole thing,\nand I simply now hit Reload, and\n\n2142\n01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:11,345\nI didn't save anything.\n\n2143\n01:41:11,345 --> 01:41:12,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm in trouble here.\n\n2144\n01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,040\nIt means I have to start all over.\n\n2145\n01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,660\nSo make sure that when you do\nmake your configurations here,\n\n2146\n01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,950\nthat you are saving your configurations.\n\n2147\n01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:22,580\nAnd so this is where Don issued the Copy.\n\n2148\n01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,730\nOkay.\nJust wanna make sure.\n\n2149\n01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:28,550\nThe copy-run-start here, and\nthat actually helps us to save this.\n\n2150\n01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:31,270\nWe should end up seeing the idea of the,\nok,\n\n2151\n01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:34,780\nand that tells that everything was\ncopied from the running config,\n\n2152\n01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:39,580\nwhich is in our RAM into the nv RAM\nwhich is the start up configure.\n\n2153\n01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,720\nThis means that this should\npersist through the reboot.\n\n2154\n01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,330\n>> Now we are all saved.\n\n2155\n01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:47,487\nAnd the cool part here is that now\nthat I've done this configuration,\n\n2156\n01:41:47,487 --> 01:41:50,938\nI can take a look at it and just verify\nthat everything stayed and is in place.\n\n2157\n01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:55,260\nI am gonna do a show running-config.\n\n2158\n01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:59,020\nAnd when I run that command, it'll show\nwhat's running on the system right now and\n\n2159\n01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,630\nI can start looking for\nthe commands that we typed.\n\n2160\n01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:05,540\nSo I can start with,\nhere's the host name that we set.\n\n2161\n01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:10,940\nI can see here's the enable secret and\nthen that hash, right.\n\n2162\n01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,560\nSo I see that.\n\n2163\n01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,085\nAs I keep scrolling down, and I'm\nchoosing the spacebar to advance screens.\n\n2164\n01:42:17,085 --> 01:42:23,640\nHere's interface Gigabitethernet0/0 and\nyou can see the IP address that I set.\n\n2165\n01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,180\n>> And what we wanna make sure of here.\n\n2166\n01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,937\nIf you actually are examining this and\nverifying it,\n\n2167\n01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:31,400\nis notice under GigabitEthernet0/1\nit has the word shutdown.\n\n2168\n01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,267\nYou wanna make sure that that word does\nnot appear inside of the interface that\n\n2169\n01:42:35,267 --> 01:42:36,910\nyou've just enabled.\n\n2170\n01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,800\nIf it does, it's not gonna work for you.\n\n2171\n01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,247\n>> Yeah, and we ran no shutdown on\nthe interface, and no shutdown,\n\n2172\n01:42:42,247 --> 01:42:44,140\nit doesn't show up here, does it?\n\n2173\n01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,300\nIt disappeared.\n\n2174\n01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:47,760\nWhen a command is like that,\nwhen you know you typed it but\n\n2175\n01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,730\nit doesn't show up,\nthat usually means it's a default.\n\n2176\n01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:53,670\nSo the default for\nthis interface is to not be shut down.\n\n2177\n01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,140\nSo when I ran no shutdown.\n\n2178\n01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,620\nIt's not showing up.\n\n2179\n01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:59,720\nNow I did not type shutdown\non this interface and\n\n2180\n01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:04,040\nthat's because it is part of the factory\ndefault config, so that was there.\n\n2181\n01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,740\nAnd if I did did no shutdown,\nit would disappear from here also.\n\n2182\n01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:11,400\nAll right, and\nif I keep advancing forward,\n\n2183\n01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,460\neventually I will get to this\nguy right here, line vty 0 4.\n\n2184\n01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:22,395\nI can see where we set our password of\nCISCO123 and we enabled the login process.\n\n2185\n01:43:22,395 --> 01:43:22,975\n>> Yeah.\n\n2186\n01:43:22,975 --> 01:43:25,445\nSo for the basic configuration,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n2187\n01:43:25,445 --> 01:43:28,035\nNow, does that mean we're any\nwhere close to being done?\n\n2188\n01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,345\nNo.\n>> No.\n\n2189\n01:43:29,345 --> 01:43:32,670\nWhat we've done is the bare minimum.\n\n2190\n01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:35,890\nTo be able to remotely connect\nto the system and work.\n\n2191\n01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:38,780\nRight now, I'm connected to this\ndevice with a console cable, and\n\n2192\n01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,740\nthe console cable's only,\nwhat, six foot long?\n\n2193\n01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:42,452\nMaybe eight foot long or\nsomething like that.\n\n2194\n01:43:42,452 --> 01:43:44,806\nIt's probably seven since that's\nthe one I didn't say, but\n\n2195\n01:43:44,806 --> 01:43:46,991\nthat means I've gotta be right\nhere with the equipment.\n\n2196\n01:43:46,991 --> 01:43:50,091\nI might be in a noisy server room or\nwhatever.\n\n2197\n01:43:50,091 --> 01:43:54,234\nNow that I've got this basic configuration\non it, I can go to my office where\n\n2198\n01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:58,140\nit's nice and quiet, remote in,\nand finish up my work, right?\n\n2199\n01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,990\nAnd I'm not plugged in to\nthe same network as that device.\n\n2200\n01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,850\nLet's demonstrate,\njust kinda connecting remotely.\n\n2201\n01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know what?\n\n2202\n01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:11,910\nLet me jump over to this switch and\nlet me drop my cable.\n\n2203\n01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:15,530\n>> Now at this particular point here,\nokay, what have we done?\n\n2204\n01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:20,370\nWe've now set it up to now where we can\nuse puTTY to be able to use the Telnet\n\n2205\n01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:25,190\ninside a puTTY to be able to\nconnect into the actual router.\n\n2206\n01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:30,110\nSo as long as my particular\nlaptop is on the same network\n\n2207\n01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:34,820\nas the actual router, I should be\nable to connect into that gigabit\n\n2208\n01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:39,840\nethernet zero port using the ip address\nthere to be able to connect in and\n\n2209\n01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,360\nget access to that command\nline console as well.\n\n2210\n01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:46,301\nSo what Don is doing right now is\nactually making sure that everything is\n\n2211\n01:44:46,301 --> 01:44:48,855\nactually configured and so\nthat we can connect directly to it,\n\n2212\n01:44:48,855 --> 01:44:51,570\nbecause we're actually on\na different network here.\n\n2213\n01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:56,059\nAnd if anybody can do it quickly as Don-\n>> I know, I accidentally created VLAN,\n\n2214\n01:44:56,059 --> 01:44:59,210\njust get that out of there.\n\n2215\n01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:02,270\nSo at this bigger point here,\nthat's what's happening,\n\n2216\n01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:06,070\nhe's connecting the actual\nrouter into a switch port and\n\n2217\n01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:10,380\nnow he's ready to connect and so he's\nready to show us how to do Telnet here.\n\n2218\n01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:14,190\n>> So I jumped over to the switch because\nthe router is plugged right into it.\n\n2219\n01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:17,720\nWe could use a PC,\na laptop, OSX, or whatever.\n\n2220\n01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,770\nWe configured enough for\nTelnet access, so on another device\n\n2221\n01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:28,440\nyou could say telnet 192.168.0.1 and\nthat will open up a remote\n\n2222\n01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:32,590\nshell to the system via the network\ninstead of via console cable.\n\n2223\n01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:33,240\nSo I'll do that.\n\n2224\n01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,960\nAnd when I connect to the router,\nyou'll see right here.\n\n2225\n01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,660\nUser access verification.\n\n2226\n01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:39,640\nPlease type in your password.\n\n2227\n01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,240\nWe set our password to Cisco123.\n\n2228\n01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,320\nAnd I punch that in, and here I am.\n\n2229\n01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,570\nI'm on the router.\n\n2230\n01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:48,570\nI can enable, and\nwe set our enable password,\n\n2231\n01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:52,470\nI set it also to Cisco123, and here I am.\n\n2232\n01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:57,390\nNow I'm in the router, I can work with it,\nI'm connected remotely instead of\n\n2233\n01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:02,480\nbeing right there tethered to\nthe system via console cable.\n\n2234\n01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,650\nAnd I can see that if I do like a,\nlet's see.\n\n2235\n01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:07,150\n>> Show sessions?\n\n2236\n01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:09,250\n>> Is it, I thought it was show user.\n\n2237\n01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:12,710\nShow users with an s.\n\n2238\n01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:13,860\nOkay, you got me.\n\n2239\n01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:15,460\nSo show users.\n\n2240\n01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:20,170\nI can see right here that the one\nthat has a star by it, that's you.\n\n2241\n01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:25,715\nSo I can see that I am connected on VTY 0,\nso I know that I'm connected on a virtual\n\n2242\n01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:29,820\nteletype line, I'm telnetted in and\nI'm connected and I'm able to configure.\n\n2243\n01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:31,490\nI could unplug my console cable and\n\n2244\n01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:35,950\nwalk away now and\ncontinue to work with the system.\n\n2245\n01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,520\n>> That's really the goal for\nwhat we're doing.\n\n2246\n01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,300\nNext time when we actually\nget back into this.\n\n2247\n01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,980\nWe've got a lot of other\nthings that we want to set up.\n\n2248\n01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:42,650\n>> A lot more.\n\n2249\n01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:44,960\n>> Especially the idea of\nsecuring the access, and\n\n2250\n01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,080\nthat's usually the one that\nwe really wanna set up here.\n\n2251\n01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,330\n>> Yeah, we've got Telnet up and\nrunning right now.\n\n2252\n01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:52,620\nTelnet is a non-encrypted shell,\nwhich means it is not secure.\n\n2253\n01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,830\nIt's not something you want\nto use in production anymore.\n\n2254\n01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:58,630\nSo setting up SSH is another big step.\n\n2255\n01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:03,380\nAssigning more advanced authentication,\nusername and password authentication,\n\n2256\n01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:07,330\nconfiguring routing, this router still\nwon't route the way that it is right now.\n\n2257\n01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:10,040\nSo we've really just broken\nthe tip of the iceberg.\n\n2258\n01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:11,540\nNow the configuration we've done so\n\n2259\n01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:15,990\nfar, every command we've done, is valid\nnot just on a router but on a switch.\n\n2260\n01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:18,820\nThese are the same things we\nwould do on a switch also.\n\n2261\n01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:20,230\nSo this is very common.\n\n2262\n01:47:20,230 --> 01:47:21,790\nIt's part of that initial setup.\n\n2263\n01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:22,360\n>> Yep.\nSo\n\n2264\n01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,050\nyou see that that's what we\nreally want to make sure of.\n\n2265\n01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:28,450\nWe're at the beginning, we want to make\nsure that you know and feel comfortable\n\n2266\n01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,880\nabout being able to configure the basic\nsetup for the router or the switch.\n\n2267\n01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,905\nAnd hopefully today,\nyou've actually learned a bit of that.\n\n2268\n01:47:33,905 --> 01:47:35,085\n>> Yeah.\n\n2269\n01:47:35,085 --> 01:47:37,185\nAll right, well Ronnie we\nare running a little low on time so\n\n2270\n01:47:37,185 --> 01:47:38,505\nit's probably a good spot for us to stop.\n\n2271\n01:47:38,505 --> 01:47:39,225\n>> It is.\n>> We got,\n\n2272\n01:47:39,225 --> 01:47:42,365\nobviously we got great material for\nthe next episode.\n\n2273\n01:47:42,365 --> 01:47:46,470\nSo for those of you that are interested\nin continuing on to see some of the more\n\n2274\n01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:49,770\nadvanced configuration,\nabsolutely stay tuned for future episodes.\n\n2275\n01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:53,280\nBut otherwise I think we'll go ahead and\nwrap it up here for today.\n\n2276\n01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,420\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2277\n01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:55,610\n>> Think of anything else to throw in?\n\n2278\n01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:57,690\n>> I don't think so,\nI think we're ready to go.\n\n2279\n01:47:57,690 --> 01:48:00,850\n>> Well ladies and gentlemen, as always,\nwe hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n2280\n01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:01,810\nDefinitely stay tuned for\n\n2281\n01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:05,690\nother episodes of ITProTV as\nwe continue with Cisco CCENT.\n\n2282\n01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,290\nAnd you know, we've got our other\nshows that are filming right now too.\n\n2283\n01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:14,500\nTune in for Security Plus,\nthe Windows 8 shows, all good times there.\n\n2284\n01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:18,490\nBut I think that's about it for\nus, so signing off for ITProTV,\n\n2285\n01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,230\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2286\n01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:22,631\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong\n>> And we'll catch you next

right we're good.\n\n5\n00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,431\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good morning, good afternoon and\n\n6\n00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,758\ngood evening, and\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,031\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:41,811\nToday I've got Ronnie Wong with me.\n\n9\n00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:42,620\nHow is it going Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,700\n>> Yes, I am doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,910\nReady to get started on another\nexciting episode of CCENT.\n\n12\n00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,130\n>> Excellent, excellent, excellent.\n\n13\n00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,900\nIn the last episode, we took a stab at\nour initial router configuration and\n\n14\n00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,310\nwe got to see what it was like to\nconnect to a device the first time.\n\n15\n00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,580\nWe did some crazy exciting things, right?\n\n16\n00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,680\nWe set a host name.\n\n17\n00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,950\nWe assigned some IP's, didn't we?\n\n18\n00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,340\n>> I think we assigned an IP address.\n\n19\n00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,130\n>> So we did some basic things.\n\n20\n00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,360\nWe got some tele-networking.\n\n21\n00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,420\nWe remotely connected to the device.\n\n22\n00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,520\nWe do have some more things to configure,\n\n23\n00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,620\nsome more advanced topics\non initial configuration.\n\n24\n00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,050\nBut today what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna shuffle things around a bit,\n\n25\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,850\nand we're gonna move from\na router to a switch.\n\n26\n00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,100\nAnd one of the last things I said in\nthe last episode, if i recall correctly,\n\n27\n00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,740\nwas [LAUGH] that the configurations\n\n28\n00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,260\nthat we did were almost identical\nbetween a router and a switch.\n\n29\n00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,330\nSo I thought it'd be a good idea today\nto fire up a switch and go through and\n\n30\n00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,330\nget a chance to see that.\n\n31\n00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,840\nTo see those same commands\nworking in a switch environment.\n\n32\n00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,610\n>> So in our switch environment here,\nremember that what we are talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,310\nAt least at the CCNT level, is that we're\ngonna be working with a single router and\n\n34\n00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,530\na single switch configuring for\na small network environment for us.\n\n35\n00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,122\nAnd so, the basic configurations\nhere at this level are normally so\n\n36\n00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,482\nthat we can get things set up and\nget it ready and working for us.\n\n37\n00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:03,700\nAnd so, the first thing that we have to do\nof course is we need to connect to it and\n\n38\n00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,780\njust put in the most basic\nconfigurations possible.\n\n39\n00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,620\n>> Yeah, and just like in the last\nepisode, I've got my trusty,\n\n40\n00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,990\nactually it's your trusty console cable.\n\n41\n00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,210\nWhich I've got plugged into my\nlaptop using one of those USB serial\n\n42\n00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,950\nport adapters we talked about.\n\n43\n00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,210\nAnd I've got it running back to a switch\nthat is just barely off-camera here.\n\n44\n00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,790\nThis switch is a Cisco catalyst\n3560 it is the switch on the exam.\n\n45\n00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,910\nSo, just like we used the 2800 router last\ntime which is the router on the exam.\n\n46\n00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,400\nSo, we've got this turkey\nsitting back here.\n\n47\n00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,320\nIt has a plain basic\nconfiguration on it and\n\n48\n00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,310\nwhat I mean is the configuration that's on\nit is the same one you'd find if you took\n\n49\n00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,860\na brand new switch out of the box.\n\n50\n00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,590\nAnd just applied power which\nis effectively what we did,\n\n51\n00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,050\njust not exactly brand new but\nit's a wiped configuration.\n\n52\n00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,100\nSo sometimes getting it start\nis actually the key, right?\n\n53\n00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,960\nEvery once and a while,\n\n54\n00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,580\nyou might not buy a switch right out of\nthe actual, right directly from Cisco.\n\n55\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,250\nYou might end up getting it a used switch,\nand remember that for us here.\n\n56\n00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,350\nStarting off with nobody else's\nconfigurations or starting off brand new,\n\n57\n00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,680\nand that's really the key for us here.\n\n58\n00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,870\nSo, we don't have to worry about anybody\nelse's configuration at this point.\n\n59\n00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,870\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n60\n00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,410\n>> Now, how do you know if your\nswitch has been factory reset or not?\n\n61\n00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,130\n>> That's right.\n\n62\n00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,700\nWell, just like on the router, when you\nfire up a switch for the first time,\n\n63\n00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,850\nyou'll get a prompt asking whether or\n\n64\n00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,360\nnot you wanna do the initial\nswitch configuration.\n\n65\n00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,710\nAnd that's where we're at, so\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n66\n00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,850\nI've got my trusty PuTTY\nfired up here and,\n\n67\n00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,100\nlet me make this screen\na little bit bigger.\n\n68\n00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,780\nAnd it basically went through\nthe initial boot process and\n\n69\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,230\nshowed all the various iOS stuff\nthat you see when a system boots up.\n\n70\n00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,620\nIt does its hardware check and\nall of that.\n\n71\n00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,271\nSo I can see this is a Cisco 3560 switch,\n\n72\n00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:56,440\nit's got 48 Fat at the net ports,\nand let me move that, there we go.\n\n73\n00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,640\nSo we can see it's got all those ports,\nwhich is exciting and fun.\n\n74\n00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,250\n>> Yep.\n\n75\n00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,820\nBut at the end of the day what I'm\nlooking for is this right here,\n\n77\n00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,970\nwhere it says, would you like to enter\nthe initial configuration dialogue.\n\n78\n00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,740\nWhen you see that message,\nthat's your clue, that says hey,\n\n79\n00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,680\nthe configuration on this\nswitch has been erased.\n\n80\n00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,830\nThis is not an active switch\nthat's been configured.\n\n81\n00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,020\nNow with a router out of the box,\nnot very useful, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,370\nYou plug in a router right out of\nthe box and it doesn't do anything.\n\n83\n00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,170\nBut a switch is a different story,\nwe don't have to configure a switch.\n\n84\n00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,010\nWe could leave it just the way it is,\nit's a 48 port switch in this example, any\n\n85\n00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,220\nPCs I plug into any port should be able to\nsee each other, communicate, and be happy.\n\n86\n00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,240\n>> Now, that for us is a huge advantage\nfor a lot of small companies that don't\n\n87\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,760\nhave anybody that could come in and\nconfigure the device, right?\n\n88\n00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,490\nYou pull it right out of the box,\nyou plug the power in.\n\n89\n00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,440\nLet the light settle down, as soon as you\nplug the devices in, they're ready to go.\n\n90\n00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,310\nEven so it is designed to do that it's\nnot the best thing that we can do.\n\n91\n00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,880\nSo that's what we're learning about\nis that we want to get this device\n\n92\n00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,640\nready to be put into our network here.\n\n93\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,200\nAnd so, we wanna make sure that we\ngo over the same configurations,\n\n94\n00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,160\npretty much just about the same here.\n\n95\n00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,310\nSo that we have a, well,\na secured device for us.\n\n96\n00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,640\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n97\n00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,080\n>> And that way we're not just putting\na device in that somebody can just simply\n\n98\n00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,940\nplug in another device into, and\nbe able to take over control.\n\n99\n00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,150\n>> Yeah, and the reality is if\nyou take the box right out of,\n\n100\n00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,085\nif you take the switch right\nout of the box and hook it up.\n\n101\n00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,355\nIf you leave it like that, you are missing\nout on all the bells and whistles.\n\n102\n00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:32,195\nThere are a ton of features inside\nof these devices that you can't take\n\n103\n00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,155\nadvantage of unless you get in and\nconfigure it.\n\n104\n00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:38,390\nSo if you're just gonna take it out of\nthe box and use it with the base config.\n\n105\n00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,840\nYou probably should have\njust bough a cheaper switch\n\n106\n00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,890\nbecause you do waste a lot of money.\n\n107\n00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,640\nAll right,\n\n108\n00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,160\nso just like on the routers, I'm gonna\nsay no to this configuration dialogue.\n\n109\n00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,990\nOn the exam, you need to know the dialogue\nexists, but you're not gonna use it.\n\n110\n00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,619\nAnd so, they want you to be able to\ndo all the configurations by hand.\n\n111\n00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,200\n>> So as a little bit of review here,\nremember that what we're looking for\n\n112\n00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,850\nhere, since we've already gone\nthrough the router configuration.\n\n113\n00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,620\nNotice that the prompts are relatively\nthe same here, instead of the word\n\n114\n00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,580\nrouter that we generically have here,\nwe have the word switch instead.\n\n115\n00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,511\nAnd you see that greater than symbol for\nus,\n\n116\n00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,580\nand that tells us we're in user mode,\nis that right?\n\n117\n00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,670\n>> Yep, unprivileged user mode.\n\n118\n00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,900\n>> Unprivileged user mode here.\n\n119\n00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,910\nAnd so, Don has actually entered in the\nfirst command for us here which is enable.\n\n120\n00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,420\nWhich actually bring us now into\nthe privileged mode, is what we have.\n\n121\n00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,870\n>> And once we're here, there's not all\nthat much we can configure on the device.\n\n122\n00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,250\nAlthough, we can jump into\nthe configuration mode,\n\n123\n00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,840\nwith configure terminal and\nnow we can do some damage.\n\n124\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,550\n>> Don't forget that when we're here,\n\n125\n00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,630\nthis is technically called\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n126\n00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,790\nAnd so, for us anything that we said\nhere affects the entire switch.\n\n127\n00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,730\nThere's 48 ports on it,\nit's gonna affect all 48 ports, and\n\n128\n00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,920\nin other words the entire switch here.\n\n129\n00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,530\nSo we do have some different\nthings on here as well.\n\n130\n00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,870\n>> So on the router, we jumped in and\nwe configured a few basic things, so\n\n131\n00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,220\nlet's run through those again.\n\n132\n00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,430\nWe did a host name,\n\n133\n00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,990\nbecause if we're connected to multiple\ndevices we want to remember which one.\n\n134\n00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,510\nSo, I just renamed this one\nusing the host name command.\n\n135\n00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,780\nHost name and then ITProTV- switch\nis what I wanted to call mine,\n\n136\n00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,012\nand now it's renamed.\n\n137\n00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,470\n>> And so, on the router we actually\ndid the ITProTV- rtr for router,\n\n138\n00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,310\nis what I think we did.\n\n139\n00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,530\n>> Oh, we did, I used the shorter name.\n\n140\n00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,720\nAll right, we also assigned a password\nby doing enable secret, and\n\n141\n00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800\nthen setting a password.\n\n142\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640\nI'll do Cisco123.\n\n143\n00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,040\n>> Incredibly secure password for us.\n\n144\n00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,538\n>> Absolutely and I use it on everything.\n\n145\n00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:34,603\n>> That's right.\n\n146\n00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:38,150\n>> [LAUGH] So enable secret Cisco123.\n\n147\n00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,800\nNow, anytime someone types enable, they're\ngonna be prompted for that password.\n\n148\n00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,518\nDon't forget that for us,\na lot of times, just like on the router,\n\n149\n00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,880\nwe have enable secret or enable password.\n\n150\n00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,604\nEnable secret means that when we go and\nstore everything,\n\n151\n00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:57,170\nthis password's gonna be stored\nencrypted already with an MD5 hash.\n\n152\n00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,709\n>> All right, now some of the other things\nthat we configured, we got the Cisco\n\n153\n00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,330\nrouter setup so that we could telnet\ninto it over the network, right?\n\n154\n00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,630\nAnd I may wanna get the switch\nset up that same way, right?\n\n155\n00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,270\nThere's a couple little\ndifferences in the way it's done\n\n156\n00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,410\non a router versus the way\nit's done on a switch.\n\n157\n00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,280\nOn the router, I mentioned how,\nin order to Telnet into it,\n\n158\n00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,870\nyou've got to have a Telnet password set.\n\n159\n00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,500\nAnd the password was set on the vty lines.\n\n160\n00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,560\nAnd on a router, you have five vty lines.\n\n161\n00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,090\nBut on a switch, you have 16,\nso you have more.\n\n162\n00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,880\nSo on a router,\nI went into line vty 0 4, like that.\n\n163\n00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520\nBut on a switch,\nwe go all the way up to 15.\n\n164\n00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,580\nNow that's important, as people connect,\nthey connect to 0 and then 1 and then 2.\n\n165\n00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,320\nIf you only do 0 through 4,\n\n166\n00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,110\nwell, then lines 5 through 15\ndon't have a password now.\n\n167\n00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,620\nThe switch will not allow you\nto connect without a password.\n\n168\n00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,120\nSo it will effectively limit you\nto just those five connections.\n\n169\n00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,870\nSo we need to make sure we get all of\nthem which is what I'm doing here,\n\n170\n00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,938\nand then I'll set that password.\n\n171\n00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:03,450\nAnd I'm gonna use the same password,\nit doesn't have to be the same one.\n\n172\n00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,670\nYou can use any variation that we want.\n\n173\n00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,970\n>> And\nthen setting in the word password here,\n\n174\n00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,230\nnotice the prompt change\non the config line.\n\n175\n00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,790\nMeans we will be prompted for\nthe password at this point too.\n\n176\n00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,110\n>> And that's on the vty's, so we got\na config- line, so that's set there.\n\n177\n00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,270\nThe other thing that we did on the router,\nwas we assigned some IP addresses to it so\n\n178\n00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,075\nthat we could tone that\nto it over the network.\n\n179\n00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:31,930\nIt's been long enough that I don't\nremember what IQ we assigned\n\n180\n00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,988\nto the router but\nwe'll assign a different one here now.\n\n181\n00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:39,040\nThis is gonna lead us to probably the\nbiggest difference between a switch and\n\n182\n00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,690\na router.\n\n183\n00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,290\nOn a router you have physical\ninterfaces that plug into networks, and\n\n184\n00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,860\neach interface gets its own IP.\n\n185\n00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,000\nOn a router, you do not, I mean a switch.\n\n186\n00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,860\nNow I'm screwing up.\n\n187\n00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,050\nOn a switch,\nyou do not have physical interfaces.\n\n188\n00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,010\nNow you might say, wait a minute,\nDon, you're crazy.\n\n189\n00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,510\nI look at the front of the switch,\nthere's ports all over.\n\n190\n00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,630\nWell, those are switch ports,\ntheir layer two port.\n\n191\n00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,760\nLayer two ports don't have layer\nthree IP addresses, right?\n\n192\n00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,500\nSo, although you've got a ton of ports on\nthe switch, none of them get addresses.\n\n193\n00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,340\nSo on a switch,\nwe have to use a virtual interface.\n\n194\n00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,270\nThere's a virtual interface on the switch\nthat we can use to define that IP address.\n\n195\n00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,820\n>> When Don starts talking about\nthis idea of the virtual interface.\n\n196\n00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,600\nAll of a sudden, we've already gone\nthrough like fast ethernet 0/0, or\n\n197\n00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,460\nsomething like that.\n\n198\n00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,180\nBut when we start talking about a virtual\ninterface here, we're gonna actually see,\n\n199\n00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,030\ns Don actually typed in here.\n\n200\n00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,710\nThat on the switch, the virtual interface\nthat we're gonna assign is actually\n\n201\n00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,810\nthe one called VLAN one.\n\n202\n00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,702\nAnd so, the idea of that\nthat virtual address is that\n\n203\n00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:47,620\nyou're not really plugging\na cable in to it.\n\n204\n00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,740\nWe're using this particular interface here\nfor management, it's what we are doing.\n\n205\n00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,646\nAnd so, this is the address\nthat we are gonna connect to,\n\n206\n00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,060\nit's what we're gonna do.\n\n207\n00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,400\n>> Yes, so on the router I went into\ninterface gigabyte ethernet 0/0, right?\n\n208\n00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,030\nGI00, or you know if it is\na fast ethernet, or whatever,\n\n209\n00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,000\nyou go into that one.\n\n210\n00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,750\nBut here on this switch,\nI'm going into interface VLAN one, and\n\n211\n00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,300\nVLAN means virtual LAN.\n\n212\n00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,570\nIt's a virtual network that spans\nacross all of these interfaces.\n\n213\n00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,210\nWe'll talk more about VLAN in another\nepisode, but this one is special.\n\n214\n00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,610\nVLAN one is defined as the one that you're\nsupposed to assign the IP address for\n\n215\n00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,400\nmanagement purposes.\n\n216\n00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,400\n>> The nice thing about this is\nthat once we get pass that strange\n\n217\n00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,270\nnaming of the interface, you actually\nsee as Don's typing this here.\n\n218\n00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,770\nThe interface or\nthe IP address command for\n\n219\n00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,190\nus, is almost exactly if not exactly\nthe same as what we did on the router.\n\n220\n00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,290\nSo the good thing is,\nif you paid attention to the router here.\n\n221\n00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,430\nYou're starting to see some commands\nthat are again, starting to repeat which\n\n222\n00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,330\nis really good for us,\nbecause it means you have to learn a lot.\n\n223\n00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,920\n>> So I'm gonna sign that.\n\n224\n00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,290\nNow on some switches,\nthis interface is turned on by default.\n\n225\n00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,750\nOn other switches,\nit's turned off by default.\n\n226\n00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,690\nSo, I've just made it a force of habit\n\n227\n00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,580\nto always run no shutdown\non it to turn it on, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,190\nAnd it's just because it does\nvary from model to model.\n\n229\n00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,540\nNow, I ran no shut down and\n\n230\n00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,280\nnothing happens that means\nthat it was on by default.\n\n231\n00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,700\nBut if it was off,\nI would've seen it come up.\n\n232\n00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,080\n>> And so, remember that for us in\nthe default configuration a lot of times,\n\n233\n00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,290\nalways treat it like what Don said here.\n\n234\n00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,300\nPhysical interfaces are really always on.\n\n235\n00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,560\nIn other words, once we actually\nturned it on, plug the device in,\n\n236\n00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,450\nit would have actually worked.\n\n237\n00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,860\nSo that means that physical interfaces\nare always on, but virtual interfaces,\n\n238\n00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,140\nyou may see, some of them are going to\nbe off, some of them are going to be on.\n\n239\n00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,470\nSo just make it a standard habit here,\nand just make sure you turn them on.\n\n240\n00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,430\n>> As I think about it Ronnie,\n\n241\n00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,370\nI don't remember what IP\nwe assigned to that router.\n\n242\n00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n243\n00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:44,452\nlet me take a look at\nthat router real quick.\n\n244\n00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:49,209\nI'm just gonna move my console cable here,\nand we'll see what IP stuck on this thing.\n\n245\n00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:53,884\n>> Now, as Don is actually\nmoving the console cable over to\n\n246\n00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,450\nthe router here, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,440\nWe're gonna see something here in a moment\nthat it doesn't take much, right?\n\n248\n00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,920\nSo, Don didn't actually have\nto disconnect from the switch,\n\n249\n00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,400\nhe simply unplugged the cable,\nplugged it into the router itself.\n\n250\n00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,670\nAnd hopefully we'll actually be\nable to see it in a moment here.\n\n251\n00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,070\nYeah, as we start seeing it here.\n\n252\n00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,922\n>> Jason, can you bring up my-\n>> Yeah,\n\n253\n00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:20,512\nas we actually start seeing this here.\n\n254\n00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:21,570\n>> There we go.\n\n255\n00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,570\n>> Notice that it didn't\nreally take a lot, right?\n\n256\n00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,460\nHe didn't have to reconnect or anything.\n\n257\n00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,840\nHe simply unplugged and\nwas able to connect right in.\n\n258\n00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,090\nAnd notice now the host\nname change went directly\n\n259\n00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,870\nfrom ITProTV-Switch to ITProTV-RTR.\n\n260\n00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,700\nAnd now we're able to see,\n\n261\n00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,960\nthe actual IP address that we set\non that actual interface here.\n\n262\n00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,210\n>> So, I just switched right over to that\nrouter real quick because it's right\n\n263\n00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,050\nhere behind me.\n\n264\n00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,400\nIf it was on the network, I could have\nremotely connected to it or whatever.\n\n265\n00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,710\nBut here I can see on the router\nthat I gave it 192.168.0.1,\n\n266\n00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,920\nit is showing that the interface is up,\ndown.\n\n267\n00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,210\nProbably because there's no cable\nplugged in to it, that'll do it.\n\n268\n00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,860\nSo let's get that plugged in.\n\n269\n00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,940\n>> And later on, we'll talk about\nwhat that up, down actually means.\n\n270\n00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,310\nFor us right now,\nit means we're missing a cable.\n\n271\n00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,590\nYeah, that's what it actually means for\nus.\n\n272\n00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,540\nSo the nice thing is we now see\nthat the switch is giving us a.\n\n273\n00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,800\n>> There we go.\n\n274\n00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,410\n>> A system message here that\nsays it's actually up, down and\n\n275\n00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,060\nnow it's changed status.\n\n276\n00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,720\nAnd what we're always looking for is the\nidea of up, up which means that our switch\n\n277\n00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,210\nand our particular router\nare now both active.\n\n278\n00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,450\nAnd hopefully now that we've switched back\nover to switch, if we've assigned the IP\n\n279\n00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,440\naddress to the switch, and we now know\nthat we're plugged into the right console.\n\n280\n00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,120\n>> There we go.\n\n281\n00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,170\nI can see interface VLAN 1 has\n\n282\n00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,710\nan IP address of 192.160.0.10 and\nit is up and happy.\n\n283\n00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,880\nI just used this one\ncommand multiple times, and\n\n284\n00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,700\nI don't think we've talked\nabout this command yet.\n\n285\n00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,100\nIt is quite simply my favorite command.\n\n286\n00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,020\nWhen it comes to Cisco routers and\nswitches, when you connect to a router or\n\n287\n00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,920\na switch for the first time.\n\n288\n00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,100\nCisco's naming convention for\nthe ports is kinda bizarre, so\n\n289\n00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,220\nyou probably don't know\nthe names of the ports.\n\n290\n00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,360\nAnd so, this command right here,\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n291\n00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,704\nGives you a summary of\nthe interfaces on the device,\n\n292\n00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:24,650\nand a status update, lets you know their\nIP address and whether they're up.\n\n293\n00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:32,650\nAnd so, I can see right here VLAN 1 is\n192.68.0.10, and the interface is up, up.\n\n294\n00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,940\nNow switches have a lot\nof layer two ports, so\n\n295\n00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,140\nI see all these layer two ports down here.\n\n296\n00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,460\nLayer two ports don't have IP's,\nso they all show unassigned.\n\n297\n00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,380\nAnd this one shows up, up because\nsomething is plugged into port 1.\n\n298\n00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,050\nIt's actually the router I\njust plugged in is on port 1.\n\n299\n00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,170\nSo it's a nice little command and\nyou get that summary.\n\n300\n00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,790\nSo this it what looks like on a switch.\n\n301\n00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,170\nLet me jump over to the router again, and\nI'll show you what it looks like there.\n\n302\n00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,852\nIf I just switch over to that, like this.\n\n303\n00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,819\nOkay, and now when I go in and\nI pull it up.\n\n304\n00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,680\nSo now I'm on the router, and when I run\nthat show IP interface, I'll write it all\n\n305\n00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,790\nthe way out here, brief, it gives me that\nsummary of interfaces on the router.\n\n306\n00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,470\nNow, this is cool, because I might\nnot have realized that it had gigabit\n\n307\n00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,190\nports on it, but now I can see,\ngig 00 and gig 01.\n\n308\n00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,880\nI can see I've got a serial interface,\nserial 000, and\n\n309\n00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,150\nI've got a cellular interface,\nI do know english, 010.\n\n310\n00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,380\nI can see those right there,\nand I can see the IP Address.\n\n311\n00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,185\nIt's a very very cool command,\nand very useful.\n\n312\n00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:40,820\nYep.\n>> As we go back to the switch\n\n313\n00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,080\nconfiguration here, we basically now\nassigned a management IP Address\n\n314\n00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,230\n>> Remember what this allows me to do.\n\n315\n00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,407\nIt allows me to be able to sit on my\nnetwork, and it allows me to use a Telnet\n\n316\n00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:54,690\nat this point, to connect into the switch,\nand to begin the managing.\n\n317\n00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,490\nA lot of times for us,\nthis is launching up PuTTY, and\n\n318\n00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,460\nwe get to this window right here.\n\n319\n00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,540\n>> I should be able to telnet into\nit right now, let me give it a shot.\n\n320\n00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,010\nI assigned an IP of\n192.168.0.10 to the switch.\n\n321\n00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,520\nNow I'm on the router right now.\n\n322\n00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,500\nSo I'm just gonna run Telnet and\npoint to that IP.\n\n323\n00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,370\nAnd it is attempting to connect.\n\n324\n00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,876\nAnd there we go, It's asking me for\na password, I'll punch in Cisco 1-2-3.\n\n325\n00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:21,510\nWhoops, which is apparently wrong.\n\n326\n00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,100\nThere we go.\n\n327\n00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,740\nAnd now I'm in the switch.\n\n328\n00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,070\nOkay, so I was on the router, and\nI just connected to the switch.\n\n329\n00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,130\nI can punch in exit, and I get out of the\nswitch, and now I'm back to the router.\n\n330\n00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,110\nNow I can Telnet and\nconnect into my device.\n\n331\n00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,660\nAs far as the commands that we\ntalked about in the last episode on\n\n332\n00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,160\nthe router side,\nthe switch side is basically the same.\n\n333\n00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,530\nLet me jump back over to\nthe switches console,\n\n334\n00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,690\nand even commands like how we\nsave our config are the same.\n\n335\n00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,250\nSo, like here on the switch,\nif I want to save.\n\n336\n00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:02,400\nRemember we did the copy running-config\nstartup-config, just like on a router.\n\n337\n00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,560\nWe can run that, and\nsave our configuration here too.\n\n338\n00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,270\n>> So this allows us to be, remember, when\nwe do this we're saving what's in RAM, and\n\n339\n00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,720\nwe're saving it over into what we\ncall NVRAM, which is the RAM that is\n\n340\n00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,350\npersistent and we reboot the commands\n>> It should pull up our\n\n341\n00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,110\nconfiguration from here.\n\n342\n00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,230\n>> Other commands like the ping command\nand Telnet command, those other diagnostic\n\n343\n00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,060\nutilities, they're all a part of\nthe switch also, so I can run ping and\n\n344\n00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,680\nhere it goes pinging out to that router so\nI can verify connectivity.\n\n345\n00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,500\nSo, everything that I've showed you so\nfar.\n\n346\n00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,670\n>> Is really the same on a switch or\na router.\n\n347\n00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,170\nThe only variations we had, the interface\nname, we had to use a virtual interface on\n\n348\n00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,650\nthe switch, versus a physical\ninterchange on the router, and\n\n349\n00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,670\nthe number of VTY lines,\n16 as opposed to five on a router.\n\n350\n00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,380\nAll right.\n\n351\n00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,860\nA couple other things worth pointing out.\n\n352\n00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,010\nOn a Cisco router,\nthe interfaces are shut down by default.\n\n353\n00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,760\nThey're turned off, but on a switch,\nthey're turned on by default, all right?\n\n354\n00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,850\nThat's part of the whole the switch\nshould work out of the box dot\n\n355\n00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,030\nmodification thing.\n\n356\n00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,460\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n357\n00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,160\nWe do need to be aware of that,\nthat all these ports are on.\n\n358\n00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,730\nWe might need to turn some off.\n\n359\n00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,270\nBut as far as the basics there,\nthat's about it.\n\n360\n00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,380\nNow in this episode, we're gonna go\na lot further than just the basics.\n\n361\n00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,470\nI mentioned last episode that Telnet.\n\n362\n00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,340\nTelnet is not a very secure protocol.\n\n363\n00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,870\n>> Right.\n\n364\n00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,690\n>> When you use Telnet to\nconnect to another device,\n\n365\n00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,370\nit is unencrypted on the network.\n\n366\n00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,640\n>> Right.\n>> Anybody can intercept that traffic, and\n\n367\n00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,930\nread it and see what's going on.\n\n368\n00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,200\nNow sorry, go ahead.\n\n369\n00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,990\n>> I was going to say,\n\n370\n00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,300\non a real production network for\nus, it doesn't matter.\n\n371\n00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,770\nEven if you go nobody\nelse is going to do this.\n\n372\n00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,850\nWe don't want traffic out on the network\nthat's actually not encrypted,\n\n373\n00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,861\njust in case anybody can do this.\n\n374\n00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:56,810\nSo for us, Telnet,\non a real network we're not going to use.\n\n375\n00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,420\nNow in testing, right,\nI'm not really connected to anybody but\n\n376\n00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,070\nthese two switches here, no big deal.\n\n377\n00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,970\nBut what we want to do is we\nwant to secure that access then.\n\n378\n00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,435\nAnd so, we're about to talk about\nthis idea of actually using\n\n379\n00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:11,375\na more secured way to do this.\n\n380\n00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,475\n>> And\nyou know what would be kind of fun Ronnie?\n\n381\n00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:16,185\nLet me show them an example,\nbecause a lot of people here,\n\n382\n00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,805\nhey Telnet is non-secure blah, blah, blah.\n\n383\n00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,440\nYou hear it, but you've never\nactually seen how insecure it is.\n\n384\n00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,930\nSo I don't want to lose my\nnetwork connection, but\n\n385\n00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,048\nI do need to be on the network\nto intercept my own traffic.\n\n386\n00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:29,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's do this,\n\n387\n00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,830\nI'm gonna grab my little USB\nnetwork adapter over here so\n\n388\n00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,740\nI can plug in, and I'll show you\nguys my non-secure connection.\n\n389\n00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,260\nSo let me grab that real quick.\n\n390\n00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,150\nI'm just gonna disconnect\nfrom my console port here.\n\n391\n00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,210\nThere we go.\n\n392\n00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,680\nAnd let me grab that, I have on my\nlaptop a program called Wireshark.\n\n393\n00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,810\nYou want to talk about Wireshark for\njust a second, while I garb this cable.\n\n394\n00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,960\n>> Sure, yeah.\n\n395\n00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,355\nNow what we have is that there's a program\nthat you can go to wireshark.org and\n\n396\n00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,340\ndownload this.\n\n397\n00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,430\nThis particular program for\nus is actually both,\n\n398\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,260\nwhat we call a packet sniffer,\nas well as a protocol analyzer.\n\n399\n00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,890\nIt allows us to build the connect\nend to our network here, and\n\n400\n00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,640\nbe able to actually see the traffic\nas it's going across that interface.\n\n401\n00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,260\nNow on a switch network,\nwhen you plug into a device,\n\n402\n00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,940\nit's only going to show you what's\ncoming into your interface.\n\n403\n00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,230\nOr what's leaving your interface here.\n\n404\n00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,720\nSo what we're actually gonna do right now,\nis we're gonna simulate it.\n\n405\n00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,880\nSo remember that this is a free program.\n\n406\n00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,610\nYou download it.\n\n407\n00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,490\nYou install it.\n\n408\n00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,710\nAnd, in a moment here,\nwe should actually see it in action so\n\n409\n00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,660\nthat you can see that if we're\nusing Telnet, we're gonna actually\n\n410\n00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,200\nbe able to read the traffic that's\ncoming off of this device, too.\n\n411\n00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,630\n>> Yep, and let me just get this thing.\n\n412\n00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,540\nConfigured.\n\n413\n00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,940\nI don't have a DACP server on the network,\nso I have to statically assign an address.\n\n414\n00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,790\nI'm going to do that real quick.\n\n415\n00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,620\nThen we'll be in business.\n\n416\n00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,390\n>> Yeah.\nSo while Don is actually talking about\n\n417\n00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,440\nthat, I'm going to see if I can\nconnect into this device here.\n\n418\n00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,260\n>> There we go.\n\n419\n00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,410\nOkay.\n\n420\n00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,250\nSo let me just make sure I can ping it.\n\n421\n00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,600\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n422\n00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,320\nSo here's what I'm going to do, on a\nWindows computer, you can fire up Telnet.\n\n423\n00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,310\nI say Windows,\nyou can do it on Linux or OS X.\n\n424\n00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,380\nLinux and\nOS X have Telnet built into them, Windows,\n\n425\n00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,210\nit's not installed by default.\n\n426\n00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,890\nSo if I run Telnet,\nI get that it's not recognized.\n\n427\n00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,540\nSo, I could install the Telnet program\nfrom Microsoft, or I could just use PuTTY.\n\n428\n00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,220\nI've got PuTTY.\n\n429\n00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,620\nWhich is a free program we talked\nabout in the last episode.\n\n430\n00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,714\nAnd PuTTY does have Telnet built right\ninto it,, so I can just choose Telnet.\n\n431\n00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:38,610\nAnd I'm gonna Telnet into 192.168.0.1.\n\n432\n00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,920\nThat's our router.\n\n433\n00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,550\nOkay.\n\n434\n00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,300\nOr I could do the switch for that matter.\n\n435\n00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,210\nI'll do the switch, the switch was .10.\n\n436\n00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,960\nAll right.\n\n437\n00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,380\nSo I can get connected, and\nI can start to work with it, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,260\nTelnet is great,\nbecause I don't have to get up and\n\n439\n00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,470\nwalk over to the switch,\nplug in a console cable.\n\n440\n00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,720\nI can just connect right over the network.\n\n441\n00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,220\nBut here's the problem with TelNet.\n\n442\n00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,970\nLemme get out of this.\n\n443\n00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,500\nI'm gonna fire up Wireshark.\n\n444\n00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,200\nAnd Wireshark is the sniffer\nthat Ronnie was talking about.\n\n445\n00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,050\nIt allows us to capture network traffic.\n\n446\n00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,120\nIf somebody is sitting in between me and\nthe switch,\n\n447\n00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,680\nanywhere on the network in between,\nthey can run a packet capture program.\n\n448\n00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,620\nAnd Intercept that traffic as\nit's crossing the network.\n\n449\n00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,870\nThat's what I'm going to do right here.\n\n450\n00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,750\nI'm running the program and\nit's capturing that program.\n\n451\n00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,160\nNow, while I'm running, I'm going\nto fire up a Telnet session again.\n\n452\n00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,350\nI'm going to connect over to that switch.\n\n453\n00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,800\nAll right, and I'm going to punch in\nmy password, so now I'm logged in.\n\n454\n00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,880\nI'm going to enable, and\nI'll get logged in there too, okay?\n\n455\n00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,840\nAnd then I'm gonna start doing some work,\nright.\n\n456\n00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,500\nMaybe I'll save my configuration.\n\n457\n00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,170\n>> All right.\n\n458\n00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,418\n>> So I'm just gonna go ahead and\nsave my configuration.\n\n459\n00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:58,163\nAnd maybe I decide to take\na look at that configuration so\n\n460\n00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:00,190\nI do a show running-config.\n\n461\n00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,880\nAnd so\nI start to take a look at my config and\n\n462\n00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,330\nseeing if everything's set right or\nwhatever.\n\n463\n00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,650\nOkay, so\nI'm just doing normal work, right.\n\n464\n00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,090\n>> Right.\n>> And then I'm all set and done, and\n\n465\n00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,920\nthen I get out, and off I go about my day.\n\n466\n00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,880\nMeanwhile, if someone was running that\ncapture program in the background,\n\n467\n00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,790\nthey've captured every single\npacket going across the network.\n\n468\n00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,440\n>> What?\nNo way.\n\n469\n00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,110\nAnd so we see here's that\ntelnet session opening up, and\n\n470\n00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,750\nconnecting out to that device.\n\n471\n00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,180\nNow as I look at it here,\n\n472\n00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,070\nI can see down at the bottom where\nit's giving me the raw data, right?\n\n473\n00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,490\nWhat's actually inside of these packets.\n\n474\n00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,270\nAnd some of them, like right here\n>> Oh, look at that.\n\n475\n00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,480\n>> User access verification\npassword colon.\n\n476\n00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,540\nSo there's a password coming.\n\n477\n00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,480\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n478\n00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,540\nAnd then as I start to\nlook at these other ones,\n\n479\n00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,440\nI don't really see that password, right.\n\n480\n00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,950\nBut I see some other things and\nso I know stuff is going on.\n\n481\n00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,290\nNow the problem here Is not that\nthe password isn't in there, but\n\n482\n00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,480\nthat each letter, as you type it,\nis sent over one at a time.\n\n483\n00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,420\nSo a hacker would have to reassemble\nall these packets to see the data.\n\n484\n00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,605\nWell, fortunately, or unfortunately\nthat's actually a really easy thing.\n\n485\n00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:12,845\nIn Wireshark, we can just right-click\non one of the packets, and\n\n486\n00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:19,325\nyou can choose follow TCP stream and\nit will reassemble them for you, and\n\n487\n00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:25,250\nwhat we get Is basically the output\nof what happened in this session.\n\n488\n00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,830\nAnd so, I can see right here,\nuser access verification password.\n\n489\n00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,113\nSo, that's where it's asking for\n\n490\n00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:30,733\na password,\n>> And\n\n491\n00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,241\nthere is your password right there\n>> And\n\n492\n00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,390\nthen right there's\nthe password that we typed.\n\n493\n00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,190\nCisco123.\n\n494\n00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,650\nThen I typed enable.\n\n495\n00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,540\nNow notice how enable all\nthe letters are double.\n\n496\n00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,360\nWhat's in red is what I typed.\n\n497\n00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,570\nWhat's in blue is what was\nsent from the other side.\n\n498\n00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,770\nWhen I typed e, the other side\nmade an e show up so I can see it.\n\n499\n00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,480\nSo that's why they show up twice.\n\n500\n00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,700\nAnd again,\nit might look confusing here but\n\n501\n00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,990\na hacker could just change it to\nsay only show me one direction.\n\n502\n00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,530\nSo, here I can change it to say show\nme what the other person typed.\n\n503\n00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,970\nHere, I type enable and\nthen cisco one, two, three.\n\n504\n00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,606\n>> Yeah.\n>> They type copy running-config,\n\n505\n00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:09,290\nstartup-config.\n\n506\n00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,060\nThey type show running config.\n\n507\n00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,525\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then they can switch it to whoops.\n\n508\n00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:17,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Switch it to show the other direction,\n\n509\n00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,310\nand now they can see\nthe information that was fed back.\n\n510\n00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,960\nWhen I ran show running configuration,\nright?\n\n511\n00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,800\nAll right here's where we did the copy,\nand we saved it and\n\n512\n00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,360\nthen here's the show run, and\nthen what's the output after that?\n\n513\n00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,160\nThe entire running\nconfiguration of my switch.\n\n514\n00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,102\nThat's bad news.\n\n515\n00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:38,430\n>> Right\n>> It was very easy for\n\n516\n00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,982\nme to do that,\nit is not a challenging thing.\n\n517\n00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:46,480\nAny ten year old with basic google\nexperience can figure this out and\n\n518\n00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,810\ncapture your traffic.\n\n519\n00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,730\nSo Telnet is not a protocol\nthat we want to use.\n\n520\n00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,600\n>> Right.\n\n521\n00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,060\n>> So the protocol that we really want to\nactually move to then is actually much\n\n522\n00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,010\nmore secure than this which for\nus is gonna be.\n\n523\n00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,900\nSSH.\nOkay.\n\n524\n00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,220\n>> Now Ronnie we\nare running short on time.\n\n525\n00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,470\nSo let's,\nI'm trying to think of a goofy phrase.\n\n526\n00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,550\n>> We are going to pause for\n>> Let's put a pin in it.\n\n527\n00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,940\n>> Wow.\n>> So let's hold on to that.\n\n528\n00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,580\nWhen we get back from break,\nwe'll tackle the protocol we should use.\n\n529\n00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,992\n>> That's right, SSH.\n\n530\n00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:19,405\n>> All right, so lets stop here, and we'll\nsee you guys back in a handful of minutes.\n\n531\n00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:27,336\n[NOISE] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n532\n00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:29,914\nSo before the break we\nwere talking about Telnet.\n\n533\n00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:35,110\nAnd I showed you guys how it is\nnot a secure solution right.\n\n534\n00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,990\nSo Ronnie you wanna walk them\nthrough the alternative?\n\n535\n00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,220\n>> The alternative for us is to\nactually think about using SSH here.\n\n536\n00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,820\nNow, unlike Telnet, SSH is well secured.\n\n537\n00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,480\nIt actually.\n\n538\n00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,230\n>> It's in the name.\n\n539\n00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,460\n>> It's actually in the name, right,\nsecure shell it's actually in the name for\n\n540\n00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,370\nus here as we go through.\n\n541\n00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,330\nSo, usually this is the one\nthat we really want to actually\n\n542\n00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,700\nuse here in terms of\nbeing able to connect.\n\n543\n00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,220\nConnect into a switch or to a router,\n\n544\n00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,460\nespecially when we're gonna do this\nover the network connection for us.\n\n545\n00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,840\nThat's really where we\nare heading next here.\n\n546\n00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,300\nBy default, Telnet is enabled for us.\n\n547\n00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,990\nSo what we wanna do now is we\nwanna go into the switch here, and\n\n548\n00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,210\nwe wanna make our trigger configuration.\n\n549\n00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,360\n>> Yep.\nWe've got\n\n550\n00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,060\na handful of commands that we need\nto do to get SSH operational.\n\n551\n00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,870\nSo I've got my switch pulled up here and\nI'm actually using telnet right now but\n\n552\n00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,990\nwe'll get our configuration in place and\nnice and secure afterwards.\n\n553\n00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,950\n>> Now everybody probably does\nthis a little bit differently.\n\n554\n00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,930\nI always have this idea of\nthings that I want to make sure.\n\n555\n00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,090\nSo remember that all of these commands\nreally have to actually be in there for\n\n556\n00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,440\nit to work or sometimes it may not and\nso we do wanna pay attention.\n\n557\n00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,010\nAnd when the very first command\nwas sent we didn't even mention,\n\n558\n00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,130\nthat normally it is involved in\nmaking sure that we can connect here.\n\n559\n00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,590\nIs just setting the host name right?\n\n560\n00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,050\n>> Yeah.\nYou can't, it sounds weird, but\n\n561\n00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,140\nyou can't enable SSH without a host name.\n\n562\n00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> You've gotta have a host name.\n\n563\n00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,430\nThe other thing that you have\nto have is a domain name.\n\n564\n00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,080\n>> Domain name yup.\n\n565\n00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,235\n>> Now, that sounds weird but\nthink of like a website.\n\n566\n00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:04,540\nWww.itpro.tv, right.\n\n567\n00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,160\nSo www might be our host and\nthen itpro.tv is our domain.\n\n568\n00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,220\nWell, SSH uses certificates for security.\n\n569\n00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,090\nThe same type of certificates you use for\naccessing a secure web page.\n\n570\n00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,080\nAnd in order to generate\na certificate we need a host name and\n\n571\n00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,070\nan IP, I mean a domain name, so\nwe've already got the hostname, right?\n\n572\n00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,220\nWe used the hostname command for that.\n\n573\n00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,320\n>> And our domain name is ipdomain-name,\nand then whatever\n\n574\n00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,780\nyour particular domain name is gonna be,\nand ours is gonna be itprotv here.\n\n575\n00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,850\nNow, once we have the hostname and\nthe domain name configured,\n\n576\n00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,360\nthere is a couple of other things\nwe need to set up for us here.\n\n577\n00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,520\nSo I'd like to go ahead and\nat this point here\n\n578\n00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,550\nI need to make sure a couple of other\nthings are also there to right.\n\n579\n00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,240\nSo such as at this point here\nI need to make sure that\n\n580\n00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,640\nIf I'm not gonna automatically\ngo into privilege mode,\n\n581\n00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,760\nwhich I haven't gotten into so\nI shouldn't have mentioned that but\n\n582\n00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,790\nI did anyways, we need to make sure that\nwe have at least an enable password.\n\n583\n00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,540\nI just realized I did that.\n\n584\n00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,060\nSo as long as I have an enable\npassword set, I'm fine.\n\n585\n00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,930\nI know I've done this.\n\n586\n00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,450\nI set up SSH thinking\nI've got everything done.\n\n587\n00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,960\nI went to try and do it, and\n\n588\n00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,420\nit still denied me access because I\nforgot to set up enable password.\n\n589\n00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,650\nMake sure you do set up enable password,\nand ours was set.\n\n590\n00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,450\n>> All right so, we've got that.\n\n591\n00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,680\nWe got our domain name set.\n\n592\n00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,340\nAnother thing that we need for SSH.\n\n593\n00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,720\nBy default,\nwe set a password on our router, right.\n\n594\n00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,280\nWe set an enable, we did enable secret and\nthen our password.\n\n595\n00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,280\nAnd when I Telnet in it just asked for\na password.\n\n596\n00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,640\nBut SSH requires a username and\na password, so we gotta have both.\n\n597\n00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,340\nNow, in order to do that, we need to\nchange the way that our devices work.\n\n598\n00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,300\nOn a Cisco switch or router, there is\na service in the background call AAA.\n\n599\n00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,030\nAnd AAA stands for authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n600\n00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,550\nAuthentication is verifying a username.\n\n601\n00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,910\nVerifying a user is who they say they are.\n\n602\n00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,250\nAuthorization is determining\nwhat they're allowed to do,\n\n603\n00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,910\nwhat commands are allowed to run.\n\n604\n00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,620\nAnd accounting is keeping\na record of what they did.\n\n605\n00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,950\nNow, AAA is turned off by\ndefault on the Cisco switches\n\n606\n00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,410\nwith the exception of that password for\nlogging in.\n\n607\n00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,920\nWe need to tell it to do the enhanced,\nthe new version of AAA.\n\n608\n00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,400\nAnd get it running, so that it asks for\na user name and a password.\n\n609\n00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> And the way we do that\n\n610\n00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,040\nis with the triple A new-model command.\n\n611\n00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,188\nThat tells the switch, or the router,\nto operate in the new configuration.\n\n612\n00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:41,550\nThe advanced AAA so it will ask for\na username and a password.\n\n613\n00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:46,254\n>> Once we have the actual device, switch\nI was trying to remember what it was that\n\n614\n00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:50,410\nwe were on, once we have the actual\nswitch set up to accept new model.\n\n615\n00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,460\nIn other words, username and password.\n\n616\n00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,944\nKey thing for us, of course, is to\nactually create a username and password,\n\n617\n00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:56,995\nkeep it logical here.\n\n618\n00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,530\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So, the easiest thing for\n\n619\n00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,360\nus is to actually type in\nthe next command here.\n\n620\n00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,863\nSo we can type in username and we can use\nour standard, what are we just gonna use,\n\n621\n00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:06,749\nadmin or-\n>> Yeah, we'll just use the admin.\n\n622\n00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:11,060\n>> Admin, and then we can either use\nsecret or we can use password here.\n\n623\n00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,127\nSo which one are we gonna do,\nwe gonna use password?\n\n624\n00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:14,420\n>> Oh, we need stick that\non the end of the command.\n\n625\n00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,369\n>> Oh, that's right, sorry, my fault, yep.\n\n626\n00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,136\n[LAUGH]\n>> So the order of these commands can\n\n627\n00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,803\ninfluence things a little bit.\n\n628\n00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,150\n>> Yeah, I forgot about that.\n\n629\n00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,160\nWhat happens is,\nwe want to set a password, right.\n\n630\n00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,950\nSo I want to set, secret, and\nthen what the password is.\n\n631\n00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,750\n>> Right.\n>> But if you do that first,\n\n632\n00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,260\nanything else you type after it\nbecomes part of the password.\n\n633\n00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,980\nSo I need to set one other thing first.\n\n634\n00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,139\nI'm gonna say username admin,\nprivilege 15.\n\n635\n00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:37,530\n>> There you go.\n\n636\n00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,735\n>> All right now, what does that mean?\n\n637\n00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:43,263\nOn your Cisco routers and switches you\nhave privilege levels 0 through 15.\n\n638\n00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:46,580\n0 has absolutely no permissions,\ncan't do anything,\n\n639\n00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,125\n15 has all the permissions in the world.\n\n640\n00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,240\n1 through 14 are actually not defined.\n\n641\n00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, we'll talk in a late episode,\n\n642\n00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,718\nactually that's in the IINS show,\nthe CCNA security stuff,\n\n643\n00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,470\nthat we'll delve into that.\n\n644\n00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,820\nBut for right now, we'll just know\nthat 15 is full admin privileges.\n\n645\n00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:12,060\nThen we'll throw in secret followed\nby what we want our password to be.\n\n646\n00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,380\nAnd anything that follows the word\nsecret will become part of the password,\n\n647\n00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,320\nthat's why I stuck it at the end.\n\n648\n00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,860\n>> Yeah, my fault.\n\n649\n00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,645\nNow, what have we just done?\n\n650\n00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:21,480\nWe've just created a simple username and\n\n651\n00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,290\npassword database here with\nthe privilege level defined.\n\n652\n00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,140\nSo instead of just being\nrequested to present a password,\n\n653\n00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,070\nwe're gonna be requested to present\na username, usually when we log on.\n\n654\n00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,700\nAnd then we're gonna be asked for\na password.\n\n655\n00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,790\nSo it's gonna ask for\ntwo particular forms for us.\n\n656\n00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,460\n>> Yeah, and that takes effect right away.\n\n657\n00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:43,545\nIf I were to switch over here,\nand telnet into 192.168.0.10.\n\n658\n00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:48,900\nWhen I connect this time, see how it\nasks for a username and not a password.\n\n659\n00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,252\nAnd so I can punch in admin and\nthen that password, Cisco 123.\n\n660\n00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,411\n>> There you go.\n>> And now I'm in.\n\n661\n00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,640\n>> Yep.\n\n662\n00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,271\nAll right, so now that we have\nthe username and password,\n\n663\n00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:01,923\nalong with our host name and our domain\nname, we've got everything set up here,\n\n664\n00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:05,542\nwe're just about ready to set up the idea\nof the cryptography key, aren't we?\n\n665\n00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,850\n>> Yep, that's the last piece we need,\nat least I think it is.\n\n666\n00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,480\n>> Almost, yeah.\n\n667\n00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,690\n>> It does depend on the systems,\n\n668\n00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,050\non many systems this is\nthe last command that we need.\n\n669\n00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,102\nWe need that certificate to be generated.\n\n670\n00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:20,257\nAnd so we can punch in a neat\nlittle command, crypto,\n\n671\n00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,372\nthat's the cryptography subset.\n\n672\n00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:29,730\nSo we'll say crypto key gen,\nI need it to generate a key, rsa.\n\n673\n00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,530\nNow RSA keys are basically certificates.\n\n674\n00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,370\nAnd so I'm telling it,\nI need it to generate a certificate for\n\n675\n00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,470\nme to use on this system for encryption.\n\n676\n00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,560\nNow it's gonna ask how many\nbits we want it to be.\n\n677\n00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,350\nThe key module, this is what it's called.\n\n678\n00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,230\nThe more bits you use,\nthe stronger the key.\n\n679\n00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,020\nThis one is telling me that I can\npick from 360 all the way to 2048.\n\n680\n00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,810\nNow, 512 is the default.\n\n681\n00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,030\nThat is not good enough for SSH.\n\n682\n00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,425\nYou need a minimum of 768 for SSH version\n\n683\n00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:08,570\n1 and a minimum of 1024 for SSH version 2.\n\n684\n00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,103\nSo I'm gonna choose 1024.\n\n685\n00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:16,110\n>> Now when Don actually hits this in,\nsometimes you're kind of fooled.\n\n686\n00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:20,480\nYou might think that 512 is the maximum\nnumber that you can type in.\n\n687\n00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,320\nBut remember, they did tell you that\nyou could type in more than that.\n\n688\n00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,110\nSo always choose a key that's\ngonna be generally more than that.\n\n689\n00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,385\nUsually the minimum that we want to\nsupport is gonna be SSH version 2, so\n\n690\n00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:32,993\nyou wanna start off with at least 1024.\n\n691\n00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,245\n>> Yep.\n>> Okay?\n\n692\n00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:37,720\n>> All right, and once that's done,\nnow I've got a certificate.\n\n693\n00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,280\nOn many devices you'll see a message\npop up telling you that SSH has been\n\n694\n00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,410\nenabled and your in business.\n\n695\n00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,770\nNow I did not get that message,\noh but I'm telnetted in, so\n\n696\n00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,880\nit may have actually happened.\n\n697\n00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,250\nLet's see if it's in there.\n\n698\n00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,294\nIt did, all right.\n\n699\n00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:53,936\nSo I just pulled up the log of the switch,\nand\n\n700\n00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:58,400\nI can see right here,\nSSH 5 enabled, SSH 1.99.\n\n701\n00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,650\nNow I said 1,024 bits was enough for\nSSH version 2.\n\n702\n00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,290\nIt is.\n\n703\n00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,040\nCisco's implementation of SSH\nversion 2 is actually SSH 1.99.\n\n704\n00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,140\nSo this is, for all intents and\npurposes, version 2.\n\n705\n00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,310\nYou won't see version 2 in the logs.\n\n706\n00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,515\n>> Maybe if I chose 1,025 bits.\n\n707\n00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:19,675\nI'm joking.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n708\n00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:20,175\n>> I'm joking.\n\n709\n00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:20,965\n>> I'm not sure if it'll let you,\n\n710\n00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:21,558\nwill it?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n711\n00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:22,240\nNo.\n>> I've never\n\n712\n00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,140\ntried.\n>> Me neither.\n\n713\n00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,750\n>> It might.\n\n714\n00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,903\nSo, [LAUGH] but\n\n715\n00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:30,520\nif I had only done 512 bits,\nit wouldn't have turned on at all.\n\n716\n00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,454\nIf I had done 768 bits,\nit would've said SSH enabled,\n\n717\n00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:37,442\nSSH version 1, is what it would have said.\n\n718\n00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:42,313\n>> All right, so now that we have this,\nwhat else do we need here?\n\n719\n00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,538\n>> There's one thing I'd like to do,\nall right?\n\n720\n00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:48,285\nSo technically SSH is enabled and\noperational.\n\n721\n00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:51,839\nI could test it out by firing up PuTTY and\n\n722\n00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,935\nconnecting to 192.168.0.10,\n\n723\n00:36:55,935 --> 00:37:00,052\nchoosing SSH this time, and connecting up.\n\n724\n00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:03,206\nSince it's the first time I'm connecting,\nit's asking for\n\n725\n00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:06,675\nme to verify the key fingerprint to\nmake sure this is the right host.\n\n726\n00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:08,730\nI know it is, so I'll hit Yes.\n\n727\n00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,240\n>> And there it is.\n>> And then I'll get logged in.\n\n728\n00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,100\nNow, it doesn't look much different\nthan what we're used to seeing,\n\n729\n00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,940\nbut it is fully encrypted on the back end.\n\n730\n00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,110\nAnd I'll show you guys\nthat in just second.\n\n731\n00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,060\nWe could say that we're done right now.\n\n732\n00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:24,940\n>> Yeah,\nthe problem that we have here though is,\n\n733\n00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,960\nif we were to switch out of this, and if\nDon were to launch the PuTTY window again,\n\n734\n00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,070\ninstead of choosing SSH at this point,\nhe could choose Telnet.\n\n735\n00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,050\nSo once he actually puts that\nin he chooses Telnet and\n\n736\n00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,070\nhe clicks Open, well look at that.\n\n737\n00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,962\nNow, this doesn't really make\nthe router any more secure.\n\n738\n00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,667\nSo we do have SSH enabled.\n\n739\n00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:50,370\nIn other words, we can use it, but\nit's also telling me that I can use SSH.\n\n740\n00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,540\nNow, that is where a problem can be.\n\n741\n00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,140\nIf I say hey, I want all you users to\nactually connect with SSH, perfectly fine.\n\n742\n00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,930\nBut if somebody says, well let me try\nTelnet, it's still letting them in.\n\n743\n00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,478\nSo we need to limit ourselves\nto really only using SSH.\n\n744\n00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:06,700\n>> Yep, so let's get in there and\ndisable that one.\n\n745\n00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,050\nSo what we do then is the VTY lines,\nthe virtual teletype lines,\n\n746\n00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,040\nthey're the ones that control SSH and\nTelnet connections.\n\n747\n00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,460\nSo I need to get into them, so\nI'm gonna say line vty 0 15, all right?\n\n748\n00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,570\nAnd once I'm in there,\nI'm gonna turn off Telnet.\n\n749\n00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,020\nNow, I'm actually logged\nin via Telnet right now, so\n\n750\n00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,870\nI am gonna get disconnected\nwhen I do this.\n\n751\n00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,160\nI'm gonna say transport input.\n\n752\n00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,620\nAnd then this command, transport input,\n\n753\n00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,490\nis controlling what transport protocols\nare allowed to go in the VTY lines.\n\n754\n00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,457\nAnd if you do a question,\nyou'll see everything that's supported and\n\n755\n00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,440\nhere I've got SSH and Telnet, right?\n\n756\n00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,190\nAnd so I can say all,\nwhich allows both of them.\n\n757\n00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,080\nI can say none, which turns them\noff then effectively locks myself\n\n758\n00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,610\nout of the device.\n\n759\n00:38:53,610 --> 00:39:00,000\nOr I can just say SSH by itself,\nthat will turn off Telnet.\n\n760\n00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,274\nOh, actually it applies a connection time\nso it is gonna leave me connected for\n\n761\n00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:03,920\nright now.\n\n762\n00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,600\n>> So right now the default for\n\n763\n00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,960\nus is that it's pretty much doing what,\ntransport input all.\n\n764\n00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,760\nIt's accepting both of those\nconnections right now.\n\n765\n00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,690\nAnd so what we've just done is we're\nsaying that we are limiting it to\n\n766\n00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,380\nonly SSH.\n\n767\n00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,440\nSo in theory when we connect back in, Don\nshould be able to connect in using SSH,\n\n768\n00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,670\nbut not able to connect in using Telnet.\n\n769\n00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,360\n>> And let's test that out.\n\n770\n00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:30,090\nI'm going to close this down so we get\na fresh and clean, honest attempt here.\n\n771\n00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,457\nAnd let me just fire up good old PuTTY.\n\n772\n00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:36,580\n>> By far one of the handiest we have.\n\n773\n00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,676\n>> All right, I'm gonna try Telnet.\n\n774\n00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:44,756\n192.168.0.10.\n\n775\n00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:46,716\nSo here I am trying telnet.\n\n776\n00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,046\nFailed to connect.\n\n777\n00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,876\n>> And that's what we're expecting to see.\n\n778\n00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:52,310\n>> And then if I try SSH.\n\n779\n00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,240\nThis time, I get my connection.\n\n780\n00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n781\n00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,150\n>> So we've enabled SSH,\n\n782\n00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,765\nand we've disabled telnet\n>> Now, let's go a step further.\n\n783\n00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:08,220\nAll right.\n\n784\n00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,910\nLet's see what it looks\nlike if somebody tries to\n\n785\n00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,460\nintercept,\n>> Right.\n\n786\n00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,950\n>> this traffic, all right?\n\n787\n00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,020\nI want to repeat the same\nthing that we did before.\n\n788\n00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,350\nSo I'm gonna fire up WireShark.\n\n789\n00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,700\n>> And he's gonna launch it again.\n\n790\n00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,040\nAnd remember the first time when we saw\nthe output from Wireshark, we were pretty\n\n791\n00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,160\nmuch able to see everything that we typed\nin during our initial Telnet session.\n\n792\n00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,454\nNow when Don launches up with SSH, let's\ntake a look at the difference that we see.\n\n793\n00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,385\nSo Don has Wireshark up and open.\n\n794\n00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:44,315\nHe's now gonna log in and\nhe's gonna type in the password.\n\n795\n00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:50,585\nAnd he's now getting into the privilege\nmode, which allows him to be able to see\n\n796\n00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:55,990\nthings and to, he's gonna save our\nrunning-config into our NDRAM.\n\n797\n00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,170\n>> Which I can't spell.\n\n798\n00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,610\n>> Yeah, me neither.\n\n799\n00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,490\n>> That would show up in the template\nlines too, you'd see all the backspaces.\n\n800\n00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,920\n>> So now that he's saved that,\n\n801\n00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,330\nhe may want to take a look at\nthe entire running-config.\n\n802\n00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,380\nSo he's just typed in our show command.\n\n803\n00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,500\nAnd these are just the same\ncommands that I ran before.\n\n804\n00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,940\n>> Now when we get down\nhere at the bottom,\n\n805\n00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,900\nnotice that the actual passwords\nare still showing up here.\n\n806\n00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,580\nSo in telnet,\n\n807\n00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,880\nwe actually saw these passwords as they\nactually came back across the screen.\n\n808\n00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,600\nSo now.\n\n809\n00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,490\n>> Let's go take a look in Wireshark and\nsee what we've got.\n\n810\n00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,310\n>> Let's see what happens.\n\n811\n00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,660\n>> So here inside of Wireshark I can see,\nand notice how it shows SSH version two.\n\n812\n00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,710\nThere's our validation.\n\n813\n00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,660\nEven though it said 1.99,\nit is version two.\n\n814\n00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,810\nAnd so\nI can see that SSH trail right here.\n\n815\n00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,380\nNow, wait a second.\n\n816\n00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,910\nDidn't I say that it was encrypted?\n\n817\n00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,020\nWell, just the fact that\nI can see that it's SSH,\n\n818\n00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,190\ndoesn't mean that I can\nshow what's inside of it.\n\n819\n00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,560\nIf somebody is intercepting\nthis traffic and\n\n820\n00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,350\nthey look at it, all the content\ninside of it is garbled up mess.\n\n821\n00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,880\nNow it was that way in Telnet too.\n\n822\n00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,590\n>> Right.\n\n823\n00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,860\n>> But I right clicked on it, and\nI chose follow the TCP stream, right?\n\n824\n00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,580\nAnd that reassembled it,\nso let's try that again.\n\n825\n00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,410\nI'll reassemble it and this time.\n\n826\n00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,500\n>> Whoa.\nLook at that.\n\n827\n00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,340\nI see where it negotiates out security,\nright here at the beginning, right,\n\n828\n00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,830\nthere's the Cisco and\nPuTTY connecting, and\n\n829\n00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:19,090\nthen after it's connected,\nit is a garbled mess, right?\n\n830\n00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,060\nAnd let me just filter\nit to one direction,\n\n831\n00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,030\nlike the data that I sent to the switch.\n\n832\n00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,530\nHere's the data I sent to the switch.\n\n833\n00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,560\nNow, these are the commands that I typed,\nI did not type this much data.\n\n834\n00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,090\nBut when it was encrypted and sent across\nthe network, it became this garbled mess.\n\n835\n00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,450\nSo an attacker intersecting my traffic,\nit's no longer any good to them.\n\n836\n00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,596\n>> Right\n>> This is secure communications, and\n\n837\n00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,480\nnow our data is safe.\n\n838\n00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,100\n>> Now, Don, let's see if we can\nsee some passwords in there.\n\n839\n00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,830\nCan we see the other side?\n\n840\n00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,360\n>> Yeah. [CROSSTALK] >> Let's see if we\ncan try and spot a password in there.\n\n841\n00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,340\n>> Here's the information\nthat it sent back to me.\n\n842\n00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,050\nSo, like, we did a show running-config.\n\n843\n00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:57,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> That\n\n844\n00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,389\nshould be down here towards the end.\n\n845\n00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:02,030\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Nothing, nope, no can't see it at all.\n\n846\n00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,368\nSo that's the power of\nan in-cryptic connection.\n\n847\n00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:10,380\nRight.\nThat's the reason why you want to use SSH\n\n848\n00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,190\nit is going to provide you the highest\nreal security when you connect to these\n\n849\n00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,759\ndevices over the network.\n\n850\n00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,410\n>> So, usually at this point,\nif you were setting up a router and\n\n851\n00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,410\na switch, you really want to\nget to at least this point.\n\n852\n00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,150\nAnd then you can plug that in, or put it\ninto your rack here, and connect it to\n\n853\n00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,670\nthe network, go back to your nice quiet\noffice, use PuTTy, connect right in,\n\n854\n00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,410\nthe rest of the configuration is ours\n>> And\n\n855\n00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,505\nwe'll be doing some of that later on.\n\n856\n00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:35,710\nYep.\n>> Now I\n\n857\n00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,360\ndo want to touch on one other command,\nwhile we have time for it.\n\n858\n00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:44,260\nWhich is, let's say that I SSH into\nmy switch like I am right now, okay?\n\n859\n00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:49,050\nSo I know I'm connected securely, and\nI start working with the switch, and\n\n860\n00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,910\nworking with the config.\n\n861\n00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,400\nAnd I'm working, and somebody walks by and\nlooks over my shoulder, shoulder surfing.\n\n862\n00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,610\nIf somebody looks over my shoulder, and\nlooks, what's on my screen right now?\n\n863\n00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,360\nThere's my password, right.\n\n864\n00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,890\nAnd that's the password that we assigned\nto the VTY lines for Telnet purposes.\n\n865\n00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,070\nSince we've disabled Telnet,\nwe can actually remove those passwords.\n\n866\n00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,370\nThey're not really necessary anymore.\n\n867\n00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,620\nBut if we still need Telnet or\n\n868\n00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,620\nwhatever, there is an extra step we can\ntake to encrypt the passwords onscreen.\n\n869\n00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,380\nIt's not the most secure\nthing in the world.\n\n870\n00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,520\nIt is reversible encryption,\nso it's not very strong, but\n\n871\n00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,310\nit will defeat that shoulder surfer,\nthat person looking over your shoulder.\n\n872\n00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:33,050\nThere is a service on Cisco\ndevices that you can turn on, and\n\n873\n00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,200\nit will look in your configuration for\nany unencrypted passwords.\n\n874\n00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,750\nAnd if it finds one,\nit will encrypt it for you.\n\n875\n00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,020\nSo, all we have to do is turn that service\non, and so, I wanted to show everybody,\n\n876\n00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,580\njust so you're aware of it.\n\n877\n00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:54,160\nThe command is service\nPassword-encryption.\n\n878\n00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,350\n>> If you run that, service\npassword-encryption, any time the router\n\n879\n00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,160\nor switch finds an unencrypted password in\nthe config, it will encrypt it for you.\n\n880\n00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,490\n>> So just like what you see right\nthere in our virtual lines there,\n\n881\n00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,380\nwhen we see the actual password, Cisco123,\n>> Notice the difference now when\n\n882\n00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,740\nwe take a look at our configuration.\n\n883\n00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,900\n>> So\nif I get all the way to the end there.\n\n884\n00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,360\nNow, instead of seeing that Cisco 123,\nwe see this jumbled mess here.\n\n885\n00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,270\nAll right, now like I said, it's not\nthe strongest encryption around, right?\n\n886\n00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,460\n>> Right.\n>> These are called Cisco type 7\n\n887\n00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,470\npasswords, and it is a non salted,\n\n888\n00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,450\nnon hashed password encryption,\nso it's definitely not strong.\n\n889\n00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,148\nIf you go out to Google,\nand do a search for\n\n890\n00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:43,170\nde-encrypt Cisco password.\n\n891\n00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,420\nWe'll just do that one.\n\n892\n00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,355\nI'll let you go with the first link here.\n\n893\n00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:48,040\nibeast.com.\n\n894\n00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,800\n>> There you go,\n>> And\n\n895\n00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,970\nI'm going to paste in what I just saw and\nsubmit it.\n\n896\n00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,180\nYour password is Cisco123.\n\n897\n00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:53,800\n>> There you go.\n\n898\n00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,150\n>> So, it just took a quick Google\nsearch and I;ve reversed that one.\n\n899\n00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,940\nBut, if someone is walking by,\nlooking over your shoulder.\n\n900\n00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,370\n>> Yup.\n>> They would have to memorize that\n\n901\n00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,840\nstring, so it does provide a,\na basic level of security.\n\n902\n00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,740\nNow because we disabled Telnet.\n\n903\n00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,140\nWe could actually remove those\n>> Yeah.\n\n904\n00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,680\n>> passwords altogether.\n\n905\n00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,820\nSo, so there's not really a risk there.\n\n906\n00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,950\nBut it is a good idea to go ahead and\n\n907\n00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,680\nturn this service\n>> Yeah.\n\n908\n00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,350\n>> On anyway.\n\n909\n00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,500\n>> Now Don, you need to talk about\nthe idea that this is reversible\n\n910\n00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,065\nencryption here.\n\n911\n00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:19,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n912\n00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,450\nSo for us to actually reverse this,\nand if we needed it.\n\n913\n00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,490\nWhat is that we have to type in?\n\n914\n00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,890\nAnything?\n>> Wait a minute, well, the hash.\n\n915\n00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,450\nI mean, not the hash, but the code.\n\n916\n00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,900\nYou'd have to have that code\nto punch it in to reverse it.\n\n917\n00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n918\n00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,314\nBut we can disable this, can't we?\n\n919\n00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:37,877\nNode service password-encryption,\ndid we [CROSSTALK] passwords?\n\n920\n00:46:37,877 --> 00:46:41,620\n>> Yeah, if we turn that off, then\nthe passwords will start to show up again.\n\n921\n00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,180\nAnd that's how it was by default\n>> Okay.\n\n922\n00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:51,420\nSo sometimes if they ask you to turn it\noff, you may actually have to do that.\n\n923\n00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,370\n>> So that's some little things to\nthink about it terms of security.\n\n924\n00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,260\nThere are some other things that we want\nto tackle with our configurations as far\n\n925\n00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,550\nas, there's some convenient\nstuff that I like to turn on.\n\n926\n00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,180\nBut then there are some addition security\nthings that we wanna configure on our\n\n927\n00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,650\nsystem, we only created one user account,\nusername admin.\n\n928\n00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,070\nWe might wanna create other accounts, I\nmight wanna create one for Ronnie, one for\n\n929\n00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,950\nme, and that way in the logs\nI'll see who it was doing what.\n\n930\n00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,900\nSo So that's something that\nwe may want it to tweak.\n\n931\n00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,360\nActually, we do have just\na few more minutes here.\n\n932\n00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,200\nLet's do this.\nI wanna talk\n\n933\n00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,410\nabout one other command before we stop for\nbreak.\n\n934\n00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,980\n>> Okay, sure.\n>> When I enabled SSH earlier,\n\n935\n00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,350\nI didn't see the message on screen.\n\n936\n00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,065\n>> Yep.\n>> And so I had to run, show log,\n\n937\n00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:36,670\nwhich is short for show logging.\n\n938\n00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,000\nAnd when you run show logging or show log,\n\n939\n00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,062\nthat gives you all the log messages\nthat have been put in your system, and\n\n940\n00:47:43,062 --> 00:47:46,340\nI was looking for one specifically,\nthis guy right here.\n\n941\n00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,930\nWell when you are telnetted into\na device or SSHed in like this.\n\n942\n00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,720\nThe log messages don't know show\nup on your screen by default.\n\n943\n00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,710\nAnd they do that because they don't want\nto overwhelm your screen with messages.\n\n944\n00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,070\nIt can be annoying.\n\n945\n00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:04,400\nSo if you remote in like this and you want\nto see these log messages as they occur,\n\n946\n00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,600\nthere's a cool command we can run,\nterminal monitor.\n\n947\n00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,150\nNow notice I'm running this command,\nnot in configuration.\n\n948\n00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,630\nThis is not a permanent command.\n\n949\n00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,740\nIt only affects my connection right now.\n\n950\n00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,980\nIf I log out it goes away and the next\ntime I log in, I'll have to run it again.\n\n951\n00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,460\nBut if I run that, now when log messages\nhappen, I'll see them immediately.\n\n952\n00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,280\nOkay, so if I were to do something like\nunplug a port on this switch, all right,\n\n953\n00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,130\nthat port's going to go down and.\n\n954\n00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:35,900\n>> There you go.\n\n955\n00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,410\n>> I get the message immediately, right.\n\n956\n00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:42,940\nAnd if I plug that port back in,\nthat interface is going to come back up.\n\n957\n00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,180\nand I'll get those messages.\n\n958\n00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,490\nNow it's running spanning tree so\nit might be a moment.\n\n959\n00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,700\nNo it didn't take very long.\n\n960\n00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,180\nSo I'll see those messages.\n\n961\n00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,220\nNow you can see where this\nmight get annoying, right?\n\n962\n00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,640\nYou're trying to work and\nthese messages keep popping up so\n\n963\n00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,190\nit bugs the hell out of you.\n\n964\n00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,180\nSo terminal monitor disables\nitself every time you log out.\n\n965\n00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,540\nSo just remember if you're going\nto be working on something and\n\n966\n00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,070\nyou want to see it works.\n\n967\n00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,300\nTo see it happen?\n\n968\n00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,170\nWell, you need to use this\nterminal monitor command.\n\n969\n00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,920\nAnd that was kinda what killed SSH, or\n\n970\n00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,600\nwhy I didn't see that SSH message is\nthat I hadn't run terminal monitor.\n\n971\n00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:21,530\nIf I do a crypto key gen rsa, It's gonna\nwarn me I already have a certificate.\n\n972\n00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,750\nI'm gonna replace it.\n\n973\n00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,797\nIf I replace it with a 512 bit key,\nnotice what just happened on the screen.\n\n974\n00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:34,240\nSSH 1.99 has been disabled, and I see it\nright now because terminal monitor was on.\n\n975\n00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,240\nNow I've just got a warning telling me\n\n976\n00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,900\nthat-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n977\n00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,490\n>> My key is not good enough,\n\n978\n00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,070\nI need one that is at least 768\nbit to get SSH version one,\n\n979\n00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:49,479\nwhich actually is showing up as 1.5 here,\nbut I can always just re-run it.\n\n980\n00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,650\nAnd bump it up to 1024.\n\n981\n00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:58,380\nAnd it'll step back up to SSH version 2.\n\n982\n00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,800\nSo that terminal monitor\ncommand is a useful command,\n\n983\n00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,710\nit does not stay in the configuration.\n\n984\n00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,580\nIf I do a show running- config.\n\n985\n00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,790\nIt won't show up in here anywhere.\n\n986\n00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,070\nI won't see that terminal monitor command,\nbut it is a cool one to remember.\n\n987\n00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:16,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n988\n00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,240\nNow on our switch, there's only just a,\nwell actually only the router\n\n989\n00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,260\nplugged into it and\nDon plugged into it at this point here.\n\n990\n00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,720\nThe commands that we see in the logs\nare not really flowing by the screen and\n\n991\n00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,720\nflooding the actual screen here.\n\n992\n00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,200\nNow if you haven't actually worked on one\nevery once in a while and yes you do plug\n\n993\n00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,420\ninto a real production network and you\nhave this turned on there may be hundreds?\n\n994\n00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,520\n>> Hundreds of messages\nflowing across the screen.\n\n995\n00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,270\nAnd there's a command that we're gonna,\nare we gonna do that now or\n\n996\n00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,160\nare we gonna do that next segment?\n\n997\n00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,090\n>> Let's do that after the break.\n\n998\n00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:47,880\nThat would be a good one.\n\n999\n00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,500\n>> All right.\nYeah.\n\n1000\n00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,080\nSo we're gonna actually talk about\na command that helps us, in a way,\n\n1001\n00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,170\nto deal with when those\nmessages pop up like that.\n\n1002\n00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,520\nSo that's what we're going to\nactually do after our break here.\n\n1003\n00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,090\n>> That's one of our convenience commands.\n\n1004\n00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,640\nIt makes it a little more pleasant\nto work in the routers and switches.\n\n1005\n00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,280\nAnd we'll tackle that one.\n\n1006\n00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,690\nBut for right now, let's stop here.\n\n1007\n00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,650\nWe'll take a break and when we get back,\nwe'll hit a little bit more security,\n\n1008\n00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,220\na little bit more convenience.\n\n1009\n00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,420\nAnd then wrap things up or\nwind things down from there.\n\n1010\n00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,110\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1011\n00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,770\n>> All right.\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned!\n\n1012\n00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,213\nMore Cisco action after these messages.\n\n1013\n00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:22,679\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1014\n00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,421\nwelcome back.\n\n1015\n00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:31,864\nSo, right before the break,\nRonnie mentioned a command that is one of\n\n1016\n00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:37,220\nmy favorites that I pretty much run on\nevery Cisco device that I connect to.\n\n1017\n00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,550\nI showed you guys the terminal\nmonitor command and\n\n1018\n00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,205\nit's a double edged sword, right?\n\n1019\n00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,030\n>> Mm-hm, right.\n>> Because on one hand,\n\n1020\n00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:48,290\nit does let you see the log\nmessages as they appear.\n\n1021\n00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,180\nOn the other hand,\nit's kind of annoying sometime, right?\n\n1022\n00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,835\nSo let's say.\n\n1023\n00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:55,825\nSay I am in my configuration, right?\n\n1024\n00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:57,505\nAnd I'm working away, doing my stuff.\n\n1025\n00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:59,435\nAnd I'm like okay, I'm done.\n\n1026\n00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:02,885\nI want to get out of config,\nand I wanna save, right?\n\n1027\n00:52:02,885 --> 00:52:10,020\nSo I type end, and\nI start doing copy running -config, man.\n\n1028\n00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,400\nSo now, a log messages popped up\nright in the middle of me typing.\n\n1029\n00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,330\nOkay.\n\n1030\n00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,640\nAnd if I want to backspace,\nsee what it's doing.\n\n1031\n00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,670\nI'm now backspacing over the log message.\n\n1032\n00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,620\n>> Oh wow.\nHow in the world.\n\n1033\n00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,520\n>> It doesn't make any sense.\n\n1034\n00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,860\nIt goes crazy, right?\n\n1035\n00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:29,160\nSo if I remember my keyboard shortcuts,\nI can hit Ctrl+R,\n\n1036\n00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,270\nwhich will redraw the line and I can\nsee where I'm at and I can go, right.\n\n1037\n00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,600\nBut if there's a lot going on, this can\nhappen constantly and it drives me crazy.\n\n1038\n00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,960\nCrazy, right?\n\n1039\n00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:45,510\n>> So what we can do is we can enable\na service called the synchronous logging.\n\n1040\n00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:49,500\nThat tells the router or the switch,\nevery time a log message comes up,\n\n1041\n00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,180\njust automatically redraw the lines,\nwe don't get super annoyed.\n\n1042\n00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,440\nAnd it is a handy component, that's what\nRonnie was talking about before the break.\n\n1043\n00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,041\n>> Yeah, when you have this on\na production network, remember what I said\n\n1044\n00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:05,361\na little bit earlier here, you can have 48\ndevices plugged into this thing and there\n\n1045\n00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:08,690\ncould be so many things going on that\n>> It's constantly moving.\n\n1046\n00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,450\nThose log messages\nare constantly popping up and\n\n1047\n00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,770\nthey're connecting to other networks,\nso they're doing other things, so\n\n1048\n00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,230\nyou're going to have a ton of information.\n\n1049\n00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,550\nSo sometimes it's so\nbad that you really can't even type it in.\n\n1050\n00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,290\n>> And\nthat should keep your train of thought.\n\n1051\n00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:23,880\nRight?\n\n1052\n00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,810\nNow, I was taught,\nwhich was kind of funny.\n\n1053\n00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,850\nWhen I first started\nlearning how to do this.\n\n1054\n00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:28,910\nJust ignore this, just keep typing.\n\n1055\n00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,520\nAnd I was like, how the heck do I do that?\n\n1056\n00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,250\nAnd the weird thing is it works.\n\n1057\n00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,440\nYou can just keep typing and you can\nactually keep your train of thought.\n\n1058\n00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,130\nAs long as it works.\n\n1059\n00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,340\n>> Don't make any typos.\n\n1060\n00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,126\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1061\n00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,850\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1062\n00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,830\nFor me, I like to turn this on.\n\n1063\n00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:47,548\nI just went into line VTY04,\nI'm on a switch, I needed to do VTY015.\n\n1064\n00:53:47,548 --> 00:53:52,131\n[CROSSTALK] So let me go fix that.\n\n1065\n00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:55,450\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> In both these commands here, the key\n\n1066\n00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,630\nfor us to remember, right, is that we have\nto turn it on on both of these interfaces.\n\n1067\n00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,674\nFor either telnet or SSH access,\n\n1068\n00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:06,492\nas well as the console access if I want to\nensure that this happens where the line\n\n1069\n00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:10,380\nis going to be re-drawn at the bottom\nedge of the screen for us.\n\n1070\n00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,155\nI can turn it on for\none and not the other, and\n\n1071\n00:54:13,155 --> 00:54:18,360\nit can cause some consternation as you\ncan't run it if you are connected on one.\n\n1072\n00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,626\n>> Consternation,\nthat's the exact word I would use.\n\n1073\n00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:22,210\nYep.\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\n\n1074\n00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,350\nI've got my login turned on, now let's\ndo the same example I did a minute ago,\n\n1075\n00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,850\nI wanna get out of config and\nI wanna save right?\n\n1076\n00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:34,200\nSo I type end and then I start to say\nby doing copy and see what happened?\n\n1077\n00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:34,830\n>> Oh look at that.\n\n1078\n00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,160\n>> See how i had typed copy r and\n\n1079\n00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,370\nthen the log message came up and\nit automatically redrew the line.\n\n1080\n00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:48,030\nAnd so now I just keep typing as if\nnothing happened and life is good.\n\n1081\n00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,760\nSo that is a pretty handy thing,\nI turn it on, on every device.\n\n1082\n00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,328\nNotice how I turned it on, on the VTY\nlines and well as the console port.\n\n1083\n00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:59,200\nLine Con 0.\n\n1084\n00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,780\nCuz if I'm consoled in, there you\ndon't have to do terminal monitor,\n\n1085\n00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,950\nthe log messages are always\ndisplayed on the console.\n\n1086\n00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,760\nSo you can really get annoyed there.\n\n1087\n00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,130\nSo it's a nice place to have\nlogging synchronous turned on.\n\n1088\n00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:14,540\n>> So when we start taking a look at this,\nnice commands, again, more for\n\n1089\n00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,000\nconvenience than anything else.\n\n1090\n00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,090\nBut let's talk about some of those\nother security commands that you were\n\n1091\n00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,090\ntalking about as well, Don.\n\n1092\n00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,270\nOne of the things that we may have.\n\n1093\n00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,990\nAnd I don't wanna say that it\nhappens all the time, here.\n\n1094\n00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:29,680\nBut, for me, is that, what if I Telnet in,\nand it looks like that, hey.\n\n1095\n00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,200\nWhat was I about to say?\n\n1096\n00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,165\nI can't even remember\nwhat I was about to say.\n\n1097\n00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:34,912\n[LAUGH]\n>> See,\n\n1098\n00:55:34,912 --> 00:55:38,380\nif only you'd had synchronous\nlogging turned on.\n\n1099\n00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,590\n>> Oh, no, tell me about it,\nyeah, in my brain.\n\n1100\n00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,710\n>> Your thought would just reappear again.\n\n1101\n00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,910\n>> But I mean I literally just\nlost that train of thought.\n\n1102\n00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,050\nI really did, crud.\n\n1103\n00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,000\n>> [LAUGH] I'm sure it was profound.\n\n1104\n00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,550\n>> I did, yeah.\n\n1105\n00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crap.\n\n1106\n00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,853\n>> All right well let me\ntalk about another one and\n\n1107\n00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:53,300\nas soon as you remember you\ncan jump right back in.\n\n1108\n00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,270\nSo logging synchronous is great because\nit does help you keep it peace of mind,\n\n1109\n00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,438\nyou can see it's obviously working for\nRonnie.\n\n1110\n00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,425\nAnother thing, you guys didn't see it but\nduring the commercial break,\n\n1111\n00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,938\nthe commercial break in which\nwe showed no commercials.\n\n1112\n00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:09,515\n[LAUGH] But during the break,\nmy session timed out.\n\n1113\n00:56:09,515 --> 00:56:10,505\n>> That's what I was going for.\n\n1114\n00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:12,650\n>> Oh, is that what you were going for?\n\n1115\n00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,700\nSame reader, so\nthe longer you let it sit here and idle,\n\n1116\n00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,330\neventually it will hang up on you.\n\n1117\n00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,740\nAnd you want that.\n\n1118\n00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,153\nIf you get up and you walk away from your\ncomputer, you don't want somebody else to\n\n1119\n00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,836\ncome and sit down right behind you and\n[SOUND] get into the system.\n\n1120\n00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:26,825\nThey make that sound.\n\n1121\n00:56:26,825 --> 00:56:31,430\n[LAUGH] And so we wanna make sure\nthat if we stay logged in idle,\n\n1122\n00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,520\nthat it logs us out.\n\n1123\n00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,090\nThe default timer, I've seen it\nvary on different devices, but\n\n1124\n00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,730\nit's normally five or ten minutes.\n\n1125\n00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,400\n>> Right.\n>> It's not a long window.\n\n1126\n00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,880\nYou can, if this is like your home\nequipment, your practice lab,\n\n1127\n00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,380\nyou can turn the timeout off altogether.\n\n1128\n00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,390\nOr [COUGH] if this is production equipment\nyou can just pick the interval you\n\n1129\n00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,910\nwant, right?\n\n1130\n00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,340\nMaybe five minutes is not long enough for\n\n1131\n00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,970\nyou so\nyou want it to be ten minutes right?\n\n1132\n00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,190\n>> And you do wanna kind of pick\nsomething that's going to help you out.\n\n1133\n00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:02,910\nWhen you log in because if you turn around\nand it's five minutes, phone call rings,\n\n1134\n00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,950\nall of a sudden, you turn around, there\nit is, it's kinda kicked you out again.\n\n1135\n00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,620\nSo here Don is actually\ntyping in as we begin here.\n\n1136\n00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,230\nWhat he's setting for\nthe virtual lines, the town ed or\n\n1137\n00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,540\nSSA axis here,\nis that he's typed in exec timeout, and\n\n1138\n00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,360\nnotice that we get to pick the numbers\nin minutes, and then, later on, watch.\n\n1139\n00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,200\nWe even get to pick\nseconds if we choose to.\n\n1140\n00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n1141\n00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,560\nIf I wanna set it to five minutes,\nI can just say exec dash timeout Five.\n\n1142\n00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,290\n>> Five.\n\n1143\n00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,740\nAnd I'm done, right.\n\n1144\n00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,350\nIf I want it to be five minutes and\n\n1145\n00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,730\n30 seconds, you'll see where I\ncan specify seconds also, and so\n\n1146\n00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:39,630\nI can say, exec-timeout 5 30, and\nthat would be 5 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\n1147\n00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,470\nI don't know anybody who's that specific.\n\n1148\n00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,780\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say, wow.\n\n1149\n00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,860\n>> But maybe I'll bump mine up to 15.\n\n1150\n00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,780\n>> Yeah.\nSo I'm gonna say exec-timeout 15.\n\n1151\n00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,940\nNow, that applies to the vty lines.\n\n1152\n00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,840\nI also want to apply that to my console.\n\n1153\n00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:00,270\nAnd so I'll get in here and\nset that to 15 minutes, too.\n\n1154\n00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,490\nThe console is even more important.\n\n1155\n00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,910\nWith SSH, if I close my session,\nthe session is gone, and that's it.\n\n1156\n00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:10,560\nWith your console connections,\nif you unplug your console cable,\n\n1157\n00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,110\nthis light blue cable right here, if we\nunplug that, your session is still live.\n\n1158\n00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> Somebody else could come behind with\n\n1159\n00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,460\ntheir own cable and plug in, and\nit's still logged in and going.\n\n1160\n00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,960\nSo on a console connection,\nyou may even want to set it shorter.\n\n1161\n00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,230\n>> Right\n>> Or just some interval so\n\n1162\n00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:30,500\nthat if you walk away, it'll lock itself\nin a certain, decent amount of time.\n\n1163\n00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,830\n>> So setting a timeout is one of\nthe security features that we do have\n\n1164\n00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:34,970\nthat is something important.\n\n1165\n00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,465\nAnd I really was going there and\nI don't know why my mind just,\n\n1166\n00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:42,180\nit merged logging synchronous with\ntime and I was like, that's not right.\n\n1167\n00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,350\nI don't know what happened there.\n\n1168\n00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,870\n>> Well you mentioned logging so\n\n1169\n00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:48,710\nthis is a good lead in to another command\nthat I like to do on new equipment.\n\n1170\n00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,480\nAnd I keep saying these\nare commands I like to do.\n\n1171\n00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,850\nThey show up on the exam [LAUGH],\nthey are good to know for that.\n\n1172\n00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,100\nBut, one thing you might have\nnoticed with the log messages.\n\n1173\n00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,600\nSo lets wait for this one to come up.\n\n1174\n00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,540\nThere we go.\n\n1175\n00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,220\nNotice it's saying that\nthis event just happened.\n\n1176\n00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,870\nWe were configured from console.\n\n1177\n00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:07,420\nRight.\n\n1178\n00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,050\nAnd it occurred on March 1st.\n\n1179\n00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,190\nWell, today is not March 1st.\n\n1180\n00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,580\nToday is September 12th.\n\n1181\n00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,900\nSo the date is wrong in the message.\n\n1182\n00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,320\nAnd we can actually manipulate several\nthings when it comes to date and time.\n\n1183\n00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,490\nThe first thing that we need to do,\nand this is good for security purposes\n\n1184\n00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,730\nbecause you may need to synchronize\nyour logs across multiple devices,\n\n1185\n00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:34,110\nthe first thing we need to do is make\nsure the clock is correct on our system.\n\n1186\n00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,150\nAnd the clock is one\nof those weird things.\n\n1187\n00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,290\nIt's one of the only things that we\nconfigure outside of configuration.\n\n1188\n00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,300\nSo if I wanna set the clock,\n\n1189\n00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,530\nthe first thing I need to do is\nfigure out what time it is, right.\n\n1190\n00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:51,010\nSo right now, it is 4:15 PM and\nso what we do, is we say clock,\n\n1191\n00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,660\nset, and then we specify the time, right.\n\n1192\n00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,400\nAfterwards, we specify the date.\n\n1193\n00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,570\nAnd you can specify the date in\nall sorts of different formats.\n\n1194\n01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, really whatever makes\n\n1195\n01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,720\nsense for you.\n\n1196\n01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,890\nSo, I'm gonna go in here and\njust say clock, set.\n\n1197\n01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:06,640\nAnd I'll set it to.\n\n1198\n01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,450\nYou need to do it in military times.\n\n1199\n01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:13,230\nSo, it's actually 16:15,\nactually it's 16:16 now.\n\n1200\n01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:13,730\n16 now.\n>> Yep.\n\n1201\n01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,360\n>> And 00 seconds and\nit is September 12 1013.\n\n1202\n01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,099\n>> Yeah.\n\n1203\n01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:22,777\n>> Okay.\n>> Now remember,\n\n1204\n01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:24,860\nyou have to actually set all of that,\ndon't you?\n\n1205\n01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,260\nYou can't just kind of, can you\njust set the time and not the date?\n\n1206\n01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,430\n>> I think you can set just the time.\n\n1207\n01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,740\n>> I can't remember.\n\n1208\n01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,760\nNo, no-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1209\n01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,180\n>> It does require you to specify.\n\n1210\n01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,920\n>> So remember, you have to set\neverything if you're gonna do this.\n\n1211\n01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,780\n>> Now I did just think of something that\nI forgot, and it's gonna cause a problem.\n\n1212\n01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,475\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1213\n01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:44,326\n>> We set the time.\n\n1214\n01:00:44,326 --> 01:00:45,710\nAnd as soon as I set the time,\n\n1215\n01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,410\nI got a nice little message\nletting me know it was set.\n\n1216\n01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,020\n>> Oh, there we go.\n>> And look what it says.\n\n1217\n01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:55,070\nIt set it, and it set it for 02:14,\nUTC, that's what time it was.\n\n1218\n01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,830\nNow we have it set for 16:16 UTC.\n\n1219\n01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:00,420\nUTC is the Universal Time Code,\nit's also called Zulu Time,\n\n1220\n01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,740\nGreenwich Mean Time,\nany of the the numbers numerous names.\n\n1221\n01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,740\nI'm not in UTC,\nwe're in the Eastern Time Zone.\n\n1222\n01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,640\nSo the time zone is wrong.\n\n1223\n01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,510\nWhen I go and fix the time zone,\nit's gonna mess my time up.\n\n1224\n01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,620\nI'll have to come and set it again.\n\n1225\n01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,910\nSo I should have set the time zone first.\n\n1226\n01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:19,050\nBut this command is the one\nthat we run outside of config,\n\n1227\n01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,060\neverything else is done inside of config.\n\n1228\n01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,705\nSo let's go fix that time zone.\n\n1229\n01:01:22,705 --> 01:01:28,490\n[SOUND] So in our global configuration\nterminal, once we're actually in here\n\n1230\n01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:34,104\nwe are now ready to set the time zone,\nand do we set the daylight in here too?\n\n1231\n01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:35,320\n>> Yup, we can set them both right here.\n\n1232\n01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,620\n>> All right-\n>> So I just ran clock?, and so\n\n1233\n01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,670\nwe've got time zone and summer time.\n\n1234\n01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:41,780\nSummer time is Daylight Saving Time.\n\n1235\n01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,470\nSo we can set these values in here for\nclock time zone,\n\n1236\n01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,730\nwe basically give it a name, so\nI'm gonna say my time zone is called EST,\n\n1237\n01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,010\nEastern Standard Time, you can type in\nwhatever name you want, call it Bob,\n\n1238\n01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,740\nif you want, and\nI'll say that it is GMT-5.\n\n1239\n01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,240\n>> Right.\n\n1240\n01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:04,050\n>> So clock, time zone EST-5,\nI'll get a message,\n\n1241\n01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,000\nthere it is, telling me that we're\nnow in Eastern Standard Time.\n\n1242\n01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,700\nAnd CL went ahead and subtracted the time\nfor me and so now my clock is wrong.\n\n1243\n01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,750\n>> Right.\n>> So we'll fix that in a second.\n\n1244\n01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:18,869\nThe other thing I need to do is say,\nclock summer-time,\n\n1245\n01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:22,550\nEDT and you can call this one whatever,\nyou can call it Fred if you want.\n\n1246\n01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,630\nI'm gonna call it EDT for Eastern\nDaylight Time, so now I'm gonna say\n\n1247\n01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,680\nthat we do observe daylight savings,\nbecause not everybody does,\n\n1248\n01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,399\nlike I think the entire state of Arizona,\nsome city in Ohio so not everybody does.\n\n1249\n01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:38,272\nAnd then I'll say, 'EDT,' and then,\n\n1250\n01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:43,525\n'recurring,' which means\nwe observe it every year.\n\n1251\n01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:45,170\n>> Right.\n>> This isn't a one time thing.\n\n1252\n01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,250\nIt is something we always observe.\n\n1253\n01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,900\nNow it knows that Daylight Saving Time\nis one hour back so\n\n1254\n01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,660\nI didn't have to do the minus four or\nwhatever.\n\n1255\n01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,130\nSo it sorts that out.\n\n1256\n01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,370\nSo now my time zones are right but\nI do need to go and fix my clock.\n\n1257\n01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:04,959\nSo I'm gonna get out of config and,\nlet's see, it is now 04:19.\n\n1258\n01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,520\nAnd now it'll be correct.\n\n1259\n01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:15,380\nSo now it shows that it is 04:19\nEastern Daylight time, Thursday,\n\n1260\n01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,330\nSeptember 12, 2013.\n\n1261\n01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:22,750\n>> This is a very good command for us\nbecause this now actually helps us then,\n\n1262\n01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,880\nas you're starting to see on the screen,\nis now allowing the logging to match up to\n\n1263\n01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,820\n>> To the true time, okay?\n\n1264\n01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,710\nWell, why is that beneficial, Don?\n\n1265\n01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,460\nWhy does it matter if I show March\n1st at 02:30 in the morning,\n\n1266\n01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,000\neven though it just happened?\n\n1267\n01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,010\n>> If I've got logs across 15 different\n\n1268\n01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:39,840\ndevices\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1269\n01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,074\n>> I may want to see one event\nhappened at a certain time and\n\n1270\n01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:45,000\nbe able to identify it across all\nthose different pieces of equipment.\n\n1271\n01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,500\nSo having synchronized\nclocks is very handy.\n\n1272\n01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,174\nAnd if you have a network time\nserver you can use those to,\n\n1273\n01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:53,830\nCisco doesn't really push\ninto it on this exam.\n\n1274\n01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,350\nBut in like the CCNA security they do.\n\n1275\n01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:59,040\nSo it does support time\nservers if you want, but\n\n1276\n01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,850\nmanually setting it here is what\nshows up on the CCENT exam.\n\n1277\n01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,500\nNow one other thing I\nwant to point out is in\n\n1278\n01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,920\nevery log message there will\nbe this time stamp right here.\n\n1279\n01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,960\nThere's a couple of problems\nwith the timestamp.\n\n1280\n01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,990\nAll right, first off, actually let me\nshow you what it normally looks like.\n\n1281\n01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:19,160\nIf I get into config and\nget out, all right.\n\n1282\n01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:23,581\nAll right, so here would be\na normal log message right there.\n\n1283\n01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:27,660\nSeptember 12, 2012 0.519, right?\n\n1284\n01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,670\nSo it's telling me that\nthis happened at 8:20 PM,\n\n1285\n01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,720\nand 12 seconds, and\n519 milliseconds, right?\n\n1286\n01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,510\nVery specific time.\n\n1287\n01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,470\nBut it also doesn't tell me the time zone.\n\n1288\n01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,860\nI don't know which time zone this is in,\nokay.\n\n1289\n01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,050\nSo is this Eastern?\n\n1290\n01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,000\nIs it whatever?\n\n1291\n01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,260\nWell, by default, it's UTC.\n\n1292\n01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,740\nIt's actually showing it still in UTC,\n\n1293\n01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,080\neven though it knows my time\nzone is Eastern Daylight.\n\n1294\n01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,750\nSo there's some additional things that\nwe may want to configure as far as it\n\n1295\n01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,932\njust being this timestamp.\n\n1296\n01:04:59,932 --> 01:05:03,530\nThe timestamp is actually part of\nyour configuration by default.\n\n1297\n01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:07,750\nIf we do our show running dash config,\nit's one of the first commands.\n\n1298\n01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:15,570\nHere is service, timestamps,\nlog, datetime and msec.\n\n1299\n01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:20,150\nSo, that means on any log,\ninclude a timestamp of the date and\n\n1300\n01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,160\ntime, all the way down to milliseconds.\n\n1301\n01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,720\n>> Right\n>> Now, I don't like that.\n\n1302\n01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,300\nI don't like seeing the milliseconds,\ncuz, it's not that terrible useful.\n\n1303\n01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,030\nAnd I like to include\nthings like the timezone.\n\n1304\n01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,602\nSo we're gonna go in and configure that.\n\n1305\n01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,345\nSo I'm just gonna say\nservice timestamps log and\n\n1306\n01:05:38,345 --> 01:05:41,130\nthen we can use the question\nmark to kind of guide us.\n\n1307\n01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,290\nWhat is some of the stuff that we can see?\n\n1308\n01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,840\nDate time is what we normally want.\n\n1309\n01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,490\nOn really old Cisco devices,\nthey used to use the uptime.\n\n1310\n01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> How long it had been since the device\n\n1311\n01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,350\nrebooted.\n\n1312\n01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:53,920\nIt was a near useless number.\n\n1313\n01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I always hated that.\n\n1314\n01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,950\nBut we'll go with date time.\n\n1315\n01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:00,020\nAnd then you'll see that we can specify.\n\n1316\n01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,060\nDo I want it to be at local time or not?\n\n1317\n01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:03,700\nRight?\n\n1318\n01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,290\nI want my logs to be in local time.\n\n1319\n01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,900\nBut if I have devices in\nmore than one area, so\n\n1320\n01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:13,560\nif you have offices in\nthe Eastern time zone and\n\n1321\n01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:18,160\nthe Pacific time zone,\nyou may want it to show the time zone,\n\n1322\n01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:23,320\nalso, as part of that time stamp so\nthat you know what time zone it was in.\n\n1323\n01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,790\nAnd then lastly we could go\ndown to the milliseconds.\n\n1324\n01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:30,501\nI don't normally do that because I\nthink that it's somewhat of a waste.\n\n1325\n01:06:30,501 --> 01:06:31,955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so,\n\n1326\n01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:35,245\nnow that I've adjusted that,\nwhen we get log messages,\n\n1327\n01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:38,755\nthere gonna have much more meaningful\ninformation attached to them and so\n\n1328\n01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:43,360\nI'm gonna get out of config, and we'll\nsee one of those log messages appear.\n\n1329\n01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,050\n>> Hey, look at that.\n\n1330\n01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:44,770\nSeptember 12th.\n\n1331\n01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,930\n4:22 PM, Eastern daylight time.\n\n1332\n01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,268\n>> Yep.\n\n1333\n01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:49,400\n>> Nice.\n>> And now it's in our actual time where\n\n1334\n01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,820\nit makes sense, and it lets me know that\nit's eastern daylight, so that, again,\n\n1335\n01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,030\nhelps with synchronizing other equipment\nthat may be in different time zones.\n\n1336\n01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,720\n>> Now Don is the best place for a,\nwe're not gonna get too deep in this,\n\n1337\n01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,150\nbut how can I get those messages\nwhere I can see them differently?\n\n1338\n01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,630\nCan I send them off to someplace?\n\n1339\n01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,890\n>> Yeah, you know as far as the CCENT\nis concerned your logs right here on\n\n1340\n01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,130\nthe router and that's it.\n\n1341\n01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:17,350\nIn the advanced certifications,\nthey want you to learn some other ways.\n\n1342\n01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:17,920\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n1343\n01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,580\none of the common ways is to use\nwhat's called a syslog server.\n\n1344\n01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,740\nAnd a syslog server is where\nyou take these log messages and\n\n1345\n01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,240\nyou send them off somewhere else.\n\n1346\n01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,050\nAnd the reason Ronnie brings it up is\nIf you're supporting 50 Cisco devices,\n\n1347\n01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,990\nyou can set up a single\ncentralized server.\n\n1348\n01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:37,450\nAll those messages get sent back to\nthat one place, stored right there, and\n\n1349\n01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,280\nyou can then just look in one place\ninstead of having to go to 50 devices.\n\n1350\n01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,900\nThat's where it becomes really important\nto synchronize those times because\n\n1351\n01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,940\nyou got all the different devices.\n\n1352\n01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:46,570\nCoexisting.\n\n1353\n01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n1354\n01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,770\nYou hear that term quite\noften a lot of times.\n\n1355\n01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:54,000\nEven in just regular networking,\nthey talk about check the syslog server.\n\n1356\n01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,020\nSo at least even at this point, even\nthough we aren't getting in to configuring\n\n1357\n01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,500\none or how to send our messages to one.\n\n1358\n01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,940\nWe do want to at least know that\nthat term exists at this point.\n\n1359\n01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,200\n>> Yeah.\nBasically everything except\n\n1360\n01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,910\nMicrosoft Windows uses syslog.\n\n1361\n01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,000\nRight?\nSo Linux.\n\n1362\n01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,310\nOSX, Unix, BSD, Cisco routers, Juniper\nrouters, you know, they all use sys log.\n\n1363\n01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,850\nMicrosoft is the only one that uses\ntheir own little event viewer,\n\n1364\n01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:20,110\nwhich even that you could output to\na sis log server if you really want to.\n\n1365\n01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:22,020\nBut it is a useful thing.\n\n1366\n01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,860\nRemember for the CCE and\nT exam they're talking small environments,\n\n1367\n01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,370\none router, one switch, nothing too crazy.\n\n1368\n01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,640\nIn the other exams you get more complex,\nand\n\n1369\n01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,390\nyou start to delve into things like that.\n\n1370\n01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,420\nAll right, so Ronnie, what have we done?\n\n1371\n01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:41,212\nWe've done the clocks and the timestamps,\nwe've did our logging synchronous.\n\n1372\n01:08:41,212 --> 01:08:41,779\n>> Time out.\n\n1373\n01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:43,481\n>> We did Our exact time outs.\n\n1374\n01:08:43,481 --> 01:08:45,310\nWe've got SSH up and running.\n\n1375\n01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,920\nWe've got Telnet up and running.\n\n1376\n01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,080\nThe web interface.\n\n1377\n01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,840\n>> Web interface.\n\n1378\n01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:54,200\n>> So, Cisco devices, most of Cisco\ndevices have a web interface.\n\n1379\n01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,605\nYou might not know it Well, you might\nnot ever see it, but it is there.\n\n1380\n01:08:57,635 --> 01:08:59,725\nOn some devices it's\nturned off by default.\n\n1381\n01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:01,305\nOn some, it's turned on.\n\n1382\n01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:04,655\nOn the exam, you're not allowed to\nuse the web interface to configure.\n\n1383\n01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:06,965\nThey'll make you use the command line.\n\n1384\n01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:09,440\nBut in real life,\nyou might want it, right?\n\n1385\n01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,010\nAnd it is different for different devices.\n\n1386\n01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,060\nLet me see if this one has it by default.\n\n1387\n01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,530\nLet me just point a web browser to\n192.168.0.10 and see what I get.\n\n1388\n01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:22,360\nAll right, it's asking for a username and\n\n1389\n01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:27,020\npassword, so I'll punch in admin and\ncisco123 and here we go.\n\n1390\n01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:33,370\nSo here's my Cisco Systems\nws3560 ITProTV Switch.\n\n1391\n01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,290\nSo now I can get it to do you know,\npings or whatever.\n\n1392\n01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,830\nWhat is this a web console?\n\n1393\n01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,500\nGo to that.\n\n1394\n01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,345\nNope it's not an install.\n\n1395\n01:09:39,345 --> 01:09:40,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so\n\n1396\n01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,700\nsome of them have a really\n>> Yeah.\n\n1397\n01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,780\n>> Fancy GY\n>> Right.\n\n1398\n01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,570\n>> That can be installed.\n\n1399\n01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,730\nAnd that's called a web console.\n\n1400\n01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:45,550\nThis one does not have it.\n\n1401\n01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,660\nSo, now that's a switch.\n\n1402\n01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,610\nThe router should have one also,\nlet's see.\n\n1403\n01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:56,320\nLet's see if we can fire it up, and nope.\n\n1404\n01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,430\nApparently not.\n\n1405\n01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,460\nAll right, so, or\nit may just be turned off, or whatever.\n\n1406\n01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:05,270\nNow, that web interface, it can be\nhandy sometimes, cuz you can actually\n\n1407\n01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:08,283\ngo in here and you can run commands,\nyou can do all sorts of stuffs, so for\n\n1408\n01:10:08,283 --> 01:10:13,240\nexample I can switch to a level 15 prompt,\nand I could do a show version\n\n1409\n01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:19,450\nand I could run it, and\nthen right here is the output for.\n\n1410\n01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,890\nThe show version command right\nin my web browser, right.\n\n1411\n01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,520\nSo that's useful if you need to email\nto tech support or something like that.\n\n1412\n01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,780\nSo kind of neat.\n\n1413\n01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,760\nBut, the more services you have\nrunning on a router or switch,\n\n1414\n01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,530\nthe more of an attack surface it has if\nsomebody's gonna try and break into it.\n\n1415\n01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,470\nSo, I normally disable it.\n\n1416\n01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,200\nI don't usually use the web server.\n\n1417\n01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:43,120\nWhen it comes to securing web server,\nyou got two choices.\n\n1418\n01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,730\nOne you can turn it off,\nthat's what I normally do, or\n\n1419\n01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:50,420\ntwo you can force it to\noperate in secure only mode.\n\n1420\n01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,366\nSo, when you configure there\nis two commands to remember,\n\n1421\n01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:59,180\nthere's IP http server.\n\n1422\n01:10:59,180 --> 01:10:59,950\nLike that.\n\n1423\n01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:04,118\nThat turns on the unencrypted server,\nand there's IPHTTP.\n\n1424\n01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:05,913\n>> Secure server.\n\n1425\n01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,840\n>> Secure-server.\n\n1426\n01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,620\nThat turns on the one that uses SSL, and\nyou'll see here it's generating an SSL\n\n1427\n01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:17,490\nkey right there it's actually a shortcut\nif you wanna generate a key for SSH,\n\n1428\n01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,400\nyou can do this and it makes it.\n\n1429\n01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,400\nBut that generates that certificate,\ngets it in place.\n\n1430\n01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,560\nAnd now, when I fire up my web browser,\nI could browse to that switch with https.\n\n1431\n01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,360\nAnd so now it's at least a secure page.\n\n1432\n01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,110\nSo anything that I send is going\nto be encrypted I'm not sending my\n\n1433\n01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,480\npassword across the network in\nplain text like I was a moment ago.\n\n1434\n01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,120\n>> There you go.\n\n1435\n01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,869\n>> Now and SSL certificate doesn't stop\nsomebody from trying to brute force that\n\n1436\n01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:46,300\npassword or trying to get in.\n\n1437\n01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,050\nIt just makes sure that\nyour data is encrypted.\n\n1438\n01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,590\nSo, it's still not the greatest solution.\n\n1439\n01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,750\nIn my opinion, the best solution-\n>> Turn it off.\n\n1440\n01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,750\n>> Is to turn it off.\n\n1441\n01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,899\nAnd if we wanna turn it off,\nthat's pretty straightforward,\n\n1442\n01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,259\nwe can just say, no IP HTTP server.\n\n1443\n01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,760\nNow, it's running in secure only mode.\n\n1444\n01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,070\nAnd then,\nI can run no IP HTTP secure-server.\n\n1445\n01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,150\nNow, they're both off entirely.\n\n1446\n01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,335\nAnd let's just verify that.\n\n1447\n01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll go back here and\n\n1448\n01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:22,940\nI'm gonna browse to 192.168.0.10 unsecure.\n\n1449\n01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,460\nPage cannot be displayed.\n\n1450\n01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,337\nAnd now, let's try secure.\n\n1451\n01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:29,749\nAnd page cannot be displayed.\n\n1452\n01:12:29,749 --> 01:12:31,010\n>> Nice.\n\n1453\n01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,470\n>> So,\nanother way to kinda secure systems,\n\n1454\n01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,960\nyou're just trying to\nminimize what's on there.\n\n1455\n01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,760\nNow, that I've got it in my head here,\nI'm gonna connect to that router,\n\n1456\n01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,480\nand let's see if it's got\nits web servers installed.\n\n1457\n01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,999\nI think we just set it up for\ntelnet, didn't we?\n\n1458\n01:12:49,691 --> 01:12:50,294\nWhoops.\n\n1459\n01:12:58,955 --> 01:13:00,511\n[CROSSTALK] I'm just turning it on.\n\n1460\n01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:03,840\n>> So, realize the same commands\non the switch are on the router.\n\n1461\n01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,757\nIt allows us to actually learn a lot\nabout two devices even at one time here.\n\n1462\n01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:12,690\n>> There we go.\n\n1463\n01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:13,740\n>> There we go, nice.\n\n1464\n01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,280\n>> So, now, I'm browsing into the router.\n\n1465\n01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,900\nAnd just like the switch when\nI connect up here it is, and\n\n1466\n01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:25,500\nI've got my same basic things, I can\ndrop into my command prompt and I can do\n\n1467\n01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:30,740\nshow version or whatever, and there it is,\nI can switch over to configuration.\n\n1468\n01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,120\nAnd I wonder if it has\nthe QoS Device Manager.\n\n1469\n01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,256\nNope.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1470\n01:13:36,256 --> 01:13:38,085\n>> So, routers sometimes also have\n\n1471\n01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:40,300\nan advanced GUI that's installed.\n\n1472\n01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,976\nThis one does not.\n\n1473\n01:13:42,976 --> 01:13:43,990\nSo, neat stuff.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1474\n01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,170\n>> Again,\na lot of people don't need this, and\n\n1475\n01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:47,980\nit is just a security\nrisk to leave it enabled.\n\n1476\n01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:52,270\nSo, you do a no IP HTTP server and\nno IP HTTP\n\n1477\n01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:58,240\nsecured as server and\nthat'll knock it out.\n\n1478\n01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,748\nRonnie??\n\n1479\n01:13:58,748 --> 01:13:59,358\n>> Yes.\n\n1480\n01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:03,638\n>> I feel like that is-\n>> Everything\n\n1481\n01:14:03,638 --> 01:14:04,920\n>> That's really it for the,\n\n1482\n01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,275\ncan you think of any other\ncommands that we might?\n\n1483\n01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:10,695\n>> No,\nI think we've covered the basics here.\n\n1484\n01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:12,785\n>> The convenience commands or anything.\n\n1485\n01:14:12,785 --> 01:14:19,820\n>> No, and we've talked about the idea of\nlogging synchronous, the exact time out.\n\n1486\n01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,830\n>> We set our time stamps,\nthat's important,\n\n1487\n01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:26,630\nwe got our passwords, SSH was turned on,\nTelnet was turned off, yes.\n\n1488\n01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,750\nWe did the transport input\nSSH that limited that.\n\n1489\n01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,940\nSo, those are all the basic commands.\n\n1490\n01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:37,180\nWhen I get a new router or a new switch,\neverything that you just saw in the last\n\n1491\n01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,570\ntwo episodes, that's normally what I do\nto get them just with the basic configs.\n\n1492\n01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:44,150\nNow, we're gonna learn\na lot more advanced stuff.\n\n1493\n01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:47,470\nWe'll do security ACLs and\nall sorts of other things.\n\n1494\n01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:50,767\nBut for our basic configuration,\nthat pretty much knocks it out.\n\n1495\n01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:51,410\n>> Yeah, really good.\n\n1496\n01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,085\n>> So, let's go and\nwrap it up here,

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,950\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT ProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,290\nI'm your host Don Pezet today and\nI'm accompanied by Ronny Wong!\n\n7\n00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,450\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,060\n>> It is going well, we're ready for\nanother day of CCNT.\n\n9\n00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,760\n>> Normally I comment on how long it's\nbeen since we've done an episode, but\n\n10\n00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,830\nit really hasn't has it?\n\n11\n00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,980\n>> No it's been quite a few moments.\n\n12\n00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,480\n>> So many- Yeah that's right- days.\n\n13\n00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,350\nAnyhow we're jumping right\nback into our Cisco world\n\n14\n00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,510\nlast episode we tackled\nswitch technologies, right?\n\n15\n00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,650\nAnd it really, it wasn't so\n\n16\n00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,660\nmuch switch technologies as much as it\nwas just basic device configuration.\n\n17\n00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,170\nSo, we had done an episode\nin Cisco routers, and\n\n18\n00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,390\nthat basic configuration\nyou apply on them.\n\n19\n00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,740\nThen we went to a switch\ndid the same thing and\n\n20\n00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,100\nthen went a little more advanced.\n\n21\n00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,570\nWe did SSH and secure web services.\n\n22\n00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,310\nWhat else did we do?\n\n23\n00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,680\n>> We ending up configuring access to it\nby configuring the virtual interface.\n\n24\n00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,160\nLearned that if we're\ngonna actually be able to\n\n25\n00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,330\nremotely manage that picker switch.\n\n26\n00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,300\nWe need to actually configure\ninterface VLAN 1 so we also\n\n27\n00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,380\nconfigured an IP address on there and then\nwe showed you how you could Telnet in,\n\n28\n00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,370\nand then we also showed you how to\nsecure that by instead using SSH.\n\n29\n00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,020\nSo we ended up generating a certificate,\nwe ended up putting a domain name,\n\n30\n00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,215\nhost name, and we added in and\nall the basic configurations that you and\n\n31\n00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:56,305\nI would really want to do when we begin\nthe setup with the switch as well.\n\n32\n00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,765\n>> So at the end of the episode\nwe had a configured switch,\n\n33\n00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:04,140\nit was ready to do some operations,\nready to get thrown into the network and.\n\n34\n00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,710\nIf we had a basic network, home, small\noffice, whatever, you're pretty much done.\n\n35\n00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,280\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n36\n00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,990\nYeah.\n\n37\n00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,230\n>> Today, we're gonna look a little more\ndeeper into how the switch operates, and\n\n38\n00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,530\nwe're gonna take a look at some advanced\nfeatures that are built into the switch,\n\n39\n00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,720\nso, you don't have to use.\n\n40\n00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,420\nBut in a corporate or\n\n41\n00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,640\nbusiness environment,\nthere's a lot of neat uses for.\n\n42\n00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,980\nOne of the important things for\nus is to remember that with switches,\n\n43\n00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,530\nwe've got to make sure that first of all,\nthat they're configured the proper way.\n\n44\n00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,360\nWe know that you can take a switch right\nout of the box and plug it right in, and\n\n45\n00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,000\nas soon as the lights settle down, plug\nin cables, we're just about ready to go.\n\n46\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,680\nBut that doesn't even mean that\nit's properly configured yet.\n\n47\n00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,900\nThe last time that we\ndid that that's fine.\n\n48\n00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,350\nBut, today we also wanna make sure we\nunderstand the basic functionality\n\n49\n00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,030\nof a switch.\n\n50\n00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,080\nIn other words, we're gonna talk about how\na switch does the things that it does.\n\n51\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,780\nWe're gonna take a look at some of the\ninternal details about switching itself.\n\n52\n00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,870\nBut we're not just addressing\nthe idea Cisco switching.\n\n53\n00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,510\nWe're addressing the concept\nof switching today.\n\n54\n00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,540\n>> Absolutely.\n\n55\n00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,820\nAs we do it, let's just start off\nwith some really basic things.\n\n56\n00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,240\nI know, in an earlier episode,\n\n57\n00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,450\nwe touched on the difference\nbetween a hub and a switch.\n\n58\n00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,070\nAnd actually, I don't think you\nwere here for that one Ronnie.\n\n59\n00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,670\nI think, Nate and I did that one.\n\n60\n00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,560\nBut, we talked a little bit about how\na hub is a layer to dumb device right.\n\n61\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,600\nData goes into one port and\nit's just blasted out all the other ports.\n\n62\n00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,870\nAnd how a switch is\nmore intelligent right.\n\n63\n00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,546\nIt's a layer two device I mean well\nno that's right I'm actually second\n\n64\n00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:36,580\nthink myself.\n\n65\n00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,615\nSo it's actually paying attention to\nthings like the Mac addresses on our\n\n66\n00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,365\nsystem and all that good stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:46,105\nAnd seeing those communications and\nkinda mapping who's on what port.\n\n68\n00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,565\n>> So remember that when we,\n\n69\n00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,925\njust as a basic rehit right,\nthe hub being the layer one device\n\n70\n00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:55,180\njust a physical connectivity device\n>> As soon as we send information into one\n\n71\n00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,720\nport, it automatically goes out\nevery other port except for\n\n72\n00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,820\nthe one it came in on.\n\n73\n00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,610\nThe reason why is not because\nit has to make a decision,\n\n74\n00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,240\nit's because it's hardwired that way okay?\n\n75\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,430\n>> It doesn't know any better right?\n\n76\n00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,820\nAlright so, what I wanna do and\nI'm frantically drawing a picture here in\n\n77\n00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,100\nthe background, which,l who knows how\nwell it'll turn out, but basically.\n\n78\n00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,870\nWhat we wanna do is kind\nof illustrate that, and\n\n79\n00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,180\nI wanna talk about something important.\n\n80\n00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,200\nIn the very first episode,\nwe mentioned a little something about\n\n81\n00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,700\nbroadcasting domains,\nand collision domains.\n\n82\n00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,210\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n83\n00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,020\nwe talked about them a little bit more\non switches yesterday, not yesterday,\n\n84\n00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,950\non Friday, but\nI wanna hit it one more time, and\n\n85\n00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,220\nmake sure that everybody's got\na really good understanding.\n\n86\n00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,460\nCuz Cisco loves to ask questions\non the CCENT exam about\n\n87\n00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,190\nhow many collision domains, or\nhow many broadcast domains you have?\n\n88\n00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,210\nAnd what that really means okay.\n\n89\n00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,540\nSo I wanna show like what things are like\non a normal network, and how it works.\n\n90\n00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,960\nAnd then we're gonna kick it up a notch,\nand\n\n91\n00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,550\nwe're gonna jump into virtual networks.\n\n92\n00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,700\nWe can get a chance to see\nhow things work there.\n\n93\n00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,270\nVery, very important because it\nabsolutely shows up on the exam.\n\n94\n00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,330\n>> So since we actually know a little bit\nabout the basic idea of how a hub works,\n\n95\n00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,490\nwe're now gonna hit the details about\nswitching concepts unto itself.\n\n96\n00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,980\nAnd we're gonna talk about how\na switch actually works as well.\n\n97\n00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,830\nSo what do you want to start off with.\n\n98\n00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,420\nDo you want to review the hub and\nthen are we going to-\n\n99\n00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,160\n>> Yeah, let's just,\n\n100\n00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,790\nI've almost got my silly\nlittle picture done here.\n\n101\n00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,030\n>> That's fine.\n\n102\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,310\n>> Let me do this.\n\n103\n00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,840\nWe mentioned that a hub.\n\n104\n00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,710\nBasically when a hub communicated,\ninformation goes in one port and\n\n105\n00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,670\nthen it just gets blasted\nright out the other port.\n\n106\n00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,510\nSo that's very simple,\nnot a lot of logic required.\n\n107\n00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,610\nIt's just electrical signals\nbeing recreated and sent along.\n\n108\n00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,090\nNothing fancy about that at all.\n\n109\n00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,790\nWell, on a switch, it does more and\n\n110\n00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,750\nit does more by using what\nare called the Mac address table.\n\n111\n00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,180\nAnd the Mac address table is a,\nwell, it's a table.\n\n112\n00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,270\nIt's a chart or whatever, a database,\n\n113\n00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,590\nthat it keeps that says, this\nparticular Mac address is on one port.\n\n114\n00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,070\nThis other Mac address is on another port.\n\n115\n00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,710\nNow, we talked about that last time but\n\n116\n00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,170\nI don't think we actually\nshowed it in action.\n\n117\n00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,520\nSo I want to show you guys\nin action how this works and\n\n118\n00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,060\nhow the switches are learning\nthat automatically.\n\n119\n00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,920\nSo in the background here, behind me, and\n\n120\n00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,390\nit's just out of view here,\nbut I've got a Cisco 3560.\n\n121\n00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,910\nIt's a switch used on the exam and\n\n122\n00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,280\nI want to show you how it's\nlearning these Mac addresses.\n\n123\n00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,570\nAnd how it's making those smart decisions.\n\n124\n00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,285\nSo let me just bring up the console.\n\n125\n00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,085\nOf that device.\n\n126\n00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,115\nSo, what I've got on my screen here.\n\n127\n00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:39,195\nThis is me logged into the console and the\nswitch is constantly paying attention to\n\n128\n00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:43,817\nwhat Mac addresses are present\non what ports, and so on.\n\n129\n00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:49,437\nI'm going to show you how it can learn\nmy particular device is plugged in,\n\n130\n00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,087\nor whatever.\n\n131\n00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,407\nI just unplugged my laptop right there.\n\n132\n00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:57,560\nSo, what we're looking at right now is\njust the switch, and I can run show\n\n133\n00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,520\nMAC address dash table.\n\n134\n00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,770\nI use a little tab autocomplete\nthere because I got tired of typing.\n\n135\n00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,900\nBut show MAC address dash table.\n\n136\n00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,910\nThat command works on\nalmost every cisco switch.\n\n137\n00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,075\nThere's actually some Older Cisco\nswitches where the command is show\n\n138\n00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,740\nmac-address-table.\n\n139\n00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,670\nA slight variation.\n\n140\n00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,100\nYou've seen that before.\n\n141\n00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500\nBut on all the ones made in\nthe last couple of years,\n\n142\n00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,570\nit's show Mac address-table.\n\n143\n00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,350\nWhen you run that, it will show what\nmac addresses the switch knows.\n\n144\n00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,270\nAnd what ports it's learned them on.\n\n145\n00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,930\nAll right.\n\n146\n00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,100\nNow, when I run that the first\nthing you're going to see here is\n\n147\n00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,250\njust a big list.\n\n148\n00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,410\nA lot of Mac addresses.\n\n149\n00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,650\nAnd you might say to yourself, man,\n\n150\n00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,940\nthis switch knows a lot of Mac\naddresses and they're all in order wow.\n\n151\n00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,600\nThe guy at IT Pro TV must have\nbought a batch of laptops.\n\n152\n00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,214\nThat's not the case.\n\n153\n00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:55,229\nOn a Cisco switch, you have one Mac\naddress that is the master address,\n\n154\n00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,830\nthe address of the device as a whole.\n\n155\n00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,310\nThen you have MAC addresses for\nevery single port.\n\n156\n00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,800\nEvery single port on\nthe switch has a MAC address.\n\n157\n00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,670\nNow, you may not be using it.\n\n158\n00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,640\nIn fact, if you're not doing what's\ncalled Layer Three Switching,\n\n159\n00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,880\nyou're not using these\nMAC addresses at all.\n\n160\n00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,640\nBut the switch still needs\nto know about them, and so\n\n161\n00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,260\nI'm going to have 48 MAC addresses\nin the list here, as I go down.\n\n162\n00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,770\nAnd these are all the ports on the switch,\nthen I get to the real ones,\n\n163\n00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,900\nthe ones that it's truly learning.\n\n164\n00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,390\nAnd so I can see some MAC addresses that\nare in there, and it's been learning some.\n\n165\n00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,270\nAnd now we're starting to see the ones\nthat are, the computers here at ITProTV.\n\n166\n00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,510\nSo I can see MAC addresses,\nyou know, quite a few of them.\n\n167\n00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,460\nWe've got, I don't know,\nclose to 200 computers in the building.\n\n168\n00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,860\nSo they'll turn up in here, and we'll see,\nwell, close to 200 MAC addresses,\n\n169\n00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,770\nI would imagine, 163, so close.\n\n170\n00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,960\nSo anyhow,\nwe're seeing a lot of MAC addresses.\n\n171\n00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,020\nNow, the one I'm concerned\nabout is my laptop.\n\n172\n00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,771\nAnd so, I'm going to just clear\nout the MAC address table.\n\n173\n00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,811\nWhoops.\n\n174\n00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,833\nDadgummit.\n\n175\n00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,502\nWhat is it?\n\n176\n00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:10,187\nThere we go.\n\n177\n00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,240\nAll right.\n\n178\n00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,300\nSo I'm just gonna clear out\nthat MAC address table.\n\n179\n00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,340\nNow, in real life land, you'd never\nreally need to do this, the command.\n\n180\n00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,540\nIt won't show up on the exam,\nbut for your own reference,\n\n181\n00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,810\nit's clear MAC address-table dynamic.\n\n182\n00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,630\nThat wipes out all the dynamically\nlearned addresses.\n\n183\n00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,590\nNow, dynamic versus static.\n\n184\n00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,830\n>> When we talk about the idea here\nof dynamic versus static, here.\n\n185\n00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,299\nDynamic addresses are the MAC\naddresses that the switch learns.\n\n186\n00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,230\nIf I have a static MAC address table here,\nor something,\n\n187\n00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,780\nthat's static MAC address entry.\n\n188\n00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,630\nIt means, that I have actually\nprogrammed it in there, and told it,\n\n189\n00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,010\nhey, this is the MAC address you\nare actually gonna use for us.\n\n190\n00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,020\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat we remember that.\n\n191\n00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,820\n>> Yep.\n\n192\n00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,890\nSo, the static ones,\nyou'll usually see, well,\n\n193\n00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,830\nlike the ones that are burned into the\nswitch, the 48 ports, those are static.\n\n194\n00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,720\nWe could manually put some\nstatic ones in there.\n\n195\n00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,600\nThere's not a whole lot of reason for\ndoing that.\n\n196\n00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,750\nActually, we'll talk a little bit,\n\n197\n00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,510\nwhen we get into security but\nmost of them are gonna be dynamic.\n\n198\n00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,160\nI just wiped out all the dynamic\nones on this switch.\n\n199\n00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,280\nNow, it's having to relearn.\n\n200\n00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,390\nNow, that does create a little\nbit of a performance burden,\n\n201\n00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,429\nin a production environment.\n\n202\n00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's not something you\n\n203\n00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,672\nreally want to do.\n\n204\n00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,550\nHere, like in a lab environment,\nit doesn't really make much difference.\n\n205\n00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,198\nBut the reason I wanted to clear it out is\nI want to show you guys how my laptop is\n\n206\n00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:26,997\nbeing learned.\n\n207\n00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:30,005\nNow, I actually unplugged\nthe cable from my laptop, so\n\n208\n00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,821\nit is not plugged in right now,\nand what I need to do,\n\n209\n00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,796\nis I need to figure out what my MAC\naddress is, cuz I don't actually know.\n\n210\n00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:39,361\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whoops.\n\n211\n00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,734\nOkay, so my physical network adapter right\nhere, ends in, I usually just use the end\n\n212\n00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:51,923\npart of a MAC address, you know,\nyou don't need the whole thing to find it.\n\n213\n00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:54,187\nSo mine ends in 1770.\n\n214\n00:10:54,187 --> 00:11:01,720\nSo my MAC address is 0014D1B01770.\n\n215\n00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,350\nSo I am on the wireless network here.\n\n216\n00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,766\nSo if I jump over to that switch,\nI probably will show up in the list.\n\n217\n00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,048\nAnd does it have a filter?\n\n218\n00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,847\nYes.\n\n219\n00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:20,528\nAnd so, I'm gonna try and\nfind my specific MAC address.\n\n220\n00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,176\nAnd I can just pull that right\nout of the background here,\n\n221\n00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,120\ncuz I've already forgotten what it was.\n\n222\n00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,918\n>> 1770.\n\n223\n00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,642\n>> Well, when you do it this way,\nyou have to type the whole thing, so\n\n224\n00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:32,247\nI've gotta type the whole thing.\n\n225\n00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:32,806\n>> There you go.\n\n226\n00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:37,670\n>> 0014.D1B0.1770.\n\n227\n00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,040\nAll right, now that kinda ran under my\nhead, so let me move back over here.\n\n228\n00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,650\nWhen Cisco writes a MAC address,\nthey write it this way.\n\n229\n00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,500\nFour digits and a period,\nfour more digits and a period, and\n\n230\n00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,030\nthen the remaining four digits.\n\n231\n00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,620\nSo in Windows, I saw it as two digits and\na hyphen, two and a hyphen.\n\n232\n00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,020\nDifferent vendors write it different ways,\nbut Cisco writes it this way.\n\n233\n00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,708\nAnd so what I'm doing, is I'm saying,\nshow me the MAC address table for\n\n234\n00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,110\nthis particular address.\n\n235\n00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,280\nI'm looking for\nthis MAC address, specifically.\n\n236\n00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,050\nRight now,\nthe switch doesn't know about it.\n\n237\n00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,300\nIt does not know about my MAC address.\n\n238\n00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,870\nDidn't find it, all right?\n\n239\n00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,465\n>> The reason why we don't know\nabout the MAC address right now,\n\n240\n00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:18,880\nis because of the way that Cisco\nswitches learn about the MAC addresses.\n\n241\n00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,460\nNow, this is very important for you,\nespecially in the beginning here,\n\n242\n00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,990\nCisco switches learn about the MAC\naddress of the source device.\n\n243\n00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,220\nSo, if you're sending data, you're\ngonna have a source MAC address, and\n\n244\n00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,900\ndestination MAC address.\n\n245\n00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,641\nWhen you actually send data,\nthat is the one that it learns and\n\n246\n00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:38,766\nassociates with that port, so\nthe source MAC address is the key here.\n\n247\n00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:44,089\n>> So I'm gonna plug my cable in, and once\nI plug in, within the first 30 seconds,\n\n248\n00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,730\nthe switch will learn about\nmy MAC address, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,427\nSo, I'm gonna do that.\n\n250\n00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:51,617\nI'm plugged into port number,\nwhat is this, port number 2, so\n\n251\n00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,647\nI'm just gonna plug into port number 2,\n\n252\n00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,520\nwe should get a message here in\na second about port number 2 coming up.\n\n253\n00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,450\nNow, this switch is running something\ncalled Spanning Tree Protocol.\n\n254\n00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,520\nAnd we haven't covered\nthat in our show yet.\n\n255\n00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,780\nIt's a loop protection mechanism.\n\n256\n00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,590\nWhile the port is gonna come up, it may\nactually stay down for a little bit.\n\n257\n00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,780\nLooking at the front of me,\nhere I see an orange light.\n\n258\n00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,240\nSo, I have to wait 30 seconds for\nthe loop detection to finish.\n\n259\n00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,276\nSo I am just going to give it a moment,\nwhile it does that.\n\n260\n00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:21,270\nSo while it says the port is up, I'm\nnot actually allowed to talk right now.\n\n261\n00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,520\nNot until this port goes green back here.\n\n262\n00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,090\nAnd it does take 30 seconds.\n\n263\n00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,150\nBasically, for 15 seconds, it listens to\nsee if there's a switch on the other side,\n\n264\n00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,250\nif there's a switch that\nmight be creating a loop.\n\n265\n00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,416\nIf there isn't, then for the next 15\nseconds, it tries to learn my MAC address,\n\n266\n00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,330\nand still verify there's no switch.\n\n267\n00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,788\nAfter 30 seconds of loop-free\nconnectivity, the port actually comes up.\n\n268\n00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:50,950\nIf I did create a loop, it would shut my\nport down, and I'd never be able to talk.\n\n269\n00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,250\nSo loop detection is a good thing.\n\n270\n00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,050\nAm I still, nope, I'm green.\n\n271\n00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,760\nSo now I'm actually up.\n\n272\n00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,970\nSo I'm just gonna run that same command,\nshow MAC address-table address,\n\n273\n00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,030\nand punch in my MAC address.\n\n274\n00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,230\nAnd when I run it, now I can see.\n\n275\n00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,690\nThe switch has learned that I'm there,\nthere's my MAC address, and\n\n276\n00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,760\nthen I'm on port 2.\n\n277\n00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,260\n>> Yep.\n\n278\n00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,820\n>> Now,\nI filtered the output on this command.\n\n279\n00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,280\n>> Right.\n>> And I did that,\n\n280\n00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,455\nbecause if I just tried\nto find it on my own.\n\n281\n00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:21,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I just looked at the full address\n\n282\n00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,250\ntable, right, I would have to go\nthrough this screen by screen, and say,\n\n283\n00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,630\nall right, where is 1770?\n\n284\n00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,820\nTrying to find 1770.\n\n285\n00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,013\nTrying to find it.\nAnd you could be here a while, right?\n\n286\n00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,370\nIt's not sorted by port number.\n\n287\n00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,510\nIt's actually sorted by MAC address,\nso, you know, you'll see some of it.\n\n288\n00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,460\n>> Yeah, good luck.\n>> But then,\n\n289\n00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,550\nif you have multiple VLANs like we do,\nthen it's all over the place.\n\n290\n00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,880\nSo trying to find my address\nin here could be pretty tough.\n\n291\n00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,415\nThis particular command, show MAC\naddress-table, has that nice little\n\n292\n00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,180\nadd-on, where you can say, address,\nand specify a particular address.\n\n293\n00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,910\nNot every command does, right?\n\n294\n00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,440\nShould I show them\nthe command line filters?\n\n295\n00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,370\nWe haven't really done that.\n\n296\n00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,975\n>> Not yet, yeah,\nwe haven't done that, but yeah, sure.\n\n297\n00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:07,439\n>> Let's do it, cuz it is really useful\non switches, so this switch right here,\n\n298\n00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,024\nit's only got 48 ports, right?\n\n299\n00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,574\nBut you guys see how big\nthat MAC address table is,\n\n300\n00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:15,280\nsome of the switches you work with\nout in the field like the 6,500s,\n\n301\n00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,595\nwe've got a 4,500 here, and\nit's got 144 ports on it.\n\n302\n00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:22,217\nWhen you have that many ports,\nyou can have hundreds,\n\n303\n00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:27,210\neven thousands of MAC addresses out there,\nit gets overwhelming.\n\n304\n00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,660\nSo Cisco has some filter\ncommands that you can use.\n\n305\n00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,735\nSo, for example, if I just run show MAC\naddress-table, I want to spell it right.\n\n306\n00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna get the full table.\n\n307\n00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,666\n>> Right.\nThe full MAC address table,\n\n308\n00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,594\neverything, okay?\n\n309\n00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:48,027\nBut I can add to the end of that,\nI can add the pipe symbol, for example.\n\n310\n00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:52,248\nThe pipe symbol is the two vertical\nlines that are usually right above\n\n311\n00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:55,539\nthe Enter key, so for me,\nI hit Shift and backslash.\n\n312\n00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,488\nIs that, oh, same laptop.\n\n313\n00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:01,714\n>> So yeah, that's kinda what it is for\nmost people.\n\n314\n00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:05,291\nAnd then you can pipe it into\nsome neat little commands.\n\n315\n00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:11,560\nWe've got include, begin, exclude.\n\n316\n00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,800\nThose are the three that I\nusually use right there.\n\n317\n00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,100\nThere's a couple others like section or\nwhatever.\n\n318\n00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,620\nSo the three main ones, though, begin.\n\n319\n00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,840\nI can say, show me the MAC address table,\n\n320\n00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,130\nand begin,\nwhen you find a particular string.\n\n321\n00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,040\nSo don't show me everything until you\nsee this particular string, right.\n\n322\n00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or you can say, include,\n\n323\n00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,680\nonly show me the lines that do include,\nthat actually contain a particular string.\n\n324\n00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,680\n>> And then there's the exclude, right?\n\n325\n00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,670\nThe exclude says show everything but that.\n\n326\n00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,820\nSo all of them actually\nseem to have exactly,\n\n327\n00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,170\nwell I don't want to say exactly, they at\nleast filter out a lot of information and\n\n328\n00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,210\nlead you to that point that we need.\n\n329\n00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,490\nBut remember that sometimes, though,\nif you just show the regular\n\n330\n00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,570\nfull on commands, especially like\nthe show running config, right?\n\n331\n00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,710\nIf we do that, some production switches,\nthe running config is gigantic.\n\n332\n00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I mean, it could take you minutes,\n\n333\n00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,160\nif not,\neven longer just to filter it through.\n\n334\n00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,190\nAnd remember that if your entire\nproduction network is still running on\n\n335\n00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,830\nthat, that causes more stress on the CPU,\n\n336\n00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,090\ncauses more things that you\nhave to worry about here.\n\n337\n00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,340\nSo using these filters as\na very highly effective way\n\n338\n00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,170\nto make sure that you see\nthe information that you need to.\n\n339\n00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,120\n>> So let's say I just wanted\nto see the static ones.\n\n340\n00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,920\nRight.\n\n341\n00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,090\nI could pipe that into the include\ncommand, and I could look for\n\n342\n00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,110\nthe word static.\n\n343\n00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,360\nNow it is case sensitive.\n\n344\n00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,970\nSo that's why I had to do\nstatic all capitalized.\n\n345\n00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,610\nRight?\n\n346\n00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,210\nAnd now it's just going\nto show me the statics.\n\n347\n00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,764\nSee how it all fit on one screen,\njust the statics, all\n\n348\n00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:45,360\nright I could have also said, I could've\npiped it into the exclude command.\n\n349\n00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,940\nAnd excluded the word, dynamic.\n\n350\n00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,920\nSo show me everything\nexcept the dynamics now,\n\n351\n00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,570\nthat's kind of a nicer\nvariation cuz look what I get.\n\n352\n00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,060\nI get my table header.\n\n353\n00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,560\nRight?\n>> Nice.\n\n354\n00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,900\n>> I lost all my table header before\n\n355\n00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,411\nbecause it didn't include the word static.\n>> Right.\n\n356\n00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,836\n>> Now I get the header and\n\n357\n00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,270\nit just excluded the.\n\n358\n00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,380\n>> Dynamics.\n>> Dynamics.\n\n359\n00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n360\n00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,950\n>> So really cool command, really saves\nsome time on the exam and in real life.\n\n361\n00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,540\n>> Life that you can filter out any output\nif you know exactly what you're looking\n\n362\n00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,980\nfor, so for example if I was looking\nspecifically for my MAC address,\n\n363\n00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,520\nI could have said show MAC\naddress-table | include 1770, right?\n\n364\n00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,540\nJust showing MAC addresses that\ncontain 1770, and I can run that.\n\n365\n00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,290\nAnd there it is, no fuss,\nno muss, gets right in there.\n\n366\n00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,760\nThere's my Mac address, there's the port\nthat it's on, and I'm in business.\n\n367\n00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,530\n>> Don't forget that these PICter\nfilters tend to work with just about\n\n368\n00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,650\nall these types of show\ncommands that we have.\n\n369\n00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,120\nSo try them out.\n\n370\n00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,580\nDo get familiar with at least\nthese basic three here,\n\n371\n00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,190\nbecause they're really gonna show you\nexactly what you need without having to,\n\n372\n00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,140\nagain, yourself, trying to sort it out by.\n\n373\n00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,640\nYeah.\n\n374\n00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,890\n>> All right, so now I see how it's\nlearning these MAC addresses, okay?\n\n375\n00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,170\nBut when I look at the MAC address table,\nthere was one interesting thing in there.\n\n376\n00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,040\nAll right.\n\n377\n00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,770\nMost of time time you're going to\nsee one MAC address per port, right?\n\n378\n00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,480\nSo there's my laptop\nplugged into a single port.\n\n379\n00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,920\nI'm one machine, I've got one MAC address.\n\n380\n00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,710\nRight?\n\n381\n00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,610\nBut look at all of these.\n\n382\n00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,390\nOn port 48.\n\n383\n00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n384\n00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,210\n>> Port 48 has a ton of MAC addresses.\n\n385\n00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,300\nWhy is that, Ronnie?\n\n386\n00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,500\n>> Well, right now what we're doing on\nport 48 is that we are doing what we call\n\n387\n00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,270\ntrunking on port 48 here.\n\n388\n00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,330\nSo when we talk about the idea of trunking\nhere, that means I will allow for\n\n389\n00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,510\nall of the different VLAN's to go across\nso it actually sees all the devices here.\n\n390\n00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,450\nAnd we haven't jumped into VLAN's yet.\n\n391\n00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,360\n>> Sorry.\n\n392\n00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,780\n>> So let's look at it a little more\nsimply and talk about up-links.\n\n393\n00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,400\n>> Okay.\n\n394\n00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,500\n>> So port 48 for\nus is basically an up-link if you have.\n\n395\n00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,420\nThis is a 48 port switch,\nwhat if I have 50 computers, right?\n\n396\n00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,670\nI can get a second switch, and I can just\nrun a cross-over cable between them.\n\n397\n00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,280\nRight, remember when you\ngo switch to switch,\n\n398\n00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,230\nyou've gotta have a cross-over cable.\n\n399\n00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,740\nSo I could run a cross-over\ncable between the two.\n\n400\n00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,040\nWell, on my switch, if that's port 48\nthat's then running to this other switch.\n\n401\n00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,650\nAnd I have 20 other computers\non that other switch.\n\n402\n00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,860\nAll 20 MAC addresses will\nshow up on the same port.\n\n403\n00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,050\nSo when you see more than MAC\naddress on a single port.\n\n404\n00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,420\nThat usually means there's a switch or\na hub on the other side.\n\n405\n00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,350\nNow, I don't know if it's a switch or\na hub.\n\n406\n00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> But there's gonna be some kind of\n\n407\n00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,260\ndevice on the other end.\n\n408\n00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,840\nIt could be a wireless access point.\n\n409\n00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n410\n00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,420\nAnd then we'll see more than one\nMAC address on a single port.\n\n411\n00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,330\n>> So this goes back to something\nthat I'd just forgotten,\n\n412\n00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,630\nI had just told you about, right?\n\n413\n00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,370\nThe very fact is the way that\nthe switch learns MAC addresses right,\n\n414\n00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,080\nit learns it from the actual source.\n\n415\n00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,250\nThe one that's sending its\nparticular MAC address across.\n\n416\n00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,500\nAnd that's what gets entered\nin the MAC address table.\n\n417\n00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,410\nSo on the other end of this switch\nit's plugged into something,\n\n418\n00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,080\nthat all those computers are essentially\nsending their MAC addresses and\n\n419\n00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,809\nsaying hey,\nstore it on this particular port here.\n\n420\n00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,610\nOnce the switch knows,\nwhat MAC addresses are on which port,\n\n421\n00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,110\nanytime it sees traffic destined for\none of these MAC addresses,\n\n422\n00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,560\ninstead of just flooding it out like a hub\nit can say, hey, this traffic is going\n\n423\n00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,620\nto 0014.D1B0.1770.\n\n424\n00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,640\nI know that that's on my port FA0/2, so\n\n425\n00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,130\nlet's send that traffic to the FA0/2\nport and not every other one.\n\n426\n00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,050\nIt'll forward it right to it and\nthen we're in business.\n\n427\n00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,800\nIf it hasn't learned that address yet,\nthen it will act like a hub.\n\n428\n00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,720\nIt will flood it out all the ports,\nand it's trying to find that person.\n\n429\n00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,980\nAnd it usually will,\nif they're plugged in.\n\n430\n00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,940\n>> Right, sounds good.\n\n431\n00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,030\n>> All right, now all of this is\n\n432\n00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,550\nkinda stuff that we talked about\nin an earlier episode, right?\n\n433\n00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,130\nBut I wanted to touch back on\nit cuz it is so important, and\n\n434\n00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,839\nI wanted to show people on an actual\nswitch, not just a drawing.\n\n435\n00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,380\nThe other thing that I kind of wanted\nto lead into here was CMS ACD.\n\n436\n00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,320\n>> Okay.\n>> All right.\n\n437\n00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,280\nWe talked a little bit about that before,\nand let me get back to my whiteboard so\n\n438\n00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,985\nI can write that.\n\n439\n00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:06,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a easy one to forget.\n\n440\n00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,440\n>> So, one of the things that we have to\nknow just about basic networking here.\n\n441\n00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,090\nRight?\n\n442\n00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,200\nIs the very beginning of networking for\nus.\n\n443\n00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,170\nWe either have the idea here,\nof what we call, a contentious networks.\n\n444\n00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,120\nIn which all the devices are either\ncompeting for access on the wire.\n\n445\n00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,250\nOr we have the idea of deterministic,\n\n446\n00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,640\nin which a single device, says who gets\naccess to use that wire at any one point.\n\n447\n00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,570\nIn switching technology, and in the basic\nnetworking that we would've done at\n\n448\n00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,660\nthe very beginning here, we would have\nactually used the idea of the competitive\n\n449\n00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,875\nmodel, especially in terms of Ethernet and\nswitches and hubs.\n\n450\n00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,029\n[COUGH] Excuse me as well, okay?\n\n451\n00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,660\nAnd so that for us means that we had\nto have some type of technology right?\n\n452\n00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:54,226\nAnd that would be what\nwe called CSMA .Carrier.\n\n453\n00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:55,440\n>> Carrier sense multiple access.\n\n454\n00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,630\n>> Multiple access with\ncollision detection.\n\n455\n00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,830\nI couldn't remember what the M.\n\n456\n00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,640\n>> That's it, so that's what I\njust put on my whiteboard here,\n\n457\n00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,000\nso CSMACD, carrier sense multiple\naccess/collision detection.\n\n458\n00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,680\nSo what is that?\n\n459\n00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,630\nLet's take it in pieces, right?\n\n460\n00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:14,210\nSo first off, if we have a bunch of\ncomputers that are plugged into a switch,\n\n461\n00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,750\nright, so if I take these computer, and\nI'll just kinda virtually plug them in.\n\n462\n00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,954\nAnd basically, when I have\nthese computers plugged in, and\n\n463\n00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,607\nthey wanna talk, well, with a hub.\n\n464\n00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,798\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Two people can't talk at the same time.\n\n465\n00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:32,764\n>> Right.\n>> If two people talk, they collide, and\n\n466\n00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,370\nwe have a problem, right?\n\n467\n00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,590\nWith a switch, that MAC address table,\n\n468\n00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,760\nthat technology really helps\nus to avoid that situation.\n\n469\n00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000\nSo, when a PC goes to talk.\n\n470\n00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520\nSo let's take.\n\n471\n00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,485\nEach of these, I should give them names so\nI can tell them apart.\n\n472\n00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:49,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So like if this is PC1,\n\n473\n00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,790\nand then the other guys are out there.\n\n474\n00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,761\nSo we'll say.\n\n475\n00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:59,289\nWe'll make this guy down here PC4.\n\n476\n00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:00,472\nWhoops.\n\n477\n00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,007\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not gonna go crazy with here.\n\n478\n00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,545\nAll right.\n\n479\n00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,898\nSo if PC1 goes to talk to PC4,\n\n480\n00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:11,000\nwhen it goes to talk that communication\nis going to pass into the switch.\n\n481\n00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,850\nThe switch is gonna look at it and say,\nthat's destined for a MAC address that I\n\n482\n00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,330\nknow, it's gonna send it along to the port\nwhere it knows that MAC address is.\n\n483\n00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,650\nAnd it's gonna go on down to that client.\n\n484\n00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,140\nThe cool part about this,\nis that it frees up the other PCs.\n\n485\n00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:32,850\nSo, if I have PC2 and PC3,\nthat these guys are available and\n\n486\n00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,661\nready to communicate without\n\n487\n00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:42,180\nhaving to interfere or\nwait with PC1 and PC4.\n\n488\n00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,880\nSo on a switch based network, I can\nhave more than one pair of PCs talking.\n\n489\n00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,100\nBut, if two of them were to\ntalk at the same time and\n\n490\n00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,920\ntheir traffic were to cross paths,\nwe end up with a collision.\n\n491\n00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,380\nSo, on hubs it was real important that\nthe PCs were able to detect that.\n\n492\n00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,650\nAnd I say PCs, any ethernet device.\n\n493\n00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,310\nThis was a part of the ethernet standard.\n\n494\n00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,270\nSo CSMA, let's start with that.\n\n495\n00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,240\nCarrier Sense Multiple Access.\n\n496\n00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,900\nIf PC1 is about to talk,\nthe first thing it does is, listen.\n\n497\n00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,780\nIt says let me listen to the line,\nand see if somebody else is talking.\n\n498\n00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,160\nIf PC1 is talking,\nPC2 would listen and hear, and say,\n\n499\n00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,220\nall right, I'm not gonna talk, I'm just\ngonna stay quiet until PC1 is done.\n\n500\n00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,280\n>> So, when we take a look at this then,\nthe idea of multiple access is that\n\n501\n00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,390\nwe have multiple devices sharing,\nessentially, that same medium.\n\n502\n00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,440\nOr that same domain, I guess is probably\nthe proper way to think about this.\n\n503\n00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,020\nSo, every device that's on this type of\ntechnology that we're using, CSMACD, here.\n\n504\n00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,270\nIs, again,\nall of them are actually listening, okay?\n\n505\n00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,020\nSo, every single one is\nlistening to see who's talking.\n\n506\n00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,720\nIf somebody else is talking, they say I'm\ngonna be quiet at this particular point.\n\n507\n00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,410\n>> Then when they do talk, there's\nstill the risk that maybe two people\n\n508\n00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,840\nwere listening at the same time,\nmaybe PC2 and three were both listening,\n\n509\n00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,690\nthey heard that it was silent and\nthey both try to talk at the same time.\n\n510\n00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,760\nSo then, once they talk,\nthey do collision detection.\n\n511\n00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,060\nThat just means they continue to listen,\n\n512\n00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,890\nbecause if there is a collision\nthe electrical signals will collide.\n\n513\n00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,610\n>> Yeah, they'll centrally form\na voltage spike is what will happen.\n\n514\n00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,780\nOnce that voltage spike ends up happening,\n\n515\n00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,770\nthose two devices sense that\nvoltage spike had to be mine.\n\n516\n00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,270\nSo that means, I had a collision, so\nlet me try and do something else.\n\n517\n00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,399\n>> And so\nthey'll wait a random amount of time.\n\n518\n00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,360\nNow it's got to be random,\n\n519\n00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,580\ncuz otherwise they would both just\nwait the same amount of time.\n\n520\n00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,980\nSo, they wait a random amount of time and\nthen they retransmit, all right?\n\n521\n00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,960\nIt's very inefficient switches\nhelp us to avoid that.\n\n522\n00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,500\n>> All right, and this is why we're\ncircling back to this is you're not gonna\n\n523\n00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,420\nuse hubs in real life anymore.\n\n524\n00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,490\nSwitches help us to avoid this,\n\n525\n00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:00,210\nbecause on a switch PC1 isn't\nactually talking to PC4 at all.\n\n526\n00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,490\nPC1 never truly touches PC4.\n\n527\n00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,510\nPC1 instead, is talking to\na memory buffer on the switch.\n\n528\n00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,780\nOn the switch, every single port\nhas a little memory buffer on it,\n\n529\n00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,030\nand so when PC1 goes to talk.\n\n530\n00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,530\nWhen it goes to send\nthat communication along.\n\n531\n00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,180\nIt's actually writing to a memory\nbuffer on that first port.\n\n532\n00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,580\nNow, is anybody else\nable to talk on port one?\n\n533\n00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,425\nNo, and that means that PC1\ncannot possibly collide.\n\n534\n00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,960\nPC1 cannot get a collision.\n\n535\n00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,750\nThe only person it can\ncollide with itself.\n\n536\n00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,280\nAnd so we do still have CSMACD, but\n\n537\n00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,980\nit doesn't really serve much purpose,\nunless something's wrong with the switch,\n\n538\n00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,530\nand the switch has to\nflip over into hub mode.\n\n539\n00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,260\n>> Yeah and\n\n540\n00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,680\nso, when we start taking a look at this\nhere, this is why we wanna use switches.\n\n541\n00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,480\nIf you get a choice between a switch and\na hub, a switch is a clear choice.\n\n542\n00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,939\nBecause it really does help us to not have\nto worry, about the idea of CSMA/CD here.\n\n543\n00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,550\nWith only one device needed to\ncommunicate on that one port.\n\n544\n00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,408\nEssentially that's what\nended up happening here.\n\n545\n00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:11,990\nIs that we've limited any collisions,\nthat may happen to that one port.\n\n546\n00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,880\nWe only have one device attached to it.\n\n547\n00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,620\nSo, it's gonna climb with itself.\n\n548\n00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,800\nDon't get me wrong, there's probably\n[LAUGH] ways we can make it happen.\n\n549\n00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,160\nIf you did something like plug a hub into\nthe switch and then plug two devices in\n\n550\n00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,600\nthat one hub, but we're probably not gonna\ndo and hopefully we'll never see that.\n\n551\n00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,598\n>> Yeah, now here's the other cool part,\nlet's say that PC1, 2,\n\n552\n00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:37,660\nand 3 all want to talk\nto PC4 at the same time.\n\n553\n00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,890\nWell, PC1, PC2, and\nPC3 can send their communication.\n\n554\n00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,620\nThey're gonna go to the memory\nbuffers on the switch, and\n\n555\n00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,190\nwhat the switch is gonna do is it's gonna\nmove them across what's called the back\n\n556\n00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,700\nplane, the circuitry on\nthe back of the switch.\n\n557\n00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,290\nNow, because of the switch handling that,\n\n558\n00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,240\nit's basically viewed as traffic\nfrom the same person at that point.\n\n559\n00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,970\nYou can't have collisions\non the back plain either.\n\n560\n00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,600\nSo, this data is all able\nto move simultaneously.\n\n561\n00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,980\nAnd then this switch does\nwhat is called queueing.\n\n562\n00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,630\nPuts all this data in line, and then\nstarts to send it on the rest of the way.\n\n563\n00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,370\nSo, maybe PC3 was first, so\nit gets to come through.\n\n564\n00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,920\nAnd then after that maybe PC2 was next,\nand it gets to come through.\n\n565\n00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,730\nAnd then finally PC1 gets its chance.\n\n566\n00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,420\nAnd all that data makes it over to PC4,\nwithout a collision.\n\n567\n00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,890\nSo, back in the day when you bought a hub\nthere was usually a little light on it\n\n568\n00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,660\nthat said collision, and\nyou could see it flashing.\n\n569\n00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,290\nIn the days of switches today,\nthere are no collision lights.\n\n570\n00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,230\nThere's no collision light\non the switch behind me, and\n\n571\n00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,940\nthat's because they just don't\nhave collisions like before.\n\n572\n00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,150\nNow, they do still have collisions,\nit can happen.\n\n573\n00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,150\nBut it's not very common, and that's\nbecause your PC is talking to the port.\n\n574\n00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,090\nSo, each port is said to\nbe a collision domain.\n\n575\n00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,710\nA collision domain is simply a group\nof computers that are able to collide\n\n576\n00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,278\nwith each other.\n\n577\n00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,466\nIn a hub based network,\nthe whole network is one collision domain.\n\n578\n00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:04,575\nIn a switch based network, every single\nport is its own collision domain.\n\n579\n00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:08,135\nSo, I drew a five port switch,\nit's got five collision domains.\n\n580\n00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:12,135\nI've got a 48 port switch behind me,\nit's got 48 collision domains.\n\n581\n00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,445\nRemember that for the exam.\n\n582\n00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:14,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n583\n00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,910\nAnd so that, don't forget,\nin going backwards with that.\n\n584\n00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,760\nWith a hub,\n\n585\n00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,330\nif you get a 12 port hub, all 12 ports\nare in one collision domain as well.\n\n586\n00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,790\nSo, just the opposite here.\n\n587\n00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,085\nSo again, good thing to remember for\nthe exam here.\n\n588\n00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,145\n>> Yep.\n\n589\n00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:30,725\nAll right,\nlooks like we're right up on break time.\n\n590\n00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:32,245\nSo, why don't we stop here?\n\n591\n00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:35,935\nWe still have a lot more to talk about,\nbut let's stop and take a break.\n\n592\n00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,905\nWhen we get back,\nwe're gonna dive a little bit more into\n\n593\n00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,230\nI wanna talk a little bit more about,\nthose memory buffers on the switch.\n\n594\n00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,340\nAnd we need to mention,\nI forgot to mention the CAM tables.\n\n595\n00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,790\nSo, we need to tackle that\nbefore moving into VLAN.\n\n596\n00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,540\nSo, let's take a break here.\n\n597\n00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,130\nAnd when we get back,\nmore exciting switch action.\n\n598\n00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,550\nWe'll see you back after these messages.\n\n599\n00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:03,719\n[MUSIC]\n\n600\n00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,600\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n601\n00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,450\nSo before the break, I did forget to\nmention one thing that was important.\n\n602\n00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,160\nWe were talking about\nthe MAC address table.\n\n603\n00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,210\nAnd as you read through various books and\nthings like that, that are out there and\n\n604\n00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,660\nyou'll hear or\nrefer to the MAC address table.\n\n605\n00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,470\nAnd you'll MAC,\nall capital Media Access Control.\n\n606\n00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,420\nMAC address table.\n\n607\n00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,880\nThen you'll hear sometimes\nbe refered to the CAM table.\n\n608\n00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,100\nAnd if you're [LAUGH] like me the first\ntime I read it a long time ago.\n\n609\n00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,440\nI remember reading and I'm like,\nwhy did they write it backwards?\n\n610\n00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,710\nWhat's wrong with these people?\n\n611\n00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,610\nBut, they're not referring to\nthe logical table like we think of.\n\n612\n00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,881\nThe CAM table, is actually referring\nto the actual hardware chip,\n\n613\n00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:51,720\nthe little memory chip that's embedded\non the motherboard of the switch.\n\n614\n00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,367\nAnd that's where the MAC\naddress table is stored.\n\n615\n00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,827\nBut that chip that CAM table.\n\n616\n00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:59,219\nWell it's called the CAM table so.\n\n617\n00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,191\nIt actually stands for\ncontent addressable memory.\n\n618\n00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:04,340\nAnd so that's exactly what it is.\n\n619\n00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,680\nThe memory module,\nthat's actually on the motherboard itself.\n\n620\n00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,936\nAnd so\na lot of times when you do read about,\n\n621\n00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:13,578\nespecially in older Cisco writings,\nyou see CAM table everywhere,\n\n622\n00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:17,570\nmost of the books today seem to\njust refer to the address table.\n\n623\n00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,970\n>> But on the exam you can see either,\n\n624\n00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,700\nthat's why it was important\nthat we bring it up here?\n\n625\n00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,070\nSo yeah, that is out there.\n\n626\n00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,360\nSo just be aware that really,\nthe MAC address table and\n\n627\n00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,090\nthe CAM table are basically\nthe same thing.\n\n628\n00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,880\nThe CAM table talking about the physical\nhardware that stores the data,\n\n629\n00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,070\nthe MAC address table being\nthe logical data that is in it.\n\n630\n00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,970\n>> Now, before the break Don, you had\nmentioned the idea of actually taking\n\n631\n00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,260\na look at each of the ports and\nwe had talked about that buffer content.\n\n632\n00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,950\nAnd so that's actually really\nimportant for us isn't it?\n\n633\n00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,740\n>> There is another thing,\nthat can show up on the exam,\n\n634\n00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,755\nalthough in real life we don't\nworry about it so much anymore.\n\n635\n00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:53,618\nBack in the day, [CROSSTALK] you\nhave to know it to build onto it.\n\n636\n00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:57,174\nSo back in the day,\nwhen you bought a Cisco switch,\n\n637\n00:32:57,174 --> 00:33:01,940\nyou could pick one of three\ndifferent operating modes for it.\n\n638\n00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,560\nToday's switches,\nwe don't really have that anymore,\n\n639\n00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,900\nbecause the technology's gotten so\nmuch more advanced.\n\n640\n00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,730\nBut, there's actually three different\nmodes that a Cisco switch can function in.\n\n641\n00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:19,040\nThe original switches way back in the day,\nthat didn't really have buffers\n\n642\n00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,080\non their ports that were just trying\nto move data as quickly as possible.\n\n643\n00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,410\nThey were what were called\ncut-through switches.\n\n644\n00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,801\nThey did cut-through switching.\n\n645\n00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:30,530\nAnd cut-through switching just meant, if\nI started to send a frame, and remember,\n\n646\n00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,960\na frame is gonna be less than 1518 bytes.\n\n647\n00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,770\nAnd usually your operating system\nwill cap it at about 1500,\n\n648\n00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,600\nso when I send data on a switch network,\nI'm usually sending about 1500 bytes.\n\n649\n00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,680\nWhen the first byte hits the switch,\nit's immediately sending it\n\n650\n00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,465\nto it's destination as soon as it can,\njust forwarding it along.\n\n651\n00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:53,640\nCut-through switches are very fast and\nthat first byte,\n\n652\n00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,860\nmaybe the first couple of bytes before\nit can see the destination MAC address.\n\n653\n00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,130\nIt's got to at least see\nthe destination MAC address, and\n\n654\n00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,070\nit is forwarding right of just\nbat as quickly as it can.\n\n655\n00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,690\nThe second type of switch that\nwe wanna talk about here,\n\n656\n00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,050\nis also gonna be the idea of what we\ncall the fragment free switching, okay?\n\n657\n00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,220\nNow when we talk about\nthe idea of fragment free,\n\n658\n00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,180\nunlike the cut through which is just\nreally wanting for that destination MAC\n\n659\n00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,590\naddress, I've gotta assume this is\ndone off the idea of statistics.\n\n660\n00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,680\nI'm gonna say that Cisco and a whole bunch\nof other companies, what they've done is,\n\n661\n00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,230\nover billions of frames that have come\nacross, is that they've noticed something.\n\n662\n00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,110\nThat they said look, when we actually\ntake a look at all this stuff,\n\n663\n00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,420\nthe first 64 bytes of the frame\nis what's actually important.\n\n664\n00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,680\nBecause that's where they found 99.97%,\nof all fragmentation that tends to happen.\n\n665\n00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,620\n>> And by fragmentation, we mean\ncorruption and slowdowns and everything.\n\n666\n00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,650\nAnd so once it actually started doing\nthat, then they started actually building\n\n667\n00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,280\nand saying,\nlook maybe this is what we need to do.\n\n668\n00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,910\nIf we can examine the first\n64 bytes of data, and\n\n669\n00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,910\nthere is no corruption, no fragmentation\nanything, let's go ahead and\n\n670\n00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,490\nforward that on to\nthe destination port itself.\n\n671\n00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,860\nAnd what that means to us,\nis those switches,\n\n672\n00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,020\nthe switches that do fragment free\nswitching, they need a buffer of at least\n\n673\n00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,650\n64 bytes to be able to store\nthat first bit of data.\n\n674\n00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,510\nTo be able to look at it,\nmake sure that it wasn't corrupted, and\n\n675\n00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,450\nthen start to send along.\n\n676\n00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,830\nCut-through didn't need that,\ncuz it was sending immediately.\n\n677\n00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,220\nSo, even if the frame was damaged,\ncut-through would still forward it.\n\n678\n00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,680\nEven though it was bad data,\n\n679\n00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,210\nfragment free would detect where\nthe bulk of that error was.\n\n680\n00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:35,120\nAnd stop it if it was damaged or\nforward along it's 64 path.\n\n681\n00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,950\n>> Now,\nwhen we start taking a look at this,\n\n682\n00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,590\non both of those there's a chance\nthat fragments can still happen.\n\n683\n00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,010\nThere's a chance that corruption\ncan still continue to happen here.\n\n684\n00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,860\nSo with the cut-through, it means that\nthe receiving devices, the one that\n\n685\n00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,570\nhas to notice it, and then transmit\na message back to the sender and say,\n\n686\n00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,320\nyou need to retransmit this particular\nframe, because something is wrong with it.\n\n687\n00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,130\nSo it has to go the whole path, and\nessentially what has to happen then is\n\n688\n00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,630\nthat, that same frame has to\nbe sent a couple of times.\n\n689\n00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,520\nWith the fragment free there's\na possibility, but it's less likely, okay?\n\n690\n00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,860\nAnd so these are actually fairly common.\n\n691\n00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,140\nNow, Don's gonna actually tell us about\nthis last one, which is more hefty here.\n\n692\n00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,786\n>> The last one, back in the day.\n\n693\n00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Was extremely cost-prohibitive.\n\n694\n00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,050\nVery, expensive.\n\n695\n00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,260\nIt was called Store and Forward.\n\n696\n00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,850\nStore and Forward switches, would receive\nthe entire frame, the whole 1500 bytes.\n\n697\n00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,920\nIt would receive that whole frame, and\n\n698\n00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,030\nstick it into a memory buffer, and look at\nit to make sure that it wasn't corrupt.\n\n699\n00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,120\nAnd if it wasn't corrupt,\nit would send it along.\n\n700\n00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,590\nIf it was corrupt it would stop it.\n\n701\n00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,290\nSo a Store and\nForward switch would actually ensure,\n\n702\n00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,810\nthat corrupted frames are never\nsent along that's great.\n\n703\n00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,130\nBut, you needed a lot of memory for\neach port on the switch.\n\n704\n00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,860\nAnd so it was extremely cost prohibitive.\n\n705\n00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:54,650\nWell, today, that kind of memory is\nextremely cheap, pennies on the dollar.\n\n706\n00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,700\nSo, it was not an expensive thing.\n\n707\n00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,790\nThe technology is far less\nexpensive than it used to be.\n\n708\n00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,670\nSo when you buy a switch today,\nyou don't really pick the modes any more.\n\n709\n00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,222\nNow, you buy the switch and it'll\nusually either be hard set as Store and\n\n710\n00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:13,399\nForward or it'll hard set as\nfragment free, but you don't pick,\n\n711\n00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:18,782\nits not something software configurable,\nits just a function of the switch itself.\n\n712\n00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:22,442\nIt's burned in, hard-coded, and\nthat's just kind of the end of it.\n\n713\n00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:25,971\nBut, on the exam,\nunderstand that switches can operate,\n\n714\n00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:29,403\nCisco switches,\ncan operate in three different modes.\n\n715\n00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:33,180\nCut-through, for\nthe data as fast as we can.\n\n716\n00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,020\nFragment free,\ncheck out the first 64 bytes,\n\n717\n00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,230\nmake sure it's okay, then send it along.\n\n718\n00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,210\nStoring forward, check out the entire\nframe, and then send it along,\n\n719\n00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,300\nthose are our three.\n\n720\n00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,900\nA lot of times when people are concerned\nabout the idea of performance,\n\n721\n00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,650\nthey may go, let's go with\na cut-through switch if we can.\n\n722\n00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,130\nAnd even though that seems\nlike a good idea, but\n\n723\n00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,140\nremember, if there's a fragment\nit has to be retransmitted.\n\n724\n00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,940\nThe idea of the, of fragment free,\n\n725\n00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,430\nthe Store and\nForward may seem relatively slow.\n\n726\n00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,670\nBut the nice thing about it is that\nit actually checks the entire thing.\n\n727\n00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,550\nSo, it's only gonna transmit it one time.\n\n728\n00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,454\nSo there's trade offs but\ncontent, or the Store and\n\n729\n00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:14,231\nForward is probably the way\nthat we'd rather go.\n\n730\n00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:15,623\n>> And we say relatively slow,\n\n731\n00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:19,516\nwe're talking about the difference of\n5 nanoseconds versus 2 nanoseconds.\n\n732\n00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:24,281\nSo it's not really a significant\nnumber to us as humans,\n\n733\n00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:27,889\nto computers it's\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n734\n00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,740\n>> All right, so those were,\n\n735\n00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,800\nI think the last of the general switching\n\n736\n00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,980\ntopics that I can think of-\n>> Sounds good.\n\n737\n00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,040\n>> I'm trying to think if there's\nanything else that I'm leaving out here?\n\n738\n00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880\nI think that really does it,\n\n739\n00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,240\nthe other that I do wanna\nmention are broadcast domains.\n\n740\n00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,430\nWe talked about how on a switch, every\nsingle port is its own collision domain.\n\n741\n00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,220\nBut broadcasts are broadcasts.\n\n742\n00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,220\nWhen you send a broadcast it is\nflooded out every other port for\n\n743\n00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,710\nthe other devices to see.\n\n744\n00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,680\nSo, even though every port of\na switch is its own collision domain,\n\n745\n00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,250\nthe whole switch is still\none broadcast domain.\n\n746\n00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,540\nSo, when you read that question on\nthe exam, make sure you do a double-check.\n\n747\n00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,240\nAre they asking about broadcast domains or\ncollision domains?\n\n748\n00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,400\nBecause on a hub or a switch,\nit's just one broadcast domain.\n\n749\n00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,330\nOn a hub, it's one collision domain, on\na switch, it's multiple collision domains,\n\n750\n00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,420\none for every single port.\n\n751\n00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,800\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n752\n00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,700\n>> Yep, sounds good.\n\n753\n00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:26,790\n>> All right,\nthe next thing we wanna tackle on,\n\n754\n00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,190\nis something that Ronnie mentioned\nbriefly earlier, and I mentioned earlier.\n\n755\n00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,210\nVLANs.\n\n756\n00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,680\nVLANs are virtual local area networks, and\n\n757\n00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,580\nthey're really cool, when I first\nstarted learning Cisco myself.\n\n758\n00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,502\nSo, I started working with\nCisco equipment in 1998.\n\n759\n00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:46,300\nAnd the devices back then, a lot of\nthe Cisco switches didn't support VLANs,\n\n760\n00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,513\nand so it was a new feature\nthat we're just getting.\n\n761\n00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,183\nWasn't even on the CCNA exam back then.\n\n762\n00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,203\nToday.\n\n763\n00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:54,759\nEvery Cisco switch supports them.\n\n764\n00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,128\nIt's all over the place,\nand it's all over the exam.\n\n765\n00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,289\nSo we need to be familiar with it.\n\n766\n00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:01,180\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of times\nwhen people say that, hey,\n\n767\n00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,620\nmy network doesn't\nsupport any VLANs at all.\n\n768\n00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,980\nWe don't worry about that.\n\n769\n00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,830\nNow, even though what they are really\nsaying is that all of their switches\n\n770\n00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,030\nare on one network, which is fine,\nthey really are on a VLAN whether or\n\n771\n00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,100\nnot they know it or not.\n\n772\n00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,954\nEspecially if they're\nusing Cisco switches here.\n\n773\n00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:19,960\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthis concept of a virtual LAN,\n\n774\n00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,265\nthat's what VLAN stands for for us here.\n\n775\n00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:24,960\nAnd so we're gonna actually just\ntalk about that a little bit here.\n\n776\n00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,390\n>> Yeah, so normally when you get\na switch, you get one physical switch.\n\n777\n00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,440\nAnd it has a bunch of ports on it,\nlike this one with 48 ports, right?\n\n778\n00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,866\nSo I've got 48 ports that are all in one\nnetwork and that's the end of it, right?\n\n779\n00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,750\nWhat a VLAN allows us to do is to\ntake that one physical switch.\n\n780\n00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,701\nAnd break it up into\nmultiple virtual switches.\n\n781\n00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:46,789\nSo I could take my 48-port switch and\ndivide it in half.\n\n782\n00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:52,670\nAnd I could have one 24-port virtual\nswitch and another 24-port virtual switch.\n\n783\n00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,650\nIt's one physical switch but\nit's divided up.\n\n784\n00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,495\nAnd it doesn't have to\nbe evenly like that.\n\n785\n00:40:56,495 --> 00:41:00,577\nAnd I could break it up into five\nvirtual switches, one with two ports,\n\n786\n00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:02,970\none with ten ports, one with 13 ports.\n\n787\n00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,636\nHowever you wanna mix and match.\n\n788\n00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,388\nI think the lowest that you\ncan go is just one port.\n\n789\n00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:08,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n790\n00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,730\nthere's not a lot of point in doing that.\n\n791\n00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,600\nSo normally you're gonna do two ports or\nmore, but you can divide it up.\n\n792\n00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,272\n>> Now, speaking of that, right,\n\n793\n00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:19,039\nwhere Don actually just described\nthe idea of actually using one switch and\n\n794\n00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,300\nbeing that actually chop the switch up and\ntreat them as they're multiple switches.\n\n795\n00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,730\nThe neat thing about VLAN is\nas we go further into it, so\n\n796\n00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,715\neven beyond the CCNT here, a little bit,\nwhen we actually have multiple switches,\n\n797\n00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:37,500\nokay, we can actually take those\nmultiple switches then, with VLANs, and\n\n798\n00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,200\nactually treat them as if they're one big,\ngigantic switch, if we want to.\n\n799\n00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,780\nOr, if I have three switches,\nI could treat 15 switches if I chose to.\n\n800\n00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,780\nSo, it's an incredibly versatile,\n\n801\n00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,020\nI guess is the right term here,\ntechnology that we can use.\n\n802\n00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,960\nNow, the whole goal behind this is simple,\nright?\n\n803\n00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,710\nI may actually think that, hey, buying\na 48-port switch is the way to go, okay,\n\n804\n00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,930\nfor right now.\n\n805\n00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,160\nBecause I have the money for it.\n\n806\n00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,210\nI don't wanna actually buy a whole\nbunch of little switches here.\n\n807\n00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,902\nWell, again, that means that I can\nactually use it very efficiently and\n\n808\n00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:13,050\nthen subdivide it later on if I need to.\n\n809\n00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,340\nSo it's a really neat technology for us.\n\n810\n00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,580\n>> Now, why would we want to divide our\nphysical switch up into virtual switches?\n\n811\n00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,460\nAnd there's two main reasons.\n\n812\n00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,130\nReason number one is,\n\n813\n00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,570\nremember how I mentioned the entire\nswitch is one broadcast domain?\n\n814\n00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,780\nRight, every port is its\nown collision domain.\n\n815\n00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,400\nBut the whole switch is\nstill one broadcast domain.\n\n816\n00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,090\nIf you divide it up into virtual switches,\n\n817\n00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,360\neach virtual switch is\nits own broadcast domain.\n\n818\n00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,550\nSo instead of having a 48-port broadcast\ndomain, if I divided it in half,\n\n819\n00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,720\nI could have two 24-port\nbroadcast domains, right?\n\n820\n00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,480\nSo we start to make our network\na little smaller as far as\n\n821\n00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,170\nthe broadcasts, all right?\n\n822\n00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,990\nThe second reason is security.\n\n823\n00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,860\nI might have some PCs that I don't\nwant to communicate with others.\n\n824\n00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,160\nMaybe I have my accounting machines and\n\n825\n00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,640\nI have my sales machines and\nI don't want the two to mix.\n\n826\n00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,310\nSo I divide the switch up logically to put\nthem on two separate networks, all right?\n\n827\n00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,380\n>> And it's all about the idea of design\nand keeping the efficiency that we can.\n\n828\n00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,396\nIf we don't have this ability\nto do what Don is talking about,\n\n829\n00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:17,470\nseparating it from our accounting and\nour marketing, right,\n\n830\n00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,704\nthis means that accounting information,\neven accidentally in terms of a broadcast,\n\n831\n00:43:21,704 --> 00:43:24,660\ncan overflow into\nthe accounting department.\n\n832\n00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,500\nAnd that means those accounting machines\ncan pretty much see everything that's\n\n833\n00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,760\nbeing sent across.\n\n834\n00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,650\nSo that may be something we\ndon't want to have happen.\n\n835\n00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,551\nAnd if I don't have enough\nmoney to buy another switch,\n\n836\n00:43:33,551 --> 00:43:35,255\nthis is the perfect way for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n837\n00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:36,265\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n838\n00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:41,441\nAnd once they're divided up like that,\nmachines on two different VLANs cannot\n\n839\n00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:46,190\nsee each other, cannot talk at all,\ncan't ping, can't do anything.\n\n840\n00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,470\nIf you want them to communicate,\nyou're gonna have to take a firewall or\n\n841\n00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,640\na router, and plug it into both VLANs to\nbe able to route between them, all right?\n\n842\n00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,570\nSo you then have full control over what\ntraffic is allowed to pass from one VLAN\n\n843\n00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,325\nto another, great way to implement\nsecurity protocols in your network.\n\n844\n00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:09,048\nNow, you can also use what's\ncalled a Layer 3 switch.\n\n845\n00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:14,500\nAnd a Layer 3 switch is a switch\nthat has a router built into it.\n\n846\n00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,560\nAnd, most of Cisco's mid-tier,\n\n847\n00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,320\nand all of Cisco's high-tier switches have\nthat router functionality built into them.\n\n848\n00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,811\nEven some of the low end\nswitches do nowadays.\n\n849\n00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:26,456\nSo that's a pretty common thing, but\nagain you still have control over it.\n\n850\n00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:33,780\nNow for the CCENT exam, you need to know\nhow to route between VLANs using a router.\n\n851\n00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,850\nAnd we haven't really set up routing yet\nin the show.\n\n852\n00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,867\nWe haven't really gotten to that point.\n\n853\n00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:40,350\nSo we're gonna tackle that in the routing\nshows that happen a little bit later,\n\n854\n00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,230\nprobably in the next two weeks and\nget that knocked out.\n\n855\n00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,690\nSo for right now we're just gonna\nfocus on the Layer 2 side of it.\n\n856\n00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,210\n>> Right.\n\n857\n00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,060\n>> For\nthose of you that go on to do your CCNA,\n\n858\n00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,812\nwe'll get into using Layer 3\nswitches on the CCNA show.\n\n859\n00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:58,210\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat VLANs and how they work.\n\n860\n00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,080\nNow Ronnie mentioned something earlier.\n\n861\n00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,449\nHe said when you buy a brand new switch,\neven if you don't set it up,\n\n862\n00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:06,836\nyou may say you're not using a VLAN,\nbut you actually are, right?\n\n863\n00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:15,260\n>> Now, every Cisco switch by default has\none VLAN on it and we call that VLAN 1.\n\n864\n00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,497\nNow when we talk about this, right,\n\n865\n00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:22,960\nevery port is automatically associated\nwith that very first VLAN that's there.\n\n866\n00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,280\nIt doesn't mean that's\nthe only one you have to use.\n\n867\n00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,250\nBut they automatically associate\nit because they assume\n\n868\n00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,250\nthat you're going to be wanting to\nuse VLANs to separate out those ports\n\n869\n00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,350\ninto the separate VLANs that you want to,\nokay?\n\n870\n00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:41,580\nRemember that, for us, a VLAN is\ngonna help us to limit the broadcast.\n\n871\n00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,890\nSo usually what we might do again is using\nbusiness functions such as marketing and\n\n872\n00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,460\nsales that we mentioned here.\n\n873\n00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,640\nWe might also do it by separating\nout functions of machines,\n\n874\n00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,290\nso I have a data center.\n\n875\n00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,480\nAnd then to have, maybe branch offices.\n\n876\n00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,980\nWhatever it might be here, but\n\n877\n00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,000\nat the beginning every single port's\ngonna be associated with that one VLAN.\n\n878\n00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,430\nAnd then we can re-assign\nthe ports they wanted.\n\n879\n00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,900\nThe good thing is we can either assign\none port, or I can assign multiple ports.\n\n880\n00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,380\nI don't have to assign consecutive ports.\n\n881\n00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,315\nI can pick and\nchoose what ports that I want to,\n\n882\n00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:16,570\nto put into whatever VLAN I\nwant to as well, right.\n\n883\n00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,622\n>> Let's take a look at this\nswitch that I've got right here.\n\n884\n00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:23,251\nSo this switch, I've done a little bit\nof configuration to it but not too much.\n\n885\n00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:26,758\nIf I take a look at the running\nconfiguration of the switch, and\n\n886\n00:46:26,758 --> 00:46:30,527\nI can look at it here, I can kinda\ngo through and see where it's got,\n\n887\n00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:33,330\nhere's the certificate\nthat's attached to it.\n\n888\n00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,222\nAnd then here,\nI start to see all the interfaces.\n\n889\n00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:38,930\nInterface Fa0/1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n890\n00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,150\nSee how there's no configuration\nattached to any of these, right?\n\n891\n00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,300\nThat means that all of these ports\nare running at their default, right?\n\n892\n00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,750\nDefault configuration for ports 1 through,\nI think the only one I messed with is 48.\n\n893\n00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,320\nYeah, so I messed with 48.\n\n894\n00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,060\nBut 1 through 47 and the gigabit ports,\nthe uplinks, 1 through 4,\n\n895\n00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,590\nthey're all right there.\n\n896\n00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,610\nNo special configuration, all right?\n\n897\n00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,867\nNotice that I've got interface VLAN 1.\n\n898\n00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:04,985\nThat's a default also.\n\n899\n00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:08,767\nAnd when we did the basic switch\nconfiguration last episode,\n\n900\n00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:14,527\nremember when we attached an IP address\nto the switch, I gave it 192.168.0.10?\n\n901\n00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:18,650\nI attached that to the VLAN 1 interface,\nall right?\n\n902\n00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,710\nWhen you buy a brand new Cisco switch,\nit has one\n\n903\n00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,430\nVLAN created automatically and I can see\nit right here, VLAN 1 default, all right?\n\n904\n00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:35,160\nAnd if I look at my list, I've got\nports Fa0/1 all the way through 47.\n\n905\n00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,410\nI messed with 48.\n\n906\n00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,144\n>> Yep.\n>> And then we've got gigabit 1, 2, 3,\n\n907\n00:47:39,144 --> 00:47:40,210\nand 4.\n\n908\n00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,670\nAll the ports are in one VLAN.\n\n909\n00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,790\nThat's the default VLAN and\nthat's just where it is.\n\n910\n00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,313\nYep.\n\n911\n00:47:48,313 --> 00:47:51,148\n>> So for us here at this point then,\nif we wanted to,\n\n912\n00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,910\nwe again can actually take in.\n\n913\n00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,976\nAny of those ports out and\nput them into whatever we wanted to.\n\n914\n00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:59,520\nNow here it looks like that Don\nactually created some other VLAN.\n\n915\n00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,700\nSo we'll get in that\nin just a moment here.\n\n916\n00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,480\n>> Yep.\nAnd then those\n\n917\n00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,290\nare created automatically too so we'll\nbe able to talk a little bit about VTP.\n\n918\n00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,760\n>> Nice.\nOh yeah, that's right.\n\n919\n00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,810\nWhen we decide we want\nto divide up our switch.\n\n920\n00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,490\nRight now all the ports are in VLAN 1.\n\n921\n00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:20,290\nIf I want to divide it up, I need to\ncreate a new virtual area network and\n\n922\n00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,680\nthen I need to attach the ports to it.\n\n923\n00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,380\n>> Right.\n>> And that process is pretty easy.\n\n924\n00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,540\nRight now I've got a router\nIt is a Cisco 2800, and\n\n925\n00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,630\nit's plugged in on port number,\nlet's use this port here, port 3.\n\n926\n00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,660\nSo on port 3,\nI've got a Cisco router plugged in.\n\n927\n00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,510\nAnd you know, I didn't pay attention\nto what IP address it had, so\n\n928\n00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,640\nI can't ping it.\n\n929\n00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,120\nSo let's do this,\nwe'll go through the whole exercise here.\n\n930\n00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,400\n>> Okay.\n>> we'll.\n\n931\n00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,550\n>> Assign an IP address to it.\n\n932\n00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,890\nAnd I didn't assign an IP to the switch\neither so maybe I should do that.\n\n933\n00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,700\nI'm gonna get into interface VLAN 1 and\n\n934\n00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,740\nI'm gonna assign an IP address\nto this switch 192.168.0.10.\n\n935\n00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:11,270\n>> Just what we used\nfrom the other episode.\n\n936\n00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,960\nAll right.\n\n937\n00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,390\nSo the switch is now 192.168.0.10.\n\n938\n00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,840\nLet me do the same thing.\n\n939\n00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,220\nActually the router.\n\n940\n00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,450\nDidn't I assign an IP\naddress to it that is 0.1?\n\n941\n00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,610\nWe'll see, if not we'll connect\ninto it and assign an IP.\n\n942\n00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,110\n>> Real quick.\n\n943\n00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,310\nI just wanna show that\nI can connect with it.\n\n944\n00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,780\nMaybe it got erased.\n\n945\n00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,330\nAll right,\nlet me jump over to it real quick and\n\n946\n00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,610\nwe'll get that set if I can\nplug in my console cable.\n\n947\n00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,690\nThere we go.\n\n948\n00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,190\nAll right.\n\n949\n00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,240\nNope.\n\n950\n00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,910\nHere, we'll take its port 1.\n\n951\n00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,530\nI'm gonna assign it an address of\n192.168.0.1, and I'll turn that on,\n\n952\n00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:52,933\nall right, now this\n\n953\n00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:58,650\nrouter is plugged into the switch so\n\n954\n00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,840\nit's port one on this router is\nplugged into port 1 on the switch.\n\n955\n00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,290\nSo that will make it easier for\nme to keep it straight.\n\n956\n00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,100\nThe router is now 192.168.0.1.\n\n957\n00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,650\nThe switch is 192.168.0.10.\n\n958\n00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:14,070\nI'm just gonna see if I can ping that.\n\n959\n00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,160\nAnd not looking too good.\n\n960\n00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,200\nThere we go.\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n961\n00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,099\n>> Actually I'm glad this happened.\n\n962\n00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:19,690\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n963\n00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,950\n>> When I did that ping,\n\n964\n00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,900\nnotice how the first two pings didn't\nmake it but the remaining 3 did.\n\n965\n00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,330\nAnd if I run that ping again,\nsee how all 5 made it.\n\n966\n00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,490\n>> Right.\n>> And immediately.\n\n967\n00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,630\n>> What happened?\n\n968\n00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,170\nWell, on a Windows PC or a Linux box, you\nwon't notice this, because it happens too\n\n969\n00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:41,860\nfast, but Cisco routers have their timer\nset really short so you notice this.\n\n970\n00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,620\nThe first time you\ncommunicate with somebody,\n\n971\n00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,900\nyou don't necessarily know what\ntheir Mac address is, right?\n\n972\n00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,660\nYeah, at layer 3, I know the layer 3\naddress of the switch, 192.168.0.10, but\n\n973\n00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,290\nin order to talk to that switch,\nI need to know its Mac address.\n\n974\n00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:56,790\n>> Right.\n\n975\n00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:00,050\n>> So when I tried to ping it,\nI didn't know its Mac address.\n\n976\n00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,170\nAnd I had to send out what's\ncalled an ARP request.\n\n977\n00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,980\nARP if you're not familiar with it,\n\n978\n00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,530\nwe talk about it in detail in the network\nplus show, but here's a recap.\n\n979\n00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,220\nARP is address resolution protocol.\n\n980\n00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,300\nAnd we use it to find\nsomeone else's Mac address.\n\n981\n00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,310\nBasically we send out a broadcast.\n\n982\n00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,330\nAnd we say, hey.\n\n983\n00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,650\nWho is 192.168.8.0.10?\n\n984\n00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:26,500\nAnd then we get a response back from\n192.1680.10 saying hey, that's me.\n\n985\n00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,630\nHere's my Mac address.\n\n986\n00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,560\nRight?\n\n987\n00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,340\nAnd we learn it, and\nwe add it to our ARP table.\n\n988\n00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,750\nSo I just did a show, ARP.\n\n989\n00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,460\nAnd right there,\nI can see where I learned 192.1680.10,\n\n990\n00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,796\nthe switch, has this Mac address.\n\n991\n00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,826\n>> 0018.198e.dbc0.\n\n992\n00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:43,854\nAll right.\n\n993\n00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:49,660\nAnd if I ping it now,\nall the pings go through immediately,\n\n994\n00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,240\nbecause I already know it, right?\n\n995\n00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,730\nI didn't have to do the ARP request.\n\n996\n00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:58,963\nIf I were to clear the ARP\ntable [SOUND] there we go.\n\n997\n00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,640\nAnd then do the ping again.\n\n998\n00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,220\nOh, it's going to learn it much\nfaster this time and not do it.\n\n999\n00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,610\nBut basically if you lose the first two or\n\n1000\n00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,470\nthe first one ping,\nyou don't normally need to worry about it.\n\n1001\n00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:13,480\nJust run the ping again and\nmake sure that all 5 go through.\n\n1002\n00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,340\nAnd you'll be in business.\n\n1003\n00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,930\nSo, I should of checked to make sure\nthe arc table actually emptied,\n\n1004\n00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,980\nit might not of.\n\n1005\n00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,220\nBut anyhow, the point being,\n\n1006\n00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,970\nport 1 on this router is plugged\nin to port 1 on the switch.\n\n1007\n00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,840\nAnd so, if I jump back over to the switch.\n\n1008\n00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,210\nJump over to it, there we go.\n\n1009\n00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,560\nAnd I take a look at the VLAN.\n\n1010\n00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,780\nThere's port number one, fa0/1,\nand it is currently on VLAN 1,\n\n1011\n00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,380\nand my switch has an IP address\nof 192.168.0.10 on VLAN 1, right?\n\n1012\n00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,520\nEverything is happening on vlan 1.\n\n1013\n00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,500\nNow, if I create a new VLAN, and\n\n1014\n00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,480\nwe do that just by typing VLAN and\na number, what we get in config.\n\n1015\n00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,220\nAnd we say VLAN and a number.\n\n1016\n00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,040\nWe can create a new VLAN,\nI'll create VLAN 2, all right?\n\n1017\n00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,650\nSo now I just made VLAN 2, and\nI can give it a name if I want.\n\n1018\n00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:16,611\nI'll call it show VLAN.\n\n1019\n00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,100\nAll right.\n\n1020\n00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,980\nSo now,\nI've got a brand new VLAN called VLAN 2.\n\n1021\n00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,800\n>> And if Don actually goes ahead and\nnow does a show command for us.\n\n1022\n00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,480\n>> The do show VLAN, here.\n\n1023\n00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,010\nNotice that what we see is,\nVLAN 2 has showed up, but\n\n1024\n00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,695\nwe don't have an actual port\nassigned to that VLAN yet.\n\n1025\n00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:38,150\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> So we're gonna be doing that.\n\n1026\n00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,740\nAre we gonna do that now, or\nare we gonna do that later?\n\n1027\n00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,250\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n1028\n00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,600\nOkay.\nSo we need to move a port over to it.\n\n1029\n00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,240\nAt least one, but\nnormally you're going to move 2 or more.\n\n1030\n00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,620\nSo I want to move that router\nport over to this VLAN to.\n\n1031\n00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,090\nSo I'm going into interface FA0/1,\n\n1032\n00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:56,248\nthat's where the routers plugged into\nthat port and I'll say switch port.\n\n1033\n00:53:56,248 --> 00:54:01,180\nAccess VLAN and a number right.\n\n1034\n00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,370\nAnd this could be whatever VLAN it is that\ni'm gonna plug into, i'll pick VLAN 2.\n\n1035\n00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,230\nAll right.\n\n1036\n00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:11,340\nSo, when I say switch port access VLAN 2,\nnow that port has been moved over.\n\n1037\n00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:18,120\nAnd if I say show VLAN, I can see\nthat port one is now the only port,\n\n1038\n00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,050\nall by itself here in VLAN 2 now,\nthere's another way for\n\n1039\n00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:28,390\nus to also create another VLAN, but\nwe can do it differently as well.\n\n1040\n00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:33,690\nWe can do it directly from\nthe interface command as well.\n\n1041\n00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:38,618\nSo, if we choose another interface,\n\n1042\n00:54:38,618 --> 00:54:42,490\nhere with interface here.\n\n1043\n00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:45,120\nWhat we want to do is actually go to the\nswitch port and we want to make sure that\n\n1044\n00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,565\nthis is gonna be an access VLAN and\nthen we can pick VLAN 3.\n\n1045\n00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,340\n>> Now VLAN 3 doesn't exist so\n\n1046\n00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,660\nwe get a message letting us know access\nVLAN does not exist creating VLAN 3.\n\n1047\n00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,790\n>> Now, this is very important for\nus cuz there are 2 ways for us to do this.\n\n1048\n00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:07,155\nNow, if we do it this way right, we have\nto do each individual port that we want.\n\n1049\n00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:07,770\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> And\n\n1050\n00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,690\nthen we can actually assign\nthem in that particular way.\n\n1051\n00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:14,650\nOr later on, have y'all done the interface\nrange command in the previous show?\n\n1052\n00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,340\n>> We haven't.\n\n1053\n00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,350\nGood point for it.\n\n1054\n00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,660\n>> There you go.\n\n1055\n00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,130\n>> So\nwe mentioned normally you're gonna move.\n\n1056\n00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,230\n>> Several ports over.\n\n1057\n00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,790\nRight?\n\n1058\n00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,970\nSo I might wanna move not just port 10 but\nmaybe port 10 through 15.\n\n1059\n00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,570\nTo create a 5 port switch.\n\n1060\n00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,900\nSo I could say.\n\n1061\n00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,740\n>> 11 through 15.\n\n1062\n00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:35,150\n>> Interface range FA0/,\neh, 10's already done.\n\n1063\n00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,790\nWe can say 11 through 15.\n\n1064\n00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,980\nAll right.\n\n1065\n00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,940\nSee how I wrote that?\n\n1066\n00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,940\nInterface range, that lets the switch\nknow I'm about to do a range of ports.\n\n1067\n00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,578\nfa0/11, that's the first port, and\nthen The spaces are important.\n\n1068\n00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:54,085\n15, that means 11 through 15.\n\n1069\n00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:55,664\nI'm now modifying.\n\n1070\n00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,080\nMore than one port at a time.\n\n1071\n00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,100\nAnd notice the command prompt\nchange that we see right here?\n\n1072\n00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,310\nWe are now in the range\ninterface configuration prompt.\n\n1073\n00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,240\nAnd now all we have to do is actually\nassign that same command to whatever\n\n1074\n00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,650\ninterface, or\nwhatever VLAN we want to, and\n\n1075\n00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,270\nthat affects all those\nports in that range.\n\n1076\n00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:17,000\nSo, we actually have a way to assign\nmultiple interfaces to a particular VLAN.\n\n1077\n00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,080\nOr we can do one at a time, or the way\nDon did earlier we create the VLAN first,\n\n1078\n00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,880\nand then we can go back through and\nassign them to the same VLAN.\n\n1079\n00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,420\n>> So now when I get out,\nand I do a show VLAN,\n\n1080\n00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,130\nI can see that I've got VLAN2\nwith just one port in it.\n\n1081\n00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,863\nAnd I can see VLAN3 exists.\n\n1082\n00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,650\nAnd it's got, what is that?\n\n1083\n00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,417\nSix ports.\n\n1084\n00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, notice the name that VLAN3 got.\n\n1085\n00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,735\nWhen you create it,\ncreating it that way is called on the fly.\n\n1086\n00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:49,346\n>> When you create an on the fly VLAN,\nthat's the official name.\n\n1087\n00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:50,889\n>> I feel like I should say trademark,\ncopyright.\n\n1088\n00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:52,305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyhow,\n\n1089\n00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:54,131\nwhen you create a VLAN on the fly.\n\n1090\n00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,858\nIt gets a name like this VLAN, and then\na four-digit number representing the VLAN.\n\n1091\n00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:04,946\nAnd I'm glad I mentioned this,\nbecause the VLAN numbers.\n\n1092\n00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:09,333\n>> The way they're stored inside a frame,\nthere's not a lot of room.\n\n1093\n00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:13,668\n>> So, you're really only given a couple\nof bytes to be able to use to store\n\n1094\n00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:14,700\nthe data.\n\n1095\n00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,400\nAnd as a result your VLAN number is going\nto be a number between 1 and 4,094.\n\n1096\n00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,880\nAnd 95, and 96 are reserved.\n\n1097\n00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,450\nAnd so you end up with 1 through 4,094,\n\n1098\n00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,460\nactually there's a couple of reserved\nnumbers we should point out, but\n\n1099\n00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,780\nthat means that you'll never\nhave a five digit VLAN number.\n\n1100\n00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,370\nCuz there's just not enough\nroom in the frame to store it.\n\n1101\n00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,690\nSo, it will be 1 through 4094.\n\n1102\n00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:42,220\nOld switches might only go 1 through 1024.\n\n1103\n00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,720\nThere's a lot of them that do that,\nthe old ones.\n\n1104\n00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,740\nBut any switch made in\nprobably the last ten years.\n\n1105\n00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,400\nShould be able to do one to 1094.\n\n1106\n00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,090\nSo, that VLAN is created.\n\n1107\n00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,090\nI could go and rename it if we wanted to.\n\n1108\n00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:01,310\nWe would just go back into config and\nsay VLAN3 name RONNIE_VLAN.\n\n1109\n00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,140\n>> There you go.\n>> This is your network.\n\n1110\n00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,470\nAll right, so when I do that,\nnow when I do a show VLAN,\n\n1111\n00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,200\nif I spell it right, then we'll see\nthat it's got a nice little name.\n\n1112\n00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,126\nSo, that's really the only\nnegative of doing it on the fly.\n\n1113\n00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:12,683\n>> Yep.\n\n1114\n00:58:12,683 --> 00:58:13,751\n>> Is that it just doesn't get a name.\n\n1115\n00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:14,494\n>> Yeah.\n\n1116\n00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:17,310\nThe nice thing is now,\nwhat we talked about a little bit earlier.\n\n1117\n00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,730\nLet's remember that what we've\nnow done is that on VLANs 2 and\n\n1118\n00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,140\n3, we have created two\nseparate broadcast domain.\n\n1119\n00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,960\nSo, we have our original broadcast domain,\nwhich is the default one.\n\n1120\n00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,310\nSo on this switch right now,\n\n1121\n00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,160\nwe have three separate broadcast domain\nwhere originally we'd have only had one.\n\n1122\n00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,890\n>> Yeah, and\nwe never did follow up with our router.\n\n1123\n00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,750\nOur router has been moved over to VLAN2,\n\n1124\n00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,320\nlet's see how that affects\nthe router all right?\n\n1125\n00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,600\nLet me move my console cable over.\n\n1126\n00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,810\nBecause we're moving the VLANs around.\n\n1127\n00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,748\nI can't connect via the network.\n\n1128\n00:58:49,748 --> 00:58:52,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it's like moving the ports, so\n\n1129\n00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,470\nI'm using a console cable to ensure\nthat I can constantly connect to it.\n\n1130\n00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:00,405\nSo now, I'm on that router now,\nand if I look at its IP address\n\n1131\n00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:05,400\nits 192 2.168.0.1 that\nnetwork is still up.\n\n1132\n00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,150\nBefore I disconnect it,\nI was able to ping the switch and\n\n1133\n00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,750\nlet me just see if my ARP\ncache is still there.\n\n1134\n00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,284\nLet me clear the ARP cache.\n\n1135\n00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:21,138\nThat did not clear the ARP cache, did it?\n\n1136\n00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:22,845\nThat will explain why it.\n\n1137\n00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,334\nIt didn't work earlier.\n\n1138\n00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:30,440\nThere we go.\n\n1139\n00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,150\nOkay.\n\n1140\n00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,970\nSo, the switch was 192.168.0.10 and\nI just cleared it out of the ARP cache.\n\n1141\n00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:42,612\nSo it's out, and I'm gonna try and\nping 192.168.0.10.\n\n1142\n00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,830\nI was able to ping it before but\n\n1143\n00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:48,170\nnow my router has been moved,\ninto a brand new VLAN.\n\n1144\n00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,890\nRemember what I said earlier?\n\n1145\n00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,910\nWhen you get moved into a separate VLAN,\nyou're cut off from the original VLAN.\n\n1146\n00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:58,120\nThe router can no longer see VLAN1,\n\n1147\n00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:03,820\nit only sees VLAN2 and so my pings\nare gonna fail if I do a show ARP,\n\n1148\n01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,920\nI'll see where I got\nan incomplete response.\n\n1149\n01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,720\nI sent out an ARP broadcast to get the MAC\naddress, I never got an answer back.\n\n1150\n01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,530\nSo I never found out.\n\n1151\n01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,520\n>> Yep.\n\n1152\n01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,110\nAnd so the way that we're gonna end\nup taking care of this is by doing\n\n1153\n01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,530\nwhat later on,\nwhich we'll call inter VLAN routing.\n\n1154\n01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:27,010\n>> Where we will need the ID of a router\nto help us get past, this limitation here.\n\n1155\n01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,750\n>> And I got so, involved in our VLAN\naction I lost track of the time.\n\n1156\n01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,020\nI think we've blown past our limit.\n\n1157\n01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep.\n\n1158\n01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,220\n>> So let's stop here, and take a break.\n\n1159\n01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,070\nWhen we get back,\nwe got more about VLANs to cover.\n\n1160\n01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,950\nRight now, we've just seen\nhow it can break our network.\n\n1161\n01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,800\nWe need to show some\nof the good stuff too.\n\n1162\n01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,950\nSo, let's stop here.\n\n1163\n01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:42,550\nWe'll take a break.\n\n1164\n01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,417\nWhen we get back, more VLAN action.\n\n1165\n01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:52,932\n[MUSIC]\n\n1166\n01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:55,240\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1167\n01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,820\nSo before the break, we took the router\nand we moved it off to its own VLAN.\n\n1168\n01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,790\nAnd when we did that,\n\n1169\n01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,250\nthe router is now no longer able\nto see the rest of the devices.\n\n1170\n01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,618\nIt's isolated,\nit's in its own little world.\n\n1171\n01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:09,980\nWhat I wanna do now is, I wanna move\nmy laptop over to that same VLAN as\n\n1172\n01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,420\nthe router to show you how that\nKind of brings it full circle?\n\n1173\n01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,220\nSo, let's take just a moment\nhere at the beginning,\n\n1174\n01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,290\nand take a look at my\nlaptop as it is right now.\n\n1175\n01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:22,870\nIf I do a quick IP config, there we go.\n\n1176\n01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:28,960\nSo, my network card is 192.168.0.2,\n\n1177\n01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,150\nthat's the IP address that\nI've got on my interface.\n\n1178\n01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,250\nAnd I'm plugged into VLAN1.\n\n1179\n01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,130\nSo, I should be able to ping the switch.\n\n1180\n01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:40,710\nThe switch is 192.168.0.10 so\nI'm just gonna try and ping that.\n\n1181\n01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:45,520\nAnd there it is I can see\nthe switch because I'm on VLAN1,\n\n1182\n01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,220\nthe switch is on VLAN1.\n\n1183\n01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:53,007\nIf I try and ping the router,\nwhich was 192.168.0.1,\n\n1184\n01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:57,880\nI'm on VLAN1,\nthe router's on VLAN2 I cannot ping.\n\n1185\n01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,504\nSo what I want to do is I want\nto move my laptop over to VLAN2,\n\n1186\n01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:07,366\nso that I can see the router.\n\n1187\n01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:10,140\nNow, I know that my laptop\nis plugged into port two.\n\n1188\n01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,740\nIf I didn't know that, I could use\nthe MAC address table to find it,\n\n1189\n01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,120\nbut I know it is let me\nget over to the switch.\n\n1190\n01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,520\nI guess that'll make a difference for me.\n\n1191\n01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:23,210\n>> So, what Don's gonna do at this point\nhere, is we're gonna actually take\n\n1192\n01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:26,940\nwhatever port that his particular\nlaptop is plugged into.\n\n1193\n01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,780\nAnd he's gonna reassign that\nparticular port into VLAN2,\n\n1194\n01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,640\nwhich is gonna be on the same\nVLAN as the router itself.\n\n1195\n01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,490\nSo here he is, actually going into\nthe interface configuration, and\n\n1196\n01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,400\nnow he's gonna reassign\nthe actual VLAN here.\n\n1197\n01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,610\nAnd remember,\nthat what Don did right here,\n\n1198\n01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:47,290\nhe didn't have to do a,\nno switch port access VLAN1,\n\n1199\n01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:52,150\nhe simply just typed in switch port access\nVLAN2, and there's a reason for that.\n\n1200\n01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:57,860\nA single port can only be in one VLAN,\nespecially in access port here.\n\n1201\n01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,290\n>> So we're only in one VLAN,\nwe're now in VLAN2.\n\n1202\n01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,140\nThat means that the port I'm plugged into,\nand the port the router is plugged into\n\n1203\n01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,180\nare both on VLAN2, and I can see\nthat with a quick show VLAN command.\n\n1204\n01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,778\nIf I do a show VLAN,\nhere's VLAN2, which has Fa0/1.\n\n1205\n01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:17,740\nThe port the router's plugged into,\nand port two,\n\n1206\n01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,070\nthe port my laptop is plugged into.\n\n1207\n01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,720\nNow, that we're both\nplugged into that port,\n\n1208\n01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,240\nremember back here where I\nwasn't able to ping the router?\n\n1209\n01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,340\nNow, I should be able to ping the router.\n\n1210\n01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,900\nLet's see what happens.\n\n1211\n01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,120\nA moment of anticipation.\n\n1212\n01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:31,650\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n1213\n01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,190\nremember, the ARP broadcast\nthing has to happen.\n\n1214\n01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,309\nI gotta try to find that MAC address.\n\n1215\n01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:40,744\nAnd [LAUGH] it's that\nmoment of anticipation.\n\n1216\n01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:41,706\n>> I know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1217\n01:03:41,706 --> 01:03:43,112\n>> Is it going to get through?\n\n1218\n01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,621\n>> [CROSSTALK] It may take a moment.\n\n1219\n01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:45,817\n>> And it does appear to be stalling,\ndoesn't it?\n\n1220\n01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:47,674\n>> Yep.\n\n1221\n01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:48,533\n>> You know what?\n\n1222\n01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,364\nLoop detection.\n\n1223\n01:03:49,364 --> 01:03:51,454\nIs loop detection still going on?\n\n1224\n01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:52,940\nNo, it seems to be happy.\n\n1225\n01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,171\nSo, let's try that again.\n\n1226\n01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:55,912\n>> Yep.\n\n1227\n01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:58,373\nThat's routeris.1 isn't it?\n\n1228\n01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:00,022\n>> [LAUGH] I think so.\n\n1229\n01:04:00,022 --> 01:04:01,800\n>> There it goes, yep.\n\n1230\n01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,960\nIt's happening, it happened while I wasn't\nfocused on the window, let me try again.\n\n1231\n01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,250\n>> Apparently, it took a little\nwhile to learn the Mac address.\n\n1232\n01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,590\n>> Oh, you know,\nI didn't think about it, but\n\n1233\n01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:12,140\nthe\n>> The ARP table on the switch.\n\n1234\n01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,870\nWhen records get written into the ARP\ntable, they stay there for a while, and\n\n1235\n01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:20,360\nso it probably had me cached on VLAN 1,\nand that cache just had to age out.\n\n1236\n01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,490\nNow it sees me VLAN 2.\n\n1237\n01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,480\nSo So now I am able to see that router.\n\n1238\n01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,178\nI can ping 192.168.0.1.\n\n1239\n01:04:27,178 --> 01:04:32,230\nNow, when I started I was on VLAN 1 and\nI could ping the switch.\n\n1240\n01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:34,300\nNow I'm on VLAN 2, so if I try and\n\n1241\n01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,570\nping the switch even though I'm plugged\nright in to the front of the switch.\n\n1242\n01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:39,840\nI'm on a different VLAN.\n\n1243\n01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,430\nI'm on VLAN 2 the switch's\nIP address is on VLAN 1.\n\n1244\n01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:48,360\nSo I'm now isolated, split off,\nand not able to ping that switch.\n\n1245\n01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,840\nRight, yep, sounds good.\n\n1246\n01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,320\nSo pretty cool, neat way to divide\nup your system for security.\n\n1247\n01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,030\nLike Ronnie mentioned In another\nepisode when we start tackling routes,\n\n1248\n01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,400\nwe'll show how to route\nbetween these VLANs,\n\n1249\n01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,140\ncuz you might want your two VLANs\nto be able to talk to each other.\n\n1250\n01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,440\nAs it is right now though,\nthey're completely isolated.\n\n1251\n01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,530\n>> Yep.\n\n1252\n01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:10,440\n>> Now there was another cool thing you\nmentioned earlier in the episode Ronnie.\n\n1253\n01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,900\nWhich is, we've divided this one physical\nswitch into multiple virtual switches.\n\n1254\n01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,430\nI can take these VLANs that we made, and\n\n1255\n01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:23,010\nI can stretch them across multiple\nphysical interfaces, all right?\n\n1256\n01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:27,810\nNow, in the Cisco books or whatever,\nthey'll usually give this one example.\n\n1257\n01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,309\nLet me get to my little drawing board,\nhere.\n\n1258\n01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,120\nAnd the example that\nthey'll give a lot times.\n\n1259\n01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,660\nIs they'll show a building right.\n\n1260\n01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,990\nLet me draw a building.\n\n1261\n01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,890\nSo I'll draw a building and\nit'll have a couple of floors, right.\n\n1262\n01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,980\nLike five floors or something.\n\n1263\n01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,420\nand on each floor, they'll have a switch.\n\n1264\n01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,840\nSo there will be a physical switch here\non this floor, and a physical switch on\n\n1265\n01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,570\nthis floor, and each floor in\nthe building will have its own switch.\n\n1266\n01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,950\nAnd all of these switches will run back\nto some kind of central data center,\n\n1267\n01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,200\nand that data center may be they're\non the ground floor, or somewhere.\n\n1268\n01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,260\nBut they basically all run\nback to this central location.\n\n1269\n01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:16,480\nSo we have a topology\nthat looks like this.\n\n1270\n01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,670\nSo see how all the switches are uplinked\ntogether so they can all see each other.\n\n1271\n01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:23,230\nWell, I might have a sales department, and\n\n1272\n01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,130\nif my entire sales department is on the\nfifth floor, right up there at the top.\n\n1273\n01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,890\nThen it may make sense for\nme to just leave them on a VLAN and\n\n1274\n01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,920\nleave them separated out.\n\n1275\n01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,970\nBut what if I have sales\npeople up here and\n\n1276\n01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:40,280\nI've got sales people on the fourth\nfloor and the third floor and so on.\n\n1277\n01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,670\nIf I have sales people spread across\nthe building or accounting people spread\n\n1278\n01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:49,268\nacross the building, I may need that VLAN\nto stretch across more than one switch.\n\n1279\n01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:54,640\nAll right nif you want to do that,\nthe easiest way is to\n\n1280\n01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,810\nrun a crossover cable from one port on\none switch to a port on the other switch.\n\n1281\n01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,200\nThat creates an uplink\nlike we said earlier.\n\n1282\n01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,820\nThe problem with an uplink is it\nonly carries traffic for one VLAN.\n\n1283\n01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,250\nSo if I two VLANs, I can run two uplink\ncables between the switch, one for\n\n1284\n01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,900\nVLAN one, one for VLAN Two,\nand be done with it.\n\n1285\n01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,730\nBut what if I have 15 VLANs, or 30 VLANs?\n\n1286\n01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:21,930\nI'm gonna run a port to my switch just for\nthe uplinks, not even counting my PCs.\n\n1287\n01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,760\n>> Yep.\n\n1288\n01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,820\n>> So\nthat's where our next technology comes in,\n\n1289\n01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,890\nwhich is what's called a VLAN trunk.\n\n1290\n01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:30,380\nEverything we've done so\nfar is with an access port.\n\n1291\n01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,800\nAnd Ronnie, I think you even\ncalled them access ports earlier.\n\n1292\n01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,420\nBut you guys have seen\nthe commands I've done.\n\n1293\n01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,380\nSwitchport, access, blah-blah-blah.\n\n1294\n01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,500\nAnd access port can only be on one VLAN.\n\n1295\n01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,340\nAnother type of port is a trunk port.\n\n1296\n01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:47,170\nAnd and trunk port is specifically\ndesigned for this right here.\n\n1297\n01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,790\nFor connecting multiple switches together,\nand carrying traffic for\n\n1298\n01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:53,030\nmore than one VLAN.\n\n1299\n01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,810\nI can have one VLAN or five VLANs or\n\n1300\n01:07:55,810 --> 01:08:00,290\n50 VLANs all going over the same\ncable if it's a trunk port.\n\n1301\n01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,170\nNow, we'd never want a trunk\nport to run to a PC.\n\n1302\n01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,840\nIt's always gonna be switch to switch.\n\n1303\n01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,210\nYou always want it that way.\n\n1304\n01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,160\nIf a PC was plugged into a trunk port,\nthat one PC could have access to more than\n\n1305\n01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,450\none network, and\nthat's a hacker's dream, right.\n\n1306\n01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:16,370\nThat's what an attacker on\nyour network really wants.\n\n1307\n01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,270\nSo let's take a look at\nthis idea of trunk ports.\n\n1308\n01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,940\nNow I've got one switch\nsitting here behind us, and\n\n1309\n01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:29,140\nIt's connected to our big switch\nin the server room in there, and\n\n1310\n01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,760\nwhen I plugged that port\nin right before the show.\n\n1311\n01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:35,300\nIt got really angry at me,\nand it shut the port off, and\n\n1312\n01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,080\nthe reason was it saw\nthat it was a switch, and\n\n1313\n01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,560\nthat it should have been a trunk port,\nand not an access port, right?\n\n1314\n01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,140\nSo the thing about trunk ports,\n\n1315\n01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,750\na normal access port only carries\ntraffic for one VLAN, right?\n\n1316\n01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,510\nLet me go back to my other drawing.\n\n1317\n01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,480\nWhere is my other drawing?\n\n1318\n01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,170\n>> There it is.\n>> Whoops.\n\n1319\n01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:55,797\nI just had it.\n\n1320\n01:08:55,797 --> 01:08:57,215\nHere, pull it up this way.\n\n1321\n01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,975\nAll right.\nLet me just take this switch here.\n\n1322\n01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:04,342\nWe'll try and\nillustrate this the best way I can.\n\n1323\n01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,220\nOh, I didn't bring my ports over.\n\n1324\n01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:11,720\nWonderful.\n\n1325\n01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:13,960\nOh, nope, there they are.\n\n1326\n01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,529\n>> Nice.\n>> There we go.\n\n1327\n01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:26,411\nOkay, let's say that I've\ngot some switches like this,\n\n1328\n01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:30,820\nand I decide that I want\nto Uuplink them together.\n\n1329\n01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,510\nAll right.\n\n1330\n01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:36,520\nWell by default, when you get a new\nswitch, every port is on VLAN 1.\n\n1331\n01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,370\nSo all I have to do is go out and\nbuy a crossover cable.\n\n1332\n01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:43,310\nAnd I run that crossover cable\nfrom one port on one switch\n\n1333\n01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,680\nto one port on the other.\n\n1334\n01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:49,870\nAnd now any VLAN 1 traffic\ngenerated here hits this cable,\n\n1335\n01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,380\njumps over, then it gets over here.\n\n1336\n01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,750\nVLAN 1 spread everywhere,\neverybody is nice and happy\n\n1337\n01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,120\n>> As long as everybody is on one VLAN\n\n1338\n01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,830\n>> We're okay with this.\n\n1339\n01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:03,180\nBut if I have three or\nfour different VLANs, well,\n\n1340\n01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,780\nwhat this would actually end up meaning\nfor me, if I don't use the idea of\n\n1341\n01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:11,100\na trunk, is that between each\nparticular VLAN on each switch.\n\n1342\n01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,350\nI would need to run that same\ntype of uplink from each\n\n1343\n01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,660\nall of the different VLANs\nthat would actually be there.\n\n1344\n01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,250\nSo for us instead, the easier and\n\n1345\n01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:24,170\nthe most efficient way to do this\nis to take that red cable and\n\n1346\n01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:29,160\nto turn it into a trunk so it can\nhandle the VLAN traffic from all VLANs.\n\n1347\n01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,600\nTo allow the traffic to go across\nthat one link instead of needing\n\n1348\n01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,760\na particular trunk, or not a trunk,\nparticular uplink between each VLAN here.\n\n1349\n01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,940\nSo that's what we wanna do, so\n\n1350\n01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:46,730\nDon is actually giving us two different\nVLAN's here and so by using that red\n\n1351\n01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:51,220\ncable if we actually do have them\ntrunked all the VLANs can go across it.\n\n1352\n01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,240\n>> Now by default all\nyour port turn VLAN 1, so\n\n1353\n01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,117\nif I was to set this\nup where port four and\n\n1354\n01:10:56,117 --> 01:11:00,010\nfive on each switch were on VLAN 2\n>> The red cable is just gonna carry VLAN\n\n1355\n01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,610\n1 traffic, so\nVLAN 1 host down on the bottom switch\n\n1356\n01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:06,900\nwould be able to talk to VLAN\n1 up here on the top switch.\n\n1357\n01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,260\nVLAN 2 hosts would be isolated.\n\n1358\n01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,680\nThese two guys up here would\nbe able to see each other.\n\n1359\n01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,030\nThese two guys down here would\nbe able to see each other.\n\n1360\n01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:17,760\nBut they wouldn't be able to\nsee in between the switches,\n\n1361\n01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,730\nunless we change this cable to carry both.\n\n1362\n01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,450\n>> Right.\n>> VLAN 1 and VLAN 2.\n\n1363\n01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:29,090\nNow, the problem here is that normally\nwhen traffic enters a switch.\n\n1364\n01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,150\nIt knows what VLAN to put it on\nbased on our port assignment, right?\n\n1365\n01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,790\n>> Right.\n>> On the port,\n\n1366\n01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,270\nI say switch port access VLAN 2.\n\n1367\n01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:40,960\nThat says any traffic coming\nin this port goes on VLAN 2.\n\n1368\n01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,868\nBut when I have an uplink like this\nthat's a trunk that's carrying more than\n\n1369\n01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:50,559\none VLAN, how does the switch know\nwhat VLAN to put the stuff on, right?\n\n1370\n01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:55,458\nAnd the way it does is through using\na neat little standard with a funny name.\n\n1371\n01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:59,391\nBut it uses What is called,\n\n1372\n01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:03,504\n802.1Q VLAN Tagging.\n\n1373\n01:12:03,504 --> 01:12:09,220\nAll right, 802.1Q VLAN Tagging\n\n1374\n01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,005\nis the long name for what most of\nus just call .1Q trunking, right?\n\n1375\n01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:16,830\n802.1Q is an IEEE standard.\n\n1376\n01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:22,180\nSo it's actually IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging.\n\n1377\n01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:27,050\nAnd what it is, is an open standard\nthat anybody vendor can support and\n\n1378\n01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,080\nalmost all of them do, that says.\n\n1379\n01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,240\nWhen I send a Piece of data,\n\n1380\n01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:36,100\na frame, out of a port that's a trunk,\nstick a little extra data,\n\n1381\n01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:41,460\nstick a tag in there that says\nthis belongs on VLAN number x.\n\n1382\n01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,520\nRight, so\nwe always have a little extra room.\n\n1383\n01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,560\nOne of the things I\nmentioned is that a frame\n\n1384\n01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,430\nhas a maximum size of 1,518 bytes, right?\n\n1385\n01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:59,650\nBut that most operating systems\nactually just do 1,500 okay.\n\n1386\n01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:02,810\nSo why do they just do 1500\nif they could do 1518?\n\n1387\n01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:07,940\nAnd the reason is they leave\na little room in the frame\n\n1388\n01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,780\nin case we need to insert data.\n\n1389\n01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,340\nInsert data like with an 802.1qvlan tag.\n\n1390\n01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,910\n>> Yup.\n>> So that's a part of\n\n1391\n01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:18,240\nthe protocol that's kinda\nbuilt into the system.\n\n1392\n01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,820\nIt's something that a lot of the vendors\nout there have thought about.\n\n1393\n01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,600\nSo Windows Linus, Mac OSX,\nthey leave that extra room\n\n1394\n01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,650\nknowing that our switch vendors\nmight need to insert some tags.\n\n1395\n01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:31,390\nAnd this tagging process is\nhow we can identify that.\n\n1396\n01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:35,580\nSo we can build a trunk between our\nswitches that is then able to carry\n\n1397\n01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,170\ntraffic from VLAn 1 and able to carry\ntraffic from VLAN 2 and it's really cool.\n\n1398\n01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,960\nAnd you get a lot of flexibility.\n\n1399\n01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,380\nI have set this up for\na number of companies.\n\n1400\n01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,510\nWe do it right here in our own building.\n\n1401\n01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:48,230\nAny time you have more than one\nswitch you are going to need a trunk.\n\n1402\n01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,800\n>> The only thing to remember is for\n\n1403\n01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,440\nus as well\n>> When we do these trunk ports,\n\n1404\n01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,660\nwe want to make sure that we provide\nas much bandwidth as we can.\n\n1405\n01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,480\nWe want to make sure that it's\nat least a fast ethernet port.\n\n1406\n01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,710\nIf you find an old switch that\nhas an ethernet port on it.\n\n1407\n01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:04,388\n>> Which would be a ten megabit port.\n\n1408\n01:14:04,388 --> 01:14:05,700\n>> Which would be a ten megabit port,\n\n1409\n01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,610\nyou're probably not going to find\nthe performance that you want.\n\n1410\n01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,980\nSo you want to make sure that trunking is\ndone at least on a fast ethernet cord.\n\n1411\n01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,390\n>> Yeah, now, it'll do it.\n\n1412\n01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can trunk over a ten megaport.\n\n1413\n01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,400\nIt's just ,think about what you're doing,\nright.\n\n1414\n01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,745\nWe're combining the traffic\nfrom more than one VLAN, so it-\n\n1415\n01:14:21,745 --> 01:14:23,515\n>> In this topology here VLAN 1 and\n\n1416\n01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:27,865\nVLAN 2 are going to be competing for\naccess on this one wire.\n\n1417\n01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:32,635\nNow, when we turn on the tagging\nwhat happens is if traffic for\n\n1418\n01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,510\nVLAN 2 is generated it's gonna\ntravel over to this port.\n\n1419\n01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,920\nThe switch is going to add a tag.\n\n1420\n01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,540\nIt punches in a little tag that says VLAN\n2, sends it along to the other side.\n\n1421\n01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:48,300\nThe other switch receives it, strips off\nthe tag and says, okay, you're on VLAN 2.\n\n1422\n01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,425\nIt removes the tag, and then sends\nthe traffic over to these ports.\n\n1423\n01:14:52,425 --> 01:14:53,100\nPorts.\n\n1424\n01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,010\nSo the end units, the PCs that are plugged\nin, they have no idea this happened,\n\n1425\n01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:01,390\nit's completely invisible to them,\nbut the switches knew about it,\n\n1426\n01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:05,020\nthey added the tag, they removed the tag,\nand the traffic moved along.\n\n1427\n01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:05,950\nYep all right.\n\n1428\n01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:09,060\nThe configuration for this is super easy.\n\n1429\n01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,650\nAll right.\nLet me show you how it's done.\n\n1430\n01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:14,030\nLet me get back into this switch.\n\n1431\n01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:14,530\nHere we go.\n\n1432\n01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,790\nSo, I've already done it for\nport 48 on this switch.\n\n1433\n01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:20,180\nBut let me show you like on port 47.\n\n1434\n01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:25,290\nLet's say I was gonna uplink port 47\nto another switch Switch, all right?\n\n1435\n01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:28,590\nWhat I would do is I would\nget into port fa0/47, I\n\n1436\n01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:39,340\nwould say switchport trunk\nencapsulation dot1q, all right?\n\n1437\n01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:43,710\nI'm going to tell it that I'm\ngoing to do 802.1 trunking and\n\n1438\n01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:47,010\nthen I say switchport mode trunk.\n\n1439\n01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,030\nThat tells it to make this\nport a trunk and off we go.\n\n1440\n01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,350\nHopefully the other end is a trunk too.\n\n1441\n01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,740\n>> As long as both ends are trunks,\nwe're pretty much okay.\n\n1442\n01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,800\n>> So the nice thing is we can do this.\n\n1443\n01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,730\nNow, there's some other things that\nare gonna go on in the background,\n\n1444\n01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:07,350\nwe're gonna worry about that\non another later show here.\n\n1445\n01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:10,930\nBut for us here,\nyou see how simple the actual tag is.\n\n1446\n01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,400\nThe key is to remember the words here,\nespecially on the commands.\n\n1447\n01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:20,230\nIf they ask you to set up a thicker trunk,\nit's for us gonna be .1q trunking.\n\n1448\n01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,830\nThat's gonna be the key here.\n\n1449\n01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:24,240\nAnd don't forget the word\nencapsulation for us as well.\n\n1450\n01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,790\nSo switchportturnkencapsulation.1q.\n\n1451\n01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:33,370\n>> There is another encapsulation type\nwhich Ronnie is getting at which is ISL or\n\n1452\n01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,980\ninterswitch length.\n\n1453\n01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,120\nISL is an old Cisco protocol,\nit's proprietary.\n\n1454\n01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:44,080\nIt used to have some advantages over dot\none q, it doesn't anymore and so dot one\n\n1455\n01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,280\nq used to only do VLAN 1 through 1024\nwhereas ISL would go all the way to 4094.\n\n1456\n01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,790\nNow .1q goes all the way also.\n\n1457\n01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,930\nSo there is no point\nin using ISL any more.\n\n1458\n01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,650\nThere used to be.\n\n1459\n01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:57,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is there,\n\n1460\n01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:02,025\nyou won't see it on the exam, so just be\naware that that's why I had to tell it,\n\n1461\n01:17:02,025 --> 01:17:06,590\n.1q, even though that's effectively\nthe only one we'll see on the exam.\n\n1462\n01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,090\nYep.\n\n1463\n01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,930\nNow there is another one,\nwhich is negotiate.\n\n1464\n01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,870\nLet's talk a little bit about that.\n\n1465\n01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:19,495\nWhen we say negotiate, that says,\noh it's mad because I've hard set it.\n\n1466\n01:17:19,495 --> 01:17:22,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That says that it will talk to\n\n1467\n01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,600\nthe other side and\nfigure out what's best, right?\n\n1468\n01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,640\nand so\nif the other side only supports ISL,\n\n1469\n01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,500\nor only supports .1Q,\nwell negotiate and figure it out.\n\n1470\n01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,670\n>> Yeah this is a way that the switches\ncan automatically do it without you or\n\n1471\n01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,940\nme really needing to\nactually figure this out.\n\n1472\n01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,570\nNow you might say, well why in\nthe world would we ever do that?\n\n1473\n01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:43,075\nWell remember that A lot of people may not\nactually be wanting to learn how to do\n\n1474\n01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:48,700\nCC&A, but because you are, because\nyou are, this is what we want to do.\n\n1475\n01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,170\nNormally the best practice\nin terms of trunking\n\n1476\n01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:56,290\nIs to not allow the idea\nof any automatic stuff.\n\n1477\n01:17:56,290 --> 01:18:00,030\nWe want to hard set it in there, so\nthat we know that this is a trunk.\n\n1478\n01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:06,130\nSo in the idea of the negotiation, if you\nactually do connect to another switch,\n\n1479\n01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:11,200\nusing a crossover cable, generally what\nwe're gonna actually end up with here\n\n1480\n01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,510\nis that the other side is going to say.\n\n1481\n01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,490\nI want to become a trunk.\n\n1482\n01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,750\nYour side is gonna say I\nwant to become a trunk too.\n\n1483\n01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:19,650\nAnd so they will negotiate and\nthey'll both actually end up trunking.\n\n1484\n01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:20,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n1485\n01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:24,600\nAnd CISCO switches manufacture\nprior till about three years ago.\n\n1486\n01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,580\nMost of them did do what's\ncalled dynamic trunking.\n\n1487\n01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,320\nThat mean they were ready build\nup a trunk at a drop of a hat.\n\n1488\n01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,520\nAnd attackers really exploited that.\n\n1489\n01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,860\nAnd so newer Cisco switches\ndon't do that by default.\n\n1490\n01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,210\nBut you can configure it.\n\n1491\n01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:43,870\nThey call it DTP, dynamic trunking\nprotocol, where you can set a switchport.\n\n1492\n01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,500\nActually, I don't know why I\njust got out of that port,\n\n1493\n01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,100\ncuz I'm gonna need it anyway.\n\n1494\n01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,880\nWell, so you've got switchport mode, and\n\n1495\n01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,500\nwe can say switchport mode access and\nthat makes this an access port.\n\n1496\n01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,100\nThat means we carry traffic from one VLAN,\nand it's usually a PC or\n\n1497\n01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,410\na router on the other end of that cable.\n\n1498\n01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:03,660\nSwitchport mode trunk means it's a switch\n\n1499\n01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,380\non the other end of that cable\nthat we wanna carry every VLAN.\n\n1500\n01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,380\nSo those are the two modes\nthat we use the most.\n\n1501\n01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,960\nAccess for one VLAN Trunk for\nall the VLANs.\n\n1502\n01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,680\n>> Right.\n\n1503\n01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,240\n>> But there's also dynamic.\n\n1504\n01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,220\n>> There you go.\n\n1505\n01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:23,940\n>> If we say, switchport mode dynamic,\nthat says we can be access or trunk.\n\n1506\n01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,750\nThat we'll negotiate it\nout with the other side.\n\n1507\n01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,930\nWhatever the other side says,\nwill do, okay?\n\n1508\n01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:35,570\nWhen you go dynamic, that means that\nyou'll try and figure it out, okay?\n\n1509\n01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,890\nAnd there's actually two modes to that,\nauto and desirable.\n\n1510\n01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:44,965\nAuto says that if we're going to become\na trunk, the other side has to ask us.\n\n1511\n01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:48,285\nIf the other side asks us\nto become a trunk, we will.\n\n1512\n01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:50,533\nOtherwise, we'll default\nto an access port.\n\n1513\n01:19:50,533 --> 01:19:53,365\nAnd that's what a lot of the newer\nCISCO switches are set to.\n\n1514\n01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:58,322\nThe older ones were set to desirable And\nthat says when a link comes up,\n\n1515\n01:19:58,322 --> 01:20:01,160\nwe will actively try to become a trunk.\n\n1516\n01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,310\nWe want to be a trunk, but\n\n1517\n01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:05,700\nif the other side says no,\nwe'll become an access point.\n\n1518\n01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,230\n>> It's neat that the technology is.\n\n1519\n01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,790\n>> Now it's starting to help\nus out a little bit better,\n\n1520\n01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,260\nby defaulting to the safer mode.\n\n1521\n01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:18,200\n>> Now, one of the things we\ncover on the security show, and\n\n1522\n01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,300\nwhen we do the CCNA security\nshow we'll cover it there too,\n\n1523\n01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,540\nis, it's a good idea not to\ndo anything automatic, right?\n\n1524\n01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:28,190\n>> Because if a hacker can gain access to\na trunk port, they've got access to all\n\n1525\n01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,900\nyour VLAN's so I make it a rule of thumb\nto never use this, to always statically\n\n1526\n01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:38,270\ndefine, manually define whether you\nwanna be a trunk or an access port.\n\n1527\n01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,659\nAnd that's what I did when I said I\nmessed with port 48, what I meant was.\n\n1528\n01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,980\n>> That I had hard set that.\n\n1529\n01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,040\nAnd so we look at Port 48,\nsee all I've done,\n\n1530\n01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,810\nswitchboard trunk encapsulation.1q,\nswitchboard mode trunk.\n\n1531\n01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,630\nRight?\nThat has now hard set.\n\n1532\n01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:59,620\nAnd I could actually go one more\nstep if I really wanted to and and\n\n1533\n01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:04,108\nI could say switch port no negotiate.\n\n1534\n01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:06,970\n>> And this means don't even try.\n\n1535\n01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:11,260\nDon't even try to use any type\nof dynamic in protocol at all.\n\n1536\n01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,250\nDo what What I tell him to do.\n\n1537\n01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:16,470\n>> And if somebody else tries to negotiate\nwith us we'll just ignore it instead of\n\n1538\n01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,240\nresponding back and\n\n1539\n01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,720\nsaying we don't negotiate,\nhere we just completely ignore him.\n\n1540\n01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,350\nSo that is absolutely hard set.\n\n1541\n01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,250\nThis port will be a trunk.\n\n1542\n01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:30,680\nOr I will say switchport mode access,\nswitchport\n\n1543\n01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,990\naccess VLAN, and whatever VLAN number,\nfollowed by switchport no negotiate.\n\n1544\n01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:40,310\nSo for example, my laptop,\nwhich is on, what am I on?\n\n1545\n01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,230\nPort 2?\n\n1546\n01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,670\nIf i wanted to say switchport mode access,\n\n1547\n01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:51,690\nswitchport access VLAN 2.\n\n1548\n01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:55,560\nAnd switch port no negotiate, oops.\n\n1549\n01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,270\nWhich I abbreviated.\n\n1550\n01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:56,790\nSorry.\n\n1551\n01:21:56,790 --> 01:22:01,160\nIf we take a look at that.\n\n1552\n01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:06,280\nSwitchport access VLAN 2 Switchport\nmode access, switchport nonegotiate.\n\n1553\n01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,120\nThat hard sets it as an access port.\n\n1554\n01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,230\nIt will only operate on vlan 2.\n\n1555\n01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:13,370\nNo other VLAN is allowed\nto cross that wire.\n\n1556\n01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:17,845\nIt's not nice and locked down, which is\nthe opposite Instead of what I did on 47,\n\n1557\n01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:19,995\nwhere I locked it down as a trunk.\n\n1558\n01:22:19,995 --> 01:22:22,505\nOr actually I guess I should show,\nlet me pull up the two examples.\n\n1559\n01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:26,575\nSo here's a desktop, and here's a trunk.\n\n1560\n01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:29,515\nBoth are hard set,\nnot allowing negotiation.\n\n1561\n01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:31,783\nThis is the way to do it.\n\n1562\n01:22:31,783 --> 01:22:35,425\nSo in real life land,\nthis is the way to do it.\n\n1563\n01:22:35,425 --> 01:22:40,700\nOn the exam, you want to know both ways\nbecause, well, it can show up on the exam.\n\n1564\n01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,860\nThe dynamic stuff, that's really\ndesigned for small office, home office,\n\n1565\n01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:47,060\npeople who don't want to deal with it,\nthe hard set stuff.\n\n1566\n01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:50,175\nThat's how you do it in any enterprise,\ncorporate environment, or whatever.\n\n1567\n01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:52,350\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n1568\n01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,401\nYep.\n>> All right. Right. So Ronnie,\n\n1569\n01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,781\nthat's a pretty good run on topics there.\nLet's see.\n\n1570\n01:22:55,781 --> 01:22:58,665\nThat was DTP and auto negotiation.\n\n1571\n01:22:58,665 --> 01:23:00,755\nWe've tackled VLAN's.\n\n1572\n01:23:00,755 --> 01:23:01,945\n>> Great program, yeah.\n\n1573\n01:23:01,945 --> 01:23:05,005\n>> We are doing pretty good\non the switching process.\n\n1574\n01:23:05,005 --> 01:23:07,385\nSo let's stop here.\n\n1575\n01:23:07,385 --> 01:23:08,048\n>> Okay.\n>> When we get back,\n\n1576\n01:23:08,048 --> 01:23:09,585\nwe're actually a little bit ahead,\naren't we?\n\n1577\n01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:12,580\n>> Yes.\n>> Shoot.\n\n1578\n01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:15,297\nThe next thing starts to dive\noff into the router side,\n\n1579\n01:23:15,297 --> 01:23:17,270\nwhich I wanted to hold off on.\n\n1580\n01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,880\nSounds good to me.\n\n1581\n01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,850\n>> You know,\nI think that pretty much tackled it.\n\n1582\n01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,800\nCan you think of any other switch\ntopics that we need to tackle\n\n1583\n01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,590\naside from inter VLAN routing?\n\n1584\n01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,810\n>> Nope.\nI think that that's all that's left is\n\n1585\n01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:29,100\ninter VLAN routing.\n\n1586\n01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,900\n>> Yeah, you know, let's do this.\n\n1587\n01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,510\nLet's stop here.\n\n1588\n01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,670\nWhen we get back we can\ntackle port security.\n\n1589\n01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,210\n>> Nice!\n>> A little bit of switch security stuff.\n\n1590\n01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:37,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n1591\n01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,350\n>> That is way down on the objectives but\nit ties in with the switches, so\n\n1592\n01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,130\nthis is a good time to cover.\n\n1593\n01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:42,510\n>> Covered, I think.\n\n1594\n01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:46,290\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1595\n01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:48,250\nAlright so lets stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n1596\n01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,280\nAnd when we get back,\nwe'll dive into some switch security.\n\n1597\n01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,520\nIt will be a good time,\nwe'll see you then.\n\n1598\n01:23:52,520 --> 01:24:00,150\n[SOUND].\n\n1599\n01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:01,502\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n1600\n01:24:01,502 --> 01:24:06,353\nwelcome back everybody we've tackled\nmost of our advanced switching,\n\n1601\n01:24:06,353 --> 01:24:11,441\nwe actually moved through some of it\na little more smoothly than I expected so\n\n1602\n01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:16,631\nwe're gonna take on a little bit extra\ntoday and tackle the switch security.\n\n1603\n01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:21,572\nAnd I'm kind of glad because earlier I\nthink it was me that made a comment and\n\n1604\n01:24:21,572 --> 01:24:24,789\nI said you really wouldn't\nwant to have more or,\n\n1605\n01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:29,270\nyou really wouldn't want to\nstatically assign a MAC address.\n\n1606\n01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,150\n>> And then I said, well,\nthere is one scenario, but\n\n1607\n01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,760\nwe'll get to it in the security section.\n\n1608\n01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,780\nWell, that section is now, so\nlet's talk a little bit about security.\n\n1609\n01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,500\n>> Right.\n\n1610\n01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,870\nNow, and switch port security here,\nwe wanna make sure,\n\n1611\n01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,430\nespecially because we have so\nmany ports that what we can do\n\n1612\n01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:50,060\nis ensure that the ports are gonna\nbehave the way that we want to.\n\n1613\n01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:54,110\nSometimes what can happen especially\nwith so many different things going on.\n\n1614\n01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:58,970\nIs that somebody could take a laptop\nbe able to plug directly in.\n\n1615\n01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,950\nAnd now gain access switch.\n\n1616\n01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:05,680\nAnd everything's not configured the way\nthat we want to they may now be able to\n\n1617\n01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,710\nget a MAC address on the switch and then\nthey may be able to configure the switch.\n\n1618\n01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:13,040\nSo you want to be able to control that.\n\n1619\n01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:17,140\n>> And you see it a lot, no matter how\nwell your network was designed on day one.\n\n1620\n01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,880\nOver the years people move offices,\n\n1621\n01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,430\nfurniture gets moved one\nof the universities here,\n\n1622\n01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:28,010\nI'd seen a situation where you'd walk into\ntheir lobby, and right there by the seats\n\n1623\n01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:30,480\nwhere the people waiting in the lobby\nwould sit there were network jacks.\n\n1624\n01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,330\nAnd that was because it used to be office\nspace but they had moved the offices\n\n1625\n01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:38,020\nout of there and turned it into a waiting\nroom, and so an attacker could walk right\n\n1626\n01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:41,190\ninto a waiting room, where you could sit\nall day and nobody would question you, and\n\n1627\n01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:44,500\nplug right into the jack and\npotentially gain access to the network.\n\n1628\n01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,560\nNow, they had secured the port,\nso it wasn't a risk.\n\n1629\n01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,330\nAnd that's what we're gonna\ntalk about now, right?\n\n1630\n01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,510\nNow before we get into\nthe technology in the switch,\n\n1631\n01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:55,980\nlet me just mention the best way to secure\na port is to earn the plug-in, right?\n\n1632\n01:25:55,980 --> 01:26:00,350\nIf the port is not supposed to be getting\nused, you should unplug the cable.\n\n1633\n01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,460\nAnd I'm not talking about\nthe cable coming out of the wall.\n\n1634\n01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,480\nI'm talking about the cable\nthat runs to your switch.\n\n1635\n01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,680\nIf you're not plugged into the switch\nyou're not gonna be able to attack\n\n1636\n01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,250\nthe network.\n\n1637\n01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,990\n>> So physical security if by far\none of the biggest things we can do.\n\n1638\n01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:16,940\nNot being able to allow\nsomebody to plug directly\n\n1639\n01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,720\ninto the wall jack by simply\nremoving the patch cable.\n\n1640\n01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,190\nSecondly, don't forget,\n\n1641\n01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:25,630\nalso just not allowing other people\naccess directly to the switch itself\n\n1642\n01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:29,820\nis a kind of big thing that we\nshould actually thing about as well.\n\n1643\n01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1644\n01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,650\nSo, one way that we can lock\nthings down in the switch itself,\n\n1645\n01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:37,760\nis we can control what PCs\nare allowed to plug in to what ports,\n\n1646\n01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,870\nand we can do it based on the MAC address.\n\n1647\n01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:46,000\nWe can statically assign somebody's MAC\naddress to a port, and set the switch so\n\n1648\n01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,510\nthat if it sees anybody else's MAC\naddress, Just shut off the port, right.\n\n1649\n01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:53,760\nAnd that way our authorized PC,\nif it's plugged in it's happy.\n\n1650\n01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,450\nBut if somebody else plugs in\nthey're not gonna be able to get in.\n\n1651\n01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,970\nNow pro's and cons of doing this, right.\n\n1652\n01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:03,320\nSo let's say you statically\nassign your Mac addresses and\n\n1653\n01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:08,090\nsomebody has their, their laptop dies,\nthey do a warranty call and and\n\n1654\n01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,305\nDell or HP or\nwhoever replaces the motherboard, right?\n\n1655\n01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:11,790\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> When they replace it,\n\n1656\n01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,830\nthe Mac address of that unit just changed.\n\n1657\n01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,710\nNow, they're not gonna be able to plug in.\n\n1658\n01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:20,130\nSo you're gonna get a help desk ticket\nevery time a network card changes or\n\n1659\n01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,630\na new computer comes in or whatever.\n\n1660\n01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,880\nSo there's a lot more\nadministrative effort involved.\n\n1661\n01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,325\nBut, you do get a degree of security.\n\n1662\n01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:27,420\n>> Right.\n\n1663\n01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,670\nAnd I say a degree because\nMAC addresses can be spoofed.\n\n1664\n01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:36,910\nSomebody can fake a MAC address, but it\nwould definitely deter just your average.\n\n1665\n01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:40,530\nSomebody brings their kid in to work\nwith them one day and their kid tries.\n\n1666\n01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:44,930\nJump on the network, you know,\nstop that kind of thing.\n\n1667\n01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:48,850\nLet's take a look, first just\nstatically assigning a MAC address.\n\n1668\n01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:52,520\nAnd then we'll show some of the ways to\nsave time and how it all kind of works.\n\n1669\n01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,280\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n1670\n01:27:54,280 --> 01:28:00,224\n>> All right, so right now,\nI have a router plugged into port 1.\n\n1671\n01:28:00,224 --> 01:28:04,287\nLet's take a look at port number 1.\n\n1672\n01:28:04,287 --> 01:28:07,290\nIf I take a look like port\nnumber one on the switch.\n\n1673\n01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,980\nI've got it on Vlan 2 so\nI'm gonna put it on Vlan 1 so\n\n1674\n01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,040\nit's a nice default configuration.\n\n1675\n01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,030\nI don't want anything special here.\n\n1676\n01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,730\nTo make this more confusing\nthan it should be, so whoops.\n\n1677\n01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:22,570\nIf I get in the right port that'll help.\n\n1678\n01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:25,060\nSo I'm just gonna put to back to vlan 1.\n\n1679\n01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:30,200\nOh, [LAUGH]\nswitchport access vlan 1,\n\n1680\n01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,370\nthat's what I want.\n\n1681\n01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:32,870\nAll right.\n\n1682\n01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,790\nSo now if I take a look at it,\nthere we go.\n\n1683\n01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,828\nNice default configuration.\n\n1684\n01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:41,050\nfa0/1 has no Special\ncommands attached to it.\n\n1685\n01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:41,980\nAlright?\n\n1686\n01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,445\nI can take a MAC address like\nthe mac address of that router.\n\n1687\n01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:45,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1688\n01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:47,120\nI can statically assign it to this port.\n\n1689\n01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:47,790\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1690\n01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:52,460\nNow if I do that even if I unplug\nthe router the mac address is\n\n1691\n01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,680\nstill assigned to that port so\nit's always gonna show up there and\n\n1692\n01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,220\nif I move it to another port\nit's gonna cause problems.\n\n1693\n01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,850\nSo, we don't want to just go and\nmodify the MAC address table.\n\n1694\n01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:04,720\nWe want the switch to know that\nwe're doing this for security sake.\n\n1695\n01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,370\n>> Right.\n>> So Cisco switches implement what's\n\n1696\n01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,800\ncalled switchboard security, and\n\n1697\n01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,270\nit allows us to define the MAC addresses\non the port, and to statically apply that.\n\n1698\n01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:18,880\nNow, if you have a big network if you\nhave a network with thousands of PCs,\n\n1699\n01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,890\nyou don't wanna have to go around and\ncatalogue all the MAC addresses and\n\n1700\n01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,920\nwrite them down and map them to a port.\n\n1701\n01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,870\nIt would take forever.\n\n1702\n01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:29,830\nSo there's a nice little system\nin here called sticky MACs.\n\n1703\n01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:33,430\nAnd sticky MACs lets the switch see\nthe MAC addresses on there right now,\n\n1704\n01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:35,139\nrecord it, and\nmake it part of our configuration.\n\n1705\n01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:39,900\nSo really the whole idea behind\nus using the MAC address here,\n\n1706\n01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,090\nis to limit the access to that port,\nreally to that MAC address or\n\n1707\n01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:48,670\neven just to a few MAC addresses,\ndepending on what we want to do.\n\n1708\n01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:53,320\nSo here, what Don's actually\ndone was search port FA/1\n\n1709\n01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,280\nis he's turned on port security with\nthe very first command I had she entered.\n\n1710\n01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,650\nActually with the-\n>> I got an error, right.\n\n1711\n01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,650\nI forgot something important.\n\n1712\n01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:06,400\nPort security is for access ports only.\n\n1713\n01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,560\nAnd this switch defaults to dynamic ports.\n\n1714\n01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,460\nPorts that can be accessed or trunk.\n\n1715\n01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,240\nSo, when I did a switch port,\nport security, it griped at me.\n\n1716\n01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,260\nIt said command rejected.\n\n1717\n01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,660\nIt's a dynamic port.\n\n1718\n01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,310\nSo I just had to turn around and\nstatically assign it and say,\n\n1719\n01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,700\nswitchport mode access.\n\n1720\n01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,730\nI forced it to be an access port,\nnot trunk port.\n\n1721\n01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,190\nAnd now I can turn that on.\n\n1722\n01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:27,070\nYou wouldn't want port\nsecurity on a trunk.\n\n1723\n01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,930\n>> No.\n>> Cuz a trunk is gonna carry\n\n1724\n01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:32,180\ntons of Mac addresses, so\nit's not useful at all there.\n\n1725\n01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,760\nSo, what I just did is I\nturned on port security.\n\n1726\n01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,200\nSo, What did that do?\n\n1727\n01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:38,990\nNothing, really.\n\n1728\n01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:42,450\nIt just enabled the security commands for\nme to use.\n\n1729\n01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:45,910\nNow I can go in and I can say things like,\n\n1730\n01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:52,630\nswitchport port-security mac-address and\nif I know the MAC address.\n\n1731\n01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:57,790\nI can manually put it in or\nI can say, sticky, which says\n\n1732\n01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:02,020\nlook at whatever MAC address is on this\nport right now and map it in, all right?\n\n1733\n01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,650\nSo if you know the MAC address, by all\nmeans, hard set it and there you go.\n\n1734\n01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:09,630\nA lot of times it's easier, though, just\nto say sticky It'll look at whatever Mac\n\n1735\n01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:13,520\naddress is on the port and\nmap that into the configuration.\n\n1736\n01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,050\n>> The next configuration that we have\nto do here is the idea of the number\n\n1737\n01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:20,060\nof Mac addresses that we want\nthat port to also learn as well,\n\n1738\n01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,800\nnow we can actually limit it to one, but\nwe can actually have more than that.\n\n1739\n01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,820\nNow Don, I don't know.\n\n1740\n01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:28,310\nIs there an actual maximum number\nthat we can put on a particular\n\n1741\n01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,230\nport that you know about?\n\n1742\n01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,410\n>> You know I don't know\nwhat the highest number is.\n\n1743\n01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,200\n>> Yeah I don't either.\n\n1744\n01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:32,930\n>> Oh apparently 6,144.\n\n1745\n01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:36,520\n>> Well, [LAUGH] I can have\n6,144 different MAC addresses\n\n1746\n01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,600\non that one particular port there.\n\n1747\n01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,920\nBut a lot of times if you know that only\none computer is supposed to be on this\n\n1748\n01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,370\nyou might limit it to\nthat single MAC address.\n\n1749\n01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,440\n>> If we're trying to be hardcore, right?\n\n1750\n01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,750\nAnd make it so\nthat only this one PC can communicate,\n\n1751\n01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,940\nthen we wanna set this maximum to one.\n\n1752\n01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:56,620\nMaximum of one means, look at that MAC\naddress that's already there, right,\n\n1753\n01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,430\nwe did the sticky command.\n\n1754\n01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:02,040\nSo there's one MAC address already there\nIf any other Mac address shows up,\n\n1755\n01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:02,790\ndo something.\n\n1756\n01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:03,790\nWe haven't said that yet.\n\n1757\n01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,390\nWe'll get to that.\n\n1758\n01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:07,040\nYou might wanna set this higher.\n\n1759\n01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,530\nIf you want to allow two Mac addresses or\nwhatever, just so\n\n1760\n01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:14,355\nyou can have it where somebody\nChanged out a machine and it's okay.\n\n1761\n01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:15,275\nThen you can bump it up.\n\n1762\n01:32:15,275 --> 01:32:18,115\nBut in a high security environment\nwe normally want to set this to one.\n\n1763\n01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:19,635\nWe'll only allow one MAC address.\n\n1764\n01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:23,395\nNow if we hadn't done\nthe sticky MAC up here.\n\n1765\n01:32:23,395 --> 01:32:27,360\nThen what it would do, is it would say,\nI would allow one MAC address, and\n\n1766\n01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,370\nI don't care what MAC address it is.\n\n1767\n01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:29,880\nIt can be any MAC address, right?\n\n1768\n01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,840\nThat's useful if you just wanna stop\npeople from plugging in switches, or hubs,\n\n1769\n01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,520\nor wireless access points, right?\n\n1770\n01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,600\nThat'll limit it so that only one\nperson at a time can talk on the port.\n\n1771\n01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,260\nIf somebody plugs in a switch,\n\n1772\n01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:44,530\nthe first person can talk,\nthe other people can't, right?\n\n1773\n01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:46,660\nSo that's useful if\nthat's what your goal is.\n\n1774\n01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:50,220\nBut if you're trying to really\nlock this down to a single PC,\n\n1775\n01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,940\nyou'll say switch port\nport security maximum one.\n\n1776\n01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:58,660\nThat locks it to one MAC address and then\nswitch port port security MAC address and\n\n1777\n01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:02,420\nthen either manually put the address in or\nsay sticky which will make it learn.\n\n1778\n01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,070\nAnd you know what?\n\n1779\n01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:04,840\nLet's make sure that's working.\n\n1780\n01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:09,155\nIf I get out of my configuration,\nand I do a show mac\n\n1781\n01:33:09,155 --> 01:33:14,858\naddress-table, and\nI filter it to an interface,\n\n1782\n01:33:14,858 --> 01:33:20,700\ninterface fa0/1,\nif I look at that interface,\n\n1783\n01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:25,600\nsee how it's got the MAC address of\nthe router and it said dynamic before.\n\n1784\n01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,600\nNow it says static.\n\n1785\n01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,830\nNow I didn't manually type\nthis MAC address in, but\n\n1786\n01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:35,820\nit became static because\nwe used that sticky option.\n\n1787\n01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:40,246\nAnd if I look at the config for\ninterface FA0/1,\n\n1788\n01:33:40,246 --> 01:33:44,360\nhere's the sticky command that I ran, and\n\n1789\n01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,280\nthen here's the sticky\ncommand that was added.\n\n1790\n01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,570\nIt saw that first MAC address, and\nnow it's part of my configuration.\n\n1791\n01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:55,540\nSo when I save my configuration\nat the end of the day,\n\n1792\n01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:00,770\nThat MAC address is now\npart of the configuration.\n\n1793\n01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:05,510\nIf I reboot the switch, it's still\nthere and if somebody plugs in and\n\n1794\n01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,420\ntheir MAC address doesn't match this,\n\n1795\n01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:11,590\nit would be a second address,\nwhich would exceed my maximum.\n\n1796\n01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:15,180\nSo there clear term about stickiest,\nremember, it's the first MAC address,\n\n1797\n01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:19,990\nwhich sends information in after it's been\nconfigured, that's it going to learn.\n\n1798\n01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,030\nNow if we set this to a maximum of two,\n\n1799\n01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,610\nthat means the first two\ndevices that plug in.\n\n1800\n01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,340\nThe third one, not going to happen.\n\n1801\n01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:31,670\n>> Now,\nI also ran switchport port-security\n\n1802\n01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,340\n>> Maximum one.\n\n1803\n01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,790\nNotice it's not here in the configure.\n\n1804\n01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:35,490\nWhat happened?\n\n1805\n01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:38,430\nWell maximum one is the default.\n\n1806\n01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,290\nSo I didn't really have to run that.\n\n1807\n01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:42,250\nI ran it so you guys would see it.\n\n1808\n01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,110\nIt doesn't show up here\nbecause it's the default.\n\n1809\n01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:47,440\nIf I did two two or five or\nten, it would show up.\n\n1810\n01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,410\nBut, one is the default.\n\n1811\n01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,160\n>> Even at this point.\n\n1812\n01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,540\nNow that we've got it configured to\nlearn the very first Mac address and\n\n1813\n01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:58,200\nwe've set the Mac's number,\nit's still not gonna do anything.\n\n1814\n01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:03,330\nIn other words, if I leave this and I set\nup, it learned about the Mac address.\n\n1815\n01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:08,580\nGuess what, I could probably still\nconnect and do other things here.\n\n1816\n01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,960\nBut what we need is\nsomething that says what?\n\n1817\n01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,660\nTrigger it.\n\n1818\n01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,340\n>> What to do.\n\n1819\n01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:15,360\n>> What to do if we actually\nhave this configured here.\n\n1820\n01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,840\nAnd so that's what Don has set next here.\n\n1821\n01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,350\n>> Yep.\nSo if we do a switchport port-security\n\n1822\n01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:25,970\nviolation, we can then pick one\nof three actions to take when a,\n\n1823\n01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,300\nwell when a violation occurs.\n\n1824\n01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,440\nSo if a second Mac address or\na Mac address that doesn't match\n\n1825\n01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,500\nthe one that's hard coded shows up,\nwhat do I do, okay?\n\n1826\n01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,380\nWell the three choices are protect,\nrestrict and shut down.\n\n1827\n01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:40,200\nProtect is the default, all right.\n\n1828\n01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:44,060\nWith protect, it actually doesn't relaly\ndo anything as far as the end user.\n\n1829\n01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,020\n>> Yeah.\n>> It lets that second Mac just get on and\n\n1830\n01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,520\ncommunicate or whatever.\n\n1831\n01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,480\nBut what protect does,\nis it creates a log entry.\n\n1832\n01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,435\nIt logs that that violation occurred,\nso that we know that it happened.\n\n1833\n01:35:54,435 --> 01:35:56,175\nBut then, it lets the violation happen.\n\n1834\n01:35:56,175 --> 01:35:58,105\nIt still lets them get out there and\ncommunicate.\n\n1835\n01:35:58,105 --> 01:36:00,678\nThis is a passive-agressive type thing.\n\n1836\n01:36:00,678 --> 01:36:02,604\nIt just logs it.\n\n1837\n01:36:02,604 --> 01:36:05,020\n>> Restrict kinda,\ndoes the same thing here.\n\n1838\n01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:08,502\nIt just doesn't keep the actual\nLog itself does it, Don.\n\n1839\n01:36:08,502 --> 01:36:10,871\n>> Well, restrict actually\ngoes a little bit further.\n\n1840\n01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:13,700\nIt does log, just like protect.\n\n1841\n01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:19,320\nBut, what restrict does is, it lets the\nfirst MAC address continue to communicate,\n\n1842\n01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,297\nbut any additional Mac address\nis not allowed to communicate.\n\n1843\n01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:23,970\n>> Okay.\n>> Let's say,\n\n1844\n01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:29,130\nan attacker brought in a hub and\nplugged it in between a PC in the wall.\n\n1845\n01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:32,120\nThe original PC would\nstill be able to talk.\n\n1846\n01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,925\nBut the hacker's machine would not.\n\n1847\n01:36:33,925 --> 01:36:34,540\n>> Uh-huh, there you go.\n\n1848\n01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,850\n>> Okay.\nSo restrict still allows the original\n\n1849\n01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:37,710\nmachine to function.\n\n1850\n01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:38,660\n>> Yeap, yeah.\n\n1851\n01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,680\n>> My favorite's the last one.\n\n1852\n01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n1853\n01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,890\nThis is the one that I pretty\nmuch use all the time.\n\n1854\n01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:46,770\nI really don't even consider the other\ntwo, is the idea of shut down.\n\n1855\n01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:51,180\nShut down means that if any other,\none besides the MAC\n\n1856\n01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,210\naddress that we have here is learned\nto actually shut the port off.\n\n1857\n01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,350\nSo we're actually tell it that hey,\n\n1858\n01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:02,190\nanother MAC address comes in,\nyou're going to manually turn that off.\n\n1859\n01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:06,020\nAnd we'd actually end up seeing it,\nit will say administratively shut down.\n\n1860\n01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,740\n>> Yeap.\nSo,\n\n1861\n01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,230\nbasically Cisco switches\nhave a neat little state,\n\n1862\n01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:16,200\nits called Error Disabled all right, and\nwhen they write it, it's EER Disable, so\n\n1863\n01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,450\nyou'll hear people call it air disable,\nbut it's actually short for error Disable.\n\n1864\n01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:25,630\nAnd, when a security violation occurs,\nthe port goes into Error Disable state.\n\n1865\n01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:28,730\nAlright, that means nobody can talk.\n\n1866\n01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:31,660\nWhen a security violation happens\nwhen we're in shutdown mode,\n\n1867\n01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,250\nit turns the port off.\n\n1868\n01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:37,300\nThe port will not come back on,\nuntil and Admin gets involved.\n\n1869\n01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:40,260\nYou can go and shut the port off and\nturn it back on again, and\n\n1870\n01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,635\nthat clears it out and\nthen it's able to function.\n\n1871\n01:37:43,635 --> 01:37:45,130\nSo,that's a great way to do it,\n\n1872\n01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:48,230\nbecause if a violation happens then\na Network Admin has to get involved.\n\n1873\n01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,730\nSomebody's got to call the help desk,\n\n1874\n01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,830\nyou get that warning verses not\ndoing that at all, just logging.\n\n1875\n01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:55,710\nWhere you might not see it for\na week that it happened,\n\n1876\n01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:58,880\ndepending on how often\nyou monitor your logs.\n\n1877\n01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,019\nAll right, so let's take a look at\nthat running configuration now.\n\n1878\n01:38:03,854 --> 01:38:09,186\nNotice that switchboard port security\nviolation shut down didn't show up,\n\n1879\n01:38:09,186 --> 01:38:11,655\nbecause it is also a default right.\n\n1880\n01:38:11,655 --> 01:38:14,235\nAnother default command, so\nit's not showing up in the Config.\n\n1881\n01:38:14,235 --> 01:38:16,640\nIf i'd picked one of\nthe other two it would.\n\n1882\n01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,730\nAll right.\n\n1883\n01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:20,590\nAnd because some of these are defaults and\naren't showing up, let's do this.\n\n1884\n01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:23,010\nI want everybody to see.\n\n1885\n01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:25,980\nLet me fire up old Notepad.\n\n1886\n01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:30,310\nAnd here we go.\n\n1887\n01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,710\nSo the commands that we ran,\n\n1888\n01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:35,140\nwe got switchboard mode access,\nswitchboard port-security.\n\n1889\n01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:37,670\nSwitch port, port security,\nMAC address, sticky.\n\n1890\n01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:44,440\nI also did switch port\nport-security maximum 1,\n\n1891\n01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:48,890\nand we also did Switch port,\n\n1892\n01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:52,581\nport dash security, violation shut down.\n\n1893\n01:38:52,581 --> 01:38:53,900\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1894\n01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:54,910\n>> There we go.\n\n1895\n01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:57,980\nThe U and I, they're so\nclose on the keyboard [LAUGH].\n\n1896\n01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:03,280\nAnyhow, it's a good thing we're\nnot regulated by the FCC.\n\n1897\n01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:09,940\nYou can only watch this episode after\n10 PM, when it's okay to use vulgarity.\n\n1898\n01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:11,550\nSo these are all the commands that I ran.\n\n1899\n01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,390\nJust remember that this guy right here,\n\n1900\n01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:17,470\nthe maximum,\nthat was considered a default.\n\n1901\n01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,510\nThis violation was a default.\n\n1902\n01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:23,420\nThis command here only shows up after\nthe first MAC address shows up.\n\n1903\n01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,590\nSo it may not show up right away on\na port that's unplugged or something.\n\n1904\n01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:28,160\n>> Right.\n>> So these are all the commands\n\n1905\n01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:28,780\nwe've run so far.\n\n1906\n01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:31,460\nHow do you know it's working, right?\n\n1907\n01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:38,930\nWell there's a nice little show command we\ncan use which is the show port-security.\n\n1908\n01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,665\nRight?\nActually let me write that on here,\n\n1909\n01:39:40,665 --> 01:39:42,530\nport-security.\n\n1910\n01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:47,100\nAnd what that show port-security does is\nit just gives you a list of all the ports\n\n1911\n01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:51,010\nthat have port security turned on and\nwhat their current status is.\n\n1912\n01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:52,260\nSo Fa0/1 has it turned on.\n\n1913\n01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,540\nIt's got a maximum address count of 1.\n\n1914\n01:39:55,540 --> 01:40:00,980\nIt currently has 1 MAC address cuz\nit's statically set and no violations.\n\n1915\n01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:03,100\nSo it hasn't had a violation yet.\n\n1916\n01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,670\nIt's just sitting there and it's happy.\n\n1917\n01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:07,110\nLet's cause a violation.\n\n1918\n01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,430\n>> Yeah.\nSounds good.\n\n1919\n01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:10,510\n>> Right now I've got the router\nplugged into that port.\n\n1920\n01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:12,240\nI'm gonna move my PC over to that port.\n\n1921\n01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,072\nMy PC has a different MAC address so\nthis will cause a violation.\n\n1922\n01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:20,365\nIf I can get the cable unplugged.\n\n1923\n01:40:20,365 --> 01:40:21,053\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1924\n01:40:21,053 --> 01:40:23,090\n>> There we go.\n\n1925\n01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,720\nAnd we gotta let it do its\nlittle loop detection first.\n\n1926\n01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,490\nSo we'll give it a second\nwhile it does that.\n\n1927\n01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:30,260\nAnd so it's coming up.\n\n1928\n01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:33,795\nRemember, the loop detection,\nby default, takes up to 30 seconds.\n\n1929\n01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:34,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1930\n01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:36,770\nwe haven't really dived into that yet.\n\n1931\n01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:40,840\nYou'll learn more about the loop\nprotection in the CCNA show.\n\n1932\n01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,720\nThere we go.\n\n1933\n01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,720\nSo the port came up and\nnotice I got a log message right there.\n\n1934\n01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,870\nError-disabled psecure,\nwhich is port security, violation.\n\n1935\n01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:53,070\nSecurity violation occurred,\ncaused by MAC address, and\n\n1936\n01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:55,260\nthere's the MAC address of my laptop,\nright, ends in 1770.\n\n1937\n01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:59,460\nLet's me know there's a violation and\nthe port just went down.\n\n1938\n01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,870\nIt shut the port down,\nso I cannot communicate.\n\n1939\n01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:05,540\nMy laptop can no longer\ncommunicate on the network,\n\n1940\n01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,100\nit actually never could\nin the first place.\n\n1941\n01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:08,100\nIt was stopped.\n\n1942\n01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,684\nThe instant it sent its first frame.\n\n1943\n01:41:10,684 --> 01:41:15,759\n>> And if you take a look at\nthe show interface command here,\n\n1944\n01:41:15,759 --> 01:41:18,207\nshow interface fa0/1.\n\n1945\n01:41:18,207 --> 01:41:19,957\n>> Yep.\n\n1946\n01:41:19,957 --> 01:41:20,920\nRight there.\n>> We can actually see\n\n1947\n01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,635\nwhat we're looking for as the very\nfirst line directly underneath it, and\n\n1948\n01:41:24,635 --> 01:41:29,235\nnotice that instead of seeing fast\nethernet is down, line protocol is down,\n\n1949\n01:41:29,235 --> 01:41:32,490\nyou also see some additional information\nwhich Don has highlighted there.\n\n1950\n01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:35,465\nError disabled is what we actually see\nhere and remember what that means.\n\n1951\n01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:37,510\nThat means an error has occurred.\n\n1952\n01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,740\nAnd was just able to because of zero,\n\n1953\n01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:43,440\nonce we do have that it means\nsomebody else has to get involved.\n\n1954\n01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,890\nNot only do we have to contact\nsomeone to get involved,\n\n1955\n01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:49,080\nthey must fix the issue first.\n\n1956\n01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:52,660\nSo, even if I were to go in, and this is\nkinda the first thing that really got me\n\n1957\n01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:55,190\nwhen I first started learning this right,\nI always heard\n\n1958\n01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:59,050\nall you have to do is actually shut\nthe port down and then turn it back on.\n\n1959\n01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:02,530\nWell, that happened, and the port\nlooked like it was coming back up,\n\n1960\n01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:04,120\nthen it immediately shut itself off Don.\n\n1961\n01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:05,800\n>> Yep, you gotta fix the problem.\n\n1962\n01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,980\n>> Gotta fix the problem.\n\n1963\n01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:09,780\nSo if I leave my laptop\nplugged into the port,\n\n1964\n01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:11,570\nit's just gonna violate again, right.\n\n1965\n01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:13,690\nAnd so it'll go right back into error.\n\n1966\n01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:16,960\nI can also run show port-security, and\n\n1967\n01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,090\nin the summary, now I can see I've\ngot a violation count of one.\n\n1968\n01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:25,110\nThat lets me know that fa0/1 did\nindeed have a violation and it's down.\n\n1969\n01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:29,330\nSo, one of things Ronnie mentioned was,\nif we want to fix the issue.\n\n1970\n01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:33,960\nThe way to reset an error disabled port,\nis to just go into configuration,\n\n1971\n01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,790\nget into the port, do a shut down.\n\n1972\n01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:38,330\nFollowed by a no shutdown.\n\n1973\n01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:40,720\nThat resets the port and\nthat brings it back up.\n\n1974\n01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,130\nNow, my laptop is still plugged in,\nso when I run that,\n\n1975\n01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:49,540\nit's gonna reset it to bring it up, but\nit's just gonna error right out again and\n\n1976\n01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:52,760\ngo back down, because my laptop\nis still plugged in, all right?\n\n1977\n01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,030\nThat's the easiest way to reset a port,\nthough it is very manual, right?\n\n1978\n01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:59,670\nAs an admin,\nI had to connect to the switch and do it.\n\n1979\n01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:02,370\nThat means that I'm aware\nthat the issue happened.\n\n1980\n01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:05,430\nI know that there was a violation and\nI'm acting on it.\n\n1981\n01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:07,120\n>> Oop, there it goes again.\n\n1982\n01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,316\n>> Now there is a way to\nautomatically reset the port.\n\n1983\n01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:11,189\nAll right.\n\n1984\n01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:14,240\nAnd it may be that you don't wanna\njust shut down the port forever,\n\n1985\n01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,885\ncuz then you have to go and do this.\n\n1986\n01:43:15,885 --> 01:43:17,910\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Maybe you only wanna shut it down for\n\n1987\n01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:18,620\nfive minutes.\n\n1988\n01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,310\n>> Right.\n>> Okay, you can have it\n\n1989\n01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:23,450\nwhere the port shuts down for\nfive minutes and then turns back on.\n\n1990\n01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:27,290\nIf the attacker is still plugged in, it'll\njust shut right back off again, right?\n\n1991\n01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:31,490\nBut if the good person is plugged back in,\nthe port will come up, and\n\n1992\n01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:34,540\nthey'll be able to function and\nyou didn't have to get involved in it.\n\n1993\n01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,330\nNow you still have a log message.\n\n1994\n01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,330\n>> All right.\n>> Your network is protected but\n\n1995\n01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:40,760\nyou still get a log message.\n\n1996\n01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,070\nSo, the way we do that is with what's\ncalled error recovery Cisco switches,\n\n1997\n01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,985\nand routers.\n\n1998\n01:43:46,985 --> 01:43:48,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But Cisco switches\n\n1999\n01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:48,830\nare where we really use it.\n\n2000\n01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:53,345\nThey have error recovery where we can\ndefine an interval of time to wait.\n\n2001\n01:43:53,345 --> 01:43:55,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Before bringing the port back online.\n\n2002\n01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:56,048\nAll right?\n\n2003\n01:43:56,048 --> 01:43:59,831\nAnd there's a number of things that\ncan cause the error disabled state.\n\n2004\n01:43:59,831 --> 01:44:00,552\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2005\n01:44:00,552 --> 01:44:02,223\n>> For the exam,\nwe only need to know about port security.\n\n2006\n01:44:02,223 --> 01:44:02,729\n>> Right.\n\n2007\n01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:04,980\n>> That's the only one that\nwe're involved in here.\n\n2008\n01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:08,360\nBasically in our config,\nif we get back to our global prompt,\n\n2009\n01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,670\nwe've got the error disabled command.\n\n2010\n01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:16,570\nAnd you'll see in here what we\ncan do detect and recovery, okay?\n\n2011\n01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:20,090\nDetect is how we see that\nan error occurred, and\n\n2012\n01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:22,550\nthen recovery is how we recover from it.\n\n2013\n01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:26,870\nAnd so\nI can say errordisable detect cause,\n\n2014\n01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:29,900\nand then you'll see all\nthe different ones in here.\n\n2015\n01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:33,420\nSecurity violation is\nthe one that we want, right?\n\n2016\n01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:34,400\nI think that's the only one we need.\n\n2017\n01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,270\nYep.\n\n2018\n01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:39,610\nAll right, so actually,\nwe do need the whole thing, don't we?\n\n2019\n01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:48,300\nShut down, and, okay there we go.\n\n2020\n01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:53,350\nSo, basically we're saying we want\nit to detect whenever a shutdown\n\n2021\n01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:57,290\nhappens caused by a security violation,\ncaused by port security, right?\n\n2022\n01:44:57,290 --> 01:45:03,480\nKind of a long command there, and\nthen we can say errdisable recovery and\n\n2023\n01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:09,760\nwe can specify the cause, so I'm gonna say\nbased on security violation, there you.\n\n2024\n01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,260\nThere it is.\n\n2025\n01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,690\nAnd then I can say the interval, and\n\n2026\n01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:19,260\nI can set it to a certain\namount of time in seconds.\n\n2027\n01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:22,080\nIf I want 5 minutes,\nwhat is that, 300 seconds?\n\n2028\n01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:23,740\nThere we go.\n\n2029\n01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:30,490\nLet me bring those commands back up,\njust so we can see that.\n\n2030\n01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,320\nThere we go.\n\n2031\n01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:36,950\nSo we did errdisable detect cause\nsecurity-violation shutdown vlan, right?\n\n2032\n01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:39,320\nSo looking for when a shutdown happens.\n\n2033\n01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:43,090\nAir disable recovery\ncaused security violation.\n\n2034\n01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:44,550\nIf it's a security violation.\n\n2035\n01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:47,484\nAnd I guess five minutes is the default\nbecause it didn't' make it in there.\n\n2036\n01:45:47,484 --> 01:45:51,810\nLet me pick a different interval\nmaybe we'll do 1 minute, right, so\n\n2037\n01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,540\nwe'll do 60 seconds.\n\n2038\n01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:59,110\nThere we go, you see\n\n2039\n01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:03,020\ndefault commands don't make it into the\nconfig but if you go with a non standard.\n\n2040\n01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:05,960\nSo 60 seconds is nonstandard,\nso it shows up right there.\n\n2041\n01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,210\nSo these three commands right here,\n\n2042\n01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:11,330\nthat makes the switch pick up\nwhen the violation happens.\n\n2043\n01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:14,540\nAnd if it sees it,\nit'll kick into recovery and\n\n2044\n01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:17,690\nafter 60 seconds it'll reset the port for\nyou.\n\n2045\n01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:20,110\nIf the violation is still there,\nit keeps it blocked.\n\n2046\n01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:23,630\nIf the violation is gone, it allows\nthe port to become healthy again.\n\n2047\n01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:25,420\n>> And this is very good\nespecially when you have,\n\n2048\n01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:27,370\nwell, hundreds of machines, right?\n\n2049\n01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:30,320\nAnd you don't have time a lot of times,\nthat you should go and fix all 100\n\n2050\n01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:35,120\nif they all go into violation at the same\ntime, so by allowing us to set this up and\n\n2051\n01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,550\nit makes it automated, we simply\ngo ahead and we fix the issue and\n\n2052\n01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:42,540\nwe tell them in just a few minutes it will\nkick back on and they'll be ready to go.\n\n2053\n01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:46,010\n>> So excellent system, pretty easy to\nwork with, and if you have thousands and\n\n2054\n01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:51,060\nthousands of machines using sticky Macs\nand using air disable auto recovery,\n\n2055\n01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,560\nusing those combined, you can get a very\nsecure system in just a matter of minutes,\n\n2056\n01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,550\njust by launching these commands.\n\n2057\n01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:59,940\nAnd we set up that port security\non one single port, but\n\n2058\n01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:02,430\nwe could have used\nthe interface range command to\n\n2059\n01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,009\nto configure it on all of our ports and\nknock this out real fast.\n\n2060\n01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:09,660\nAll right, Ronnie,\nwhat else do we have on security?\n\n2061\n01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,630\nI think we got most of it.\n\n2062\n01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:12,690\nOh some general practice things.\n\n2063\n01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,200\n>> So let's make sure we understand too.\n\n2064\n01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:19,490\nNow not only is the best practice to limit\nwho can access the switch itself, but\n\n2065\n01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:24,940\nwhat if we don't really want to remove\nall of those patch cables here, okay?\n\n2066\n01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:28,850\nBecause I know that those\nports may be used later on,\n\n2067\n01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,730\nI don't want to have to go and find new\npatch cables and connect them all back in,\n\n2068\n01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:36,410\nwell, one of the best practices\nthat we can have is to simply\n\n2069\n01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:41,710\njust administratively turn off\nports that we're not using, okay.\n\n2070\n01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:44,610\nAdministrative shutdown means that\nnothing's going to turn it on\n\n2071\n01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:46,570\nuntil someone comes in to turn them on.\n\n2072\n01:47:46,570 --> 01:47:49,310\nSo that may be another way for\nus to do that.\n\n2073\n01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:51,130\n>> Yeah and\nthere's two different approaches, right?\n\n2074\n01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:53,150\nThe one that I recommend\nis what Ronnie said, right?\n\n2075\n01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:55,850\nIf you have a port that you're not using,\ngo into the switch,\n\n2076\n01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:57,110\nissue the shutdown command.\n\n2077\n01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:58,180\nIt turns it off.\n\n2078\n01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,820\nNow it's actually not possible, right?\n\n2079\n01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,510\nThat's the best.\n\n2080\n01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,640\n>> So using the interface range command,\nselecting all those\n\n2081\n01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,930\nports that we don't actually want\nto be able to or we're not using.\n\n2082\n01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,950\nAnd then putting in\nthe id of shutdown here.\n\n2083\n01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:12,600\nThat will turn all of those\nunused ports off for us.\n\n2084\n01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,715\n>> Another option is you can create a,\nwe call it a dead VLAN.\n\n2085\n01:48:16,715 --> 01:48:18,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A VLAN with nothing else on it.\n\n2086\n01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,180\n>> Unused, yep.\n\n2087\n01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:22,580\n>> And you can assign any\nunused port to that VLAN.\n\n2088\n01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:25,640\nBy doing that, if somebody plugs into\nthe unused port, they get a link light.\n\n2089\n01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> But they're not on your main network.\n\n2090\n01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,600\nThey're partitioned off on a VLAN.\n\n2091\n01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,540\nThat is effective, but there are some\nVLAN attacks that are out there.\n\n2092\n01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,970\nAnd so it's not as good as\njust shutting the port off.\n\n2093\n01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:37,250\nI recommend shutting the port off.\n\n2094\n01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:41,360\nBut assigning the port to an unused\nVLAN is another approach, and\n\n2095\n01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,960\nit's one of the Cisco recommendations,\nso it can show up on the exam.\n\n2096\n01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,870\n>> Now Don I've heard that\npeople shouldn't use VLAN1.\n\n2097\n01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:50,830\nIs there a particular reason for that?\n\n2098\n01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:54,650\n>> Yeah so on your switch,\nremember that VLAN1 is the default, right?\n\n2099\n01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:59,650\nAnd so the admin port, when you Telnet or\nSSH into a switch, that IP address.\n\n2100\n01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:01,390\nThat's attached to VLAN1.\n\n2101\n01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:05,830\nSo an attacker that's out there, they're\ngonna know, hey, I wanna get on VLAN 1.\n\n2102\n01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:09,570\nSo the temptation that we have when we get\na new switch is to use VLAN 1 as our main\n\n2103\n01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:15,350\nnetwork, and what you should do instead is\nmove all your PCs to some other VLAN and\n\n2104\n01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,640\ndon't use VLAN 1.\n\n2105\n01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,780\nYou can use VLAN 1 for\nmanagement if you need to.\n\n2106\n01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:23,160\nBut you shouldn't have PC's and\nservers and stuff like that one VLAN 1.\n\n2107\n01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,890\nIt should just be for like switch\nmanagement, or router management.\n\n2108\n01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:27,610\nEverything else should\nbe on a different VLAN.\n\n2109\n01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:29,790\n>> Now does that include trunking maybe,\neven?\n\n2110\n01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:33,490\n>> Well, now see on the trunking\nside if you're using VLAN 1 for\n\n2111\n01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:36,860\nmanagement, you're going to need to have\nthat available in the various switches so\n\n2112\n01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,350\nyou'll want to truncate.\n\n2113\n01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:43,300\nSwitches, one of the attacks, and\nwe've tackled this in the security show so\n\n2114\n01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:45,270\nI don't want to go too crazy on it here,\nbut\n\n2115\n01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:50,230\none of the attacks that you can do is\ncalled VLAN jumping, where you can\n\n2116\n01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:55,190\nbasically corrupt your VLAN tag, and\nend up on what's called the default VLAN.\n\n2117\n01:49:55,190 --> 01:50:00,620\nEvery trunk has a default or native\nVLAN that untags packets going across.\n\n2118\n01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,630\nAnd the default is VLAN1.\n\n2119\n01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:06,270\nSo most attackers know if they\ncan just damage their VLAN tag,\n\n2120\n01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:07,960\nthat they can end up on\nthat management VLAN.\n\n2121\n01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,250\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n2122\n01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:14,310\nSo one of the last things that we can do\nfor security is change that native VLAN,\n\n2123\n01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:20,370\nso that if an attacker damages their tag,\nthey end up on this other VLAN instead.\n\n2124\n01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,480\nSo I set up that trunker,\nlet's go back to the switch.\n\n2125\n01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:29,760\nI set up that trunk earlier\non port 47 where I said\n\n2126\n01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,130\nswitchboard mode trunk like that, right?\n\n2127\n01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:37,200\nWell when we define a trunk, there's\nactually a lot more that you can define.\n\n2128\n01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:41,280\nAnd so you'll see some of the different\nthings that we can set in here.\n\n2129\n01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:45,660\nThe one I'm looking for is under the trunk\nsubsetting, which is trunk native,\n\n2130\n01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:49,260\nand then you can specify a VLAN number.\n\n2131\n01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:53,440\nSo the default is that\nthe native VLAN is VLAN1.\n\n2132\n01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,360\nAnd if somebody does one of\nthose corrupted tag attacks,\n\n2133\n01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,930\nthey could end up on that VLAN,\nand that's your management VLAN.\n\n2134\n01:50:58,930 --> 01:50:59,960\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n2135\n01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,370\nSo instead, we could pick a dummy VLAN.\n\n2136\n01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:05,119\nI usually use 999,\nwhich now I've told everybody [LAUGH].\n\n2137\n01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:06,525\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n2138\n01:51:06,525 --> 01:51:07,917\n>> So\n>> So anyhow,\n\n2139\n01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:11,720\nwe say switchport trunk native VLAN 999,\nright?\n\n2140\n01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:16,080\nNow any untagged traffic,\nany traffic that has a corrupt tag or\n\n2141\n01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,220\nno tag will end up on VLAN 999.\n\n2142\n01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:21,896\nWell, if I don't use that VLAN,\nthen great, have at it.\n\n2143\n01:51:21,896 --> 01:51:23,184\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n2144\n01:51:23,184 --> 01:51:24,620\n>> Welcome, go ahead.\n\n2145\n01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:29,000\nSo that's an extra degree of security if\nsomebody tries to perform a VLAN attack.\n\n2146\n01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,350\n>> Yep.\n\n2147\n01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:30,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n2148\n01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:32,090\nOne thing to remember.\n\n2149\n01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:35,810\nThat setting has to be done\non both ends of the trunk.\n\n2150\n01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:38,440\nSo, I just did it on\nthis switch behind me.\n\n2151\n01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,650\nI now would need to do it to the switch\non the other end of that cable.\n\n2152\n01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:46,920\nSo real important, any trunk settings have\nto be done on both ends of the cable.\n\n2153\n01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, and\n\n2154\n01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:49,170\nthat goes for any trunk setting.\n\n2155\n01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:49,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n2156\n01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,930\nMake sure of that.\n\n2157\n01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:52,560\nBecause it's not gonna work if you don't.\n\n2158\n01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,630\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2159\n01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:58,680\nIt will wreak all sorts of havoc, so yeah,\ndefinitely something to keep in mind.\n\n2160\n01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:01,350\nAll right, so\nas far as our switch security,\n\n2161\n01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:04,310\nwe got to see statically\nassigning a MAC address,\n\n2162\n01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:08,200\nwe got to see setting violations,\nif we exceed that count.\n\n2163\n01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,930\nWe got a chance to talk a little bit\nabout shutting down unused boards and\n\n2164\n01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:13,520\nchanging the native VLANs.\n\n2165\n01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,950\nBut those are all things that we need to\nbe aware of when it comes to security on\n\n2166\n01:52:16,950 --> 01:52:17,716\na Cisco switch.\n\n2167\n01:52:17,716 --> 01:52:18,886\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2168\n01:52:18,886 --> 01:52:23,480\n>> And [COUGH] for any of you that go on\nto do the CCNA Security certification,\n\n2169\n01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,720\nthere is a lot more you\ncan do on the switch.\n\n2170\n01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,020\nBut for the CCENT exam,\nthose are the ones you need to know.\n\n2171\n01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:30,300\n>> Right.\n\n2172\n01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,440\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen\nas always we hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n2173\n01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:38,000\nDefinitely stay tuned for our next,\nwell actually, our next episode for\n\n2174\n01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,900\nthe CCNT show, we're gonna be getting into\nrouting, and all the routing technologies.\n\n2175\n01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,450\nGreat stuff can be found there.\n\n2176\n01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:47,420\nAs well as our other shows that\nare filming right now, like Security+ and-\n\n2177\n01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:48,210\n>> Network+.\n\n2178\n01:52:48,210 --> 01:52:49,100\n>> What else is going on?\n\n2179\n01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,330\nWindows 8, all sorts of good\nstuff going on right now.\n\n2180\n01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:54,870\nSo check the other shows out if\nyou've got the time and the desire.\n\n2181\n01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:59,940\nOtherwise, stay tuned for future Cisco\nepisodes and signing up for IT Pro TV.\n\n2182\n01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,980\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n2183\n01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:01,790\n>> And I'm Ronnie

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,921\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,462\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:42,610\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,990\n>> I am doing well today.\n\n8\n00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,940\nI am doing better than any\ncast member of anybody\n\n9\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,910\nthat ever appeared on Gilmore Girls.\n\n10\n00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,570\n>> You know.\n\n11\n00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,420\n>> I'm lying to you.\n\n12\n00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,040\nI'm lying to you.\n\n13\n00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,626\n>> I don't know the future fate\nof anybody on Gilmore Girls.\n\n14\n00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know the grandfather was in\n\n15\n00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,910\nThe Lost Boys.\n\n16\n00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,120\n>> Yes.\nAnd what happened to him?\n\n17\n00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,730\n>> He was the main.\n\n18\n00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,410\nOh we don't want to ruin,\nno spoilers for lost boys.\n\n19\n00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,670\n>> Yeah,\njust in case you haven't seen it yet.\n\n20\n00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,276\n>> Yeah the movie's been out for 20 years.\n\n21\n00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:12,270\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n22\n00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,960\n>> I'm lying.\n>> So today we've got another Cisco\n\n23\n00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,700\nepisode ahead for you.\n\n24\n00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,660\n>> That's right.\n>> And we are gonna\n\n25\n00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,410\nbe tackling the wonderful\nworld of switches.\n\n26\n00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,150\n>> That's right.\n\n27\n00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,975\nWe actually already did, you know,\na good solid episode or two, I think,\n\n28\n00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:24,950\non switches.\n\n29\n00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,220\nBut we still have a couple of extra\nlittle things that turn up on the exam\n\n30\n00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,420\nthat we need to make sure we cover so\nthat we've got you guys covered, right?\n\n31\n00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,630\n>> Yeah,\ndon't forget that Cisco equipment for\n\n32\n00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,594\nus tends to generate a ton of information,\nand a lot of times when you're new to it,\n\n33\n00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:43,820\nright, you start doing these\ndifferent shell commands.\n\n34\n00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,790\nYou run across and all of a sudden\nit spits out like 20 lines of stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,990\nAnd you're going well,\nI wonder what those things are about.\n\n36\n00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,670\nWell we're gonna talk about a lot of those\nlittle, tiny things that really should be\n\n37\n00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,340\npart of a skill set of anybody\nheading towards a CCENT track for us.\n\n38\n00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,080\nSo just to get you familiar with that and\nalso some\n\n39\n00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,910\nother troubleshooting problems that tend\nto pop up, just in basic configuration.\n\n40\n00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,210\nAnd I know as somebody, when I started,\nI had a lot of these errors and\n\n41\n00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,360\nI was just like oh,\nI gotta do something about 'em, and so\n\n42\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,542\nwe're gonna take a look\nat some of those issues.\n\n43\n00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,580\n>> Yeah, now the first thing\nwe're gonna tackle today,\n\n44\n00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,840\nis what's called an SVI,\nthe switch virtual interface.\n\n45\n00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,630\nAnd for those of you guys following\nalong in the objective list,\n\n46\n00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,836\nSVIs are objective number,\nwhat is it, 4.9,\n\n47\n00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:34,660\nright, configure SVI interfaces\nis what Cisco calls out.\n\n48\n00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,490\nSo what the heck is an SVI?\n\n49\n00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,386\nWell, on a switch you have physical\ninterfaces, tons of physical interfaces,\n\n50\n00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:42,890\nright.\n\n51\n00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,110\nThe switches I've got behind us,\nwe have two 3560s here.\n\n52\n00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,270\nThey're 48 ports each, so they've got 48\nphysical ports across the front of them.\n\n53\n00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,740\nNot counting the uplinks,\nthe SFPs on the side.\n\n54\n00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,560\nBut, if your switch is set up to do VLANs,\nright,\n\n55\n00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,550\nVirtual Local Area Networks,\nyou can also have virtual interfaces.\n\n56\n00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,220\nVirtual interfaces on each VLAN,\nthat aren't a physical one,\n\n57\n00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,940\nit's not a port on the front of\nthe switch, it's something virtual.\n\n58\n00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,480\nIt's floating in the back\nplane of the switch, right,\n\n59\n00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,560\nthe ethereal,\nfloating eyeball or whatever.\n\n60\n00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,394\n>> So these are not actually ports\nthat match up to any physical port\n\n61\n00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,250\nthat we have.\n\n62\n00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,718\nBut the VLANs are actually\nvery important for\n\n63\n00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,520\nus if we're gonna do what we\ntalked about in earlier episodes.\n\n64\n00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,010\nEssentially taking one big gigantic\nswitch and being able to chop them,\n\n65\n00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,690\nnot physically chop them, but\nlogically divide up that switch and\n\n66\n00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,100\ntreat it as multiple ones.\n\n67\n00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,900\nSo, SVIs are what helps us to do that.\n\n68\n00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,670\n>> Now, every switch has one SVI already\nright out of the box, and that's what we\n\n69\n00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,140\nsaw in the other episode, was the VLAN 1\ninterface, and it's there for management.\n\n70\n00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,530\nIf you wanna telnet or\nSSH into the switch,\n\n71\n00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,720\nif you wanna browse to its web interface,\n\n72\n00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,490\nthat's the interface that you assign an IP\naddress to and you browse in to get at it.\n\n73\n00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,410\nSo that's a standard configuration and\nsomething that we saw in the last episode.\n\n74\n00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,150\nHowever, we can create as\nmany more SVI's as we want.\n\n75\n00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,750\nYou normally have,\nwell the SVIs are tied to your VLANs.\n\n76\n00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,270\nSo you can have up to one SVI for\nevery VLAN.\n\n77\n00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,410\nYou can't have more than\none SVI on the same VLAN.\n\n78\n00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,790\nSo if I've got 40 VLANs, I could have\n40 SVIs if I wanted them to, right.\n\n79\n00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,640\nBy default it's just VLAN 1.\n\n80\n00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,849\nAnd it's kind of funny that Cisco calls\nthis one out in the CCENT objectives,\n\n81\n00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,541\nbecause the primary use for\nthese SVI's is for layer 3 switching,\n\n82\n00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,970\nwhere our switches start to\ndo some of the routing roles.\n\n83\n00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,680\nAnd we don't really deal with\nthat until the CCNA exam.\n\n84\n00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,050\nOne of the first things that you may do,\nat least at CCENT level,\n\n86\n00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,340\nis when you start working with both\nrouter and switches just a little bit,\n\n87\n00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,795\nis that you think, hey,\non a router interface, I go into interface\n\n88\n00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:52,980\nFA0/1 you do your IP address command and\nthen you type in an IP address.\n\n89\n00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,990\nYou keep doing that over and over again,\n\n90\n00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,420\nall the sudden you switch on over to\na switch and then you do the same thing.\n\n91\n00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,955\nInterface, fa0/1, you type in a IP address\nand it tells you, you can't do it.\n\n92\n00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, at that point you're\n\n93\n00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,020\nkind of like, well,\nwhat in the world is going on?\n\n94\n00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,970\nI know that I saw Don actually type in\nan interface on a switch interface.\n\n95\n00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,500\nWell, that's what we're typing in right\nthere, is that SVI is actually where we\n\n96\n00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,970\nend up putting an IP address on\nthat virtual interface as well.\n\n97\n00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,350\nSo sometimes when you get confused,\nthat's what it might be.\n\n98\n00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,910\nSo we want to make sure that we actually\nunderstand that a little bit better today.\n\n99\n00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,810\n>> All right, so let's start with the one\nthat's built in, right, that VLAN 1.\n\n100\n00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,090\nI'm on a switch here, this is that\nsame one we used in the other episode.\n\n101\n00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,070\nAnd if I do a show ip interface brief,\nright,\n\n102\n00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,230\nwhich gives me my interface summary.\n\n103\n00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,600\nWhen I look at it, right there at the top,\nthere's an interface VLAN1.\n\n104\n00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,180\nThat is an SVI,\na switch virtual interface.\n\n105\n00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,000\nNow on Cisco websites every now and\n\n106\n00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,150\nthen you'll see the term BVI,\nwhich is a bridge virtual interface.\n\n107\n00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,110\nAnd technically SVI's and\nBVI's are really the same.\n\n108\n00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,650\nYou can create BVI's on\nrouters also though,\n\n109\n00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,375\nsometimes routers can act as a bridge and\nthey call them brouters.\n\n110\n00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,586\n[CROSSTALK] It's a CompTIA thing.\n\n111\n00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:15,060\nBut anyhow, so this one just\nhas that one SVI and that's it.\n\n112\n00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,292\nBut if we start creating multiple VLANs,\n\n113\n00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,795\nwe might wanna have an IP\naddress on each VLAN.\n\n114\n00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,870\nIt's useful useful for management,\nbut more for routing, really.\n\n115\n00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,040\nSo we can go in and\ncreate as many as we want.\n\n116\n00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,260\nIf I do a, show interface vlan 1, and\n\n117\n00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,940\nactually look at it,\nhere it tells me VLAN 1 is up.\n\n118\n00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,380\nHardware is EtherSVI, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,520\nSo right there it's letting me know\nthat this is a switch virtual interface.\n\n120\n00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,420\nThe VLAN 1 interface cannot be removed.\n\n121\n00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,690\nIt's part of the factory default settings.\n\n122\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,770\nYou can shut it down, you can turn it off.\n\n123\n00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,920\nI'm not gonna do it now,\ncuz I'd disconnect.\n\n124\n00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,310\nBut you can shut it off,\nbut you can't remove it.\n\n125\n00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,960\nSo it's always there.\n\n126\n00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,350\nThe rest, though, are up to you.\n\n127\n00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,570\nSo if we wanna create more\nit's actually really easy.\n\n128\n00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,544\nSo let's say I've got a VLAN,\nI'll say VLAN 2.\n\n129\n00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,750\nActually, you know what,\nlet's pick a VLAN that I'm not using.\n\n130\n00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,830\nI'll do VLAN 222, all right.\n\n131\n00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,340\nAnd I'll give it a name and\nI'll call it the ITProTV-Show, all right.\n\n132\n00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,600\nSo I've now got a VLAN, VLAN 222, right.\n\n133\n00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,540\nAnd if I wanna be able to telnet or\n\n134\n00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,930\nSSH into the switch from that VLAN,\nI'm gonna need an IP address on that VLAN.\n\n135\n00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:35,030\nSo, I create an SVI by typing,\ninterface vlan 222, all right.\n\n136\n00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,650\nWhen I do that, that's going to\ncreate the SVI right there, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,756\nSo it's actually getting created,\nI can assign it an IP address.\n\n138\n00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:53,752\nWhat network do I want,\nhere I'll use 192.168.0.10, all right.\n\n139\n00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:57,842\nOkay, and\nI can issue the no shutdown command.\n\n140\n00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:58,844\nYou know, I don't remember offhand.\n\n141\n00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,730\nI think they're shut down by default.\n\n142\n00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,040\nSo I'll do a no shutdown,\nand now that SVI is created.\n\n143\n00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,103\nAll right, now I didn't get a status\nmessage saying the interface is coming up,\n\n144\n00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:12,589\nand that's probably because I\ndon't have any ports in VLAN 222.\n\n145\n00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,320\nSo if no ports are up,\nthen the SVI doesn't come up either.\n\n146\n00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,800\nSo I'll fix that.\n\n147\n00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,940\n>> So Don actually kind of mentioned\nsomething very important for us, right?\n\n148\n00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,623\nIf I have a machine, then,\nthat's actually in VLAN 222, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:29,350\nAnd then I want to actually be able to\nTelnet or SSH into the switch itself,\n\n150\n00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,076\nit has to go through this, which this\nparticular IP address now becomes my\n\n151\n00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:38,010\ndefault gateway that allows\nit to go into VLAN1.\n\n152\n00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,140\nSo that's the idea that we're\ntalking about right here.\n\n153\n00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,420\nAnd that's a very good concept for\nus to remember.\n\n154\n00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,030\n>> So what I'm gonna do now is\nI'm gonna take another port and\n\n155\n00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,680\nput it into VLAN 222.\n\n156\n00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,233\n>> Yep.\n\n157\n00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:54,710\nSo we always wanna make sure that we\nswitch it into an access port first.\n\n158\n00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,390\nBecause only access\nports can go into VLANs.\n\n159\n00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,190\nAnd then, we assign that\nparticular port into VLAN 222.\n\n160\n00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,990\nAnd Don goes ahead and\nputs the switch port.\n\n161\n00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,830\nNo negotiate.\n\n162\n00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,210\n>> Yeah and do I not have, I might\nnot have terminal monitor turned on.\n\n163\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,103\nI'm not seeing any status messages so,\n\n164\n00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,282\n[CROSSTALK] we'll verify\nthis the manual way.\n\n165\n00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,310\nNormally, you see the status\nmessages popping up,\n\n166\n00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,300\nletting you know the interface came up or\nwent down or whatever.\n\n167\n00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,320\nI'm SSH'd into the switch, and\n\n168\n00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,380\nso you don't see status messages unless\nyou issue the terminal monitor command.\n\n169\n00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,750\nIt's too late now, cuz I've already run\nthe command, so we'll verify it manually.\n\n170\n00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,910\nOh, there we go, so there's one of them.\n\n171\n00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,400\nSo I can see line protocol on interface\nVLAN 222 changed stated to up.\n\n172\n00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,299\nAnd if I do a show ip interface brief,\n\n173\n00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,850\nnow I can see I've got VLAN 1,\nand it has an IP address.\n\n174\n00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,405\nAnd I've got VLAN 222 and\nit has an address, I've now got two SVIs.\n\n175\n00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:53,501\n>> And also the switch port that\nDon just put into VLAN 222.\n\n176\n00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,560\n>> I did number three.\n\n177\n00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,270\n>> Number three, yeah.\n\n178\n00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,777\nI just saw the up, up.\n\n179\n00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,019\nIt's my eyesight more than anything else.\n\n180\n00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:58,911\nYou know?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,444\n>> [LAUGH] Just wanted\n\n182\n00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:00,960\nto make sure I was seeing that right.\n\n183\n00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,270\nSo that particular\ninterface is now in there.\n\n184\n00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,520\nSo remember if you had\na computer plugged in that and\n\n185\n00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,720\nyou wanted to get access in the switch,\nyou'd have to actually have that.\n\n186\n00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,930\nSo what if Don were just to simply go into\nFA0/3 and try and type in an IP address?\n\n187\n00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,520\nThat's not gonna work for\nus at this point.\n\n188\n00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,530\n>> Yeah, so, on a switch,\nyou have what are called switch ports and\n\n189\n00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,530\nyou have what are called routed ports.\n\n190\n00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,700\nOkay?\n\n191\n00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,980\nOn most switches,\n\n192\n00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,890\nthey're layer 2 devices, all of your ports\nare switch ports and that's the end of it.\n\n193\n00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,890\nBut on a layer 3 switch,\na switch that can do routing,\n\n194\n00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,739\nyou have ports that are switch ports,\nact like layer 2 switches, and\n\n195\n00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:42,010\nthen you can have ports that are layer\n3 ports, that are routed ports.\n\n196\n00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,020\nNow, an SVI Is a routed port by default,\nokay?\n\n197\n00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,070\nSo, these SVIs work differently\nthan a regular port.\n\n198\n00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,610\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n199\n00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,614\nIf I do a show run interface fa0/1, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:03,970\nIf I look at that interface, well I've got\nall the default commands on it, right?\n\n201\n00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,160\nSo, let me pick one that maybe\ndoesn't have some defaults.\n\n202\n00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,693\nThere we go.\n\n203\n00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:11,846\nSo here I've got like switchport access\nVLAN 222, switchport mode access,\n\n204\n00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,730\nswitchport no negotiate.\n\n205\n00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,127\nThe switch port command is what's\ntelling it that this is a switch port.\n\n206\n00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,810\nIf I do show run interface VLAN 1,\nor VLAN 222.\n\n207\n00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,830\nThey're not switch ports.\n\n208\n00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,860\nSwitch ports are layer two,\nthese are layer three ports, all right?\n\n209\n00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,230\nAnd I was able to assign that IP.\n\n210\n00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,030\nBut like Ronnie was saying, if I go into\ninterface FA0/3 which is a switch port.\n\n211\n00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,508\nIf I said ip address 192., well,\n\n212\n00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:46,289\nlet's pick a different IP,\n172.16.0.5, right?\n\n213\n00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,044\nSo, if I try and do that, I get an error,\n\n214\n00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:52,600\nthe ip address command\nisn't even an option.\n\n215\n00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,930\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz it's a layer two port.\n\n216\n00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,140\n>> And I know that's beginning,\n\n217\n00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,620\nlike I said, a lot of times when you're\nfirst starting out, you might try this.\n\n218\n00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,190\nAnd, if you were like me,\nyou tried it for probably 100 times and\n\n219\n00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,498\nthen realized, hey, that's not working.\n\n220\n00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:09,600\nAnd then once you actually go, oh yeah,\nthat's right, there's a switch port.\n\n221\n00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,140\nSo we're trying to save you just\na little bit more headache here is what\n\n222\n00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,705\nwe're trying to do.\n\n223\n00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:15,563\n>> Yeah, and for\nthose of you that go on to do the CCNA-\n\n224\n00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:16,096\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,454\n>> In a CCNA,\nwe cover the layer three routing and so\n\n226\n00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,787\nyou actually have to come in and\nmake use of a lot of this stuff, but for\n\n227\n00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:25,380\nthe CCENT exam, they just want you\nto be aware of that difference.\n\n228\n00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,370\nBy default on a switch, all of the ports\nare layer two ports, except for the SVIs.\n\n229\n00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,470\nThose SVIs are layer three.\n\n230\n00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,700\nThey're designed to have an IP\naddress attached to them, and\n\n231\n00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,310\nyou can access the switch using them.\n\n232\n00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,500\nYou can Telnet our SSH into it.\n\n233\n00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,635\nIf I had a computer and I'm plugged\ninto VLAN 222, I can now SSH into\n\n234\n00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:49,910\n192.168.0.10 because that's the IP\nthat we assigned to it right there.\n\n235\n00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,820\nI can get in and\nI can then start to work with switch.\n\n236\n00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,086\nI mean, you still have to have\nthe user name and password.\n\n237\n00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:58,550\n>> Right, so one of the things that you\nmay actually encounter then, right?\n\n238\n00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,370\nIs they may give you a show run or\n\n239\n00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,572\na portion of a show run command and\nthey say, hey, why don't you try and\n\n240\n00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:07,740\nidentify which one of these\nactually could be an SVI?\n\n241\n00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,314\nWell, again,\n\n242\n00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,536\nthat should be something that you might\nbe able to actually take a look at.\n\n243\n00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:14,878\nAnd realize that on a switch, when you\ndo see the IP address attached to that\n\n244\n00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,117\nparticular interface,\nthat may give you a hint.\n\n245\n00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:19,469\n>> Yeah, and just the name-\n>> Right.\n\n246\n00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,217\n>> That it's a VLAN XYZ, right?\n\n247\n00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,590\nAnything that starts with a VLAN,\nthat's going to be an SVI.\n\n248\n00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,771\nSo keep in mind that, for the CCNT side,\n\n249\n00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:31,378\nwe really just need to treat this\nas another way to manage a switch.\n\n250\n00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:35,911\nSo we can have other interfaces to manage\nit, but definitely when we launch the CCNA\n\n251\n00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:39,240\nshow, tune into that and\nyou will see the layer 3 switches.\n\n252\n00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,134\nNot too much more about SVIs.\n\n253\n00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,690\nRonnie, can you think anything\nelse on SVIs we need to mention?\n\n254\n00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,840\n>> No, like we said, probably the idea\nof identification is kinda the key here.\n\n255\n00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,830\nEspecially in this particular exam.\n\n256\n00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,300\nMaking sure that you understand the\ndifference between the idea that routed\n\n257\n00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,630\nand that switch port.\n\n258\n00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,857\nI think we're doing well on that one.\n\n259\n00:13:56,857 --> 00:14:00,935\n>> Okay, so the next thing that\nwe need to tackle is actually,\n\n260\n00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:04,830\nit's the same on switches\nas it is on routers.\n\n261\n00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,910\nYou can use most Cisco switches and\nall Cisco routers to be a DHCP server.\n\n262\n00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,850\nIf you need a DHCP server on your network,\nyou don't have to\n\n263\n00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,110\nset up an actual dedicated server,\nyou can use your Cisco equipment.\n\n264\n00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,236\n>> Yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:23,049\nYeah, when we start talking about DHCP,\nlet's remember that that concept,\n\n266\n00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,016\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol,\n\n267\n00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:28,130\nnow that term has actually changed\nover the years for CompTIA.\n\n268\n00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,930\nI know that cuz I see that a lot.\n\n269\n00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,950\nBut for us Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol Server.\n\n270\n00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,600\nJust a little bit of a reminder\nhere when we start, right?\n\n271\n00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,930\nThat is actually what helps us to assign\nIP addresses to devices that are out there\n\n272\n00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,120\non our network.\n\n273\n00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,550\nRemember if I have just two devices,\nI can statically go around and\n\n274\n00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,860\nactually put the IP addresses on them?\n\n275\n00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,340\nBut what if I have 1,000 devices,\ndo I want to walk around and do that?\n\n276\n00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,500\nWell I don't.\n\n277\n00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,680\nSo what we can do is we can set\nup a server, configure it, and\n\n278\n00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,700\nallow that server to handle it.\n\n279\n00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,690\nNow what Don is telling us,\nis something that's very neat.\n\n280\n00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,350\nWhich is something I didn't\nknow when I first started.\n\n281\n00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,310\nIs that a router or\na switch can actually do this for me.\n\n282\n00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,398\nSo I'm gonna have to actually go out and\n\n283\n00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:10,580\nput up a particular Microsoft DHCP\nserver I don't need to.\n\n284\n00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,340\nI don't have to.\n\n285\n00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,468\nI can, but here, the actual\ninfrastructure device does it for us.\n\n286\n00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,720\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n287\n00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,130\n>> In a production environment,\nI like to do it this way.\n\n288\n00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,534\nBecause if you think about it,\n\n289\n00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:24,352\nif the switch goes down your\nnetwork's down anyway, right?\n\n290\n00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:25,652\nSo you don't need a DHCP server.\n\n291\n00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,910\nThe network's down.\n\n292\n00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,400\nSo it's a very reliable\nplace to stick this role.\n\n293\n00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,179\nAnd then you don't have to worry\nabout when you reboot your server,\n\n294\n00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,710\nyou know DHCP acting up or whatever.\n\n295\n00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,930\nSo it is pretty versatile, and\nyou can do it on routers and switches.\n\n296\n00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,260\nLet's take a look at that process\nof setting up a DHCP server.\n\n297\n00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,955\nIt's not intuitive.\n\n298\n00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:47,378\n>> Yeah, and the commands are definitely\nnot intuitive at this point so the good\n\n299\n00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:51,881\nthing is it doesn't take long to actually\nset up the commands to get it to work.\n\n300\n00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,790\n>> So we created a VLAN and you know what,\n\n301\n00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,544\nI'm gonna change that range\nto make it easier to spot.\n\n302\n00:15:56,544 --> 00:16:00,292\nSo VLAN 222 is what we made, right?\n\n303\n00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,620\nAnd I'm gonna change that\nIP address to 192.168.222.\n\n304\n00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,990\nAnd we'll make this guy .1.\n\n305\n00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,330\nSo, it's gonna be 192.168.222.1,\nthat's are very first one.\n\n306\n00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,540\nAnd so, now that will be easy for\nme to spot.\n\n307\n00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,983\nLet me just verify that it applied.\n\n308\n00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,190\nThere we go.\n\n309\n00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,520\nSometimes, I run these commands and\nI don't think about it.\n\n310\n00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,549\nI just did several\nshortcut commands in one.\n\n311\n00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,843\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me explain what I did cuz it's\n\n312\n00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:31,670\nkinda neat to see this stuff.\n\n313\n00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,680\nI'm in config, and\nI wanted to run a show command.\n\n314\n00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,520\nWell, show commands don't work in config.\n\n315\n00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,600\nIf I do a show version,\nI just get an error.\n\n316\n00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,720\nThe show command doesn't exist in config.\n\n317\n00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,950\nSo, you can use the do command.\n\n318\n00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,640\nDo says, run what I'm about to\ntype outside of configuration.\n\n319\n00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,540\nSo, I can do a show command.\n\n320\n00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,285\nThe only negative is like your context\nsensitive help doesn't really work.\n\n321\n00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:57,995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But as long as you know the command you\n\n322\n00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,620\nwanna run, you can do it,\nand it works just fine.\n\n323\n00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,410\nSo, I did a do command and then,\nI did show IP interface brief.\n\n324\n00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,670\nBut then, I filtered it.\n\n325\n00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,930\n>> Yep.\n>> See the little pipe symbol there?\n\n326\n00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,540\nThat's me filtering it.\n\n327\n00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,372\nAnd I excluded any line that contains UNA.\n\n328\n00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:18,150\nIn other words,\nunassigned is what I'm looking for.\n\n329\n00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,310\nWhen you do a show IP interface brief,\non the switch,\n\n330\n00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,890\nyou get your routed ports as\nwell as your switched ports.\n\n331\n00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,680\nWell, switched ports\ndon't have IP addresses.\n\n332\n00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,190\nSo, if I only care about\nthe ones that have IP address,\n\n333\n00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,270\nthen I can filter out the ones that don't.\n\n334\n00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,400\nAnd the word unassigned is\nwhat I was keying off of.\n\n335\n00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,540\nNow, I didn't want to catch ones\nthe said like unsaid or whatever, so\n\n336\n00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,520\nthat's why I did UNA.\n\n337\n00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,210\nThat was enough to identify just those.\n\n338\n00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,260\nWith that filter, I just see those.\n\n339\n00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,300\nI guess I could have said just\ninclude ones that have VLAN.\n\n340\n00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,040\nThat would've worked too.\n\n341\n00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,960\nBut when you do it that way,\nyou lose your column headers.\n\n342\n00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,625\n>> Yep\n>> So, but anyhow,\n\n343\n00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,778\nI just wanted to verify that\nIP took effect and it did.\n\n344\n00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,941\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let's say,\n\n345\n00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:06,449\nthat we wanna issue DHCP\naddresses on VLAN 222.\n\n346\n00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:11,720\n>> Yeah, this takes place in the global\nconfiguration prompt for us, and\n\n347\n00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620\nthat's key for us as we do this.\n\n348\n00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,003\nThe command actually begins with IP DHCP,\nand then, the word pool.\n\n349\n00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:22,580\nAnd this is where it gets tricky,\nwe have to create a name for it.\n\n350\n00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,370\nSo, a lot of times,\nI might just do VLAN 222, but\n\n351\n00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,755\nhere Don actually created the name\nof this pool called ITProTV-Show.\n\n352\n00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,450\nIt's what he actually created\nhere at this picker point.\n\n353\n00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,180\n>> And I did that because that's\nwhat I did in the VLAN earlier.\n\n354\n00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,250\n>> Yep. No, that's great. Yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,060\nThat actually is very descriptive and\nhelps us out at this bigger point here.\n\n356\n00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,208\nNow, once we actually have this,\nif I don't what next command is, I could\n\n357\n00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:53,954\npossibly do the very important idea of the\nquestion mark here, that might help me.\n\n358\n00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,447\nBut a lot of times,\nyou don't have to do anything but\n\n359\n00:18:56,447 --> 00:19:00,240\nyou just simply hit the enter and\nnotice how the prompt has changed here.\n\n360\n00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,465\nThe prompt has now changed to DHCP-config.\n\n361\n00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:08,430\nSo, we're inside of the actual\nconfiguration prompt for DHCP and\n\n362\n00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,337\nnow we get, well, yes, you see\na whole list of different commands.\n\n363\n00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:16,310\nThe important ones for us, now, of course,\nare gonna be just several things that\n\n364\n00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,980\nwe actually have to have for\nevery single computer.\n\n365\n00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,500\nWe need, of course, the pool of addresses\nthat we are going to actually assign out.\n\n366\n00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,893\nWe're gonna use the network keyword\nto help us do that [SOUND].\n\n367\n00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:33,130\nAnd from here, you actually\njust assign the entire network.\n\n368\n00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,670\n>> Yeah.\nOn this one, it's weird.\n\n369\n00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,010\nIt's really non-intuitive.\n\n370\n00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,420\nOn most systems, like on a Linux system or\nwhatever, you would specify the low and\n\n371\n00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,220\nthe high end, but here,\nit wants to know the network.\n\n372\n00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:52,280\nAnd so, I'm saying 192.168.222.0/24\nis the network that we're doing.\n\n373\n00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,559\nNow, the problem here is that command,\nthat includes, oh,\n\n374\n00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,403\nthat's right, it needs a space.\n\n375\n00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:03,162\nThat includes the whole thing,\n.1 all the way to .254.\n\n376\n00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:07,335\nWell, this switch is .1, so\nI'm now overlapping and so\n\n377\n00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:11,860\nI get a recipe for disaster right here and\nit's not intuitive.\n\n378\n00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,550\nYou'd think that you\ncould specify first or\n\n379\n00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,410\nlast like on every other\nsystem on the planet.\n\n380\n00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But here, it's just the network.\n\n381\n00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n382\n00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,220\nSo, at the beginning here,\nwe need at least the network command.\n\n383\n00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,970\nThe other things that we normally\nneed would be what we'd have on\n\n384\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,740\nevery other device.\n\n385\n00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,338\nWe need a default gateway, and\nwe might also need a DNS server.\n\n386\n00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:31,627\nSo, for us, they don't call it\ndefault gateway here do they,\n\n387\n00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,980\nit's called default router.\n\n388\n00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,982\nDefault guest router is the one\nwe all associate there [SOUND].\n\n389\n00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,802\nAnd this, of course, would actually now\n\n390\n00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:48,515\nbe the IP address that we\nput on that SVI interface.\n\n391\n00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,395\nIt's the one that we'd have here.\n\n392\n00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:53,130\nNow, at this point,\nif I don't do anything else,\n\n393\n00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,365\nI should be fine as long as I'm not\nusing any type of name resolution.\n\n394\n00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:01,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm gonna go ahead and add that in.\n\n395\n00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,080\n>> So,\nusually that's at least the minimal.\n\n396\n00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,741\nWe used to just say, oh no,\nas long as you have an IP address and\n\n397\n00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,440\na default gateway subnet mask,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n398\n00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,050\nBut DNS is so involved in\neverything we do in networking,\n\n399\n00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,420\nI would say that's probably in the central\npart of our networks today too.\n\n400\n00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,720\n>> So, I'll go ahead and\nflag that to hand out that option.\n\n401\n00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,220\nUsually, with DHCP,\nyou wanna give out an IP address and\n\n402\n00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,220\na subnet mask,\na default gateway and a DNS server.\n\n403\n00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,450\nThere's other things like you might\nwant to give out a domain name.\n\n404\n00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,780\nSo, I might say that these\nguys are a part of the,\n\n405\n00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,010\nIf I can spell it, lab.itpro.tvdomain,\nso I can specify that.\n\n406\n00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,340\nAnd that'll let me hand it out also.\n\n407\n00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,850\nThe last thing I need to do is\nI do need to fix that overlap.\n\n408\n00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,900\nThe pool is overlapping with IP\naddresses that maybe in use.\n\n409\n00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,170\nYou may have static IPs and things, so\nwe need to go inside our exclusions and\n\n410\n00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,280\nyou think that you can do it\nright here but you can't.\n\n411\n00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,300\nYou gotta get out of the DHCP config,\nand it's done here.\n\n412\n00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,838\nIt's IP, DHCP.\n\n413\n00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:03,648\n>> Excluded address\n>> And then, here you specify the low and\n\n414\n00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:08,520\nthe high for the exclusions,\nso I might exclude .1 all\n\n415\n00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,990\nthe way through 192.168.222.49.\n\n416\n00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,233\nSo, by doing that, now the first IP\nin the pool will actually be .50,\n\n417\n00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:23,510\nand then maybe I want to exclude-\n>> The upper end.\n\n418\n00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,127\n>> Yeah, so we'll do, let's say,\n\n419\n00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:31,490\n200 through 254.\n\n420\n00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,870\nSo, now, my pool will actually be in\nbetween these, it'll be 50 through 199.\n\n421\n00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,760\nSo, a cool, what is that, 150 addresses?\n\n422\n00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,370\nSo, I got 150 addresses\navailable in my pool.\n\n423\n00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,970\nA little counter intuitive,\n\n424\n00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,240\nthat you got to get out of the pool\nto configure the exclusions.\n\n425\n00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,590\nBut that is a key piece,\nthat's an important one.\n\n426\n00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,570\n>> Don't forget to make sure\nyou actually name that pool.\n\n427\n00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,310\nSo, it's not enough just to say IP DHCP.\n\n428\n00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,970\nAnd just start typing it in here.\n\n429\n00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,520\nYou have to actually create\nthe name of that pool.\n\n430\n00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,710\nYou have to define that pool and\nthe other stuff that we need.\n\n431\n00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,950\nAnd then if we're gonna exclude any,\nyou have to have this in there.\n\n432\n00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,283\nIf not, we're gonna get that where, all of\na sudden, the first IP address that would\n\n433\n00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:15,034\nbe handed out is the same one as we've\nset up as our default in gateway.\n\n434\n00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:16,030\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n435\n00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,970\n>> And that's not gonna be good.\n\n436\n00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,450\n>> So, that's really it.\n\n437\n00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,700\n>> Yep.\n>> For getting the DHCP server.\n\n438\n00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,840\nAnd let's just recap that config.\n\n439\n00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,620\nAnd so, basically, if we go in and\n\n440\n00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,880\nlook at the configuration,\nhere's the pool that we configured.\n\n441\n00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,530\nSo, we started off by creating the pool,\nand giving it a name.\n\n442\n00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,930\nWe use the network command\nto say the IP network,\n\n443\n00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,980\nthe sub net that we are gonna fall under.\n\n444\n00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,960\nThen, we did some options.\n\n445\n00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,400\nWe did a default router,\nDNS server and a DNS domain name.\n\n446\n00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,452\n>> Yup.\n>> And then, after that, we went and\n\n447\n00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,544\nput in our exclusions,\nthat piece right above it there.\n\n448\n00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:55,172\nAnd so, that limited our pool size down,\nso our pool is now between .50 and .199.\n\n449\n00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:55,707\nYep.\n\n450\n00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:58,642\n>> Those are the key commands right\nthere and it's the same on a router,\n\n451\n00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:01,680\nI'm on a switch right now, but\nit is the exact same on a router.\n\n452\n00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,860\nYou just specify the IP and\nthe other options and\n\n453\n00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,110\nyou're pretty much in business.\n\n454\n00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n455\n00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,630\nNow, some of you out there,\neven though you may not be going,\n\n456\n00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,410\nwell, my DHCP server can do\na whole bunch more than that.\n\n457\n00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,320\nThat's all you're doing.\n\n458\n00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,285\nWell, yes, that's all we're doing now.\n\n459\n00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:21,910\nDHCP even on a Cisco router\nswitch can do a whole bunch more,\n\n460\n00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,600\nthat's for\nanother show that we'll end up having.\n\n461\n00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,835\nBut just to still your fears,\nit can do a lot more than this.\n\n462\n00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,270\n[LAUGHS]\n>> So,\n\n463\n00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,420\nhow do we know it's actually working?\n\n464\n00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,050\nWell, let's find out.\n\n465\n00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,950\nSo, I took, what was it Ronnie,\nport number three?\n\n466\n00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,560\n>> Port number three.\n\n467\n00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,620\n>> And put it on VLAN 2.\n\n468\n00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,840\n>> Yes, you did.\n>> Port number three actually runs to this\n\n469\n00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,550\nother switch in the background and\nwhat I can do is, on that other switch,\n\n470\n00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:52,400\nI can take port three here and\nI can disable it as a switch port.\n\n471\n00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,530\nI can say no switch port.\n\n472\n00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,570\nAnd that will turn it into a routed port.\n\n473\n00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,170\nThat physical interface\nis now a routed port.\n\n474\n00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,200\nAnd what I can do here, now that it's\nrouted, I can assign an IP address.\n\n475\n00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,408\nWell, normally, I'd say,\nIP address 192.168.222.2.\n\n476\n00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:16,890\nAnd then, a subnet mask, and so on.\n\n477\n00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,250\nThat's what we'd normally do.\n\n478\n00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,160\nWell, instead, this time I'm gonna say,\nIP address DHCP.\n\n479\n00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,980\nBy doing that, I'm now a DHCP client,\nand we do that on routers all the time.\n\n480\n00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,950\nOn switches not so much, but\nit's what I've got right here.\n\n481\n00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,900\nSo, now, I'm gonna request\nan address from another system.\n\n482\n00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,830\nAnd on that port, the other system is\nthe other switch which is a DHCP server.\n\n483\n00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,670\nSo, if I do a show IP interface brief, oh,\n\n484\n00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,350\nactually, there's my update right\nthere and see how I got .50.\n\n485\n00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,730\nThat was the first IP in the pool,\nso I got that from the other server.\n\n486\n00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:02,250\nI also got a default gateway and\na DNS server and the other values too.\n\n487\n00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,995\nWe don't see that here.\n\n488\n00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:06,490\nBut we did.\n\n489\n00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,304\nLet me write this all\nthe way out this time.\n\n490\n00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:09,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n491\n00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,030\npeople can see exactly\nwhat it is that I'm doing.\n\n492\n00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,360\nThere we go.\n\n493\n00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,206\nAnd I can see that I got 192.168.222.50.\n\n494\n00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,900\nAnd it shows right here\nthat I got it from DHCP.\n\n495\n00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,818\n>> Yeah.\n\n496\n00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:22,140\nNow, Don, you mentioned something\nvery interesting right there.\n\n497\n00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,470\nYou said,\nwe do this on routers all of the time.\n\n498\n00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,260\nLet's talk about that just for a moment.\n\n499\n00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,130\nWhen might I actually want my\nrouter to get a DHCP address?\n\n500\n00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,115\n>> So if you're a home or\na small business, the WAN interface for\n\n501\n00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:37,275\nyour router, the router interface that\npoints to your internet service provider.\n\n502\n00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,285\nUnless you've got a business\nclass account with a static IP,\n\n503\n00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:44,300\nmost people get a dynamic IP from their\ncable or DSL provider or whoever.\n\n504\n00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,523\nAnd so, you wanna use DHCP.\n\n505\n00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,420\nThat's what you're gonna pull.\n\n506\n00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,860\nIf your provider is giving you a static\nIP though, that's a different story,\n\n507\n00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,120\nthen you just hard set it.\n\n508\n00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n509\n00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,915\nBut if you do end up with a Cisco router\nand you are using just a regular,\n\n510\n00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,204\nnon-commercial account, this may be\nthe way that you do connect that\n\n511\n00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:05,564\nparticular interface from your cable\nmodem, plug it in, you do this,\n\n512\n00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:10,288\nthe IP address, the DHCP and that will\nallow that picker port to end up getting\n\n513\n00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:13,084\nthat IP address from\nyour service provider.\n\n514\n00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,160\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n515\n00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,880\nSo, anyhow, that's basically it,\njust keep in mind the Cisco routers and\n\n516\n00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,370\nswitches can be both,\nDHCP servers as well as DHCP Clients.\n\n517\n00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,080\nThere are a whole slough of\n\n518\n00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,710\nother commands-\n>> Oh yes.\n\n519\n00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,400\n>> Like Ronnie mentioned.\n\n520\n00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,980\nBut for the exam, those are the ones that\nwe really need to see, even this client\n\n521\n00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,726\nside IP address DHCP, that can turn\nup on the exam from time to time.\n\n522\n00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:38,790\nBut that's basically the ins and\nouts of it.\n\n523\n00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,905\nYou can do show IP DHCP and\n\n524\n00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:45,430\nthere's a ton of different pieces of\ninformation you can look at to see.\n\n525\n00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:50,670\nYou can check check out your various\nserver status and statistics.\n\n526\n00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,320\nSo, I can see here that I've got\none pool and I've issued out.\n\n527\n00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,950\nI've gotten one request and so on.\n\n528\n00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,830\nSo, you can kind of get an idea\nhow things have been going.\n\n529\n00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,300\nI've got one acknowledgement down here.\n\n530\n00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,340\nSo, I've actually issued\njust one address so far.\n\n531\n00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,520\nBut you can start to see\nsome of that good stuff.\n\n532\n00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,625\nIt's all in there and whatever.\n\n533\n00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:10,830\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n534\n00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,900\nIt makes it nice and handy,\n\n535\n00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,250\nespecially if you don't have\na lot of other infrastructure.\n\n536\n00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,530\nSo, you may be a small business,\nwhere you say,\n\n537\n00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,760\nhey, this one device is actually gonna\nbe a big portion of my network here.\n\n538\n00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,280\nGetting it set up, at least,\nin the basic, in the beginning,\n\n539\n00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,840\nunderstanding it is really\ngonna be helpful for us.\n\n540\n00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,150\nNo need to go out and\npurchase another server just to run DHCP.\n\n541\n00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,590\nSo, on that note, that's basically it for\nDHCP and looking at the clock,\n\n542\n00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,130\nwe're right at our first break.\n\n543\n00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,530\nSo, why don't we stop here.\n\n544\n00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,408\nWhen we get back,\nwe're going to move into next.\n\n545\n00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:43,092\n>> Where?\nNTP.\n\n546\n00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,805\n>> NTP.\n>> [CROSSTALK] So, let's stop here.\n\n547\n00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:46,650\nTake a break.\n\n548\n00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,590\nWhen we get back,\n\n549\n00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,380\nwe're gonna see configuring a few\nother options on our switches.\n\n550\n00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,811\nSome fun stuff there.\n\n551\n00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:57,255\nDefinitely, stay tuned and\nwe'll see you back after these messages.\n\n552\n00:28:57,255 --> 00:29:05,098\n[SOUND] Welcome back everybody.\n\n553\n00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:09,994\nSo, before the break, we were taking a\nlook at switchboards, router ports, DHCP,\n\n554\n00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:12,382\nall sorts of good stuff there.\n\n555\n00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:14,910\nWe're gonna jump into another\none of my favorites that's\n\n556\n00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,440\nreally overlooked which is the NTP or\nthe network time protocol.\n\n557\n00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,040\nIn the initial switch set up episode,\n\n558\n00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,830\nwe talked about how important it was\nto set the times on our switches and\n\n559\n00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,910\non our routers, so that our log\nfiles would all be synchronized.\n\n560\n00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,037\nIf you're sending your log files\nto a log server especially,\n\n561\n00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:35,945\nyou want all your clocks\nto be set the same,\n\n562\n00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:38,502\nso you can correlate events\nbetween different devices.\n\n563\n00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:41,420\nUnfortunately, it's not very easy\nif you're manually doing it.\n\n564\n00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,380\nBut all Cisco devices\nsupport using a time server.\n\n565\n00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,590\nSo, you can have\na centralized time server or\n\n566\n00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,360\nan external time source,\nkey all your devices to use it, and\n\n567\n00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,620\nthey'll all have clocks that\nare set to the exact precise time.\n\n568\n00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,810\nIt's pretty awesome stuff.\n\n569\n00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n570\n00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,146\nIt really does help us, not only in things\nlike logging but the idea of timing and\n\n571\n00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:05,195\nmaking sure everything's actually\ncoordinating the way we need to,\n\n572\n00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:09,954\nis important in things like authentication\nfor our network and everything else.\n\n573\n00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:13,980\nSo, for us to bring everything under that\nunified idea of time is actually very\n\n574\n00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,240\nhelpful in just about\neverything we do in networking.\n\n575\n00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,090\nAnd so,\nwe wanna make sure that we get this right.\n\n576\n00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,670\n>> Now, before we jump into\nsetting our time server stuff,\n\n577\n00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,900\none thing we need to make sure that\nwe get straight are our time zones.\n\n578\n00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,525\nA lot of people will use GMT\nwhich is what your routers\n\n579\n00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,935\nare set to by default and if you use that,\nthat's great, it works fine.\n\n580\n00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,935\nBut if you've got systems in multiple time\nzones and stuff, it can be a pain to sit\n\n581\n00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:43,810\nthere and calculate what time\nthings actually occurred on.\n\n582\n00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,680\nI like to use local time on my systems,\nbut\n\n583\n00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,960\nyou need to make sure that\nyour log files reflect that.\n\n584\n00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,870\nAnd so,\nin the other episode I showed that.\n\n585\n00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,982\nDid we do that on this switch or not?\n\n586\n00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,620\nLet's see.\nNope.\n\n587\n00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,773\nSo, we need to fix that.\n\n588\n00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,254\nSo, basically, what we need to do is,\non our switches,\n\n589\n00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:04,290\nwe need to basically tell them\nwhat time zone they're in.\n\n590\n00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,910\nAnd we do that with the clock command.\n\n591\n00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,250\nAnd you'll see,\nyou've got clock time zone.\n\n592\n00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,230\nAnd you can give it a name.\n\n593\n00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,161\nNow, we're coming up on the end\nof daylight savings time.\n\n594\n00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,804\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I need to make sure that it knows\n\n595\n00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:19,720\nthat we are in eastern time,\nthe Eastern Standard Time.\n\n596\n00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,910\nAnd that it is minus five from GMT.\n\n597\n00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,620\nThat's our offset.\n\n598\n00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,885\nBut I'm also gonna tell it,\n\n599\n00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:32,490\nclock summer time, and, summer-time.\n\n600\n00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,160\nThere we go.\n\n601\n00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,880\nWhich we'll call EDT recurring.\n\n602\n00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,340\nSo, I'm telling it every year during\nDaylight Savings Time, we roll back.\n\n603\n00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,153\nAnd during that time, I wanted to show\nthe times zone as EDT instead of EST, so\n\n604\n00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:47,928\nthat I know it.\n\n605\n00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:52,550\nAnd I'm gonna do the same\nthing on my other switch.\n\n606\n00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,171\nSo, I'll just jump in here and\ndo the same thing.\n\n607\n00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:59,591\nSo clock, time zone, est -5\n\n608\n00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:05,214\nendclock summertime edt reccurring.\n\n609\n00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,710\nAnd look at the clocks here.\n\n610\n00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,450\nSo this one says that it's February 28,\n1993 at 2800 hours.\n\n611\n00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,740\nThis guy, also February 28th,\n1993 at 20:00.\n\n612\n00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,910\nBut the clocks are different, right?\n\n613\n00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,957\nSo, this is, what is that, 8:33 PM.\n\n614\n00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:21,560\n>> Yup.\n>> And here I've got 8:35 PM.\n\n615\n00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,235\nSo they're off by 2 minutes.\n\n616\n00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,870\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that can make a difference at times.\n\n617\n00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,100\nBut for us here I think what really\nmatters is that the showing about\n\n618\n00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,810\n10 years behind.\n\n619\n00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,700\nI think its actually 20,\nI'm sorry 20 years behind.\n\n620\n00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,370\n>> Yeah so it good to be back.\n\n621\n00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,730\nNow even a difference of 2 minutes\nis enough to make things like\n\n622\n00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,438\nauthentication can fail,\nas well as even some VPN tunnels,\n\n623\n00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:48,014\nif the clock shore off that fire they\nmight see it as a time delay attack, and\n\n624\n00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:50,590\nso that can really cause some problems.\n\n625\n00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,330\nSo we need to synchronize that.\n\n626\n00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,250\nWe could go and\nmanually set the clocks, but\n\n627\n00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,370\nwe have to get it perfect and press Enter\nat the same time on all of our devices.\n\n628\n00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,725\nNot really reasonable.\n\n629\n00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:01,145\nSo we're going to use\nthe network time server.\n\n630\n00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,085\n>> Right.\nYeah, and the network time server for\n\n631\n00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:07,715\nus is essentially going to be the server\nthat everybody else keys off of.\n\n632\n00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:12,645\nSo whatever his time is, everybody elses\ntime should also reflect that as well.\n\n633\n00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:15,799\nNow we could also set up our\nown internal time server.\n\n634\n00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,490\nAnd in a big organization you may do that,\n\n635\n00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,890\nbecause you want to actually\nbe able to control that.\n\n636\n00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,570\nBut for us,\nwe actually don't have to go internal.\n\n637\n00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,120\nWe can actually go to one of\ntimes it's on the internet too.\n\n638\n00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,950\n>> Yeah an internal time server.\n\n639\n00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,290\nAny Sysko router can be a time server.\n\n640\n00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,670\nIf you have a Windows Active Directory\nenvironment,\n\n641\n00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,750\nall of your domain controllers\nare already time servers.\n\n642\n00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,250\n>> Right.\n\n643\n00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,920\nIn a Linux environment,\n\n644\n00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,970\nyou know Linux servers can be\ntime servers if we want them to.\n\n645\n00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,800\nVery easy to set it up.\n\n646\n00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,380\nThe advantage of an internal\nserver is that it's right there.\n\n647\n00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,750\nIt's right on your network.\n\n648\n00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,040\nWhen you ask it,\nyou get a very quick response.\n\n649\n00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,600\nThe ones out on the internet are perfectly\nreliable also, but it takes time for\n\n650\n00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,260\nyour message to make it all the way\nout there and all the way back.\n\n651\n00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,400\nSo, when you use an external time server,\n\n652\n00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,690\nyour device actually has to do\na couple tests, to test latency.\n\n653\n00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,480\nAnd then they request time, and\nthey adjust it by the latency.\n\n654\n00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,900\nSo, there's a little bit of an accuracy.\n\n655\n00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,144\nWe're not running like\na space Station here.\n\n656\n00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:12,945\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Or nuclear launch facility.\n\n657\n00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:14,935\nSo we don't need to be that accurate.\n\n658\n00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:18,655\nBut if accuracy is your goal, if you\ndo work in a nuclear launch facility,\n\n659\n00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,725\nthen by all means,\nset up an internal time server.\n\n660\n00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,605\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Don't screw around with the ones on\n\n661\n00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:24,205\nthe internet.\n\n662\n00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,325\nSo let's use one.\n\n663\n00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:28,965\nOne of the nice public ones\nthat's out there is ntp.org.\n\n664\n00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,655\nThey're a non-profit.\n\n665\n00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:34,710\nThey have public time servers and\nthey have a pool of them so if one fails,\n\n666\n00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,830\nyou can use the others.\n\n667\n00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,420\nAnd we can reference them at pool.ntp.org.\n\n668\n00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,410\nHowever, I don't know if my switches\nare geared up to be able to hit that,\n\n669\n00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,400\nso let's see.\n\n670\n00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,850\nI'm just gonna try and ping it.\n\n671\n00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,980\nLet's just see here.\n\n672\n00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,100\nSo I'm trying to ping, okay.\n\n673\n00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:03,530\nSo on this one, they got IP addresses,\nso DNS is doing well, but I'm not.\n\n674\n00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,250\nOh you know, actually look at that.\n\n675\n00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,270\nSee here I've got a domain server\nof 8.8.8 From DHCP earlier,\n\n676\n00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,580\nwhereas this one's actually\nusing a broadcast.\n\n677\n00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,810\nSo that's not good.\n\n678\n00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,820\nSo we do need to tweak that.\n\n679\n00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,040\nAlso, the fact that they're\nnot getting anywhere.\n\n680\n00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,200\nIf you're gonna use an Internet time\nserver, you need to set your DNS servers\n\n681\n00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,500\nto be able to do the lookup,\nand you need a default gateway.\n\n682\n00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,740\nSo we need to set both of those.\n\n683\n00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,010\nAnd in fact, while I'm in here,\n\n684\n00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,280\nI'm gonna disable that routed\nport that we created earlier.\n\n685\n00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,830\nThat's gonna cause issues.\n\n686\n00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,370\n>> So don't forget,\n\n687\n00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,710\nif you're doing this on the switch\n>> We wanna set up a default gateway\n\n688\n00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,250\non the switch itself.\n\n689\n00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,820\nSo the switch can communicate\noutside of the network here and\n\n690\n00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,040\nbe able to talk to the time server\nin the way that we come back.\n\n691\n00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,940\nSo we're no longer talking about\nthe IP address on that routed port or\n\n692\n00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,300\non the SVI now.\n\n693\n00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,260\nWe're actually now talking\nabout the default gateway for\n\n694\n00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,210\nthe management interface on our switch it.\n\n695\n00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,040\n>> Now it is for\nthe management interface, but\n\n696\n00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,770\nit's another one of\nthose nonintuitive ones.\n\n697\n00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,350\nSo they gave a command, we actually\nissue in the root, in the global config.\n\n698\n00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,440\nSo I'm gonna say IP default gateway,\nand I'll just point to our default\n\n699\n00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,286\ngateway here in the studio, I'm gonna\ndo the same thing on the other switch.\n\n700\n00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:14,374\nMy default hate-way.\n\n701\n00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:19,350\nThere we go and\nI'm going to set my name servers.\n\n702\n00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,320\nWe'll just use Google.\n\n703\n00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,040\nSo we did set this up a little bit earlier\nin our show but we did it only for\n\n704\n00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,670\nthat one particular instance of that VLAN.\n\n705\n00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,070\nFor VLAN 222 and\nnow we're setting this up for\n\n706\n00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,410\nthe entire switch on\nthe management interface.\n\n707\n00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,800\n>> Yeah, so now the switch, in theory,\n\n708\n00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,710\nshould be able to ping\npool dot ntp dot org.\n\n709\n00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,256\nSo we'll just test that out.\n\n710\n00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:50,491\nIt's thinking.\n\n711\n00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,430\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n712\n00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,573\n>> While it's trying,\n\n713\n00:36:56,573 --> 00:37:01,410\nlet me try the other one.\n\n714\n00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,990\nThere we go.\nAll right, so it's getting out.\n\n715\n00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,020\nWhy is this guy not getting out?\n\n716\n00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:09,040\nI don't know.\n\n717\n00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,070\nOh, you know what,\nit's a VLAN issue on this one.\n\n718\n00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,870\nYeah, I forgot.\n\n719\n00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,190\nThis one is actually daisy chained off the\nother switch, and actually, you know what?\n\n720\n00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,120\nHang on a second.\n\n721\n00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:27,224\nIt's got VLAN1 10.1.230.21.\n\n722\n00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:30,910\nActually you can ping to gateway.\n\n723\n00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,290\nLet me just make sure I didn't\nfat finger the gateway.\n\n724\n00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:46,290\nIP default gateway 10.1.2.31,\nand my IP was not dot one, right?\n\n725\n00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,810\n.21.\n\n726\n00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:56,760\nAll the way out to Google, but\nI can't ping pool.ntp dot.\n\n727\n00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,050\nOh, there it goes.\n\n728\n00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,540\nApparently, I was just being impatient.\n\n729\n00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,780\nAll right, there we go.\n\n730\n00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,510\nBoth systems are able\nto ping out to Google.\n\n731\n00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,220\nI mean, to pool.ntp.org.\n\n732\n00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,080\nNow, I can set them up as my time server.\n\n733\n00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,420\nOn the first one here,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n734\n00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,815\nI'll say, ntp server.\n\n735\n00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,520\nPool.ntp.org.\n\n736\n00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,020\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n737\n00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,340\nyou can enter in more than one server.\n\n738\n00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,280\nYou would just run this command and\nthen run it again and\n\n739\n00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,040\nsay ntp server or whatever.\n\n740\n00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,150\nIf you're gonna do more than one,\nthere's one more command here you can add,\n\n741\n00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,850\nwhich is prefer.\n\n742\n00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,100\nAnd if you throw prefer on the end,\nyou'll try that server first.\n\n743\n00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,880\nYou can only have one flagged as prefer.\n\n744\n00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400\nThe others will just be regular.\n\n745\n00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,370\nAnd you always go to\nyour preferred one first.\n\n746\n00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,380\nSince I'm only gonna enter in one, I don't\nneed that so I'll just stop right there.\n\n747\n00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,110\nOkay?\n\n748\n00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,460\nNow once I do that in the background\nmy switch is gonna reach out and\n\n749\n00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,150\nperiodically every 6 hours or\n12 hours or whatever the timer is,\n\n750\n00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,060\nis gonna reach out to that time server and\njust synchronize my clock.\n\n751\n00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,180\nAnd make sure that its actually accurate,\nand\n\n752\n00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,765\nthat I don't think that its 1993 anymore.\n\n753\n00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:00,410\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n754\n00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,020\n>> Now happen fast or it may not.\n\n755\n00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,450\nApparently it happen fast.\n\n756\n00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,700\n>> Happened incredibly fast.\n\n757\n00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,160\n>> Yep.\nSo it knows that 2:53 on October 24th.\n\n758\n00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,270\nIt can see that and now it's set.\n\n759\n00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,164\nIt's actually more accurate than our\nstudio clock, which thinks it's 2:52.\n\n760\n00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,140\nBut a lot of that cool stuff\nhappened in the background.\n\n761\n00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:29,020\nSo let's see if I can't do a little de-bug\nhere and get that into the foreground.\n\n762\n00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,800\nLet's see,\nI want to do packets and events.\n\n763\n00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,320\nMake sure my terminal monitor is on.\n\n764\n00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,130\nAnd what else do I want to do?\n\n765\n00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,930\nMaybe sync.\n\n766\n00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,840\n>> Oh, yeah, synchronization.\n\n767\n00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,580\n>> Yep, let me do sync.\n\n768\n00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,656\nAll right, so we're just throwing out\na couple of NTP debug commands so\n\n769\n00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:52,800\nthat we'll be able to see what happens\nwhen the NTP server goes to do its magic.\n\n770\n00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,265\nAnd so\nI'm gonna say NTP server pull.ntp.org.\n\n771\n00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:03,630\nAnd when I run that, there we go,\nNTP is kicking on for all our interfaces.\n\n772\n00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,510\nNow I've only got the one\ninterface with an IP, so\n\n773\n00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,440\nit's the only one that's gonna go out,\nand it will go out eventually.\n\n774\n00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,360\nThis is that part where we just wait,\nI'm bored.\n\n775\n00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,230\n>> Yeah this was the slower of the two.\n\n776\n00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,490\nUnless I picked the wrong debug.\n\n777\n00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,470\n>> Let's do a clock and see if it.\n\n778\n00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,740\nIt already updated [LAUGH] and\nwe missed it.\n\n779\n00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,270\nI must have picked the wrong debug,\nI wonder which one.\n\n780\n00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,830\nYou know, actually I did debug packet, so\n\n781\n00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,030\nit should have even shown\njust the raw packets.\n\n782\n00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,176\nI'm sure why it didn't show that.\n\n783\n00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:39,307\nWell anyhow.\n\n784\n00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,790\nCrazy debugs.\n\n785\n00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,860\nThat may be a flaky one.\n\n786\n00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,670\nSo now that it's in place,\n\n787\n00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:53,690\nI can see this one says that it\nis 14:55:27 and you'll see 0.01.\n\n788\n00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:59,279\nSo if you wanna synchronize all\nthe way down to the milliseconds,\n\n789\n00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:04,358\nthat is a really challenging thing to do,\nand you know it's\n\n790\n00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,744\nnot really something you can hope\nto achieve by hand, but, and\n\n791\n00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:15,152\nthere's no way I can do this fast enough,\nsee I didn't get it.\n\n792\n00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,450\nDad-gummit.\n\n793\n00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,420\nSo we're gonna try and\nsee if I can't time this just right.\n\n794\n00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,970\nWhy is it not letting me?\n\n795\n00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,060\nOh well, anyhow.\n\n796\n00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,570\nBut you can see how close they are, right?\n\n797\n00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,181\n14:56:07.\n\n798\n00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:33,980\nIt's 05 here.\n\n799\n00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,950\nApparently took me two seconds to\nget over to that other window.\n\n800\n00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,950\nIt would've been faster for\n\n801\n00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,690\nme to do like an alt+tab that something\nthan it was to try and use the mouse.\n\n802\n00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,870\nThere we go.\n\n803\n00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,510\nAnd so we can see how\nabsolutely close they are and\n\n804\n00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,550\nto get the milliseconds linked in.\n\n805\n00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,000\nSo here it took me half a second\nto get over that other window.\n\n806\n00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,530\nTo get them that synchronized is\nnot something we can do by hand,\n\n807\n00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,520\nwith NTP we can.\n\n808\n00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,620\nNow when we look at our logs, and we see\nthese log event's we'll be able to see\n\n809\n00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,660\nnow only what happened, but when it\nwas an accurate for that time zone.\n\n810\n00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,920\nNow notice it went to non\ndaylight time there, so\n\n811\n00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,540\nwe might not want to go a little further,\nwe showed in the other episode\n\n812\n00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,670\nsettings that our log messages\nhad corrected time zones, right?\n\n813\n00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,370\nSo if we say, let's see.\n\n814\n00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:27,811\nWe want service time stamp log,\nthere we go.\n\n815\n00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:34,169\nDate time, local time and show timezone.\n\n816\n00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,230\nThere we go.\n\n817\n00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:41,730\nThat command right there says\nhey when we do a log message,\n\n818\n00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:46,200\ngo ahead and show it in the local time\nzone, and put the time zone in there,\n\n819\n00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,272\nand you'll actually see it when\nI get out of the config here.\n\n820\n00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:50,980\nIt's gonna come up and\n\n821\n00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,930\nit's gonna show, there it is that it\nhappened at 2:57 eastern daylight time.\n\n822\n00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,100\nI know exactly what time zone it was,\nand what time it occurred, and\n\n823\n00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,780\nthat becomes part of the logs, and so\nnow we see it and it's very accurate.\n\n824\n00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,295\n>> So the NTP client and setting that up,\nusually something we wanna do,\n\n825\n00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,985\nwe want to make sure that all of\nour devices are synchronized up.\n\n826\n00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:16,685\nGives us not only actually\nbeing exactly on time for\n\n827\n00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:19,425\nthose of us that are a little\nmore paranoid about that.\n\n828\n00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:23,375\nBut also again remember other\nservices depend on the time.\n\n829\n00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,337\nOur logs depend on, and\nwe're doing trouble shooting,\n\n830\n00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,837\nit's gonna help to actually\nknow when something happens,\n\n831\n00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:30,597\ninstead of it showing as 1993,\nwhich would be really.\n\n832\n00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:31,592\n>> That's right.\n\n833\n00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:35,177\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwhat's next on our agenda here Ronnie?\n\n834\n00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:39,383\n>> We are now moving into the areas\nof some of the quirky kind\n\n835\n00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:44,013\nof events that can happen in\nterms of troubleshooting.\n\n836\n00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:47,246\n>> You know troubleshooting switches, and\nkind of inadvertently showing you guys.\n\n837\n00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:48,812\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH].\n>> Troubleshooting today when I wasn't\n\n838\n00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:50,316\ngetting out to the time server.\n\n839\n00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:53,896\nTrouble shooting switches is\na little bit challenging sometime.\n\n840\n00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:54,556\n>> Yep.\n>> Right?\n\n841\n00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:58,306\nWhen you're trouble shooting layer three\nissues, you have a whole suite of tools.\n\n842\n00:43:58,306 --> 00:44:01,636\nYou can use ping and trace route and\nstuff like that to find your problems and\n\n843\n00:44:01,636 --> 00:44:02,630\nisolate them.\n\n844\n00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,860\nWhen you're trouble\nshooting layer two issues,\n\n845\n00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,620\nit's much more challenging, all right.\n\n846\n00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,630\nSo fortunately Cisco has a lot of\nreally cool features turned on,\n\n847\n00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,580\nthat will help you to identify problems.\n\n848\n00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:18,480\nAnd some of the issues that Cisco calls\nout in the objectives are things that,\n\n849\n00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,800\nif they actually occur, the switch\nis gonna be blasting it in the logs.\n\n850\n00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,850\nYou'll know that there's a problem.\n\n851\n00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,080\nSo it's pretty neat that you get that in\nthere, that you can see those kind of\n\n852\n00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,120\nproblems, and you can spot them and\nsort them out, right?\n\n853\n00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,680\nSo we're gonna talk about troubleshooting.\n\n854\n00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,460\nWe've only got a handful of minutes\nleft in this segment, so maybe we'll do,\n\n855\n00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,810\nlet's start with a VLAN mismatch.\n\n856\n00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,690\nSo that doesn't take too long.\n\n857\n00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,070\nAnd then we'll get into trunks and\nstuff like that.\n\n858\n00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,730\nSo all right, so a VLAN mismatch.\n\n859\n00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,200\nWhen you take a switch and\nyou have an uplink.\n\n860\n00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,830\nA cable that runs from\none switch to another.\n\n861\n00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:01,395\nIt's possible you could configure\nyou know one VLAN on one end and\n\n862\n00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:02,330\nanother VLAN on the other.\n\n863\n00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,240\nAnd if there's a mismatch,\n\n864\n00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,600\nif the VLAN numbers don't match,\nthen that can cause some problems.\n\n865\n00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,930\nIt can cause traffic to bleed\nfrom one VLAN to another.\n\n866\n00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,170\nIt causes issues, but fortunately\nyour Cisco switches watch for that.\n\n867\n00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:14,810\nThey see it.\n\n868\n00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,370\nThey pay attention, and\nthey will actually warn you about it.\n\n869\n00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:19,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n870\n00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,970\nThe nice thing is don't forget that, when\nyou're actually are troubleshooting stuff\n\n871\n00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,400\nlike this, if you're using SSH or\nTelnet to go in, one of the key\n\n872\n00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,250\ncommands that really helps you is make\nsure you turn on that terminal monitor.\n\n873\n00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,480\nA lot times us checking the logs,\n\n874\n00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,750\ndon't get me wrong that's the best\nthing that we can do when this happens.\n\n875\n00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,590\nBut in terms of seeing it happen,\n\n876\n00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,510\nterminal monitor is actually the command\nthat we're gonna want to see.\n\n877\n00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,760\nA lot of times you actually see where it\ntells you, there is this VLAN mismatch.\n\n878\n00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,110\nAnd that's one that eases\nthings that I love about Cisco.\n\n879\n00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:54,320\nIt doesn't give you a cryptic particular\ntype of message that comes out,\n\n880\n00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,940\nit really kind of tells you,\nthis is what the problem is,\n\n881\n00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,530\nyou need to do something about it.\n\n882\n00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,067\nOn that point, again, we actually\nshould begin to take a look at that.\n\n883\n00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:05,455\nSo VLAN mismatches here,\ncan happen in many different ways.\n\n884\n00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:06,575\nAnd I've done this before.\n\n885\n00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:09,245\nWhere I've actually set some\nthings in the wrong V Lan.\n\n886\n00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:12,295\nOr taking a physical K-1\nplug into the wrong one.\n\n887\n00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:16,100\nThinking that I've plugged it\nn to the correct port as well.\n\n888\n00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,060\nSo you ready for an example?\n\n889\n00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,430\n>> Let's take a look at\nthese two switches here.\n\n890\n00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,640\nI have switch one and switch two.\n\n891\n00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,270\nAnd the switch on the left, I have FA0/3\nand it's configured on VLAN 222 and\n\n892\n00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,560\nit's set up for that.\n\n893\n00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,720\nAnd I've got it flagged as an access port.\n\n894\n00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,860\nNow that port has a crossover cable in it,\n\n895\n00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,868\nand it runs right over to switch\nthree on this other switch, right?\n\n896\n00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:38,320\nAnd I've got it set as an access port,\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n897\n00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:44,148\nsay switch port access\nVLAN which I can't spell.\n\n898\n00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:46,230\nVLAN 333, okay.\n\n899\n00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,180\nSo it's now on a different VLAN, okay.\n\n900\n00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:56,310\nNow these cords are up linked into each\nother, they're hard set as switch boards,\n\n901\n00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,330\nand they are supposedly up and running.\n\n902\n00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:06,070\nSo if I do a show IP interface brief, and\n\n903\n00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,103\nI filter it just to catch 0/3.\n\n904\n00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:12,200\nSo there we go, so it is showing it's up.\n\n905\n00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,700\nActually, is the other one up?\n\n906\n00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,140\nYeah.\nSo it's showing it up, up.\n\n907\n00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,670\nSo it looks like the interface is happy,\nand it's up, and there we go.\n\n908\n00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,710\nNow, the reality is, though,\nthat we've got a VLAN mismatch going on.\n\n909\n00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,450\nWe don't know that.\n\n910\n00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,450\nWe don't see it.\n\n911\n00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,610\nWell, we don't see it, but\n\n912\n00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:33,870\nother protocols do, specifically CDP,\nCisco Discovery Protocol.\n\n913\n00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,340\nIn the background, every Cisco device\nis running a service called CDP,\n\n914\n00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,440\nCisco Discovery Protocol,\n\n915\n00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,110\nand it lets us find other devices\nthat were plugged into it.\n\n916\n00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,143\nSo if I do a, do show CDP neighbors,\n\n917\n00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:50,518\nthat will show the other Cisco\ndevices that I'm plugged into.\n\n918\n00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:54,561\nAnd so it shows how I'm plugged\ninto switch one on port three.\n\n919\n00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:55,878\nRight there, I can see it.\n\n920\n00:47:55,878 --> 00:48:00,212\nAnd on this one,\nif I do a do show Neighbors.\n\n921\n00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,220\nI can see switch 2, on port 3.\n\n922\n00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,320\nThey see each other on port 3.\n\n923\n00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,012\nCDP also communicate\nthe VLAN numbers though.\n\n924\n00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,060\n>> Right.\n\n925\n00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,810\n>> And so\nthere is a VLAN mismatch going on here.\n\n926\n00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,380\nAnd it may not have detected it,\ncuz CDP is not fast.\n\n927\n00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,600\nIt runs, what is it,\nrunning every 90 seconds?\n\n928\n00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n929\n00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,530\n>> So it could take it\na little while to spot that.\n\n930\n00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:24,258\nBut when it does,\nthere will be messages in our log that\n\n931\n00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:28,950\nactually identify that mismatch,\nthat things are not right.\n\n932\n00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:37,970\nAnd you know, looking in here,\nit is not turning up just yet.\n\n933\n00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,960\nBut if we give it enough time, it will\nspot us, and it will start to warn us.\n\n934\n00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,840\nSo it's cool.\n\n935\n00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840\nIf you don't see it, it will turn up.\n\n936\n00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,470\nAnd you know,\nwe might wanna just wait, and\n\n937\n00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,680\nafter the break they should be in there.\n\n938\n00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,090\nSo we can kinda cook on there.\n\n939\n00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,830\nBut CDP will discover it.\n\n940\n00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,870\nIf they don't,\nwe can usually discover it, right?\n\n941\n00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,360\nWhatever that device is on the wrong port\nwon't be able to see the other host that\n\n942\n00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:01,090\nis should, and you can start to kinda\ntroubleshoot that down and track it down.\n\n943\n00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,150\nMapping what ports are plugged\ninto what switches and\n\n944\n00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,060\nthen looking at the VLANs\nassigned to them.\n\n945\n00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,760\n>> And Don gave us a very good and\n\n946\n00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,410\nvery realistic way that we do begin\ntroubleshooting the ID of the VLANs here.\n\n947\n00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,770\nBy simply bringing up the actual\nconfigurations on both.\n\n948\n00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,790\nVerifying that that's\nthe port we're connected to,\n\n949\n00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,680\nwe do want to make sure that\nthose V LAN numbers match.\n\n950\n00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,180\nYup.\n\n951\n00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,310\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwhy don't we do this; let's stop here and\n\n952\n00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,050\ntake a break.\n\n953\n00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,000\nThat should be plenty of time for\nCDP to see our problem.\n\n954\n00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,180\n>> Yup [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n955\n00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,200\nwhen we get back, we're gonna continue\nto look at VLAN mismatches and\n\n956\n00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,010\nwe got several other different problems\nwe met troubleshooting the switch.\n\n957\n00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,060\nWe're gonna take a look at\neach one as we move along.\n\n958\n00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:43,297\nSo stay tuned, and we'll have\nmore Cisco excitement after this.\n\n959\n00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:44,342\n[MUSIC]\n\n960\n00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:51,870\n[SOUND]\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n961\n00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:59,820\nDuring the break, I was trying to spot the\nVLAN mismatch and I never did get the log.\n\n962\n00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:05,070\nSo, I flipped them over to trunks and\nI generated some native VLAN mismatches.\n\n963\n00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,730\nIt is detecting those apparently, and the\nswitch is not reporting the other ones.\n\n964\n00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,940\nThis may need to update our firmware or\nsomething.\n\n965\n00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,530\nSo let me show you the native VLAN\nmismatch, it's the same thing.\n\n966\n00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:20,550\nWhen you have a trunk between two\nswitches, when you are trunking.\n\n967\n00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,390\nYou've gotta uplink that's\ncarrying multiple VLANs.\n\n968\n00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,720\nYou can define a native VLAN\nif it's an 802.1Q trunk.\n\n969\n00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,369\nYou specify what VLAN\nyou want to be untagged,\n\n970\n00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:34,200\nto not have any tags on it when\nit sends the packets along.\n\n971\n00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,240\nAnd every other VLAN has to be tagged.\n\n972\n00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,990\nWell the default is VLAN 1, but if you've\nchosen a different VLAN, and it's wrong\n\n973\n00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,420\non the different ends of the cable, the\nswitch will see that and it'll report it.\n\n974\n00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,180\nSo I want to show that to you and\ngive you an idea how that works.\n\n975\n00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,770\nSo let me take my switch and\n\n976\n00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,610\nI'm just gonna shut that port\ndown while I work on it.\n\n977\n00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:01,400\nIt's always a good idea to shut switch\nports down when you're messing with\n\n978\n00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,330\nyour trunks.\n\n979\n00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,980\nYou don't have to, but you can end\nwith some weird errors if you don't.\n\n980\n00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,220\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go through here and\n\n981\n00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,150\njust throw out a couple of commands.\n\n982\n00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:19,360\nFirst off, I'm gonna set the trunk\nencapsulation to use 802.1Q.\n\n983\n00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,484\nI'll set the trunk, let's go mode,\n\n984\n00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:30,120\ntrunk, and switchboard no negotiate.\n\n985\n00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,770\nSo I'm gonna force it to be a trunk.\n\n986\n00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,240\nAnd I'm I'll do the same thing\nover here on the other switch.\n\n987\n00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,875\nOh shoot.\n\n988\n00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,810\n[LAUGH] Got my commands out of order.\n\n989\n00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:50,380\nAll right, so there we go, we'll do that.\n\n990\n00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,409\nAll right.\n\n991\n00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:55,767\nSo now they're both set to be trunks.\n\n992\n00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:56,382\n>> Right.\n\n993\n00:51:56,382 --> 00:52:03,730\n>> And then I can say,\nswitch port, trunk, native VLAN.\n\n994\n00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,171\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n995\n00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:06,262\n>> And the default is one.\n\n996\n00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:09,565\nMaybe on this one I'll set it to 222, and\n\n997\n00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:14,130\non this one I will say switch\nboard trunk native vlan 333.\n\n998\n00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,170\nAll right, so,\nthose are non matching numbers.\n\n999\n00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,130\nAnd if I do a no shut down and\nbring that up.\n\n1000\n00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,950\nWhat's gonna happen is\nthe trunk will work.\n\n1001\n00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:23,460\nIt'll come up.\n\n1002\n00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,636\n>> Huh.\n>> We're running it.\n\n1003\n00:52:24,636 --> 00:52:25,886\nOne que on both ends.\n\n1004\n00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:27,872\nBut right away\n>> There you go\n\n1005\n00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:29,150\n>> I should start getting some messages,\n\n1006\n00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,030\nand it's actually CDP.\n\n1007\n00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,480\n>> Huh.\n>> It's Cisco Discovery Protocol\n\n1008\n00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,350\npicking this up.\n\n1009\n00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,030\nSo, I can see CDP native VLAN mismatch.\n\n1010\n00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,660\nNative VLAN configured on\nFastEthernet0/3 is 3 33.\n\n1011\n00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,520\nOn the other side, it's 2 22.\n\n1012\n00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,140\nSee.\n\n1013\n00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,930\nVery specific.\n\n1014\n00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,640\nTelling us exactly what we're looking for.\n\n1015\n00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,640\nAnd that's what I was trying to\ntell you guys before the break.\n\n1016\n00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,990\nIt's really cool It spots it,\ntells us exactly what's wrong, and\n\n1017\n00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,192\nit's gonna spam us with that.\n\n1018\n00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:56,630\nIt's gonna keep telling us, I believe it's\nevery 60 seconds or every 30 seconds.\n\n1019\n00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,230\nNo, I guess it would be tied to CDP,\nso it should be every 90 seconds.\n\n1020\n00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,150\nSo it is gonna continue to warn us.\n\n1021\n00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,490\nSo if you just ignore it now, it's gonna\nkeep bugging you about it until you-\n\n1022\n00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,330\n>> 'Til you fix it.\n\n1023\n00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,120\n>> Yep\n>> And that's a good thing for\n\n1024\n00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,230\nus to actually remember that,\nis that even though it may be annoying,\n\n1025\n00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,640\nit's not something we should just ignore.\n\n1026\n00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,970\nIt's something that is telling us\nthat we need to pay attention to,\n\n1027\n00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,480\nsomething that we should continue\nto actually monitor and ensure that\n\n1028\n00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,440\neverything is actually going on and\nworking the way that it actually needs to.\n\n1029\n00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,360\nFor us here, on this idea of the VLAN.\n\n1030\n00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,600\nNow, Don mentioned this\nidea of the native VLAN.\n\n1031\n00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,870\nSo, Don, is there a good reason for\n\n1032\n00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:36,390\nme to actually choose a native VLAN\nbesides just using the regular VLAN 1?\n\n1033\n00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,350\n>> On the older switches, there was.\n\n1034\n00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:45,390\nRight, on older switches, tagging a frame\non the switch required processor power,\n\n1035\n00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,410\nand it could create\nperformance segregation.\n\n1036\n00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:52,700\nSo you used to pick your busiest VLAN, and\nthat was the one that you made native.\n\n1037\n00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,350\nNowadays, we really just do it for\nsecurity reasons.\n\n1038\n00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,830\nThe native VLAN is VLAN 1,\nwhich is usually our management VLAN.\n\n1039\n00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,610\nAnd so\na lot of us will set it to something dead.\n\n1040\n00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,500\nAn empty VLAN.\n\n1041\n00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,320\nSo if an attacker gets into it,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n1042\n00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,120\nIt's an empty Vlan.\n\n1043\n00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,239\nSo you might pick something like VLAN 999,\nand\n\n1044\n00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:11,920\njust stick things on there and that's it.\n\n1045\n00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,246\n>> Yep.\n\n1046\n00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:17,400\n>> So anyhow that is an example right\nthere of that detection of VLAN mismatch.\n\n1047\n00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,000\nSo if that happens,\nthe switch does tell you..\n\n1048\n00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,680\nAnd you can get in there and\nfix it so pretty handy.\n\n1049\n00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,153\nLet me undo this so\nwe don't have to see these messages.\n\n1050\n00:54:28,153 --> 00:54:32,488\n>> Now loggon is putting\neverything back into place here.\n\n1051\n00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:36,145\nWhat we're gonna take a look at next\noverall is actually just some of\n\n1052\n00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:41,355\nthe different ways that Cisco displays\nsome other statistical information for\n\n1053\n00:54:41,355 --> 00:54:45,720\nus that we need to be\naware of as CCENTs here.\n\n1054\n00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,710\nAnd again, a lot of times when we're\nactually doing this right at the beginning\n\n1055\n00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,380\nwe may not know what\nall these numbers mean.\n\n1056\n00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,373\nWe wanna make sure that we actually go\nover at least the most common ones for\n\n1057\n00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:55,980\nourselves as we actually get started.\n\n1058\n00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,136\nSo we're gonna end up taking a look\nhere at the idea of things like mismatch\n\n1059\n00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:01,669\nto use.\n\n1060\n00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:05,693\nWe're gonna be talking about duplex\nmismatches Some other types of information\n\n1061\n00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,350\nthat we see.\n\n1062\n00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,620\nMake sure that we can spot it.\n\n1063\n00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n1064\n00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,770\nCisco switches, when you buy them\nfrom the factory they have an MTU,\n\n1065\n00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,110\na maximum transmission unit,\nthat's a sign.\n\n1066\n00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,390\nAnd it can vary from switch to switch,\n\n1067\n00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:23,170\nand you can configure that yourself,\nbut it is,\n\n1068\n00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:28,290\nif you do a show interface for any of your\ninterfaces, the MTU is buried right here.\n\n1069\n00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,650\nMTU 1500 bytes.\n\n1070\n00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,890\nSo it's telling us right here\nthat if we receive a frame,\n\n1071\n00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,790\nthat frame should not any\nbigger than 1500 bytes.\n\n1072\n00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,890\nBut it is something that you can adjust.\n\n1073\n00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,600\nAnd the important thing here is\nif you adjust it on a switch,\n\n1074\n00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,150\nyou've actually got to adjust it on\nthe entire pathway from the source of\n\n1075\n00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,290\nthe communication to the end\nof the communication.\n\n1076\n00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,750\nOtherwise you're gonna have some problems.\n\n1077\n00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,310\nAll right.\n\n1078\n00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:56,999\nSo Cisco switches will do detection to see\nwhen that MTU doesn't match and so again,\n\n1079\n00:55:56,999 --> 00:56:00,250\nit's warning you and\nletting you know about the problem.\n\n1080\n00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,194\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n1081\n00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:05,630\nyou can adjust the MTU on\nthe entire switch if you want.\n\n1082\n00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:11,330\nBy doing the system mtu command and then\nspecifying what you want the size to be.\n\n1083\n00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,868\nNow, 1500 through 1998\nare considered normal size.\n\n1084\n00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:18,441\nMost systems will reject anything\nover about 1518 though, so\n\n1085\n00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,020\nyou don't normally go all the way up.\n\n1086\n00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,652\nSome systems support jumbo frames, right,\nand you'll see that on like storage area\n\n1087\n00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:30,174\nnetworks, where our, iSCSI networks,\nreally, and they'll do like 9000.\n\n1088\n00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:33,588\nWe actually do that on one of ours here,\nso we've got like 9000 bytes.\n\n1089\n00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:36,596\nBut it just depends on your network.\n\n1090\n00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:39,890\n1500 is really common.\n\n1091\n00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,242\nBut if I adjust it on a switch, right?\n\n1092\n00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:45,320\nLike if I take switch number two here.\n\n1093\n00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,100\nAnd if I take it and I say, system mtu,\nand bump it into something lower.\n\n1094\n00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,603\nActually, it's gonna\ndisconnect me isn't it?\n\n1095\n00:56:51,603 --> 00:56:56,132\nIf I bump into something lower,\nit is gonna cause some issues.\n\n1096\n00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:58,780\nLet me see.\n\n1097\n00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,320\nSome switches will actually let\nyou adjust it per interface.\n\n1098\n00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,147\nI don't think this one does,\nbut let me see if it'll let me.\n\n1099\n00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,820\nNo, it's not, is it?\n\n1100\n00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,770\nYeah, it's not gonna let me do it.\n\n1101\n00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,680\nAll right, well you know what,\nI'll try it on the whole one.\n\n1102\n00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,080\nAnd I might have to console into\nthis switch if it disconnects me.\n\n1103\n00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,680\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and say system mtu.\n\n1104\n00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,020\nNow, this is one that does require\na reboot on most switches.\n\n1105\n00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,940\nSo if I bump this one up to say like,\n1518, right?\n\n1106\n00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,790\nSo, it's gonna tell me and\n\n1107\n00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,000\nit says, changes will take\naffect after the next reload.\n\n1108\n00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,840\nSo, I'm just gonna get out of config,\nwe'll go ahead and save,\n\n1109\n00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,380\nand then we'll do a reload.\n\n1110\n00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,800\nAll right.\n\n1111\n00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,844\nSo it's definitely gonna disconnect\nme during the reload and\n\n1112\n00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,959\nI guess I could fire up\nthe old console now.\n\n1113\n00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:48,380\nLet's see here.\n\n1114\n00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,300\nWhose going to,\nRonnie are you going to do that one?\n\n1115\n00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:50,970\n>> I am.\n\n1116\n00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,270\n>> Okay, so, you're watching the reload?\n\n1117\n00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,410\nLet's switch over to your screen\n\n1118\n00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:00,795\nand, yeah,\nI've got the console to the other switch.\n\n1119\n00:58:00,795 --> 00:58:02,525\nAll right, so there it goes reloading.\n\n1120\n00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:08,820\nIt's gonna reload, and when it comes up,\nit's gonna have this new MTU size of 1518.\n\n1121\n00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,750\nNow, that's not gonna match with\nwhat's on the other switch,\n\n1122\n00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,350\non switch one,\nwhich has the default MTU of 1500.\n\n1123\n00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,930\nCisco discovery protocol\nwill pick up on that.\n\n1124\n00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:21,410\nThere's other protocols\nthat'll pick up on it too.\n\n1125\n00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,100\nSo, for example,\n\n1126\n00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,030\nin the router world if you're running\nOSPF, OSPF very sensitive about MTUs.\n\n1127\n00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,920\nIt'll pick this up and\nyou won't be able to build adjacencies.\n\n1128\n00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,840\n>> Right.\n>> That's one of the key things\n\n1129\n00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,358\nthat has to match.\n\n1130\n00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:33,380\nIf you remember from the OSPF episode,\n\n1131\n00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,760\nthere were several things that had\nto match, MTU was one of them.\n\n1132\n00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,850\n>> Yup.\n\n1133\n00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:43,095\nSo, there it is as the switch is actually\nexpanding out the operating system, on\n\n1134\n00:58:43,095 --> 00:58:49,245\ninto RAM, we should be just a short moment\naway from hopefully seeing a mismatch.\n\n1135\n00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,735\n>> And this is another one where it's\nCDP that'll discover the mismatch, and\n\n1136\n00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:55,125\nCDP runs every 90 seconds by default.\n\n1137\n00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,525\nSo you kinda have to wait and see.\n\n1138\n00:58:57,525 --> 00:59:01,585\nEventually it'll pick that up,\nit kick in and recognize it.\n\n1139\n00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,110\nSo it may take a little while.\n\n1140\n00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,010\nWe'd also see the error\non the other switch too.\n\n1141\n00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,807\nIt should be detecting on both sides.\n\n1142\n00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:07,504\n>> Yep.\n\n1143\n00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:12,369\n>> All right, well while we're\nwaiting on that, what happens if my\n\n1144\n00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:17,770\nmaximum MTU is set to 1500, and\nI receive a frame that's 1518?\n\n1145\n00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,550\nWhat happens?\n\n1146\n00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,620\nIt's called a giant.\n\n1147\n00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:27,950\nOur frame that comes in is too large and\nso we get an error and that's detected.\n\n1148\n00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:33,199\nNow, I mentioned that term because a giant\nis something that the switch tracks and\n\n1149\n00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,646\nwe can detect it even if CDP doesn't.\n\n1150\n00:59:35,646 --> 00:59:38,665\nIf CDP fails to detect it,\nwe can spot it ourselves, and\n\n1151\n00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:40,800\nso we'll do that here in just a moment.\n\n1152\n00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,920\nSo there's yours coming up.\n\n1153\n00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,620\nAnd I got my interface just came up.\n\n1154\n00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,440\nAnd haven't picked it up yet,\nbut it might.\n\n1155\n00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,500\nSo, let's say for a minute that\nit doesn't pick it up, right?\n\n1156\n00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,970\nWell, if you take a look\nat the interface itself.\n\n1157\n00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:04,060\nRonnie, can you do a show interface,\ndo a show interface FAA0/3.\n\n1158\n01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,880\nWhen we do the show interface command,\n\n1159\n01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,420\nit gives us all the layer two\ninformation about the port,\n\n1160\n01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,180\nand at the bottom of it you'll\nsee a ton of numbers, right?\n\n1161\n01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,800\nSee where it's got five minute input,\nfive minute output rates?\n\n1162\n01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,070\nThat's how much bandwidth\nthe line is consuming.\n\n1163\n01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:24,080\nAnd then after that,\nyou get a bunch of statistics,\n\n1164\n01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,420\na bunch of data about what's going on,\nokay.\n\n1165\n01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,070\nAnd if you look at what's in there,\nyou see normal stuff, right?\n\n1166\n01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:35,210\nThe 23 packets input or\noutput, that's normal stuff.\n\n1167\n01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,030\nBut you'll also see errors in there.\n\n1168\n01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,780\nWe've got runts and giants.\n\n1169\n01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,580\nA giant is where we get a frame\nthat's over the MTU size, a runt\n\n1170\n01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,140\nis where it's below the minimum, most\npeople don't realize there's a minimum and\n\n1171\n01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,310\nwhat did you say it was running?\n\n1172\n01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,060\n>> Usually about 46 bytes in terms\nof the actual data pack itself.\n\n1173\n01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,060\nIf you include the headers,\nyou've about 72 bytes here.\n\n1174\n01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,338\nSo usually under 72 bytes,\n\n1175\n01:00:57,338 --> 01:01:00,678\nthat's when you actually start to\nseeing runts come along as well.\n\n1176\n01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:03,650\nNow, there was something that you told me\nabout that I didn't realize, which was\n\n1177\n01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:08,680\nthe idea of babbles, here to, on the ideal\nzero interface, so that was kind of neat.\n\n1178\n01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,110\n>> Some of these don't really\npertain to ethernet ports.\n\n1179\n01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,760\nSome of these come from serial.\n\n1180\n01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,050\nSo ,you'll see lost carrier and\nno carrier, right?\n\n1181\n01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:20,450\nThose are from the serial days, and so\nyou're not really gonna get much here.\n\n1182\n01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:24,170\nBut Cisco follows a consistent interface\non these, and that's why it's included.\n\n1183\n01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,980\nBabbles are the same way.\n\n1184\n01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,680\nBut other ones are ones that\nwe need to be aware of, and\n\n1185\n01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,045\nCisco even calls them\nout in the objectives.\n\n1186\n01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:32,968\nSo, let's talk about the ones\nthat are called out, right?\n\n1187\n01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:36,440\nSo runts and giants, those are a couple.\n\n1188\n01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,460\nCRC.\n\n1189\n01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,156\nA CRC is a Cyclical Redundancy Check,\n\n1190\n01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:45,765\nevery frame that's sent on your network\nwill have a CRC attached to it.\n\n1191\n01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:50,250\nIt's a little has that's\ndone of the frame.\n\n1192\n01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,505\nAnd if there's electrical interference or\nanything like that on the line,\n\n1193\n01:01:54,505 --> 01:01:57,827\nthe frame will get changed,\nand when the receiver gets it,\n\n1194\n01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:00,695\nthey can look at the CRC and\ncompare it to the frame.\n\n1195\n01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:04,790\nAnd if they don't match up, it means the\nframe was damaged and we can throw it out.\n\n1196\n01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:09,640\nIf you see increments here,\nif you see 1 CRC or 1,000 CRCs or 10,000,\n\n1197\n01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,505\nthat's a good sign that you've\ngot interference on the line, or\n\n1198\n01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:17,254\nlike a failing cable,\nloose cable connectors can do that too.\n\n1199\n01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:18,125\n>> Yup.\n\n1200\n01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,657\n>> All right, we've also got,\n\n1201\n01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:22,367\nwhat were some of the other\nones that are called out?\n\n1202\n01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:26,174\n>> Let's see, talked about drop packets.\n\n1203\n01:02:26,174 --> 01:02:27,313\n>> Drop packets, yes.\n\n1204\n01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:30,065\n>> So, do we see that, I don't think\nwe actually see that one in here?\n\n1205\n01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:34,845\nIs that one of our numbers?\n\n1206\n01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:38,575\nNope, so drop packets,\nyou get in a few scenarios.\n\n1207\n01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:41,170\nWe haven't learned about\naccess control lists yet.\n\n1208\n01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,130\nACLs, that's gonna be in\nanother one of our shows.\n\n1209\n01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,680\nIf there's an access control\nlist that is blocking traffic,\n\n1210\n01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,990\nyou set up these security filters,\nthen those are drop packets.\n\n1211\n01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,700\nOnes that we drop, we don't allow through.\n\n1212\n01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,160\nBut the other time we have drop packets\nare when we exceed the bandwidth\n\n1213\n01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,310\nof our line.\n\n1214\n01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,480\nWhen our bandwidth is fully consumed,\n\n1215\n01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,700\nanything else that's coming\nin starts to get dropped.\n\n1216\n01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,270\n>> Yeah.\n\n1217\n01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,150\n>> And how do we know that?\n\n1218\n01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,550\nWell, when you look up towards the top\nyou'll see the output queue and\n\n1219\n01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,290\nhow it's at 0/40 right now, right?\n\n1220\n01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,153\nThat's the output queue.\n\n1221\n01:03:12,153 --> 01:03:15,990\nYou don't have an incoming queue, things\nare already filtered before they come in.\n\n1222\n01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:20,360\nSo, on the output queue,\nif you see it sitting at 40/40,\n\n1223\n01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,990\nthen that means you're likely\ngetting drop packaged right now,\n\n1224\n01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,603\nthat you've got things that are not\nmaking it out that interface.\n\n1225\n01:03:25,603 --> 01:03:26,103\n>> Huh.\n\n1226\n01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,550\nThe other one that we wanna take\na look at was this idea what,\n\n1227\n01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,090\nhold on, I keep copying things,\n\n1228\n01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:36,085\ncuz I can't right-click or do,\nis this idea of late collisions, right?\n\n1229\n01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:36,877\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, for\n\n1230\n01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,471\nus in terms of late collisions,\n\n1231\n01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:41,730\nusually what that means is another\none of those mismatch errors.\n\n1232\n01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:44,700\nWe've already talked about the idea\nof VLAN mismatch errors and\n\n1233\n01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,640\nthe native VLAN mismatch errors.\n\n1234\n01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,732\nUsually when you see the idea of late\ncollisions as a duplex error is when we\n\n1235\n01:03:50,732 --> 01:03:53,900\ntend to see that one side's\nset to auto dup, or not auto,\n\n1236\n01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,561\nfull duplex and half duplex.\n\n1237\n01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:57,345\nI was thinking auto duplex.\n\n1238\n01:03:57,345 --> 01:04:01,275\nSo, usually when you have something\nlike that, that means one side is able,\n\n1239\n01:04:01,275 --> 01:04:05,448\nactually, to do as fast as they can, That\nside is only able to send or receive, and\n\n1240\n01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:09,270\nso it's getting what we call the idea\nof late collisions happening there.\n\n1241\n01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,570\n>> Yeah, and duplex mismatches are a lot\nless common today than they used to be,\n\n1242\n01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:18,210\ncuz on Gigabit networks, they are all full\nduplex, they don't run in half duplex.\n\n1243\n01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,550\nBut if you still have a hundred\nmegabit network, that can happen.\n\n1244\n01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,770\n>> Yep.\n>> And in fact, the link between these\n\n1245\n01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,060\nswitches is 100 megabits.\n\n1246\n01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,730\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n1247\n01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,660\n>> Okay.\n>> Ronnie, on the switch that you're on,\n\n1248\n01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,850\ngo into interface fa0/3.\n\n1249\n01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:35,439\nAnd manually set yours to full duplex.\n\n1250\n01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,170\nAnd I'm on the other end of that.\n\n1251\n01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,790\nAnd I'm gonna manually\nset mine to half duplex.\n\n1252\n01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,740\nOkay?\n\n1253\n01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,740\nWhen you change the duplex, the interface\nwill go down and come back up.\n\n1254\n01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,320\nSo there it is.\n\n1255\n01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,150\nIt's up.\n\n1256\n01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:49,840\nWe are now up.\n\n1257\n01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,460\n>> Yes.\n\n1258\n01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,650\n>> But our duplexes don't match.\n\n1259\n01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,270\nYou know,\nyour switch hasn't detected it yet.\n\n1260\n01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,240\n>> Yes, I know.\n>> But mine is going nuts over here.\n\n1261\n01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,020\nSo on Ronnie's side.\n\n1262\n01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,170\n>> Yes.\n>> His switch doesn't realize that\n\n1263\n01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:04,060\nthere is a duplex mismatched, and so it\ncan start to create those late collisions.\n\n1264\n01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:04,700\n>> Yes.\n\n1265\n01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,780\n>> On my side though,\nlet's switch over to my computer.\n\n1266\n01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,480\nMy switch is now spamming me, saying,\nlook, we got a duplex mismatch.\n\n1267\n01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,570\nThat on the on the end,\nit's set to full duplex.\n\n1268\n01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,730\nBut on this end, we are not full duplex,\nwe're half duplex.\n\n1269\n01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,750\nSo we got a mismatch.\n\n1270\n01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,660\nSo it's actually gonna warn us about that.\n\n1271\n01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,030\nAnd the thing about the duplex modes,\n\n1272\n01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:28,690\nwhen I'm in half duplex,\nI can only send or receive data.\n\n1273\n01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,170\nI can only do one at a time,\nbut Ronnie can do both.\n\n1274\n01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,700\n>> Yep.\n\n1275\n01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,640\n>> And so, he might be sending\nsomething at the same time as I am, and\n\n1276\n01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,210\nmy system won't be able to receive it,\nand so it's gonna freak out.\n\n1277\n01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,730\nNow, it would be really hard for\nus to create that.\n\n1278\n01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:45,990\nIf we start continual pings or\nwhatever, we'll probably.\n\n1279\n01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:50,530\nWe'll probably just not be\nin the right time slot.\n\n1280\n01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:54,140\nSo, it's really difficult to create it but\nit will happen.\n\n1281\n01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:58,370\nAnd, I guess it coulda happened\non its own by now, if I,\n\n1282\n01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,960\nlet me just pull up FA0/3 and\nsee if we got anything.\n\n1283\n01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,680\nI think you put up four, didn't you?\n\n1284\n01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,480\n>> Did I?\n>> No, no, I got it.\n\n1285\n01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,462\n>> Okay. No. >> Did a typo and\ncorrected it last second.\n\n1286\n01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:08,050\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH].\n\n1287\n01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,260\n>> So I'm not showing much in there.\n\n1288\n01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,060\nBut anyhow, it will happen.\n\n1289\n01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:15,060\nSo those duplex mismatches, it's another\none that the switch warns you about.\n\n1290\n01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,385\nIt's shouting it out and\nit's CDP detecting it.\n\n1291\n01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:18,350\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> So the messages come up\n\n1292\n01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,370\npretty frequently.\n\n1293\n01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,930\nAnd so you know to go in there and fix it.\n\n1294\n01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:26,150\nIf you're using autodetect duplex,\n\n1295\n01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,900\nthen that can happen even between\nthe switch and a client, and so that's why\n\n1296\n01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:35,360\nthey normally recommend that you manually\nset your duplex to take care of that.\n\n1297\n01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,970\n>> Yeah.\nUsually when we start taking a look at\n\n1298\n01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:40,820\nthis idea of, well,\nam I gonna set it always or not,\n\n1299\n01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:44,300\na lot of times what you hear is between\n2 devices like switches to switches,\n\n1300\n01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,660\nyou wanna make sure you\nmanually set those.\n\n1301\n01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,500\nIf I'm only plugging in my PC\ndirectly into that switch port,\n\n1302\n01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,810\nyou can leave the actual port at auto.\n\n1303\n01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,800\nBut it just depends on\nwhat you choose to do.\n\n1304\n01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,710\nUsually that's where you tend to see\nit most often in terms of setting it.\n\n1305\n01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:00,770\nYep.\nAnd then the last one that Cisco calls out\n\n1306\n01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,310\nare the general input/output errors.\n\n1307\n01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,730\nSo here's an input error and\nhere's an output error.\n\n1308\n01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,950\nAnd basically these\nare kind of general errors.\n\n1309\n01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:13,250\nThey normally indicate\nfailures on the interface.\n\n1310\n01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,360\nAnd typically hardware failures.\n\n1311\n01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,550\nSo you can have ports on\na switch that are dying.\n\n1312\n01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:22,520\nAs your switch gets older,\nindividual ports can burn out.\n\n1313\n01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,210\nSo that will normally manifest itself\nhere as either input or output errors.\n\n1314\n01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,020\nThe frustrating part is when\na full duplex communication,\n\n1315\n01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,710\nyou actually have 2 different.\n\n1316\n01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:33,020\nDevices in there a transmitter and\na receiver.\n\n1317\n01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,400\nAnd so it's very common that\njust the transmitter burns or\n\n1318\n01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,090\njust the receiver burns.\n\n1319\n01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,820\nAnd in that scenario you'll start\nto see errors on one of the others.\n\n1320\n01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,710\nSo, it's a good way to\nspot hardware errors.\n\n1321\n01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:46,195\nCable.\nErrors can manifest this way.\n\n1322\n01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,135\nCable errors normally show up\nas CRC failures though but\n\n1323\n01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:52,085\nit can show up as input and\noutput errors too in certain scenarios.\n\n1324\n01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:56,945\nNow there's a lot of other information\ntucked away in that output but\n\n1325\n01:07:56,945 --> 01:07:59,890\nit's not something that we\ntruly need to worry about.\n\n1326\n01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,810\nIt's not on the CCNT exam.\n\n1327\n01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:05,300\nSo the ones that we kind of ran over there\nare the ones we need to worry about.\n\n1328\n01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,670\nOh, you know we left off framing.\n\n1329\n01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:13,370\nSo CRCs, runts, giants, dropped packets,\nlate collision, Input output areas,\n\n1330\n01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:16,100\nthose are the ones that we need\nto be familiar with on the exam.\n\n1331\n01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,930\nIf they give you a question and\nthey show you that output, and the runts\n\n1332\n01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:24,130\nnumber is incremented, you need to know\nthat's a bad thing, and what causes it.\n\n1333\n01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:27,190\nIn this case,\nframes coming in too small, or giants,\n\n1334\n01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,865\nframes coming in over the MTU size.\n\n1335\n01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:35,530\nAlso, late collision, typically actually,\nkind of easy to spot what the problem is.\n\n1336\n01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:37,800\nFraming is a tough one.\n\n1337\n01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,920\nFraming.\n\n1338\n01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,130\nOur switches that we buy today are almost\nalways ethernet switches and so\n\n1339\n01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,570\nthey're set to use ethernet framing.\n\n1340\n01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:51,510\nWhat if you plug into another device\nthat is token running or if it's set for\n\n1341\n01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:57,410\none of the older ethernet standards like\n802.2 where we're doing 802.3 on these.\n\n1342\n01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,990\nSo if you're set to use one\nof those older standards and\n\n1343\n01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,570\nyou plug in,\nit's gonna get a framing mismatch.\n\n1344\n01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,870\nThe frames are gonna be built different.\n\n1345\n01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,860\nTheir headers are gonna be wrong.\n\n1346\n01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:09,460\nAnd either your switch just\nwon't recognize it at all, and\n\n1347\n01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,170\nyour dropped packets is\ngonna start climbing up, or\n\n1348\n01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:15,480\nyour switch will recognize it and\nit'll be flagged as bad frames.\n\n1349\n01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:21,470\nAnd so you'll start to see error messages\nregarding that and for the life of\n\n1350\n01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:26,660\nme I could not find a non ethernet switch\nto be able to demonstrate this cuz who has\n\n1351\n01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:30,900\ntoken equipment laying around anymore or\neven the ethernet standard stuff.\n\n1352\n01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,430\n>> So for us remember that that's\nthe whole idea there right.\n\n1353\n01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:37,770\nSo you see where they tell you that you're\nrunning token ring or fitting on one,\n\n1354\n01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,770\nand then ethernet on the other.\n\n1355\n01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,330\nMore than likely,\n\n1356\n01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:43,450\nthat's gonna be one of the framing issues\nthat we have to actually be aware of,\n\n1357\n01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,000\nbecause essentially, the packets,\nor the frames I should say,\n\n1358\n01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,550\ntechnically, are built differently.\n\n1359\n01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:54,850\nSo a switch that only sees ethernet Is not\ngoing to really recognize anything else.\n\n1360\n01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,450\nSo, let's make sure that we remember that.\n\n1361\n01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:00,770\n>> My recommendation to everybody\nis to follow the OSI model when you\n\n1362\n01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,680\ntroubleshoot stuff.\n\n1363\n01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,010\nEspecially with switches.\n\n1364\n01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:06,060\nSwitches are layer two devices but\nI always start at layer one.\n\n1365\n01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,960\nLook at your physical cables.\n\n1366\n01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,640\nA loose cable will have you guessing for\ndays on end.\n\n1367\n01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,110\nSo, you know, look at your cables,\ncheck them first.\n\n1368\n01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,680\nThen move up to layer 2, right?\n\n1369\n01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,410\nLook at just your,\ndo you have link lights, you know?\n\n1370\n01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:19,490\nDo you have basic connectivity?\n\n1371\n01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1372\n01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,140\n>> And then start digging in from there.\n\n1373\n01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,110\nSo, you know?\n\n1374\n01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,880\nYou can find a lot of\ninformation that way.\n\n1375\n01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,710\nYou can discover problems,\nroot them out, and then get them sorted.\n\n1376\n01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,055\n>> The key thing is, don't assume, right?\n\n1377\n01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:32,960\n[LAUGH] There's so much information\nthat Cisco really provides for you.\n\n1378\n01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,980\nYou don't really have to\nmake a lot of assumptions.\n\n1379\n01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,740\nAt layer 1 or layer 2.\n\n1380\n01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,480\nSo I always hear this from people like,\n\n1381\n01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,670\nyou don't have to worry about\ntrouble shooting cables anymore\n\n1382\n01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,010\nbecause most of the switches do\nwhat we call auto MBIS right?\n\n1383\n01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,930\nI don't care what type of cable you do,\nbut you can't always assume that\n\n1384\n01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:52,320\nevery single switch that you come\nacross that is gonna be that way.\n\n1385\n01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,950\nSo it could be just as simple\nas not using the proper,\n\n1386\n01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:00,730\nCable, and we can troubleshoot\neverything else in the world, and\n\n1387\n01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:05,600\nliterally start pulling our hair, until\nwe realize it's just the wrong cable.\n\n1388\n01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,920\nEven worse, it may still be the cable,\neven though it's not the wrong type of\n\n1389\n01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,720\ncable, that somebody may\nhave just incorrectly made.\n\n1390\n01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,960\nAnd that, I can't tell you how many hours\n\n1391\n01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,390\nthat that could cause you if you\ndon't start off with layer one.\n\n1392\n01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,850\nWhere you're just in there like,\nI've troubleshooted everything!\n\n1393\n01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,240\nEverything is set perfectly!\n\n1394\n01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,040\n>> Yes.\n>> But remember,\n\n1395\n01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,730\nif that sending pin is not hooked up to\nthe receiving port on the other side,\n\n1396\n01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:28,730\nyou're in trouble.\n\n1397\n01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:29,310\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1398\n01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,240\n>> So yes, make sure you troubleshoot\neven those small things.\n\n1399\n01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:32,800\n>> Yes.\n\n1400\n01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,750\nJust take advantage of the tools.\n\n1401\n01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,550\n>> Oh yes.\n>> That are built into the switch because\n\n1402\n01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,130\nthere's a lot.\n\n1403\n01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:39,440\nThe higher end switches have even\nmore tools in them like UDLD and\n\n1404\n01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,950\nall that kind of good stuff.\n\n1405\n01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,850\n>> Oh yes.\n>> But in the lower\n\n1406\n01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,820\nend switches you've at least\ngot your status counters and\n\n1407\n01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,950\nyour error messages and\nyou've also got your logs.\n\n1408\n01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,885\n>> Yes.\nYou can see a lot in there, and\n\n1409\n01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:50,015\nyou can spot those and\nget in there and fix the problem.\n\n1410\n01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,445\n>> Yeah,\nthe only last thing I wanna mention is,\n\n1411\n01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:56,285\nDon has used debug commands throughout\nour episode which is great.\n\n1412\n01:11:56,285 --> 01:11:58,465\nRemember though, on a production switch,\n\n1413\n01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:02,865\nonce you run those debug commands,\nmake sure you turn them off afterwards.\n\n1414\n01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:06,295\nNot every single debug command\nwill cause problems, but\n\n1415\n01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:10,440\nsome of them that actually\nsend everything that there is,\n\n1416\n01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,690\nit can cause enough issues to cause\nperformance problems on the switch itself.\n\n1417\n01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:17,400\nSo always make sure after\nyour run debug commands,\n\n1418\n01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,380\ndo your un-debug all\nis usually what we do.\n\n1419\n01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,900\nTurn them all off.\n\n1420\n01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,890\n>> Yeah, pretty much every debug\ncommand affects performance,\n\n1421\n01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,680\nthey all cause a slowdown on the device,\nthe router or the switch.\n\n1422\n01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,389\nYou always want to make sure\nyou turn those off, absolutely.\n\n1423\n01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,370\nAlright well ladies and\n\n1424\n01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:35,150\ngentleman I think that pretty much wraps\nup troubleshooting Cisco switches and\n\n1425\n01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:39,070\nit wraps up the rest of our switch\ntopics at least for the CCENT show.\n\n1426\n01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:45,330\nRemember in the CCNA show that we all jump\nright back into switches where we've got\n\n1427\n01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,820\nlayer three switching and a bunch\nof other little bells and whistles.\n\n1428\n01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,530\nSpanning tree protocol and\nall that good stuff.\n\n1429\n01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:53,050\nSo those are all things\nthat we'll jump into but\n\n1430\n01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:56,150\nI think that pretty much raps it up for\nthe switches.\n\n1431\n01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:57,550\n>> Sure does.\nYeah.\n\n1432\n01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,730\n>> Yeah.\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show\n\n1433\n01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:05,690\nas always remember if you have any\nquestions whatsoever live

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:37,555\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTv.\n\n6\n00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:38,846\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:40,241\nToday, with Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,130\nHow is it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,140\n>> It's going well,\n\n10\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,270\nwe are ready to go on our way,\nto the destination where we're gonna hit.\n\n11\n00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,660\n>> Pumped up and energized.\n\n12\n00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,440\nToday we have an action\npacked double header,\n\n13\n00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,140\na double dose of CCENT,\nstraight from our friend upgrade.\n\n14\n00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,930\n>> That's right.\n\n15\n00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,602\n>> Anyhow.\n[LAUGH] Have you seen the movie Idiocracy?\n\n16\n00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:02,245\n>> Yeah.\nI have.\n\n17\n00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:06,290\n>> The guy upgraded with 2\nD's cuz it's a double dose.\n\n18\n00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,810\nThat's what we've got for\nyou today, a double dose of Cisco.\n\n19\n00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,580\nWe are gonna be jumping\ninto some neat topics.\n\n20\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,350\nIn the last couple episodes,\nwe focused on basic configuration.\n\n21\n00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,120\nWe did a basic switch configuration,\nbasic router configuration.\n\n22\n00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,850\nWe saw some security features.\n\n23\n00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,910\nWe did SSA.\n\n24\n00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,640\nTried those kind of things.\n\n25\n00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,340\nNow we are going to start\ntackling our networks.\n\n26\n00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,820\nCuz if we're gonna route well you need to\nroute between networks, which means you\n\n27\n00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,810\nneed to know how to create networks and\nso that's what we're gonna tackle today.\n\n28\n00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,310\n>> And now that doesn't mean\nthat we actually take a break\n\n29\n00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,270\nfrom all the stuff we've been doing.\n\n30\n00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,430\nKeep practicing those commands.\n\n31\n00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,370\nKeep making sure that you're\nactually keeping up with it and\n\n32\n00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,930\ngetting faster each and every day.\n\n33\n00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,430\nSo once you actually do that,\nalso remember that there's\n\n34\n00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,650\nfoundational concepts that we have to\nunderstand so we actually went through\n\n35\n00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,790\nthe foundational concepts of the basic\nconfiguration on routing and switching.\n\n36\n00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,530\nAnd now we're actually going into\nthe concepts on routing again and so\n\n37\n00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,650\nwe're taking a deeper\ndive is what we're doing.\n\n38\n00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,550\n>> Yep.\n\n39\n00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,570\nSo where we wanna start today\nis we're gonna talk about IPv4,\n\n40\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,790\nInternet Protocol Version 4,\n\n41\n00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,700\nwhich is the most popular network\nprotocol in the entire world.\n\n42\n00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,690\nSo when you're out in the field and\n\n43\n00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,844\nyou go to route traffic, it's typically\ngoing to be IP version four traffic.\n\n44\n00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:25,620\nNow on IPv4's heels is IPv6,\n\n45\n00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,920\nInternet protocol version 6, which I\nlike to say in the next 5 to 7 years,\n\n46\n00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,710\nsome people say sooner, that it will\ntake over as the most common protocol.\n\n47\n00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,329\nAnd so we need to know it also,\nit is on the exam,\n\n48\n00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,760\nmoreso now with the new\nversion of the exam.\n\n49\n00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,320\n>> So we're actually going to be\ntaking a little bit deeper look.\n\n50\n00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,000\nYou may have at least seen in IP version 6\naddress if you've been doing an IP config\n\n51\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,530\non your Windows computer or something else\nlike that, but you should actually start\n\n52\n00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,100\nseeing it, we're gonna actually take\na little bit deeper understanding of it.\n\n53\n00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,610\nThat we had talked about the different\ntypes of addresses as well and\n\n54\n00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,530\ntalked about where they are actually going\nto be used the majority of time inside\n\n55\n00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,720\nof our networking.\n\n56\n00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,280\nSo, where are we going to\nget started today, Don?\n\n57\n00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,730\n>> All right, well let's see.\n\n58\n00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,279\nLet's start with just IPv4 addresses,\nright.\n\n59\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,190\nBasically, with IPv4 addresses,\nat this point,\n\n60\n00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,160\nby the time you're here\nwatching our Cisco show,\n\n61\n00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,850\nyou should already have a pretty good\nunderstanding of how IPv4 addresses work.\n\n62\n00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,540\nIf you don't, if you've never been exposed\nto this before, well we're gonna cover it\n\n63\n00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,270\nhere in this show, but a lot of our\nviewers already have that knowledge.\n\n64\n00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,810\nSo my recommendation to you is, if you've\nnever dealt with subnetting before,\n\n65\n00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,470\njump over to the network plus show.\n\n66\n00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,940\nIt's part of your membership here,\n\n67\n00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,976\nso at no extra charges,\nyou just jump right over there.\n\n68\n00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:44,640\nAnd Wes and I and Ronnie,\nyou and I, you were on the show.\n\n69\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,584\nWe filmed some really good episodes.\n\n70\n00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:51,080\nWe did more than one episode\ncovering IPv4 as far\n\n71\n00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,990\nas its IP address structure,\nit's subnetting, and all that.\n\n72\n00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,300\nWe go into great depth.\n\n73\n00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,820\nBut for those of you that already have\nthe knowledge, what we're gonna do is,\n\n74\n00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,490\nwe're gonna do the basically\nthe things we gotta know for the exam.\n\n75\n00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,850\nRight?\nThe stuff that is really important for us.\n\n76\n00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,970\nAnd so\nthis may serve as a good refresher for\n\n77\n00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,330\nthose of you that already\nhave the knowledge.\n\n78\n00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,490\nCuz even if you are a hardcore\nnetworking guy, you know.\n\n79\n00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,430\nAnd you do it for a living,\nand that's your sole job.\n\n80\n00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,350\nYou'll still don't do\nsubnetting very often.\n\n81\n00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,980\nSo it is a skill that is hard\nto keep up and maintain.\n\n82\n00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,932\n>> And it's a skill that you need to know\non the exam I'd say incredibly well.\n\n83\n00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,220\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah mostly because\n\n84\n00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,700\nthey don't let you use the Windows\ncalculator during the exam.\n\n85\n00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,500\nSo that means that anything you\ndo has to be done by hand and\n\n86\n00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,040\nthat's always a bit of a challenge, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,100\nSo let's start off real basic here\nwith what is an IPv4 address, right?\n\n88\n00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,200\nSo let me fire up my notepad here.\n\n89\n00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,013\nSo an example of an IPv4 address, let me\njust throw out one of the most popular\n\n90\n00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:57,765\nones that we see a lot,\nis that guy right there, 192.168.0.1.\n\n91\n00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,770\nAnd I'm gonna make that a little bigger.\n\n92\n00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,388\nJust so we can kinda make sure\nit shows up well on television.\n\n93\n00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,850\nAll right 192.168.0.1 that's\na pretty common IP address.\n\n94\n00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,690\nWhen we look at that as human\nbeings we see four numbers\n\n95\n00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,430\nseparated by three periods, right?\n\n96\n00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,030\nSo 192 and then a period,\n168, 0, and 1, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,660\nBut that's just a representation for\nus as human beings.\n\n98\n00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,140\nThat's not how the computer sees it,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,970\n>> The computer sees it as\nwhat we call binary, right?\n\n100\n00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,550\nSo binary for us is a different\nnumbering system in which computers know\n\n101\n00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,520\nthe language of and instead of having ten\ndigits, zero through nine, that you and\n\n102\n00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,085\nI learned in school, binary is only\nabout two digits, zeros and ones.\n\n103\n00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,529\nAnd so what we do is we take those\nnumbers that we just saw and\n\n104\n00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,791\nif we convert them into binary, okay,\n\n105\n00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,770\nthat will actually be a representation\nof how the computer actually sees it.\n\n106\n00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,080\nNow remember, if you don't actually have\nexperience in the conversion of this,\n\n107\n00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,220\nyou wanna go back and check out that\nNetwork Plus episode for us too.\n\n108\n00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,750\n>> And you know what, let me just,\nI wanna double check myself here.\n\n109\n00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,550\nI'm not sure I got 168 right.\n\n110\n00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,580\nSo in real life land you\ncan cheat a little bit, and\n\n111\n00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,360\nyou can use the windows calculator, which\nwill let you punch in a number like 168,\n\n112\n00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,980\nand switch it to binary and\nit'll flip it for you.\n\n113\n00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,280\nAnd that's what a lot of us do.\n\n114\n00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,040\nBut on the exam,\nyou don't have that available.\n\n115\n00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,020\nSo, we're gonna kind of\nreview that process by hand.\n\n116\n00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,400\nBut I just did this one in my head.\n\n117\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880\nSo I wanted to make sure that\nI didn't make a mistake.\n\n118\n00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,780\nSo what I've written is the same\nthing as the first number.\n\n119\n00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,820\nIt's the same thing as 192.168.0.1.\n\n120\n00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,020\nJust written in binary.\n\n121\n00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,550\nAnd I left the periods in\nbecause that's how we see it.\n\n122\n00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,290\nBut the computer doesn't\neven need the periods.\n\n123\n00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,840\n>> Nope.\n\n124\n00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,490\n>> And so\nwhat it does is it leaves those out.\n\n125\n00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,850\n>> The dots just make it easier for us to\nunderstand as humans, instead of having to\n\n126\n00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,630\nlearn 32 bits of binary coding, right, we\nbreak it up into four 8-bit chunks for us.\n\n127\n00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,720\nSo remember that the first number that\nwe see right there in decimal notation,\n\n128\n00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,380\nwe call it dotted decimal notation,\n\n129\n00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,530\nwhat we're now seeing is\nthe idea of the binary itself.\n\n130\n00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,170\nAnd so to make it easier for you and me,\n\n131\n00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,936\nwe still break it up with\nthe dots even in binary.\n\n132\n00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:15,820\n>> So all three of these addresses on the\nscreen are actually the same exact thing.\n\n133\n00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,610\nAn IPv4 address is a 32 bit number,\n\n134\n00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,550\nand what that means is that\nit's made of 32 1's and 0's.\n\n135\n00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,060\nAnd each bit can only hold two values.\n\n136\n00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,790\nIt's a base two number,\nthat's what binary is, and so\n\n137\n00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,660\nyou're either going to have a one or\na zero there.\n\n138\n00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,290\nWe take that 32-bit number and\nwe throw the dots in\n\n139\n00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,020\nthere to break it up into the 8-bit\nchunks which makes it smaller.\n\n140\n00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,470\nThose are our octets, and they're called\nan octet because each one is 8-bits.\n\n141\n00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,251\nAnd then we take those individual 8-bits,\nso like these first eight here, and\n\n142\n00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,166\nwe convert those into decimal.\n\n143\n00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,991\nAnd decimal is the base ten mathematics\nthat we all learned in elementary school.\n\n144\n00:07:55,991 --> 00:08:00,539\nYou have zero through nine, and then when\nyou get to ten you go to Two digits.\n\n145\n00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,460\nAnd it's 10 through 19.\n\n146\n00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,108\nWell, actually it's 10 through 99.\n\n147\n00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,785\nRight?\nAnd then you go to three digits and\n\n148\n00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,830\nit's 100 to 999 and\nthen you go to four digits.\n\n149\n00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,020\nSo that's base 10 mathematics that\nwe all know and can do in our head.\n\n150\n00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,290\nWe could all do binary in our head if\nthat's what we learned in kindergarten but\n\n151\n00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,365\nthat's not how things work.\n\n152\n00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:24,680\n>> Nope, but if you want to actually\nstart doing that, keep doing conversions.\n\n153\n00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,660\nThe more often you do\nthe 8 bit conversions,\n\n154\n00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,850\nthe more that you'll start\nseeing the patterns.\n\n155\n00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,700\nSo practice is key here\nif you want to do it.\n\n156\n00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,480\n>> And you know Ronnie,\n\n157\n00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,790\nI know that most of our viewers on\nthis show already know how to do this.\n\n158\n00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,150\nBut I suck at it.\n\n159\n00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,360\nSo, let's just do an example here so\n\n160\n00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,210\nthat everybody kind of gets\nan idea of how that works.\n\n161\n00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,577\nAnd I'll take another IP\naddress like 172.16.0.1.\n\n162\n00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:50,150\nThat's another common one.\n\n163\n00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,470\nAnd if I want to translate it\nfrom decimal into binary well,\n\n164\n00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,340\nI kinda break it up number by number,\nright?\n\n165\n00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,620\nSo I start with 172.\n\n166\n00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,400\nAnd it's part of an octet.\n\n167\n00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,010\nSo there's 8 bits.\n\n168\n00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,532\nAnd each bit has a value\nassociated with it.\n\n169\n00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,925\nThe first bit is 128.\n\n170\n00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,695\nThe second one is 64, the third one is 32.\n\n171\n00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:20,380\nThen 16, then 8, then 4,\nthen 2, and then 1.\n\n172\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,250\nAnd what you'll notice is\nI started with 128 and\n\n173\n00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,400\nI'm basically halving the number for\neach one, right?\n\n174\n00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,690\nCutting it in half as we\nget down all the way to 1.\n\n175\n00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,630\nSo, if I have a number like 172,\n\n176\n00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,350\nI just have to do some fairly\nsimple mathematics here.\n\n177\n00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,460\nWhich unfortunately is the exact kind of\nmathematics that I have a problem with.\n\n178\n00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,160\nSo, if I take 172, I need to say to\nmyself, is that bigger than 128?\n\n179\n00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,800\nAnd if it is,\nthen I will need that 128 value,\n\n180\n00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,030\nand I take a 172 and\nI subtract 128 which results in 44?\n\n181\n00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,530\n>> Yes.\n\n182\n00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,030\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n183\n00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,100\nAgain, my basic math is terrible,\nI always have to double-check my math.\n\n184\n00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,420\nAnd on the exam,\nif you're doing this by hand\n\n185\n00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,850\n>> Yeah, make sure to double-check it.\n\n186\n00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,570\n>> Yeah, make sure you write out the\nproblem, so that you can easily recheck.\n\n187\n00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,500\nSo, then I say, is 44 bigger than 64?\n\n188\n00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,680\nIt is not, so I don't need that one.\n\n189\n00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,970\nIs 44 bigger than 32?\n\n190\n00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,150\nYes it is.\n\n191\n00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,750\nSo I need that one and so\nI'll take 44 minus 32 which equals 12 and\n\n192\n00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,130\nthen that is smaller than 16 but\nbigger than 8.\n\n193\n00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,760\nAnd so\nnow I subtract 8 which leaves me with 4.\n\n194\n00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,370\n4 is exactly 4.\n\n195\n00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,810\nSo I need that one, and\nwhen I take away 4, I end up with 0.\n\n196\n00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,978\n0 is smaller than 2 and smaller than 1.\n\n197\n00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:47,218\nAnd so at the end of the process I now\nknow that 172 written in binary would be,\n\n198\n00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:53,855\nand I just start from the top and\ngo down, it's gonna be 10101100, right.\n\n199\n00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:58,254\nThere is 172 written in binary.\n\n200\n00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,632\nNow, when you get really\ngood at it like Ronnie,\n\n201\n00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:04,950\nthat's where you start doing it in your\nhead or you just have it memorized, right?\n\n202\n00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,019\nSome of them are easy,\nlike here I've got 16.\n\n203\n00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,495\nWell, 16 is one of the placeholders, so\nI know that, that bit's gonna be a 1 and\n\n204\n00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:17,604\nall of the others are gonna be a 0, and\nand so, oh I lost my lost my 1, there.\n\n205\n00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:21,845\nSo, I was like why are there only seven,\nwhat happened here?\n\n206\n00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:25,690\nI've created some all new addressing\nscheme. So I know for 16 that it's gonna\n\n207\n00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,188\nbe 0 for 128, 0 for 64, 0 for 32,\n\n208\n00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:34,824\n1 for 16 and then 0 for 8, 4, 2 and 1.\n\n209\n00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:35,324\nRight?\n\n210\n00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,540\n0 is the easiest.\n\n211\n00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,920\n>> Eight 0's in a row.\n\n212\n00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,140\n>> Yep, it's all 0's.\n\n213\n00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,010\nAnd then 1 is pretty easy also\nbecause it's a place holder.\n\n214\n00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,540\nI picked a pretty softball\nnumber to convert.\n\n215\n00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,070\nSo converting it from decimal into\nbinary is pretty straightforward, right?\n\n216\n00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,330\nBut the key thing to remember\nis you're going to have to do it\n\n217\n00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,680\nby hand on the exam.\n\n218\n00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,855\nSo, do not rely on calculators.\n\n219\n00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:02,720\n>> Nope, keep practicing, now is the key.\n\n220\n00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,840\nGetting faster is also the key.\n\n221\n00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,030\nThe exam is timed, so\n\n222\n00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,890\nyou actually have to make sure that\nyou know this relatively well.\n\n223\n00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,920\n>> Yep.\n\n224\n00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,390\nAnd you're not just gonna\nbe converting IP addresses.\n\n225\n00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,140\n>> Right.\n>> You're also gonna be converting\n\n226\n00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,280\nsubnet masks.\n\n227\n00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,860\nAnd that's really\nthe important thing here.\n\n228\n00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,390\n>> It is.\n\n229\n00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,820\n>> When we have an IP address,\n\n230\n00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,270\nespecially with a router involved, we're\ngoing to need to deal with subnet masks.\n\n231\n00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,740\nNow, there is a time when\nwe don't need subnet masks.\n\n232\n00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,068\nAnd that's if we're doing what's\ncalled classful addressing.\n\n233\n00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,395\nSo let's take a minute, Ronnie, and\n\n234\n00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,824\ntalk a little bit about\nthe different classes, right?\n\n235\n00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,490\nThe different types of\naddresses that are out there.\n\n236\n00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,114\n>> So when we take a look at the idea\nhere, again the idea of review here is\n\n237\n00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:42,821\nthat IP addresses were really valid\non the Internet at the beginning.\n\n238\n00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:48,073\nAnd the organization,\nIETF or ICANN or IANA.\n\n239\n00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:48,590\n>> Changes over the years.\n\n240\n00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,950\n>> Whichever one has been\nchanged over time here.\n\n241\n00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,370\nThey started out last year's thinking\nthat the Internet was really going to be\n\n242\n00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,980\nfor businesses.\n\n243\n00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,360\nRight?\nSo they actually separated out\n\n244\n00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,030\ninto different classes here.\n\n245\n00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,235\nLarge businesses got what we'll\ncall the idea of a Class A address.\n\n246\n00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:06,090\nOkay, and then we had Class B and Class C\naddresses that were valid on the Internet.\n\n247\n00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,100\nYou have two other classes, Class D and E.\n\n248\n00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,870\nA class A address for\nus essentially range from\n\n249\n00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,290\nthe 1 network all the way\nthrough the 126 network for us.\n\n250\n00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,850\nA class B address range from\n128 all the way through 191.\n\n251\n00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,690\nAnd the Class C network begins at\n192 going all the way through 223.\n\n252\n00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,615\nClass D is actually for what we call\nmulti-cache which begins at 224.\n\n253\n00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:34,340\nAnd then there's also Class E\naddresses that are experimental.\n\n254\n00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,090\nFor us, we're really only focusing\nin on those first three classes.\n\n255\n00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,480\nAnd you may be saying, well,\nokay, that makes sense.\n\n256\n00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,630\nBut why in the world don't we really have\nto worry about the idea of subnet masks?\n\n257\n00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,610\nBecause I know that IP addresses and\nsubnet masks always go hand in hand.\n\n258\n00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,260\nIn classful addressing for\n\n259\n00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,470\nus, every single class has\na default subnet mask for us here.\n\n260\n00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,390\nAnd you do take a look at what Don\nhas actually put up here for us.\n\n261\n00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,680\nHe actually gives us the entire ranges of\nhis classes here, but the subnet masks for\n\n262\n00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,030\nthem are actually relatively easy again,\nokay?\n\n263\n00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,950\n>> Yep, so in the classful days\nthings were a lot easier, right.\n\n264\n00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,230\nThey were a lot less efficient, which\nis why we're no longer in those days.\n\n265\n00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,040\nBut in the classful days, you basically\nhad three ranges, a Class A, Class B and\n\n266\n00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,590\na Class C.\n\n267\n00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,390\nNow, the IP addresses,\nthe address space as\n\n268\n00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,390\na whole goes from 0.0.0.0 all\nthe way through 255.255.255.255.\n\n269\n00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,320\nFour 0's, that is 32 zeroes in binary.\n\n270\n00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,850\nFour sets of 255,\nthat is four sets of eight 1's, or 32 1's.\n\n271\n00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,670\nSo you're going from 32 0's all the way\nto 32 1's, that's the lowest and\n\n272\n00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,620\nthe biggest number that you can\nhave in the IPv4 address space.\n\n273\n00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,150\nNow the addresses that start with 0,\n\n274\n00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,160\nso in other words all 0 through\n0.255.255.255, those are reserved, so\n\n275\n00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,570\nwe're not allowed to use those.\n\n276\n00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,950\nThey're blocked off by the IANA and\n\n277\n00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,470\nthe IETF, the various agencies\nthat manage the addresses.\n\n278\n00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,770\nBut right after that,\nwe start our classful addresses.\n\n279\n00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,683\nAnd the classful addresses started with\n1.0.0.0 and went all the way up to 126.\n\n280\n00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:19,058\nSo, basically if you see an address\nthat starts with a 1 through a 126,\n\n281\n00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,941\nthat falls in the Class A range.\n\n282\n00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:25,540\nNow a Class A is a pretty big network.\n\n283\n00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,250\nBut let me hold off on that for a just a\nsecond, I don't wanna get ahead of myself.\n\n284\n00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,820\nAfter the Class A's,\nwe then have 128 all the way through 191,\n\n285\n00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,325\nthose are the Class B's, and we have 192\nthrough 223, those are the Class C's.\n\n286\n00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:46,427\nNow we don't necessarily have to mention\nsubnet masks here because it's actually\n\n287\n00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:50,601\nthis first octet, this first number that\ntells us whether it's a class A, B, or C.\n\n288\n00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:55,474\nSo what Cisco wants you to know for\nthe exam is a little more than what\n\n289\n00:15:55,474 --> 00:16:01,848\nNetwork Plus or those other guys want It's\nnot so much that the number is one to 126.\n\n290\n00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:05,972\nIt really comes down to what the number\nwould start with if we converted it to\n\n291\n00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,190\nbinary.\n\n292\n00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,992\nRight?\n\n293\n00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:13,765\nIn a class A network,\nthe first octet starts\n\n294\n00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:20,325\nwith zero followed by seven more bits,\nright?\n\n295\n00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:24,215\nSo we can spot a class A because\nthat first octet starts with zero.\n\n296\n00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:28,265\nIn an eight bit number,\nthat first bit is worth 128, right?\n\n297\n00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,400\nThat's the 128 bit.\n\n298\n00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,420\nIf we don't have it, if we have a zero,\n\n299\n00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,850\nthat means the number we have\nis gonna have to be beneath 128.\n\n300\n00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,000\nSo that's how we're able to spot that one.\n\n301\n00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400\nA class B has to be over 128, right.\n\n302\n00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,380\nSo for it the first octet, let me try and\n\n303\n00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,590\nkeep this a little neat,\nstarts with one zero.\n\n304\n00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,148\nOne, two, three, four,\nfive, six, there we go.\n\n305\n00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:57,112\nAll right, and here we can spot\nthat the first bit is 128 so\n\n306\n00:16:57,112 --> 00:17:00,790\nthat means if it's gotta be\na one we're gonna be over 128.\n\n307\n00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,150\nThe second bit though,\nthat zero, that's 64.\n\n308\n00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,440\n128 plus 64 is 192.\n\n309\n00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,570\nSince we've got a zero for\nthat second bit, we can't have the 64.\n\n310\n00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,470\nThat means that we have to be over\n128 cuz we've got the one here and\n\n311\n00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,600\nwe have to be below 192 cuz\nwe've got the zero there.\n\n312\n00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,500\nAnd that's why this range\ngoes from 128 to 191.\n\n313\n00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:30,371\nAnd then the Class Cs, well they're\nvery similar in that they start with.\n\n314\n00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:33,410\n>> A one, one, zero, yep.\n\n315\n00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,025\n>> Oops.\n\n316\n00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,230\n[LAUGH] Get my caps lock going on there.\n\n317\n00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,600\n>> So these begin with the one, one, zero.\n\n318\n00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,610\nAnd if you convert that again from the\nbinary, that's 128 plus 64, which is 192.\n\n319\n00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,000\nAnd then for us here, the upper range\nof that would actually be the 223.\n\n320\n00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,580\nNow we can't go to one, one, one, so\n\n321\n00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,290\nthat's where we're gonna\nalso end up as well.\n\n322\n00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,370\n>> Yep, one, one,\none would set us at 224 or higher.\n\n323\n00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,940\nAnd so, that kinda locks in our Class C.\n\n324\n00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,260\nSo these are the class ranges.\n\n325\n00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,450\nSo in the early days of the Internet,\n\n326\n00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,950\nwe didn't have subnet masks because\nwe just looked at the first octet.\n\n327\n00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,290\nAnd the first octet told us\nwhat our subnet mask was.\n\n328\n00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,023\nNow, when we say a subnet mask, just for\n\n329\n00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:15,040\na review we just wanna review\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n330\n00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,490\nWell, every IP address is\nactually made up of two pieces.\n\n331\n00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,050\nI know it looks like four pieces,\nbut it's really just two.\n\n332\n00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,030\nYou have a network ID, and\nyou have a host ID, right.\n\n333\n00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,870\n>> That's it, yep.\n\n334\n00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,690\n>> The network ID identifies\nthe entire network that you're on.\n\n335\n00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,280\nAnd any computers that\nare on the same network can\n\n336\n00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360\ntalk to each other without\ngoing through a router.\n\n337\n00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,410\nIf you're on a different network,\n\n338\n00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,610\nyou're going to have to go through\na router to get there, all right.\n\n339\n00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,570\n>> So a lot of times you\nhear about analogies, right.\n\n340\n00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,360\nSo, don't forget the basic\nanalogy is relatively easy.\n\n341\n00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,470\nMultiple houses on the same street.\n\n342\n00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,730\nYour street would actually\nbe your network portion,\n\n343\n00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,210\nthe houses would be the individual\nnodes on that particular street,\n\n344\n00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,300\nwhich means that we all have\na shared common portion, and\n\n345\n00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,764\nthen individually you have\nyour own house numbers.\n\n346\n00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:56,911\n>> Yeah.\nTake our studio for example.\n\n347\n00:18:56,911 --> 00:19:01,171\nSo we're at 6933\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n348\n00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:01,752\nRight?\n\n349\n00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:05,049\nSo [CROSSTALK].\n\n350\n00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,488\nAll right, so there's our street address.\n\n351\n00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,749\n6933 Northwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n352\n00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:09,782\n>> You're going to get all\nyour fan mail here now.\n\n353\n00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,432\n>> I know.\n\n354\n00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,795\nYou know how I remember this,\nit's kind of sad how I remember this.\n\n355\n00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,433\n69, that's easy to remember.\n\n356\n00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,135\nAnd then 33.\n\n357\n00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:17,490\nHave you ever had Rolling Rock beer?\n\n358\n00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,420\n>> No I have not.\n\n359\n00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,430\n>> Just so you realize it's not a free\nendorsement, Rolling Rock is a terrible,\n\n360\n00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,005\nterrible beer.\n\n361\n00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's horrible.\n\n362\n00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,640\nPeople drink it though.\n\n363\n00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,060\nBut anyhow,\non the back they have the 33 written and\n\n364\n00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,320\nthat's how I remember\nour address every time.\n\n365\n00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,895\nAnyhow, so.\n\n366\n00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:36,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when you look at this address.\n\n367\n00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,560\nThe first part here is\nour building number.\n\n368\n00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,730\nWe are the only 6933 on\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n369\n00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,070\nThere is no other 6933 on\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n370\n00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,050\nThere is a 6935, right?\n\n371\n00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,085\nThat's the hair salon.\n\n372\n00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh there you go.\n\n373\n00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,870\n>> So it's an IT hair salon discount.\n\n374\n00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,490\nSo 6935.\n\n375\n00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,740\nIf I want to go over to that hair salon,\nit's right here on the same road as me.\n\n376\n00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,444\nI don't even really need to take the car,\nI can walk right over there, right?\n\n377\n00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:12,230\nSo that kind of idea of us being on\nthe same road, it's right there.\n\n378\n00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,790\nThere are other 6933's though,\njust on other roads.\n\n379\n00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,730\nAnd if I wanted to get to somebody else,\n\n380\n00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,938\nif I wanted to get to 3832\nNorthwest Fifth Boulevard.\n\n381\n00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,900\nRight?\nSo if I wanted to\n\n382\n00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,470\nget to this other address,\nit's a different road than what I'm on.\n\n383\n00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,020\nI'm gonna have to get in my car and I'm\ngonna have to follow a route to get there.\n\n384\n00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,542\nRight?\nI'm gonna have to take one road,\n\n385\n00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,260\ntwo roads, ten roads, who knows,\nyou've gotta fire up the GPS.\n\n386\n00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,630\nRight?\nAnd that's really what our routers do.\n\n387\n00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,286\nOur routers, our Cisco routers,\n\n388\n00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:45,550\nthey're the ones who figure out how\nto get from one road to the next.\n\n389\n00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,650\nThey don't really care about the hosts.\n\n390\n00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,520\nThey don't care about\nthe individual buildings.\n\n391\n00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,440\nThey care about the roads.\n\n392\n00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,320\nSo they can get you to the road you\ncan find the building on your own.\n\n393\n00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,540\nAnd so\nthat's where these subnet masks come in.\n\n394\n00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,560\nThe subnet masks tell us which part\nof this address is our network and\n\n395\n00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,050\nwhich part is our host, all right?\n\n396\n00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,240\nNow the network part is always on the left\nand the host is always on the right.\n\n397\n00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,700\nAnd so when we look at the address,\n\n398\n00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,580\nit's really just telling us\nwhere that point changes.\n\n399\n00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,082\nIn a class A network,\nthe address breaks down like this.\n\n400\n00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:26,101\nWhere the first eight bits\nare the network ID, and\n\n401\n00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,812\nthe remaining 24 bits\nare all part of the host ID.\n\n402\n00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:38,376\n>> And so you can see where a single Class\nA address would have a ton of different\n\n403\n00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,850\ndevices that we could actually put on it.\n\n404\n00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,110\nYou take those bits that are marked in H,\nyou start off with a one, and\n\n405\n00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,830\nyou can actually fill in\nall 24 of those ones,\n\n406\n00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,050\nyou get millions of devices\nper class A address.\n\n407\n00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,200\nClass B is just about divided evenly,\nright?\n\n408\n00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,480\nWhat you see there is you see the first\n16 bits as being the network portion, and\n\n409\n00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,700\nyou see the second 16 bits as\nbeing the host portion as well.\n\n410\n00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,963\nAnd so this particular type of network\nwas 16 bits as the host portion\n\n411\n00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,014\ngives you thousands,\n\n412\n00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:14,350\nactually tens of thousands of addresses\nper network that we actually have there.\n\n413\n00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,430\nAnd then in class A,\n\n414\n00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,240\nyou actually end up seeing where the first\n24 bits are the network portion,\n\n415\n00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,940\nand then the last eight bits\nare essentially the host portion.\n\n416\n00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,660\nSo you get a couple of hundred\naddresses there as well.\n\n417\n00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,370\nSo notice that in the host portion\nbreakdown, where the class A gives you\n\n418\n00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,240\nthe first eight bits of network,\nclass B, 16, and class C, 24 bits.\n\n419\n00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,120\n>> Yep, so if I'm on a class A network and\nmy address is 5.0.0.1.\n\n420\n00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,780\nAll right, the five,\nthat is my network ID.\n\n421\n00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,790\nAnd the 001 that's my host ID.\n\n422\n00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,700\nSo if I want to talk to somebody else, and\n\n423\n00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,636\ntheir address is 5.223.17.49, right?\n\n424\n00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:58,160\nIt doesn't matter that those last three\noctets are completely different than mine.\n\n425\n00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,800\nThey start with a five, I start with\na five, we're on the same network.\n\n426\n00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,300\nAll right, if my address started with 172\nand I was talking to somebody else that\n\n427\n00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,050\nwas 172, that's not enough to know because\nin a Class B the first two octets match.\n\n428\n00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,420\nMatched with a network ID.\n\n429\n00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,400\nSo, if I'm 172.16.0.1 and Ronnie is\n172.17.0.1, we both start with 172, but\n\n430\n00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,510\nthe second octet has to match also.\n\n431\n00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,360\nMine's a zero, Ronnie's is a one.\n\n432\n00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,330\nWe're not on the same network.\n\n433\n00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,410\nSo in a Class B,\nthe first two octets have to match.\n\n434\n00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,860\nAnd in a Class C,\nit's the first three octets.\n\n435\n00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,540\nSo when I threw out that very first\naddress at the beginning, 192.168.0.1.\n\n436\n00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,420\nThat's a Class C address,\n\n437\n00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,200\nthe first three octets\ndetermine the network ID.\n\n438\n00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,040\nSo 192.168.0 is the network.\n\n439\n00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,240\nAnd then .1 all the way through .254 those\nare the IP addresses that are on that\n\n440\n00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,940\nnetwork And,\nthose machines can talk to each other,\n\n441\n00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,635\nwithout going through a router.\n\n442\n00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,394\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so\n\n443\n00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:05,470\nthose are some of our classes.\n\n444\n00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,456\nNow, when we talk about the subnet masks,\nthe way that they're normally written,\n\n445\n00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:16,730\nthat subnet mask, it's normally\nwritten in this kind of format.\n\n446\n00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,230\nWhere it's 255.\n\n447\n00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,300\nWhatever, depending on the subnet.\n\n448\n00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,790\nSo I'm just gonna continue adding.\n\n449\n00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,730\nAnd, you know?\n\n450\n00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,230\nIf any of you guys are trying to,\nyou know, take notes or whatever.\n\n451\n00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,250\nI will post this text file,\nalong with the episode.\n\n452\n00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,600\n>> When it goes onto the itpro.tv website,\nyou'll be able to jump there.\n\n453\n00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,680\nAnd you'll see the episode.\n\n454\n00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,280\nAnd then the link for\nthis text file, will be beneath.\n\n455\n00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,750\nI do like to save that.\n\n456\n00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,375\nLet me, let me make sure, I save it\nreal quick, now that I've said that.\n\n457\n00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,530\n[LAUGH] If I forget, I'll regret it.\n\n458\n00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,650\nThere we go, okay.\n\n459\n00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,520\nSo basically, we've got these addresses,\nand these subnet masks.\n\n460\n00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,823\nAnd what the 255s are,\nif I were to convert those into binary,\n\n461\n00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:03,552\nwhat that really is, is.\n\n462\n00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:15,080\nIt's really written like this,\n\n463\n00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,880\nso that, what you're getting is 8 ones.\n\n464\n00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,960\nMeaning those first 8 bits are part of\nthe network ID, and then the remaining\n\n465\n00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,330\n24 bits are all zeros, meaning that\nthey are all part of the host ID.\n\n466\n00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,890\nAll right, so,\nlet me just kinda update the others.\n\n467\n00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,705\nI'm trying to cheat and, copy and paste,\nand it's not working out so well for me.\n\n468\n00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:37,590\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:44,006\n>> I'm a lazy typer,\n\n470\n00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:50,030\nand there we go.\n\n471\n00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:56,770\nSo these are pretty common, and what we're\ngonna do, will class form the networks.\n\n472\n00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,710\nOne thing that you'll learn about\nCisco equipment, is Cisco routers,\n\n473\n00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,360\nany Cisco router manufactured today,\nreally,\n\n474\n00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,180\nany Cisco router manufactured in the last\n10 years, is going to be classless.\n\n475\n00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,960\nAnd so, we're not gonna follow the class\nfor rules on it, and that means,\n\n476\n00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,730\nthat the first octet,\nno longer matters for us.\n\n477\n00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,275\nSo keep that in mind, and\nwe're gonna talk more about that,\n\n478\n00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:22,722\na little bit later in the show, I do want\nto cover some of the special ranges,\n\n479\n00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:26,477\nsome of you sharp-eyed viewers,\nmight have already noticed,\n\n480\n00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:31,470\nhow I skipped over 127, and\nyou might think that's odd, and it is odd.\n\n481\n00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,380\nBut there is a reason for that.\n\n482\n00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,880\nI also stopped at 223,\nand didn't go beyond that.\n\n483\n00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,170\nAnd there's a reason, that I did that too.\n\n484\n00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,650\nAnd so, we'll tackle that.\n\n485\n00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,620\nBut looking at the clock,\nwe are right at our first break.\n\n486\n00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,510\nDo you have anything to throw in,\nbefore we go for a break.\n\n487\n00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,740\n>> I don't think so.\nI think we're ready.\n\n488\n00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,320\n>> Okay.\n\n489\n00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,030\nLet's stop here.\n\n490\n00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,640\nWhen we get back, I wanna talk about\nsome of those exception ranges, and\n\n491\n00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,030\nspecial addresses, that we have,\n\n492\n00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,990\nbefore we really start getting\ninto the work of true subnetting.\n\n493\n00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:02,180\nSo let's stop here, we'll take a break,\nand we'll be back after these messages.\n\n494\n00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,242\n>> [SOUND].\n\n495\n00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:13,305\n>> All right, so before the break, we got\na chance to see some of the general IPv4\n\n496\n00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:18,368\naddresses, and kind of a class full\nranges, that are out there, I did mention\n\n497\n00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:23,530\nthat I skipped some numbers, so\nI do want to talk about that a little bit.\n\n498\n00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,406\nI mentioned one already,\n\n499\n00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:30,970\nthe all zero through 0.255.255.255,\nand that's reserved.\n\n500\n00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,260\nLet me just kinda clarify,\nwhat I mean by reserved.\n\n501\n00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,650\nIP Addresses, the Internet Protocol\nversion 4 addresses, are created, and\n\n502\n00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:46,488\nstandardized by the IATF, and then they\nare registered, and issued by the IANA.\n\n503\n00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:47,740\n>> Oh, wow [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,020\n>> And there's the ARIN-\n>> I know [LAUGH].\n\n505\n00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,900\n>> That's involved in some things,\nbut so, you have multiple,\n\n506\n00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,480\nlike governmental overseeing bodies,\nthat get involved in this stuff.\n\n507\n00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640\nAnd so when something is reserved,\nsometimes it's reserved by the IANA\n\n508\n00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,470\nbecause maybe there gonna issue it to\na different country, than you're in.\n\n509\n00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> Other times,\n\n510\n00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,850\nit's reserved by the IETF,\nbecause it's just outright blocked off for\n\n511\n00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,150\nsome other purpose,\nother than use on the internet.\n\n512\n00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,860\nOkay.\n\n513\n00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,380\nSo these ranges can be reserved for\nvarious reasons.\n\n514\n00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,590\nSome of the more common ones that we see,\nI skipped over 127.\n\n515\n00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,723\nSo let me add that, in here,\nto our list, 127.0.0.0.\n\n516\n00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:30,117\nAnd it goes all the way\nthrough 127.255.255.255.\n\n517\n00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,194\nThat, right there is not a class.\n\n518\n00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:36,270\nIt's not a Class A, Class B,\nClass C or whatever.\n\n519\n00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,380\nIt is called the Loopback.\n\n520\n00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,880\nNow, most of you guys are already familiar\nwith 127.0.0.1 as your Loopback address.\n\n521\n00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,180\nIf you ping that address,\nyou ping yourself.\n\n522\n00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,310\nIt just loops right back to you.\n\n523\n00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,120\nBut what a lot of people don't know,\nis that one IP,\n\n524\n00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,530\nsure it looped back like that.\n\n525\n00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,610\nBut actually,\nthat entire Class A is reserved.\n\n526\n00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,590\nYou can't use it, even though,\nI think like even in Windows,\n\n527\n00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,020\nmost of those addresses,\ndon't actually work.\n\n528\n00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,460\nSo, if I ping-\n>> No, you can do it.\n\n529\n00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:04,960\n>> Does it work?\n\n530\n00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, it sure does.\n\n531\n00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,130\nLook at that.\n>> The entire network.\n\n532\n00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,120\n>> Well, now see, I didn't know that.\n\n533\n00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,010\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n534\n00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,560\n>> All right, well, that's useful\nin an extremely useful kind of way.\n\n535\n00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,570\n[LAUGH] I thought only the first\none would respond, but yeah,\n\n536\n00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,920\napparently the whole dadgum thing.\n\n537\n00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,205\n>> [CROSSTALK] The whole thing.\n\n538\n00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:19,937\n>> Yeah, well good to know.\n\n539\n00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:20,738\nI wonder, why they did that?\n\n540\n00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:21,666\n>> I don't know.\n\n541\n00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,362\nBut it did waste a lot of addresses,\nthough.\n\n542\n00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,059\n>> It really did.\n\n543\n00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,298\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n544\n00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:28,915\n>> Let's add that to the slide.\n\n545\n00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:30,935\nTo the notepad here.\n\n546\n00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,829\nWhen we talk about these addresses,\nlike a Class A.\n\n547\n00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:37,919\nA Class A, where you have one octet for\nthe network,\n\n548\n00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,316\nand all of the remaining octets for\nthe host,\n\n549\n00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:49,260\nthat actually gives you 16.7 Million,\nwhich I can't even spell,\n\n550\n00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,494\nthat's how big it is,\n16.7 Million Addresses.\n\n551\n00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:58,410\nSo, that's a huge chunk of addresses,\nright?\n\n552\n00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,370\nAnd, actually let's, well, we don't\nneed to get too precise with this.\n\n553\n00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,620\n>> If you want it, I know what to say.\n\n554\n00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,487\n>> Do you actually know it?\n>> Yeah.\n\n555\n00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,323\n>> Well, what is it, Ronnie?\n\n556\n00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:11,650\n>> It's 16,777,214 addresses.\n\n557\n00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,324\n>> Wow, how do you know that [LAUGH].\n\n558\n00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:15,098\n>> 777 thousand, yeah.\n\n559\n00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,339\n>> 770,214?\n\n560\n00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:18,733\n>> 77.\n\n561\n00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,720\n>> Oh really?\n>> Yeah.\n\n562\n00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,462\n>> That's kind of neat.\n\n563\n00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:22,572\nSo I just memorized the ballpark,\n\n564\n00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,932\non the exam the ballpark is\nreally all you need to know.\n\n565\n00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:27,976\nSo I always remember 16.7 million.\n\n566\n00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:31,221\nRonnie, amazing mind,\n\n567\n00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:36,018\n16,777,214 Addresses.\n\n568\n00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:37,233\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I guess,\n\n569\n00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:41,035\nactually I don't need to write Million\nanymore, now, that'd be a huge number,\n\n570\n00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:41,540\nso there.\n\n571\n00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,810\nIt's a lot of Addresses,\nis really the important part here.\n\n572\n00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,570\nAnd I think, that works out to a butt ton.\n\n573\n00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,922\n[LAUGH]\n>> A butt ton.\n\n574\n00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:50,468\n>> I think, it is not the same?\n\n575\n00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:53,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow, it's a ton of Addresses.\n\n576\n00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,850\nSo when we say they reserved\nthe entire 127 range,\n\n577\n00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,140\nthat's 16.7 Million Addresses,\nthat they wasted.\n\n578\n00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,898\nNot wasted, I mean we use\nthe Loopback [CROSSTALK] testing.\n\n579\n00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:02,722\n>> Reserve, yeah.\n\n580\n00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:04,366\n[LAUGH]\n>> But that's what we lost,\n\n581\n00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,670\nwith just that one reservation.\n\n582\n00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,410\n>> Yeah.\nAll right.\n\n583\n00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,980\nAlso if I go beyond the classes.\n\n584\n00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:16,010\nSo I stopped here at 223, but\nthere are things beyond that.\n\n585\n00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,403\nSo 224, I'll write them out,\nif you want to talk about them, Ron.\n\n586\n00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:19,983\n>> Yep.\n\n587\n00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:24,280\n224 going all the way to 239,\nall the way to the upper end of that,\n\n588\n00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,300\ngives us what we call\nthe Class D Addresses for us.\n\n589\n00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,720\nNow, these ticker addresses\nare not valid on the Internet.\n\n590\n00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,420\nBut they are actually reserved,\nfor the idea of Multicasting.\n\n591\n00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,290\nWe haven't really talked about\nthe idea of Multicasting, yet here.\n\n592\n00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,760\nBut this allows us to be able to actually,\ninstead of a broadcast,\n\n593\n00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,170\nwhere we actually send information\nout to everybody on that subnet.\n\n594\n00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,260\nMulticast allows us to send it to\na subset of that network, instead.\n\n595\n00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,489\n>> Yeah, so the way I remember it, is you\nreally have three communications, Unicast,\n\n596\n00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:56,625\nBroadcast and Multicast.\n\n597\n00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:03,074\nSo Unicast is one-to-one, Broadcast is\none-to-all, and Multicast is one-to-.\n\n598\n00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:03,574\n>> Many.\n>> Some.\n\n599\n00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,479\nRight, one-to-many.\n\n600\n00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,743\nSo, just a neat little technology.\n\n601\n00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:08,560\nWe'll actually talk more about multicast,\n\n602\n00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,636\nwhen we get into our routing protocols.\nThen beyond that,\n\n603\n00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:16,908\nwe have the final range which goes\n\n604\n00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:21,711\n240.0.0.0.\n>> All the way through to 255.\n\n605\n00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:23,952\nAll the rest of it, there you go.\n\n606\n00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:24,858\n>> All the rest of it.\n\n607\n00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,960\nAll the way to 254,\n\n608\n00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,067\nnow this one doesn't have a name.\nIt's technically reserved,\n\n609\n00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:35,857\nand it's reserved for research purposes,\nis what they have it flagged for, but\n\n610\n00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:38,727\nit's not really a class,\nyou'll hear some people say class E.\n\n611\n00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:42,744\nBut that's not the, it's just reserved,\nit's just pulled off and\n\n612\n00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:46,968\nyou can't make use of it, the octet\nguarantee isn't there on this one,\n\n613\n00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:51,279\nit doesn't have like a guaranteed\nstart to 1.1.1.0 or whatever.\n\n614\n00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,953\nBut it is to kinda flag and reserve,\nand then the very last address,\n\n615\n00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:57,512\nthat guy right there.\n\n616\n00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:01,552\nThat is the general broadcast.\n\n617\n00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:03,712\n>> Yeah.\n>> The broadcast that will broadcast to.\n\n618\n00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:04,237\n>> Everything.\n\n619\n00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:05,384\n>> Everything.\nEvery network, everybody.\n\n620\n00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,486\nAnd again,\nnot valid on the internet, right?\n\n621\n00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,350\n>> Right.\n\n622\n00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,230\n>> The only ones that are valid on the\ninternet are the class A, B, and C ranges.\n\n623\n00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,800\nAnything else is gonna be paired off.\n\n624\n00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:17,480\n>> And\nactually let's add an exception there.\n\n625\n00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,835\nLet's really crank this up a notch.\n\n626\n00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:19,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n627\n00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,020\n>> Even within the class A, B and C, there\nare certain ranges that are pulled out.\n\n628\n00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,970\nNow, if you have A, B,\n\n629\n00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,980\nor C range, most of them are what\nis called registered addresses.\n\n630\n00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,080\nIn other words, in order to use them,\nyou have to be registered with the IANA.\n\n631\n00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,080\n>> Now,\nthere are ranges that we tend to use,\n\n632\n00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,810\nwithin our own local area network, that\nare not valid or routable on the internet.\n\n633\n00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,470\nAnd so within each one of those classes,\nwe have those ranges as well.\n\n634\n00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,260\nYou might be wondering about why\nin the world would we do that,\n\n635\n00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,860\nif you haven't actually heard this before.\n\n636\n00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,230\nIt's because we started running out\nof IP addresses on the internet.\n\n637\n00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,030\nSo, what they did is they took out certain\nchunks of the address spaces in class A,\n\n638\n00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,270\nclass B, and class C to do so.\n\n639\n00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,100\nSo, that's what we're actually\ngonna take a look at.\n\n640\n00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,140\n>> Yeah, and so these are, they're called\nprivate IP ranges, and they're covered,\n\n641\n00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,890\nit's RFC 1,918.\n\n642\n00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,610\nI hate to throw out RFC numbers like that,\n\n643\n00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,160\nbut it is probably the only RFC\nnumber that shows up on the exam.\n\n644\n00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,840\nSo, RFC 1918 is the one that\ndefines the private IP ranges, and\n\n645\n00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,700\nbased on what it does.\n\n646\n00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,760\nIt sets aside a block of class As, a block\nof class Bs, and a block of class Cs for\n\n647\n00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,230\nuse inside your own organization\nwithout registering with the INA.\n\n648\n00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,540\nAnd so, these are addresses that we\nwill see commonly in businesses And\n\n649\n00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,830\nthen we need to know.\n\n650\n00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:39,340\nSo in the Class A range,\nthe reserved address is 10.0.0.0.\n\n651\n00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:46,870\nAnd actually I could just put\nquestion marks I suppose, like that.\n\n652\n00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,180\nThe 10.Class A, that is reserved.\n\n653\n00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,130\nFor Private Use.\n\n654\n00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,640\nSo, nonroutable on the internet, but\nyou can use it in your own business, and\n\n655\n00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,820\nyou have a Class A that you can use.\n\n656\n00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,520\nIf those machines need to get out to\nthe internet, you'll have to do like\n\n657\n00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,510\nnetwork address translation which\nwe'll cover in another episode.\n\n658\n00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,140\n>> Yep.\n\n659\n00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,490\n>> In the Class B, we actually have\na weird number that actually comes here.\n\n660\n00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,200\nAnd this begins at 172.16.\n\n661\n00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,650\nAnd then, your addresses.\n\n662\n00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:21,820\nI'm all the way through 172.31 and the\nlast bits, that we actually have there.\n\n663\n00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,410\nNow Don,\ndo you know why that happens there?\n\n664\n00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,280\n>> So, every now and then they get\nsquirrelly with things, and like 127?\n\n665\n00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,630\nThe reason we have 127 is it's supposed\nto be in the middle of the whole shebang.\n\n666\n00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,450\nRight, and if you think about it,\nyou go from 0 to 255,\n\n667\n00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,615\n127 is basically in the middle.\n\n668\n00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:46,049\n172.16, I'm not entirely sure why\nthey skipped that first chunk,\n\n669\n00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:50,890\nbut 0 through 15, and\nthen you have 16 through 31, right?\n\n670\n00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,656\n>> Yep.\n\n671\n00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:54,860\n>> So those are 16 increments,\nor the fourth bid or whatever.\n\n672\n00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,101\n>> I happen to know some\ntrivial information.\n\n673\n00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:57,659\n>> You do?\n\n674\n00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,957\n>> Yes, I do.\nIt has to do with the idea of what we were\n\n675\n00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:04,845\njust talking here about\nthe class IP addressing,\n\n676\n00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,839\nthe subnet mask for\nthis private range is unusual.\n\n677\n00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,023\nIt is a /12.\n\n678\n00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:13,762\nSo it is a 255.240.\n\n679\n00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:14,782\nThat's in the middle.\n\n680\n00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:16,279\nRight, smack down in the middle.\n\n681\n00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:17,534\nYou were correct.\n\n682\n00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:19,541\nThat's what exactly what they did.\n\n683\n00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,074\n>> Not terribly creative people.\n\n684\n00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:26,751\nSo, say as they're dividing\nthat one right in the middle.\n\n685\n00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,401\nI did not know that.\n\n686\n00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,572\n>> Yeah,\nI told you I know trivial information.\n\n687\n00:36:29,572 --> 00:36:30,095\n>> That is pretty cool.\n\n688\n00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:31,035\n>> That's trivial.\n\n689\n00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:34,390\n>> Okay, this one.\n\n690\n00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,800\nYeah, those are ones that, sometimes\nyou just have to memorize this stuff,\n\n691\n00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,799\nbecause you don't necessarily know\nthe history of it or whatever.\n\n692\n00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,038\nThat's one that I always just memorize and\nknow the history of.\n\n693\n00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,513\n>> That's it.\n\n694\n00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:48,298\n>> Down to the 192 side,\nwe also have a range here.\n\n695\n00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:51,630\nThis one is a neat one\nbecause we use it so much.\n\n696\n00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,019\nWhich is 192 to 168.0.0.\n\n697\n00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:01,340\nThere we go.\n\n698\n00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,646\nAnd it goes all the way\nthrough 192.168.255.255\n\n699\n00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:11,090\nwhich is reserved for private use.\n\n700\n00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,762\nAll right.\n\n701\n00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,761\nSo, many homes.\n\n702\n00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:14,294\n>> Right.\n\n703\n00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:18,921\n>> Many small business across\nthe world use 192.168.0.1,\n\n704\n00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:24,034\nbecause it is the first available class\nC that's reserved for private use.\n\n705\n00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:24,591\n>> Right.\n\n706\n00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,042\n>> For use inside of your own home.\n\n707\n00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,969\nSo, that is a really common network.\n\n708\n00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:31,400\nMost of you guys watching us on the show\nright, now probably have that address.\n\n709\n00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,144\n>> Yep.\n\n710\n00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:32,793\n>> Unless you use Netgear.\n\n711\n00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,721\nNetgear loves 192.168.100.\n\n712\n00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:35,894\n>> No.\n\n713\n00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:37,379\n>> Which is also in the reserve range,\nso perfectly fine.\n\n714\n00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:43,160\nAll right so,\nthose are some of our exceptions.\n\n715\n00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,297\nWe got multi class.\nRonnie did we just cover the whole range?\n\n716\n00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,482\n>> I think we've covered everything.\n\n717\n00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:52,518\nSo, we went from 0, 0, 0, 0,\nall the way through, 255.\n\n718\n00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:53,599\nWait, nope.\nI didn't-\n\n719\n00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,099\n>> I think that's everything.\n\n720\n00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,620\n>> I can't think of any other\n\n721\n00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,352\nspecial ranges.\nMicrosoft has some weird junk they do\n\n722\n00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,526\nwith like APIPA, the 169.254s.\nBut,\n\n723\n00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:04,500\nthat's not a part of the official stand,\nso we don't have to worry about that.\n\n724\n00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,750\nAs far as Cisco is concerned, what we've\nseen right here, kinda turning through,\n\n725\n00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,280\nthese are the addresses that we need to\nknow for the exam, the address ranges.\n\n726\n00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,287\nMake sure the class letters,\nmake sure the IP address ranges,\n\n727\n00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,960\nthe tops and the bottoms.\n\n728\n00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,492\nThese are things that show up on the exam.\n\n729\n00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:22,827\nIf you have them memorized,\n>> Helps.\n\n730\n00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:24,750\n>> It's a lot easier than having\nto try to figure them it out,\n\n731\n00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,053\nduring the exam without a calculator.\n\n732\n00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,864\n>> Sounds good.\n\n733\n00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:32,670\n>> All right, so\nthose were some of our special addresses.\n\n734\n00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,105\nLet's take a look at What's\nnext on our agenda here.\n\n735\n00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,637\nSo we've got basic IP addressing, so\n\n736\n00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:45,860\nwe should talk about subnet masks a little\nmore and kind of lead into VLSM, right?\n\n737\n00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,300\nSo, let's talk just for off about\nhow IP addresses work, right Ronnie.\n\n738\n00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,070\nI'm gonna throw a couple of\naddresses here on the screen.\n\n739\n00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,127\nLet me kind of clear some of this off.\n\n740\n00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n741\n00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,340\nremember that when we began with the IP\naddresses, we talked about the class full\n\n742\n00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,020\nIP addresses in which we don't\nreally need the subnet mask.\n\n743\n00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,990\nNow, once we started running\nout of IP addresses though,\n\n744\n00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,730\nsubnet masks became even more important\nbecause we started realizing something.\n\n745\n00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,510\nThat they really are a valuable tool for\nus.\n\n746\n00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,801\nTo be able to break the class for\naddressing rules here,\n\n747\n00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,840\nis what we're actually gonna do.\n\n748\n00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,106\n>> So that we know that a Class A,\n\n749\n00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:28,932\nhas subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and\nhow do we know that?\n\n750\n00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,547\nBecause we memorized it.\n\n751\n00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:33,066\n>> Yep, that's right.\n>> And we know [LAUGH] that a Class B is\n\n752\n00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:38,023\n255.255.0.0 and\nthe Class C has 255.255.255.0.\n\n753\n00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:42,610\nThis tells me which octets\nare part of the network ID.\n\n754\n00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,510\nAnd on the exam,\nCisco may write it this way.\n\n755\n00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,290\nOr they may write it, in what's\ncalled subnet shorthand notation.\n\n756\n00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,300\nThe subnet shorthand notation says,\n\n757\n00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,020\ninstead of listing it\nout as a decimal number.\n\n758\n00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,215\nWe'll, just list how many\nbits are in the network ID?\n\n759\n00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:01,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n760\n00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,420\n>> So 255, if written in binary is 8, 1s.\n\n761\n00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,170\n>> And then the 0's right,\nthat'll be 24 more 0s.\n\n762\n00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,490\nSo what they're saying is there's\neight 1s in that subnet mask, so\n\n763\n00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,033\nit's a 8-bit subnet mask or a / A's.\n\n764\n00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:22,270\nAnd a Class B, same thing except it has\n16 ones, and the Class C has 24 ones.\n\n765\n00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,820\nSo you may see it written\non the exam either way.\n\n766\n00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,970\nIt is important to know both ways,\nbecause Cisco goes back and\n\n767\n00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,989\nforth on it very frequently.\n\n768\n00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:38,238\nAll right, now I wrote two addresses\nup here at the top of the screen.\n\n769\n00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:40,080\n192.168.0.1 and 192.168.15.224.\n\n770\n00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,670\nThey both fall within the private\nrange for a class C, right?\n\n771\n00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,450\nThey start with 192.\n\n772\n00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,510\nLet's start with 192.168 that\nis in that private range, and so\n\n773\n00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,590\nthey are Class C's, so you don't have to\ngive me a subnet mask if its class full,\n\n774\n00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,700\nI can just tell from the first\noctet that its class C, and\n\n775\n00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,040\nI can tell that its a private address\nbecause it starts with 192.168, right?\n\n776\n00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,820\nThat's kind of the big advantage of\nclass full stuff you can just spot it.\n\n777\n00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:12,900\nNow, following class full rules are these\ntwo IP addresses on the same network?\n\n778\n00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,400\nNo.\n>> No.\n\n779\n00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,555\n>> A class C address,\n\n780\n00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,817\nthe first 3 octets make up the network,\nthe first three octets here,\n\n781\n00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:23,035\n192.168.0 And 192.168.15.\nThey're different,\n\n782\n00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,435\nthey're not on the same network.\n\n783\n00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:26,459\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n784\n00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:29,575\nBut almost all equipment-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n785\n00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:31,545\n>> Manufactured today.\n\n786\n00:41:31,545 --> 00:41:33,890\nAnd really,\nanything made in the last ten years.\n\n787\n00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,000\nIs going to implement\nsomething called CIDR,\n\n788\n00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,431\nwhich is Classless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n789\n00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,320\nOkay?\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing says\n\n790\n00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,340\nforget about the classes.\n\n791\n00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,420\nWe don't care about those.\n\n792\n00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,932\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n793\n00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:50,630\n[LAUGH] >> We don't use the first octet\nto determine our classes anymore and\n\n794\n00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,640\ninstead we will provide a subnet mask.\n\n795\n00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,570\nSo we can change this subnet mask\nup here and treat it as a Class B.\n\n796\n00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,750\nIf we used a 255.255.0.0 subnet mask,\na Class B subnet mask,\n\n797\n00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,160\nwith these addresses they'd\nbe on the same network.\n\n798\n00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,570\nAnd now they can magically talk\nwithout going through a router.\n\n799\n00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,530\nBut the thing if you do that, when you\nhand off this IP address to somebody else,\n\n800\n00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,350\nyou've got to hand off a subnet mask.\n\n801\n00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,760\nThey've got to know what\nyour subnet mask is, and\n\n802\n00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,450\nin early communications that\ndidn't happen, and so routers and\n\n803\n00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,880\ndevices that handled these\nroutes had to be updated.\n\n804\n00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,710\nSo anything made in the 80s or\neven the early 90s may not have that,\n\n805\n00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,210\nbut really starting around 95,\n96, somewhere in that range,\n\n806\n00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,170\npretty much everything supported\nclassless at that point.\n\n807\n00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,190\n>> So this is really, for us, and\nwhat you'll be doing here for the exam,\n\n808\n00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,038\nas well as for networks,\nyou're going to see this everywhere.\n\n809\n00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:49,550\nYou're not gonna actually walk into\nmost networks where you'll just see, oh,\n\n810\n00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,420\nthat's a class B or a class C.\n\n811\n00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,150\nYou'll see some unusual subnet\nmasks that go along with this.\n\n812\n00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,900\nAnd so, we're actually do a little\nbit of review of these two.\n\n813\n00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,140\n>> So just keep in mind, when we talk\nabout classless inter-domain routing,\n\n814\n00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,270\nwe talk about CIDR, that means the first\noctet no longer has any bearing\n\n815\n00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,190\nover what subnet mask you're gonna use.\n\n816\n00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,370\nAnd that means we need\na subnet mask in hand.\n\n817\n00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,310\nSo one of types of things that\nyou might see on the exam\n\n818\n00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,710\nis an example where they give\nyou two IP addresses like this.\n\n819\n00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:21,360\nAnd they say, what subnet mask\ndo you need to use, in order for\n\n820\n00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,630\nthese two machines to be\non the same network right.\n\n821\n00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:32,560\nSo if I give you 172.15.222.9, and\nI give you 172.71.1.8, all right.\n\n822\n00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,460\nWhat subnet mask would I have to use,\n\n823\n00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,840\nin order for\nthese two guys to be on the same network?\n\n824\n00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,940\nWell, if we use our\nClass Poll subnet masks,\n\n825\n00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,580\nthe subnet masks that we're used to.\n\n826\n00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,600\nThe first octet matches,\nwe've got 172, 172.\n\n827\n00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,580\nBut the second octet already\ndoesn't match, right?\n\n828\n00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,250\nSo in this case, what I would have to do,\n\n829\n00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,230\nis I would have to use a class\nA subnet mask in order to get these.\n\n830\n00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,530\nNow that's gonna cause a problem, okay?\n\n831\n00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:10,500\nMy main problem is 172.16 is\nin the private range.172.71,\n\n832\n00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,280\nthat is in the registered range.\n\n833\n00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,010\nAnd, you know what,\nI'm gonna change my example.\n\n834\n00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,200\nI'm gonna change it after the fact.\n\n835\n00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,310\nNow we'll just make it 18.\n\n836\n00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,240\nOkay.\nNow they're both in the private range.\n\n837\n00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,320\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> All right?\n\n838\n00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:31,070\nBut when I use that class A mask,\nwhat am I actually getting?\n\n839\n00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:36,329\nI'm getting 172.0.0.0,\nall the way through 172.255.255.255,\n\n840\n00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:39,800\nwhich means I would be getting private and\npublic addresses.\n\n841\n00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,720\nAnd it would've happened if I left\nthe addresses the same way, but\n\n842\n00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,710\nthis will get private and public.\n\n843\n00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,490\nIf I use this network inside of\nmy environment, there may be,\n\n844\n00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:53,210\nwell there are, real public IPs\nthat are out there on the internet.\n\n845\n00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,080\nThat I might not be able to get to.\n\n846\n00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,480\nAnd the reason I say there are, I just\nnoticed my IP address at home, right?\n\n847\n00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,900\nI have a cable modem at home and my IP\naddress changes very infrequently, right?\n\n848\n00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,390\nEvery now and then it changes.\n\n849\n00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,920\nIt just changed the other day and\nmy address started with 172.\n\n850\n00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,030\nI noticed that and I thought that was odd.\n\n851\n00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,690\nI was like, oh 172, because some cable\ncompanies now have started issuing\n\n852\n00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,790\nprivate IPs to the customer.\n\n853\n00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,890\nI thought they were doing that to me which\nis a horrible thing so I was about to\n\n854\n00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,800\ncall and complain but I read the rest\nof the address and it was a public IP.\n\n855\n00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,900\nJust happen to start with 172.\n\n856\n00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,400\n>> Yep.\n\n857\n00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,995\n>> So my constant battles with\ninternet service providers.\n\n858\n00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,580\n[LAUGH] It's not too much to ask I think.\n\n859\n00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,810\nI don't do bit torrents,\nI don't bootleg videos on the internet.\n\n860\n00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,920\nI need a public IP.\n\n861\n00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,982\nDon't give me some private IP and\ntell me you're giving me internet service.\n\n862\n00:45:45,982 --> 00:45:47,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I don't care

whatever.\n\n879\n00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,190\nVariable length subnet mask, it just\nmeans that, if we combine it with cider,\n\n880\n00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,610\nnot only does the first octet not\nmatter anymore, but it means that\n\n881\n00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,360\nwe're gonna move away from the old\nmodel of having simple subnet masks,\n\n882\n00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,110\nto having these guys up here,\nwhere it's 255.000.\n\n883\n00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,670\nThis simple model right here that says\nyou really only have three subnet models.\n\n884\n00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,450\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n885\n00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,260\n>> With VLSM we break it open so\nthat we can have a slash.\n\n886\n00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,990\nSlash seven, a slash

conservative\n\n889\n00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,680\nin the uses of our IP addresses.\n\n890\n00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,200\nRemember that one of the earliest problems\nthat we had was very fact that we weren't\n\n891\n00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,490\nwe essentially said class A,\n\n892\n00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,880\nyou have a class A address you get\n16 million plus addresses right?\n\n893\n00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,700\nThere were a lot of\ncompanies that did that.\n\n894\n00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,470\nSo those particular addresses that weren't\nused pretty much just sat there, but\n\n895\n00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,230\nusing variable link subnet\nmasking we can't say that we use\n\n896\n00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:29,440\nevery single on to the max extent here,\nbut it will actually allow us to\n\n897\n00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,870\nwaste less addresses here,\nis what will actually end up happening.\n\n898\n00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,500\nSo that's where we'll end\nup seeing this as well.\n\n899\n00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,810\n>> All right, so the thing about VLSM,\nit's very powerful.\n\n900\n00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,390\nGives us a lot of stuff that we can do.\n\n901\n00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,780\nBut it is difficult, right, okay.\n\n902\n00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,400\nAnd if this is the first time\nyou've seen this, like I said,\n\n903\n00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,540\nI really encourage you to jump over to the\nNetwork Plus Show, because we go really in\n\n904\n00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,730\ndepth on it and kind of walk you through\nthe early stages and how to go through it.\n\n905\n00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:00,191\nBut, what I wana do here is, I wanna\nshow everybody one example of VLSM, and\n\n906\n00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:04,682\nthen I want to show you guys why it's\nimportant to us on Cisco router, okay?\n\n907\n00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,554\nCause it is very useful\non out Cisco routers and\n\n908\n00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:12,208\nit's a practical real world use of\na technology that's kinda difficult.\n\n909\n00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:16,223\nLet's do this cuz we've only got\na little bit of time before our break.\n\n910\n00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:20,387\nLet me show you one example right\nnow of just a simple use of VLSM and\n\n911\n00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:25,940\nthen I'll show you how we can use it for\nour routers and make it really cool.\n\n912\n00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,380\nSo, let's say for example,\nthat I had two networks.\n\n913\n00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,531\nThat I had 192.168.0, you know what?\n\n914\n00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:36,710\nLet's use our our guest network here.\n\n915\n00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,237\nSo, we have a guest network here,\nand it is 192.168.00, right?\n\n916\n00:48:41,237 --> 00:48:42,361\nEverybody, actually no it's not.\n\n917\n00:48:42,361 --> 00:48:43,495\nI am a big liar.\n\n918\n00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:47,897\nIt is 10.1.100.0 right.\n\n919\n00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:51,703\nAnd when we started with\nthis network it was a /24.\n\n920\n00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:52,238\nAll right.\n\n921\n00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:54,580\nThat's an example of CIDR.\n\n922\n00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,430\nWe used a class C subnet\nmask with a class A address.\n\n923\n00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,860\nSo that's just using CIDR.\n\n924\n00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,589\nBut we started running out of IPs.\n\n925\n00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:08,272\nWe had so many people visiting\nthe building that had cell phones and\n\n926\n00:49:08,272 --> 00:49:09,680\ntablets and-\n>> Whatever.\n\n927\n00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,550\n>> God only knows what else and\nthen you have people like Wes.\n\n928\n00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,940\nYou guys have seen Wes on the show.\n\n929\n00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,000\nHe comes walking in here with\nseven tablets in his bag.\n\n930\n00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,160\nI never really know what\nhe does with all that.\n\n931\n00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,020\n>> Galaxy Empire.\n\n932\n00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,662\n>> Does he build a virtual reality world\naround his head in the seven tablets?\n\n933\n00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:24,830\n>> Yes, yes he does.\n\n934\n00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,900\n>> But anyhow, so\nwe started running out of IPs,\n\n935\n00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,571\nour DHCP server was getting saturated,\nso we implemented VSLM also.\n\n936\n00:49:32,571 --> 00:49:38,157\nAnd we said, all right let's\njust add on the next network,\n\n937\n00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:47,130\n10.1.101.0/24 in a class c network\nyou have 254 useable IP addresses.\n\n938\n00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:51,710\nI wanted to add another class C\nto get another 254 addresses.\n\n939\n00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:56,080\nAnd the end result is that you\nend up with 512 usable total.\n\n940\n00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,377\n>> 510 yeah.\n\n941\n00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:58,243\n>> 510?\n>> Yeah.\n\n942\n00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,616\n512 would actually give us the.\n\n943\n00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:04,340\n>> Okay so\n510 usable if I can keep it straight.\n\n944\n00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,720\nSo we wanted to add that on.\n\n945\n00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,300\nAll right, so, what you do to do\nsomething like this is pretty neat.\n\n946\n00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,730\nBasically we wanted to have these two\nnetworks able to talk to each other\n\n947\n00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,920\nwithout going through a router.\n\n948\n00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,700\nSo, step one is to convert them to binary,\nright.\n\n949\n00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,070\nNow really the only difference\nis this octate here.\n\n950\n00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,660\nSo, we don't have to\nconvert the entire address.\n\n951\n00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,250\nOn the exam, you don't have a lot of time.\n\n952\n00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,840\nSo, you want to do as little\nas possible for conversions.\n\n953\n00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,197\nSo really that one octate\nis what I'm worried about.\n\n954\n00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,330\nBut, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n955\n00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,940\nconvert the whole thing just so you guys\ncan see the whole process on my example.\n\n956\n00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,355\nAnd then I'll do it the shorthand\nway after the break.\n\n957\n00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:44,000\nSo a 10 in binary is what?\n\n958\n00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,860\nWe've got four 0s, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\n959\n00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:54,790\nAnd then I had to pick 100.\n\n960\n00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:59,140\nThat's a-\n>> 11, and then from that point,\n\n961\n00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,753\nthat'd be a 16 so you don't need that one.\n\n962\n00:51:01,753 --> 00:51:05,460\nAnd then 8, then you need the 4.\n\n963\n00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,450\nYou don't need the 2 and 1.\n\n964\n00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,417\n>> Wait, do I need the 8 or no?\n\n965\n00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,124\n>> No.\n\n966\n00:51:09,124 --> 00:51:11,873\n>> No 8, yes 4, no 2, no 1.\n\n967\n00:51:11,873 --> 00:51:14,622\n[LAUGH] And 96 plus 4.\n\n968\n00:51:14,622 --> 00:51:15,573\nThat's how I come up with it.\n\n969\n00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,129\n>> Okay.\nSo\n\n970\n00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:19,338\nnow we can kinda cheat a little bit on\nthis one cuz we've already converted\n\n971\n00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:21,340\nthe first two numbers.\n\n972\n00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,790\nAnd then 101 should be easy enough.\n\n973\n00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:33,412\nOkay, so there's the two addresses and\n\n974\n00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:36,188\nyou know actually,\n\n975\n00:51:36,188 --> 00:51:41,412\nlet's write this in different ways so\n\n976\n00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:45,180\nwe can keep them straight.\n\n977\n00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,210\nOkay, so there's our two addresses, and\n\n978\n00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,300\noriginally we were using\na class C subnet mask, right?\n\n979\n00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:59,407\nWhich would have been like this.\n\n980\n00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,310\nAll right?\n\n981\n00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:06,243\nAnd according to a class C subnet mask, if\nwe just draw a line where the ones stop,\n\n982\n00:52:06,243 --> 00:52:11,410\nand the zeros start in the subnet mask,\nthat line would be right here.\n\n983\n00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,374\nAnd if we want these machines\nto be on the same network, well,\n\n984\n00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:19,360\neverything to the left of that\nline has to match, right?\n\n985\n00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,460\nAnd we can see is we look\nat these that they do match\n\n986\n00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,920\nall the way through the first octet\nall the way through the second octet.\n\n987\n00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,775\nAnd most of the way through the thirst\noctet this last little bit,\n\n988\n00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:35,201\n10.1.100 has a 0, 10.1 1.101 has a 1.\n\n989\n00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:36,071\nThere's our difference.\n\n990\n00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,930\n>> Right, in two separate networks.\n\n991\n00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,930\n>> So if we want to combine those\n\n992\n00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:45,590\nwe need to make everything to\nthe left of the line match.\n\n993\n00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,710\nAnd the easiest way to do\nthat is to move the line.\n\n994\n00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,200\nMove the line and\nthat'll save us a lot of time.\n\n995\n00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,440\nSo basically that's what we did, is we\ncame down here and we said all right,\n\n996\n00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,290\nwell this line is now gonna be over here.\n\n997\n00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,940\nAnd by moving that line over, now\n\n998\n00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,940\neverything to the left\nof the line matches.\n\n999\n00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,650\nAnd then so the right it can be different,\nwe're not worried about that, right?\n\n1000\n00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,480\nThe fact there's a 0 here, or\na 1 here, that's part of the host ID.\n\n1001\n00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,910\nSo we're not worried about it.\n\n1002\n00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,510\nEverything to the left has to match.\n\n1003\n00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,820\nNow, if we move the line, our subnet mask?\n\n1004\n00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,470\nIt's all 1s to the left of the line,\nall 0s to the right.\n\n1005\n00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,170\nSo I did have to change this\none bit from a 0 to a 1.\n\n1006\n00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:36,060\nBut when I do that, now everything\nto the left of the line matches,\n\n1007\n00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,430\nthese two networks are now\nconsidered combined.\n\n1008\n00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,850\nThey're merged together.\n\n1009\n00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,210\n>> For the new subnet mask.\n\n1010\n00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,616\n>> And that new subnet mask\nwouldn't be 255.255.255.0.\n\n1011\n00:53:46,616 --> 00:53:47,740\nI lost that one bit.\n\n1012\n00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:52,697\nSo it's actually gonna be 255.255.254.0.\n\n1013\n00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:58,974\nSo now I've got a new range that's built\nup, and any time you create a new range,\n\n1014\n00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:03,820\nyou need to figure out the beginning and\nthe ending, right?\n\n1015\n00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,944\nThe first and the last addresses, and so\n\n1016\n00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:16,640\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nadd a little bit more in here.\n\n1017\n00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,390\nAnd we need to figure out\nwhere our network starts and\n\n1018\n00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,940\nwhere our network ends, all right?\n\n1019\n00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,600\nFortunately, figuring out the start and\nthe end is really easy.\n\n1020\n00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,870\nThe start, you just zero out the host ID.\n\n1021\n00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,080\nAnd the end,\nyou just make the host ID all 1s.\n\n1022\n00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,140\nRight.\n\n1023\n00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,466\n>> That's it.\n>> And so if we were to convert these from\n\n1024\n00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:43,832\nbinary back into decimal,\nit would basically be 10.1.100.255.\n\n1025\n00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:45,125\n>> .0.\n>> No.\n\n1026\n00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:45,914\nBad, bad, bad.\n\n1027\n00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:46,540\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1028\n00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,570\n>> All right, .0.\n\n1029\n00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:48,745\nI'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n1030\n00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:52,371\nThrough 10.1.101.255, there we go.\n\n1031\n00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:55,270\nThat would be the beginning and\nthe end of our new range.\n\n1032\n00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,540\nSo now we're spanning across two\nclass C's, and that's where we get\n\n1033\n00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,030\nover 500 addresses, and now we're able to\naccommodate more guests in the building.\n\n1034\n00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,690\nSo that's an example of VLSM.\n\n1035\n00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:08,397\nIf you watched the Network Plus show,\nyou've seen this,\n\n1036\n00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:11,217\nyou've seen a number of different\nexamples of using VLSM but\n\n1037\n00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:13,945\nwhat I want to show you guys is\nhow it's useful on a router.\n\n1038\n00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:15,088\nRight.\nHow we're going to use it in\n\n1039\n00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:17,619\na Cisco world, because that's likely\nwhat's going to show up on the exam.\n\n1040\n00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:18,410\nAll right.\n\n1041\n00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,820\nBut we have blown past our break, Ronnie.\n\n1042\n00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,995\nSo do you have anything else to throw in?\n\n1043\n00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:22,840\n>> Nope.\n\n1044\n00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,612\nI think we're ready for our next section.\n\n1045\n00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,490\n>> All right, so let's go ahead and\nstop here, we'll take a break.\n\n1046\n00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,818\nAnd when we get back, some real world\nexamples of how you can use VLSM and\n\n1047\n00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:30,997\nmake it not suck so much.\n\n1048\n00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:32,029\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1049\n00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:35,230\n>> And try and kinda get that\nkind of stored in our brains.\n\n1050\n00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,410\nSo we'll see you guys\nback in a few minutes.\n\n1051\n00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:45,944\n[NOISE].\n\n1052\n00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:47,540\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1053\n00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,830\nSo before the break I left\nthe teaser out there.\n\n1054\n00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,070\nI said all right, VLSM, we learn about it.\n\n1055\n00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,800\nWe know it for the exam, right.\n\n1056\n00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,130\nBut a lot of people never see how\nthey're gonna practically use it for\n\n1057\n00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:57,760\nthe real world.\n\n1058\n00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,960\nAnd we say things like oh,\nif you have a big network and\n\n1059\n00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,860\nyou wanna break it up into\nsmaller networks you can do that.\n\n1060\n00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,502\nBut people pretty rarely do that.\n\n1061\n00:56:04,502 --> 00:56:07,835\nBut on Cisco routers there\nis a great example of where\n\n1062\n00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:12,096\nyou absolutely will use this,\nand it's a very beneficial thing.\n\n1063\n00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:15,154\nAnd it's a technology\ncalled route summarization.\n\n1064\n00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:15,816\nAll right.\n\n1065\n00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:20,262\nEvery router has to maintain a database,\nright?\n\n1066\n00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:24,370\nIt's really a table that says what\nroutes are out there that exist.\n\n1067\n00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,690\nThat's how it knows how to get places.\n\n1068\n00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,920\nThink like your GPS.\n\n1069\n00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,740\nYour GPS has a database of all the roads\nin the US or whatever country you're in.\n\n1070\n00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,580\nAnd if you say,\n\n1071\n00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,830\nget me from point A to point B it looks\nat all those roads to find the route.\n\n1072\n00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,880\nWell that's what your router does.\n\n1073\n00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,120\nYour router has to know all\nthose different networks.\n\n1074\n00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,060\nThe bigger that database is,\n\n1075\n00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,030\nthe bigger that table is,\nthe slower your average is gonna be.\n\n1076\n00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,310\n>> So a lot of times what you end up\nseeing especially when you have a router\n\n1077\n00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:56,400\nthat has tons of routes, it means it has\nto get an insert for every single one.\n\n1078\n00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,450\nAnd even if the actual networks\nare relatively the same,\n\n1079\n00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,020\nit has to keep an entry for\nevery single one.\n\n1080\n00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,160\nWhat we're about to show you is how\na router actually takes entries that\n\n1081\n00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,740\nthen connect the multiple routes,\nand end up summarizing them as well.\n\n1082\n00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,980\nSo what we call the idea of\nroute summarization there.\n\n1083\n00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,190\nAnd that's where we\nreally do use VLSM a lot.\n\n1084\n00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:18,250\n>> All right, so I wanna show you\nguys an example of a routing table.\n\n1085\n00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,240\nAnd so let's say I run a business and\n\n1086\n00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,620\nin my business I have a bunch of networks,\nright.\n\n1087\n00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,090\nAnd I just use private addresses\ncuz it's just in my own company.\n\n1088\n00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,480\nAnd so for whatever reason I\nhave a need for seven networks.\n\n1089\n00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,350\nOkay.\n\n1090\n00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:39,520\nSo I've got 192 at 168.0.123456\nevery time I add a new network,\n\n1091\n00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,530\nI just bump up another class C.\n\n1092\n00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,680\nSo maybe I run a conference center,\nevery room in that center\n\n1093\n00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,010\nI want to have its own network,\nand so this is what I do.\n\n1094\n00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,610\nIn my router,\n\n1095\n00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,790\nit has to have a table that keeps\ntrack of all these different networks.\n\n1096\n00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:03,405\nAnd so here I would have seven\nroutes in my routing table.\n\n1097\n00:58:03,405 --> 00:58:04,115\nOkay.\n\n1098\n00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:06,395\nNow seven routes doesn't sound like a lot.\n\n1099\n00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:07,345\nAnd it isn't.\n\n1100\n00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:10,925\nA Cisco router, even the low end ones.\n\n1101\n00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:13,775\nLet me define low end right?\n\n1102\n00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:17,665\nSo Cisco makes routers that have\nvarious numbers assigned to them right?\n\n1103\n00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:22,775\nIf it is a three digit number like\nthe Cisco 800 series, that is the lowest\n\n1104\n00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:26,990\nof the low and it's really not designed\nto do more than one or two routes.\n\n1105\n00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,030\nIt's really designed for\nhome use only, okay.\n\n1106\n00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:34,920\nThen you have the routers\nthat start with a one.\n\n1107\n00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,740\nLike the 1700s, the 1800s, those guys.\n\n1108\n00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,970\nThose are designed for small office,\nbranch office type environments.\n\n1109\n00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:45,660\nAnd they can usually handle several\nhundred routes without a problem.\n\n1110\n00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,360\nThen you get to the ones that start\nwith a two, the 2600s, the 2800s.\n\n1111\n00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,600\nThe 2800s which are what are on the exam\n\n1112\n00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,710\nthey can usually handle a couple of\nthousand routes without an issue.\n\n1113\n00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,760\nAnd then you get your bigger\nrouters like your 7200s.\n\n1114\n00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,390\nThose guys can handle hundreds\nof thousands of routes, right?\n\n1115\n00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,900\nIt really all comes down to\nthe amount of RAM you have.\n\n1116\n00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,730\nThe higher end routers have more RAM.\n\n1117\n00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,170\nThe lower end routers have less.\n\n1118\n00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,250\nAnd so that affects the amount of routes.\n\n1119\n00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,670\nNow you might ask yourself, why would I\nhave hundreds of thousands of routes?.\n\n1120\n00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:20,140\nIf you're an internet connected router,\nthe internet routing table is massive.\n\n1121\n00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,570\nLet me see what it is right now.\n\n1122\n00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,145\nYou can actually pull it up online.\n\n1123\n00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:28,181\n[SOUND]\n>> Here's stuff that\n\n1124\n00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,190\nDon knows that I [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1125\n00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,460\n>> Yeah, there's a website there, Potaroo,\nI always forget the name Potaroo.\n\n1126\n00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:38,180\nBGP is the border gateway protocol\nit's what used to route the internet.\n\n1127\n00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,670\nAnd this website Potaroo,\nthey basically track the amount of\n\n1128\n00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:46,640\nroutes that are out there in\nthe IP version four routing table.\n\n1129\n00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,500\nThey do some IPv6 stuff also.\n\n1130\n00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,120\nBut if you look at it, you can see how the\nnetworks have been steadily climbing and\n\n1131\n00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,580\nincreasing the amount of\nnetworks that are out there.\n\n1132\n00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,850\nAnd so we see em just climbing,\nand climbing so\n\n1133\n00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,880\nthat today, right here in 2013.\n\n1134\n00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,820\nEach of these represents a year, right.\n\n1135\n01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,980\nSo you see where the big dotcom boom kinda\nhappened and all the way up to today.\n\n1136\n01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,562\nThat we're up to just\nbeneath 500,000 routes.\n\n1137\n01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:13,410\nThat is probably somewhere around\n470,000 I think was the last\n\n1138\n01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,250\nspecific number I saw.\n\n1139\n01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,940\nSo if you're an internet connected router,\nif you're an internet service provider.\n\n1140\n01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,360\nYou're gonna have 470,000 routes.\n\n1141\n01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,160\nThat's what you have to have to\nbe a successful internet router.\n\n1142\n01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:23,840\nAll right.\n\n1143\n01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,190\nSo that's a big routing table.\n\n1144\n01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n1145\n01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,960\n>> Anything we can do to make it\nsmaller makes a big difference.\n\n1146\n01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,600\nAll right.\n\n1147\n01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,370\nAnd so, VLSM allows us to do that.\n\n1148\n01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,680\nIt allows us to summarize,\nor combine routes, so\n\n1149\n01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,790\nthat when we advertise them out to other\nrouters, instead of having to advertise\n\n1150\n01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:45,300\nout a ton of routes, I can advertise\na subset, a smaller group of routes, and\n\n1151\n01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,750\nit makes the routing table smaller,\nwhich makes the routers more efficient.\n\n1152\n01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,210\nAll right, so lets take a look at\nthis routing table here, right.\n\n1153\n01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,290\nSo, I've got seven routes.\n\n1154\n01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,250\nAnd I wanna make that\nas small as possible.\n\n1155\n01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,660\nWell, whenever we combine routes,\nthe first thing that we need to do,\n\n1156\n01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,340\nsadly, is to convert it over to binary.\n\n1157\n01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,380\nBecause we need to see how we can adjust\nthe subnet mask to combine these.\n\n1158\n01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:12,970\nAnd we need to pay attention to where\nthings stop being the same, and\n\n1159\n01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,930\nstart being the same, and so on.\n\n1160\n01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,970\nSo we need to tackle that.\n\n1161\n01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,950\nAnd apparently my screensaver did\n\n1162\n01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:20,880\nsomething there,\n>> [LAUGHS]\n\n1163\n01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,280\n>> So let me reset my video.\n\n1164\n01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,770\nOne of the things I mentioned\nearlier in the show was that,\n\n1165\n01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:31,080\nbasically, on the exam you don't\nhave a lot of time, right?\n\n1166\n01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,150\nYou've got 90 minutes, you don't want\nwaste time converting binary to decimal,\n\n1167\n01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,240\ndecimal to binary.\n\n1168\n01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,210\nSo you wanna do as little as possible.\n\n1169\n01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:42,080\nWhen I look at this table,\nsee how they all start with 192.168.\n\n1170\n01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,297\nEvery one of these starts with 192.168.\n\n1171\n01:01:46,297 --> 01:01:49,783\nSo there's not really much I'm gonna\nbe able to do with those first two\n\n1172\n01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,277\nbecause they completely match.\n\n1173\n01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:55,100\nSo I can just not convert those,\nif I don't want to.\n\n1174\n01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,470\nNow, here, I'm gonna go ahead and\nconvert them, just so\n\n1175\n01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,870\nwe can see this fully written out,\nit helps to convey the message.\n\n1176\n01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:06,080\nBut on the exam, I would not convert 192\nand 168 cuz it's really a waste of time.\n\n1177\n01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,150\nI would just put, like x's in there,\nor not mark it at all.\n\n1178\n01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,720\nAnd then just jump to the next one.\n\n1179\n01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,740\nBut, because this one is so\ncommon, I've got it memorized,\n\n1180\n01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,652\nso that makes it a little bit easier.\n\n1181\n01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:22,730\nAll right,\n\n1182\n01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:30,100\nso this is our first address which is\n192.168.0.0 so that is it in binary, and\n\n1183\n01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:35,040\nbecause these are all kinda the same, I\ncan save myself a little bit of time here.\n\n1184\n01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,500\nAnd we can start to take like,\none, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n1185\n01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,150\nAll right.\n\n1186\n01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:46,780\nSo these are our networks and just need\nto update these numbers to reflect that.\n\n1187\n01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,427\nSo there's one in binary and\ntwo in binary, three in binary, four,\n\n1188\n01:02:51,427 --> 01:02:52,560\nfive, and six.\n\n1189\n01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,770\nAll right.\n\n1190\n01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,398\nSo there they all are in binary.\n\n1191\n01:02:59,398 --> 01:03:06,070\nIf I wanna make my networks\nas small as possible,\n\n1192\n01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,370\nokay, I need to start from the left and\ngo to the right.\n\n1193\n01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:16,390\nAnd I need to find the point where these\nnumbers stop being the same, okay.\n\n1194\n01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:19,120\nSo following this across,\nwhere does that happen, right?\n\n1195\n01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,460\nWhere do things stop being the same?\n\n1196\n01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,905\nWell I already know the first.\n\n1197\n01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:24,825\nTwo octets are the same,\nso I can move past that.\n\n1198\n01:03:24,825 --> 01:03:25,875\nThat's why I can skip it.\n\n1199\n01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,055\nThere's no point in converting it,\nI already know they're the same.\n\n1200\n01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:34,145\nBut in the third octet, they actually\nstop right here, at the 5th bit.\n\n1201\n01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:35,920\nThe 5th bit, they're all zeros.\n\n1202\n01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,455\nThe 6-bit,\nthings start to get crazy, right?\n\n1203\n01:03:38,455 --> 01:03:40,000\n>> Yep\n>> We have some with zeros,\n\n1204\n01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,010\nsome with ones.\n\n1205\n01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,750\nThey're no longer the same.\n\n1206\n01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:48,000\nSo if I were to combine these,\nI could draw my line, right.\n\n1207\n01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,140\nRemember my line from earlier?\n\n1208\n01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,570\nI could draw that line right here.\n\n1209\n01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,990\nWhoops.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1210\n01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,130\nAnd that would make them all the same,\n\n1211\n01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:03,940\nall wrapped up in a nice little bundle,\nright.\n\n1212\n01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,160\nSo now they could all be shown as\nbeing on the same network, right.\n\n1213\n01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,032\nSo all I have to do is count my bits.\n\n1214\n01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:10,731\nSo I've got eight bits,\neight more, that's 16.\n\n1215\n01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:13,402\nPlus these five, that gets me to 21.\n\n1216\n01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:18,547\nIf I were to do 192.168.0.0/21,\n\n1217\n01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:23,066\nthat would include all of these networks.\n\n1218\n01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:23,756\nRight?\n\n1219\n01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:24,960\nNow what's the problem with that, Ronnie?\n\n1220\n01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,110\n>> Problem with this-\n>> On the spot quiz.\n\n1221\n01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,410\n>> Oh.\n>> If I do a /21 what am I breaking?\n\n1222\n01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,001\n>> You're breaking the rules.\n\n1223\n01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:35,630\n>> Well,\n\n1224\n01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:40,460\nI'm breaking some rules especially when it\ncomes to what networks I'm advertising.\n\n1225\n01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,900\nIf I start telling other routers\nthat I have 192.68.0.0/21,\n\n1226\n01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,370\nwell that's true for these networks.\n\n1227\n01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:51,690\n>> Right, but it's also true for others.\n\n1228\n01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,150\n>> Right.\nCuz it goes all the way up.\n\n1229\n01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,170\nIf I were to really crank things up.\n\n1230\n01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:01,850\nTechnically, and I actually don't know\nwhat this one is actually gonna be, so\n\n1231\n01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,946\nI'll just put question marks in there.\n\n1232\n01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:04,437\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1233\n01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:07,110\n>> Let me just show you guys.\n\n1234\n01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:11,300\nWhen we move that line to here,\nif I take and\n\n1235\n01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:17,000\ndo 111, to find the end,\nto find the highest number, right?\n\n1236\n01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,870\nThat's gonna be 192.168.\n\n1237\n01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:22,963\nand this would be 111 is seven, right?\n\n1238\n01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:23,508\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yep.\n\n1239\n01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:25,674\nSo that would be 7.0, right?\n\n1240\n01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:28,520\nOr 7.255 the way I've written it.\n\n1241\n01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:36,370\nBut it would include that 7 dot network,\nwhich I don't have in my company, okay?\n\n1242\n01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,600\nSo 192.168.7 is a network I don't have.\n\n1243\n01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,820\nIf I do a /21, I'm including that.\n\n1244\n01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,390\nThat's a problem.\n\n1245\n01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:46,230\nNow, if I know that .7 is not being\nused anywhere and I wanna go ahead and\n\n1246\n01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,860\nwrap it up and advertise it, that's fine,\nbut if I do this, if I advertise with\n\n1247\n01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,190\nthis network here, I'm technically\nadvertising a network I don't have.\n\n1248\n01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,580\nAnd that's against the rules\nespecially with internet routing.\n\n1249\n01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,990\nIf you're an internet connected router,\n\n1250\n01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,890\nif these are public ranges,\nyou're not allowed to do that.\n\n1251\n01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,180\nThey'll shut you off,\nyour backbone is required to shut you off.\n\n1252\n01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,740\nAnd then your internet access is gone.\n\n1253\n01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,240\n>> There you go.\n\n1254\n01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:15,480\n>> So when we start to divide up our\nnetwork like this, it's important that we\n\n1255\n01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,830\nonly advertise networks\nthat we actually have.\n\n1256\n01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:19,410\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1257\n01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:22,810\nwe have to be careful about\nwhere we draw this line.\n\n1258\n01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,690\nAnd in this case while it would be nice\nto combine them all into one network,\n\n1259\n01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,590\nwe're not gonna be able to.\n\n1260\n01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,710\nWe're gonna have to do\nseparate summarizations.\n\n1261\n01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:38,283\nAll right, so looking at it here, if I\nwanna make sure that I don't grab any un,\n\n1262\n01:06:38,283 --> 01:06:41,370\nnonexisting, what's the right word there?\n\n1263\n01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,340\nNonexisting networks?\n\n1264\n01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,350\n>> Any other networks.\n\n1265\n01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,375\n>> Any other networks.\n\n1266\n01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We need to find\n\n1267\n01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,460\na better place to draw our line, right?\n\n1268\n01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,411\nIf I move the line to the right one, so\n\n1269\n01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:56,420\nif I just move it over one space and\ngo over to here.\n\n1270\n01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:04,226\nSo I'm actually gonna have two lines now.\n\n1271\n01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:10,903\nDo I have an extra zero in there,\nor something?\n\n1272\n01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:11,566\nWhat have I done?\n\n1273\n01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:14,597\n>> There you go.\n\n1274\n01:07:17,015 --> 01:07:18,363\n>> There, ok.\n\n1275\n01:07:18,363 --> 01:07:20,070\nSo I'm gonna have two lines.\n\n1276\n01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:23,170\nIf I move that line to the right,\nsee how I've got zeros for\n\n1277\n01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,690\nthe first four networks?\n\n1278\n01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:29,460\nAnd then I've got ones for the last three,\nbut to the right of it notice\n\n1279\n01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,770\nhow I've got 00, 01, 10, and 11.\n\n1280\n01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:36,710\nThat covers all four combinations of that.\n\n1281\n01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,895\nSo, if instead of a /21 if I did a /22,\n\n1282\n01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:44,617\nin other words moving that\nline to the right one more,\n\n1283\n01:07:44,617 --> 01:07:49,436\nthat would take these first four\nnetworks and it would combine them.\n\n1284\n01:07:49,436 --> 01:07:54,577\n192.168.0.0/22, that includes\n\n1285\n01:07:54,577 --> 01:07:59,111\n192.168.0.1.2, and .3.\n\n1286\n01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:02,850\nAnd it doesn't include any other networks,\njust those four.\n\n1287\n01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:09,370\nAnd so that would let me\ncollapse the first four entries.\n\n1288\n01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:13,440\nSo now if I did that,\nmy routing table would go from\n\n1289\n01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,940\nbeing seven routes to just\nbeing four routes, right?\n\n1290\n01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,640\nSo I would have four routes, yeah.\n\n1291\n01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,007\nSo then I would have,\nwho am I leaving out?\n\n1292\n01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:26,921\n4.0/24, 5.0/24.\n\n1293\n01:08:29,244 --> 01:08:30,897\n6.0/24.\n\n1294\n01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:32,513\nOkay.\n\n1295\n01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:35,401\nSo my routing table goes from\nseven routes down to four routes.\n\n1296\n01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:36,750\nNow that doesn't sound\nlike a big difference.\n\n1297\n01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:43,070\nBut if you have hundreds of thousands of\nroutes and you do this in thousands of\n\n1298\n01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,560\nplaces, you can get your internet routing\ntable well below a hundred thousand routes\n\n1299\n01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,190\nand most ISPs will have routing tables\nthat are less than 50, 000 routes.\n\n1300\n01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,680\nSo that's huge savings.\n\n1301\n01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,430\nMakes your routers considerably faster.\n\n1302\n01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,380\n>> So be careful here.\n\n1303\n01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,360\nLike Don said, if we get too many,\nwe may violate that idea and\n\n1304\n01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,970\nactually end up advertising someone else's\nroutes underneath our summarization.\n\n1305\n01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,140\nSo we may not want to do that.\n\n1306\n01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,210\nSo sometimes you do have to compromise and\nsay,\n\n1307\n01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,740\nI can't summarize everything that I want\nto, you actually summarize what you can.\n\n1308\n01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,750\n>> And we're not necessarily done.\n\n1309\n01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,270\n>> Nope.\n>> We could go a little bit\n\n1310\n01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,095\nfurther, right?\n\n1311\n01:09:20,095 --> 01:09:22,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So sure, I don't have four, five,\n\n1312\n01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,085\nsix, and seven, right?\n\n1313\n01:09:24,085 --> 01:09:25,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I can't get seven, but\n\n1314\n01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,780\nthat doesn't mean I'm\ncompletely out of luck.\n\n1315\n01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:31,300\nI could take these networks\nhere that are left over.\n\n1316\n01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,250\nI wasn't able to subnet them.\n\n1317\n01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:39,290\nAnd let me get rid of this extra\nline cuz it'll just get confusing.\n\n1318\n01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,260\nThere.\nOkay.\n\n1319\n01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:46,860\nSo that's where I broke those four down to\ncombine them into the one 192.160.0.0/22.\n\n1320\n01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,960\nIf I look down here, notice how 192.168.4,\n\n1321\n01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:58,110\nand .5,\nthey are the same all the way up to here.\n\n1322\n01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,660\nAnd then after that,\nthey've got a 0 and a 1.\n\n1323\n01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,610\nThat bit only has two combinations,\n0 and a 1.\n\n1324\n01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:10,010\nSo I can actually combine these two\nguys if I put their line right there.\n\n1325\n01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,080\nSo if I draw their line right there,\n\n1326\n01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,800\nadding that one extra bit to the host ID,\nthen that would combine them.\n\n1327\n01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:22,210\nAnd I could take my four and five and\n\n1328\n01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:25,240\ncombine them into a /23.\n\n1329\n01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:31,690\nSo now my routing table goes from seven\nroutes down to only three routes.\n\n1330\n01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:35,270\nAnd that's important to remember on the\nexam also is that you can mix and match.\n\n1331\n01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:40,100\nYou don't always have to do, if I do a /22\nhere, I've gotta do a /22 everywhere.\n\n1332\n01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,490\nNo, you can mix and match.\n\n1333\n01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,420\nThe real important thing\nis in real life land.\n\n1334\n01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,870\nThis IP range right here.\n\n1335\n01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,370\nThese are three routes\nthat I'm advertising.\n\n1336\n01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,740\nI have these entire routes.\n\n1337\n01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:56,485\nI'm not advertising anything false.\n\n1338\n01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:04,455\nIf I did a 192.168.0.0/21 I would be\nfalsely advertising that I had 192.168.7.\n\n1339\n01:11:04,455 --> 01:11:08,630\nWith private address it may not matter.\n\n1340\n01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,130\nIt's easy and you're done.\n\n1341\n01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,950\nBut with public addresses\nyou can't do that.\n\n1342\n01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,400\nSo we do have to break it up.\n\n1343\n01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,110\nAnd so in this case I had to do a /22,\na /23 and a /24.\n\n1344\n01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:25,260\nThis routing table right here matches\nwhat I showed at the very beginning.\n\n1345\n01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,290\nSo where I had seven of these /24s,\n\n1346\n01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:34,175\nnow I'm down to just three networks,\na /22, a /23, and a /24.\n\n1347\n01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:35,429\n>> Excellent.\n\n1348\n01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:38,140\n>> Now,\nyou need to know how to do this by hand.\n\n1349\n01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,240\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n1350\n01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,800\nAnd like I said,\njump over to that Network+ show.\n\n1351\n01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,325\nIt's actually two episodes we did it.\n\n1352\n01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:44,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It spanned over two episodes.\n\n1353\n01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,410\nAnd so we do this by hand.\n\n1354\n01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,300\nWe show you how to work it out.\n\n1355\n01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,500\nIt's really detailed.\n\n1356\n01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,900\nWe're gonna learn later though that a lot\nof our routing protocols will do this for\n\n1357\n01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,010\nus automatically and that's pretty cool.\n\n1358\n01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:00,205\nBut on the exam they want you\nto be able to do it by hand.\n\n1359\n01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:01,165\nSo, you will get questions about this.\n\n1360\n01:12:01,165 --> 01:12:05,215\nThey'll give you a routing table,\nand they'll say what's the smallest\n\n1361\n01:12:05,215 --> 01:12:09,133\nsubnet mass you can use to combine\nthese networks without wasting IPs,\n\n1362\n01:12:09,133 --> 01:12:11,109\nwithout falsely advertising IPs.\n\n1363\n01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:12,460\nAnd you've gotta work that out.\n\n1364\n01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:17,940\nWe should probably do another example.\n\n1365\n01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,650\n>> Sure.\n>> Right.\n\n1366\n01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,720\nLet's just take, I'll come up with some\noff the wall numbers that are a pain for\n\n1367\n01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,308\nus to convert.\n\n1368\n01:12:23,308 --> 01:12:25,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know\n\n1369\n01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:29,725\nwe could do the opposite direction\nof VLSM where we break up a network.\n\n1370\n01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:30,280\nRight?\n\n1371\n01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,720\nSo maybe I go out and\nI buy some registered IP's from my\n\n1372\n01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,210\nInternet service provider or directly\nfrom the INA, I can't normally do.\n\n1373\n01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:45,110\nBut so I go out and I get 209.251.133.,\nwell maybe I get the whole class.\n\n1374\n01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,270\nWell not the whole class C.\n\n1375\n01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,985\nMaybe they give me half the class C right.\n\n1376\n01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:54,337\n>> Yep.\n>> So they give me a 25, right?\n\n1377\n01:12:54,337 --> 01:13:02,261\nA /25 tells me that the first\n25 bits are my subnet mask.\n\n1378\n01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:02,775\nRight?\nAnd\n\n1379\n01:13:02,775 --> 01:13:06,007\nthen the remaining,\nwhat am I left with, seven bits?\n\n1380\n01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,627\nThe remaining seven bits are my host ID,\nright?\n\n1381\n01:13:08,627 --> 01:13:11,916\nAnd that gives me enough,\nseven bits would give me 126?\n\n1382\n01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:12,946\n>> 27?\n>> 126.\n\n1383\n01:13:12,946 --> 01:13:15,111\n>> Okay, so 126 usable IP's.\n\n1384\n01:13:15,111 --> 01:13:19,057\nPretty decent amount of public IP's.\n\n1385\n01:13:19,057 --> 01:13:21,970\nIf I have a disaster recovery site.\n\n1386\n01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:25,680\nAnd I have a production home office site.\n\n1387\n01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,260\nI may wanna divide this up again, so\nthat half the addresses can go to DR,\n\n1388\n01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,800\nand half can stay right in production.\n\n1389\n01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,070\nRight?\nAnd this is a real world example.\n\n1390\n01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,070\nI've done this at a number of places.\n\n1391\n01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,620\nAnd it saves you from having\nto get another address pool.\n\n1392\n01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,830\n>> Right, so\nthe idea of wasting a few addresses here\n\n1393\n01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:46,590\nis what we normally actually are trying\nto do with variable link subnet masking.\n\n1394\n01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,610\nEven though we may not end up working\nwith an ISP inside of our own businesses,\n\n1395\n01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,811\nthis is where it's gonna become critical,\nright here.\n\n1396\n01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:56,940\n>> And this network is already\nsomewhat small, it's a slash 25 right.\n\n1397\n01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:01,450\nSo that tells me the first three octets,\n209.251.133, that's the first 24 bits,\n\n1398\n01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,770\nthey're entirely in the network ID.\n\n1399\n01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:04,600\nRight?\n\n1400\n01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,230\nSo, what I was saying earlier was,\n\n1401\n01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:10,070\nwhen it comes to converting this stuff,\nwe don't really care what\n\n1402\n01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,510\nthat is in binary cuz we're not going\nto have to work with those octets.\n\n1403\n01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,050\nThose octets are not really\ninvolved in our operation.\n\n1404\n01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:20,522\nAnd then I know zero.\n\n1405\n01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:21,486\nRight?\n\n1406\n01:14:21,486 --> 01:14:24,035\nSo I like to call it the action octet.\n\n1407\n01:14:24,035 --> 01:14:24,730\nRight?\nAll\n\n1408\n01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:27,490\nof the action is happening\nhere in this last octet.\n\n1409\n01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,330\nThe first three, I'm not so worried about.\n\n1410\n01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:33,202\nSo this is,\nas far as I'm concerned on the exam,\n\n1411\n01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,605\nthis is what 209.251.133.0 is in binary.\n\n1412\n01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,990\nOkay?\n\n1413\n01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,110\nAnd again, I'm doing this to save time,\n\n1414\n01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,490\nI don't want to convert\nstuff I don't need to.\n\n1415\n01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:50,900\nNow they told me it's a /25,\nso a /25 subnet mask,\n\n1416\n01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,160\nagain, I'm not going to convert that\nto decimal, because I don't care right?\n\n1417\n01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> But I know it's 25 ones.\n\n1418\n01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:01,690\nSo when I write out that network mask\nthat they gave me I need to do 25 ones.\n\n1419\n01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,930\nAnd I'm just hitting one and\ncounting them in my head.\n\n1420\n01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,846\nSo I got to 25 ones.\n\n1421\n01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:07,858\nActually, I didn't even really do\nthat because I knew that there\n\n1422\n01:15:07,858 --> 01:15:11,390\nwere 24 ones in the first three octets and\nI only needed one more.\n\n1423\n01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,960\nSo there's the subnet mask.\n\n1424\n01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:20,740\nSo that tells me that according to my\nISP my line gets drawn right here.\n\n1425\n01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,300\nOkay?\n\n1426\n01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,420\nSo that's where my line is drawn, and that\nis my network as far as I'm concerned.\n\n1427\n01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,050\nOkay?\n\n1428\n01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:32,330\nAnd if I wanted to figure out the first\nusable, and last usable addresses,\n\n1429\n01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:36,210\nand so on, what I can do is\nI can just take this number,\n\n1430\n01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,780\nand the first usable address is all zeros.\n\n1431\n01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:46,480\nThe last usable address, we take that\nhost ID, and we make it all ones, right?\n\n1432\n01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,440\nSo this is the, well,\nthey actually have names, right?\n\n1433\n01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,480\nSo this is the subnet address,\nwhich really is already done for us here.\n\n1434\n01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,795\nAnd then we do like the first usable.\n\n1435\n01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,310\nWhich the first usable we\nmake it all zeros and a one.\n\n1436\n01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:10,018\nAnd then last usable it's all ones and\na zero.\n\n1437\n01:16:10,018 --> 01:16:13,650\n>> Then we have our broadcast.\n\n1438\n01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,260\n>> And then our broadcast, yep.\n\n1439\n01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,970\n>> So these are the boundaries of\nthe network that they've given us, okay?\n\n1440\n01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:23,180\nAnd I'm not wasting time on those\nfirst three octets, but for\n\n1441\n01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,800\nthe last one, these are pretty\neasy numbers to convert, right?\n\n1442\n01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,350\nAll zeros and a one.\n\n1443\n01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,760\nThat's gonna be .1.\n\n1444\n01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,390\nAnd then zero, all ones, and a zero.\n\n1445\n01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:33,960\nRight?\n\n1446\n01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,380\nWell, the zero would be 128 if\nwe had that bit, which we don't.\n\n1447\n01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,840\nSo I know my numbers\nare going to be under 128.\n\n1448\n01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,240\nWell, all ones would be 127,\nbut this one has a zero, so\n\n1449\n01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,890\nit's actually going to be 126.\n\n1450\n01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:51,800\nSee, we convert it in our head,\nit saves a lot of time.\n\n1451\n01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,440\nMakes the ED exam go much, much quicker.\n\n1452\n01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:00,540\nSo we can punch in 126 and then the, which\nis going to throw off all my alignment.\n\n1453\n01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,470\nAnd then the [LAUGH] broadcast, right?\n\n1454\n01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,600\nThe all ones there at the end.\n\n1455\n01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,780\nThat tells me it's 127, so\nthere's my broadcast, 127.\n\n1456\n01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,780\nAll right.\n\n1457\n01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,690\nSo we figure out these\naddresses if we have to,\n\n1458\n01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:15,830\nif the question is asking us to figure\nthat out then we can, and it's not so bad.\n\n1459\n01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:22,070\nI do try and take whatever\nshortcuts I can just because I know\n\n1460\n01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,310\nthat I don't have a ton\nof time on these exams.\n\n1461\n01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:29,560\nCisco usually gives you just the amount\nof time tat you need to get things done.\n\n1462\n01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,150\nNow, the whole setup from\nthis in the begging was,\n\n1463\n01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,130\nI want to take this network and\nbreak it in half, right?\n\n1464\n01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,630\n>> Right.\n\n1465\n01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:36,300\n>> I got a pretty decent\nsize network here.\n\n1466\n01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,790\nOne through 126 are my usable IP's.\n\n1467\n01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,140\nI'm gonna break that in half.\n\n1468\n01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:47,650\nSo we should have around 62, 64 addresses\nin each of these networks that we create.\n\n1469\n01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:55,130\nTo break the network in half, all we have\nto do is move our line to the right one.\n\n1470\n01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,680\nMoving it to the right one gives\nus one more bit to the network ID,\n\n1471\n01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,850\nwhich can be zero or one,\nthe two halves of our network.\n\n1472\n01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,260\nIf we wanted to break it into four,\nwe'd go to the right two.\n\n1473\n01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,410\nCuz then we would have zero zero,\nzero one, one zero, and one one, right?\n\n1474\n01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,710\nFour combinations.\n\n1475\n01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:12,990\nSo you move it based on how many\nnetworks you need to create.\n\n1476\n01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,240\nI need to create two.\n\n1477\n01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,340\nI only need one bit to handle that so\nI'm just gonna move it to the right one.\n\n1478\n01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:25,460\n>> So by moving the line to the right one,\nwe're gonna end up seeing that now,\n\n1479\n01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,151\nlet's see we're down\n>> So this is gonna be a /26,\n\n1480\n01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:37,006\nbecause we're adding one more one and\nwe're moving our line over, all right.\n\n1481\n01:18:37,006 --> 01:18:39,923\nNow, actually you know I probably\nneed to change some of this.\n\n1482\n01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,290\nLet me just get rid some of this here.\n\n1483\n01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,260\nSo I'm gonna move my line over.\n\n1484\n01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:52,110\nNow, the problem here is gonna be that I'm\nactually creating two different subnets.\n\n1485\n01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:58,760\nOne subnet is going to be the one that\nwe already had, but the other one\n\n1486\n01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,640\nis going to be, so we've got zero zero,\nand the other one is gonna be zero one.\n\n1487\n01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:08,170\nThose are the two subnets that I'm making,\nand so I need to figure out what\n\n1488\n01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:12,160\nmy two subnets are going to be before I\ntry and calculate out my other addresses.\n\n1489\n01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,270\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n1490\n01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:18,740\nSo my initial line was drawn here and\nthat's why I have a zero to the right.\n\n1491\n01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,820\nI've got to have that zero right,\nbecause that's locked in.\n\n1492\n01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,480\nThat's what my ISP gave me.\n\n1493\n01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,560\nBut now I'm portioning out this bit to\nbe able to give to my network ID and\n\n1494\n01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,920\nso I get it and\nI can have a zero or a one there.\n\n1495\n01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,900\nAll right, so\nif we calculate that out, right?\n\n1496\n01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:39,490\nAll zeros, that's a zero,\nzero one, that's the 64 bit, and so\n\n1497\n01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,462\nthis subnet will actually start with a 64.\n\n1498\n01:19:42,462 --> 01:19:43,290\nRight?\n\n1499\n01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:46,600\nNow if that's all they're asking for\non the question, I can stop there.\n\n1500\n01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,270\nI don't necessarily have to calculate out\nthe first and the last and the broadcast.\n\n1501\n01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:54,110\nUnless that's specifically\nwhat they're asking for.\n\n1502\n01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:56,882\nBut here by going with the /26,\nI do create the two networks.\n\n1503\n01:19:56,882 --> 01:20:01,190\nAnd we've actually got a little\nbit of time so we can go ahead and\n\n1504\n01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:05,024\ncalculate out the first,\nlast and all that good stuff.\n\n1505\n01:20:05,024 --> 01:20:07,172\nCuz it's not a hard thing to do, right?\n\n1506\n01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:10,945\nWe just take our addresses\nas they are Whoops.\n\n1507\n01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:13,841\nAnd we go a little crazy.\n\n1508\n01:20:17,135 --> 01:20:18,260\nAll right.\n\n1509\n01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:23,590\nSo, basically we're gonna take our,\nwe wanna find the broadcast.\n\n1510\n01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:26,170\nWe wanna find the first usable and\nthe last usable.\n\n1511\n01:20:34,388 --> 01:20:35,310\nAll right.\n\n1512\n01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:40,920\nSo for the first usable, all zeros and\na one for the host ID at least.\n\n1513\n01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,090\nLast usable is like that,\nand broadcast is all ones.\n\n1514\n01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,020\nRight?\n\n1515\n01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,230\nAnd then all we have to do is\nconvert just that last octet to\n\n1516\n01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,140\nfigure out what value should be in here,\nright?\n\n1517\n01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,290\nSo if we talk about the first usable,\nwell, that's easy.\n\n1518\n01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,570\nThat's a one.\n\n1519\n01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:01,340\nThe last usable will end up being,\nlet's see.128, 64 so\n\n1520\n01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:06,430\nthat would be 63 if we had all of them but\nwe don't we have 62.\n\n1521\n01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:08,998\nAnd then we have\n>> 63 as the Broadcast.\n\n1522\n01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:11,370\n>> 63 for the Broadcast.\n\n1523\n01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,900\nAnd I can just actually cheat\neven more here and just copy\n\n1524\n01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:20,205\nthese guys, paste them down here,\n\n1525\n01:21:20,205 --> 01:21:24,860\ncuz I just really have to make\nminor changes to that one bit.\n\n1526\n01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,990\nThe first network had 00 and the second\nhad 01, that's really the only difference\n\n1527\n01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:32,280\nbut that's gonna change these\nnumbers over here a good bit.\n\n1528\n01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,520\nMy first address is actually gonna be 65,\nand\n\n1529\n01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,180\nyou can see that in the 64\nbit plus the one bit.\n\n1530\n01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:44,650\n>> And\nthen we'll have 126 followed by 127.\n\n1531\n01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:48,920\nSo there we get our sub-net address?\n\n1532\n01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,710\nOh, you know, it's,\nmy head's on top of it.\n\n1533\n01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:51,410\nThere we go.\n\n1534\n01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:55,030\nWe get our sub-net address,\nour first usable, our last usable, and\n\n1535\n01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:58,160\nour broadcast address for\neach of the networks that we just created.\n\n1536\n01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:03,137\nAnd we created that by adding this extra\nbit to the network I've got 00 for\n\n1537\n01:22:03,137 --> 01:22:06,547\nthe first network and\n01 for the second network.\n\n1538\n01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:13,506\nThey're both inside of\nthe 209.251.133.0/25.\n\n1539\n01:22:13,506 --> 01:22:16,001\n>> But these are /26's, right?\n\n1540\n01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:17,122\nThey're inside of it.\n\n1541\n01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:23,110\nSo that's another use for VLSM,\nyou see that mostly when you're trying to\n\n1542\n01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,900\npart out public IP's and\nuse them efficiently.\n\n1543\n01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,960\nWhen you're dealing with private IP's,\n\n1544\n01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,410\nwe don't normally do this because you\ncan waste private IP's what do you care.\n\n1545\n01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,428\nSo people usually just pick\nall sorts of crazy sub-nets.\n\n1546\n01:22:35,927 --> 01:22:40,693\nAll right so, for the exam, that's\nreally what you can expect to see, and\n\n1547\n01:22:40,693 --> 01:22:43,050\nagain, if that just blew your mind.\n\n1548\n01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,270\nRight.\n\n1549\n01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,470\nYou went crazy.\n\n1550\n01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:48,260\nI definitely encourage you to jump over to\nthe Network Plus show where we go a lot\n\n1551\n01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,490\nslower, and\ntackle it in a lot more detail.\n\n1552\n01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:54,480\nBut by the time you're\nhere into the CCNT side,\n\n1553\n01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,680\nyou should already have that\nbasic network knowledge.\n\n1554\n01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,200\nSo hopefully that serves as\na good review for you guys.\n\n1555\n01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,711\nI think I'm about tapped out on\nthe sub-netting, Ronnie, how about you?\n\n1556\n01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:06,210\n>> I think our last segment is actually\nthe one that's gonna tap us out\n\n1557\n01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:06,968\ncompletely.\n\n1558\n01:23:06,968 --> 01:23:08,070\n>> [LAUGH] Oh yeah.\n\n1559\n01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,560\nSo we've been focusing\non IPv4 the whole show.\n\n1560\n01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,250\nNow, for the next segment,\nwe're gonna jump into IPv6, and\n\n1561\n01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:19,410\nthere we don't even worry about\nsubletting cuz the outer space is so big.\n\n1562\n01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:22,190\nIf you haven't seen IPv6 before\nhere will be your chance.\n\n1563\n01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:22,840\nIt's exciting.\n\n1564\n01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,470\nIt's fun.\nIt's new.\n\n1565\n01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:26,310\nDefinitely something you\nwanna stay tuned for.\n\n1566\n01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,680\nAll right, so on that note,\nlet's stop right here and take a break.\n\n1567\n01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,620\nWhen we get back,\nthe wonderful world of IPv6.\n\n1568\n01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:34,035\nWe'll see you then.\n\n1569\n01:23:34,035 --> 01:23:37,465\n[SOUND]\n\n1570\n01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:53,759\n[MUSIC]\n\n1571\n01:23:53,759 --> 01:23:55,810\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n1572\n01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:58,380\nSo we've been droning on\n>> Yes.\n\n1573\n01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,550\n>> About IPV4 and all that this episode.\n\n1574\n01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,680\nAnd now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at IPv6, right?\n\n1575\n01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,900\nThe successor for IPv4.\n\n1576\n01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,240\n>> Yeah now in IPv6 for us.\n\n1577\n01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:13,240\nAnd what we actually have here is a much\nlarger address space, remember that IPv4\n\n1578\n01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,010\ndidn't give us enough essentially in the\nway that we started handing them out, and\n\n1579\n01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:20,170\nwe started dissipating them, or\nI guess losing them rapidly.\n\n1580\n01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,470\nAnd the nice this as\nsoon as they realized,\n\n1581\n01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:26,420\nin the phenomenal growth of the Internet,\nthat we would start losing them,\n\n1582\n01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:30,440\nI mean incredibly rapidly, they started\nworking on a solution right away.\n\n1583\n01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:35,510\nNow I'm sure that solution actually went\nthrough several processes, but now it's\n\n1584\n01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:40,750\nfinalized, we are on the backbone of\nthe Internet, moving towards IP version 6.\n\n1585\n01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,310\nAnd it's coming rapidly\ntowards us as a CCENT,\n\n1586\n01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,110\nyou're gonna need to know\nthe basics of IP version 6.\n\n1587\n01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:47,760\n>> Yeah.\n\n1588\n01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,990\nIPv6 actually was originally\ndeveloped in the late 90's.\n\n1589\n01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:53,100\nSo we're talking about\nan old technology now.\n\n1590\n01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,210\nIt's been around a while.\n\n1591\n01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:57,440\nBut there have been various things\nthat have made us not deploy\n\n1592\n01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,500\nis as widely as we should.\n\n1593\n01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,340\nBut the cool part is,\nafter the original standard came out and\n\n1594\n01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,540\nit wasn't widely adopted,\nthey said, all right,\n\n1595\n01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,740\nlet's take this time to add features to\nmake it better, and they've done that.\n\n1596\n01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,710\nAnd so there's things like IPSET,\nprotocol encryption that's kind\n\n1597\n01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:17,650\nof built into the IPv6 mobile IP,\nwhere your IP address\n\n1598\n01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:20,920\ncan follow you from network to network\nlike a phone number does on a cell phone.\n\n1599\n01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,270\nThat kind of thing is\nbuilt into the protocol.\n\n1600\n01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,780\nSo it's a very powerful,\nvery feature-rich protocol,\n\n1601\n01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:29,780\nthat we all,\nwant to get to as soon as we can.\n\n1602\n01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,190\nBut even if you want to,\nsometimes your stuck.\n\n1603\n01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:35,850\nSo like for me at home,\nI really want to do IPv6 at home.\n\n1604\n01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:38,020\nMy ISP doesn't make it\navailable to customers yet.\n\n1605\n01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,246\nSo you may or may not actually be able to,\ndeploy it in your network.\n\n1606\n01:25:42,246 --> 01:25:44,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n1607\n01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,720\nIdentification at this point\nis really the key, right.\n\n1608\n01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,350\nSo we wanna become familiar with it.\n\n1609\n01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:53,650\nAs familiar as you're gonna be with IP\nversion 4, like Don said, next five to\n\n1610\n01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:57,510\nseven years, maybe a little bit sooner,\nit's gonna become very familiar, and\n\n1611\n01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:00,760\nif you're ahead of the game, you're\ngonna be one step ahead of most people.\n\n1612\n01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,620\nThat won't change.\n\n1613\n01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,450\n>> That's right.\n\n1614\n01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:04,680\nSo let's start with\nthe biggest difference.\n\n1615\n01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:08,670\n>> Right.\n>> IPv4 is a 32-bit address, and\n\n1616\n01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:13,070\nwe normally write it as a decimal number\nso it's easy for us as humans to handle.\n\n1617\n01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:16,490\nIPv6, it's 128 bits.\n\n1618\n01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,110\n>> Wow.\n>> It's massive.\n\n1619\n01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> A massive number, and\n\n1620\n01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:21,740\nbeyond what we can grasp as humans.\n\n1621\n01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,590\nAnd so to give you an idea of\n\n1622\n01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,379\nhow big 128 bits is-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1623\n01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,710\n>> The 32 bit address space for IPv4.\n\n1624\n01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:31,110\nWe said earlier,\nactually I don't think we did say.\n\n1625\n01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:32,170\n>> Nope.\n>> But it's, yeah.\n\n1626\n01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:35,680\n>> 32 bit address space gives us a little\n\n1627\n01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,195\nbit under 4.3 billion\npossible combinations.\n\n1628\n01:26:38,195 --> 01:26:40,765\nSo out on the Internet\nthat's what we have.\n\n1629\n01:26:40,765 --> 01:26:45,595\nWhen you move to the idea of IPv6,\nnot talking about billions anymore,\n\n1630\n01:26:45,595 --> 01:26:48,955\nwe're talking about numbers\nthat aren't easy to describe.\n\n1631\n01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:51,380\n>> It's like quintillions or something.\n\n1632\n01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:54,300\nLet's put it in terms that\nour minds can wrap around.\n\n1633\n01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,520\nSo 4.3 billion,\nthat's a big number, right?\n\n1634\n01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,350\nBut most of us understand\nwhat a billion is.\n\n1635\n01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:04,260\nAnd so\nin IPv4 we had 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n1636\n01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,750\nAnd when IPv4 was originally developed,\n\n1637\n01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,620\nthat was roughly the earth's a population,\nright?\n\n1638\n01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,710\nAnd so, everybody could have one address.\n\n1639\n01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:13,500\nWell, the earth's population\ntoday is over 6 billion, so\n\n1640\n01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:17,780\nnow there's not even enough for\neverybody to have one address.\n\n1641\n01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:23,424\nIn IPv6, with 128-bit address space,\nevery single person on the planet today,\n\n1642\n01:27:23,424 --> 01:27:28,914\nall 6 billion people, every single person\ncould have 4.3 billions IP's each,\n\n1643\n01:27:28,914 --> 01:27:32,170\nand we'd still have more leftover.\n\n1644\n01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:35,010\nThat's how big the 128\nbit address space is.\n\n1645\n01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,280\nIt is massive.\n\n1646\n01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,710\n>> Yeah, sometime when you hear about the\nanalogies to describe the space, I mean,\n\n1647\n01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,160\neven the analogies don't make sense,\nright?\n\n1648\n01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,130\nSo, my favorite one that I heard about,\nwas actually one where you could take\n\n1649\n01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:50,890\na bb, just a regular bb that shoots out of\na bb gun, assign an IP version 6 address.\n\n1650\n01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,630\nYou could stack them, going to\nthe nearest black hole coming back round,\n\n1651\n01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:55,801\nand we'd still have billions\nof addresses left over.\n\n1652\n01:27:55,801 --> 01:27:59,677\n[LAUGH] I mean it's just staggering\nhow big this address space is.\n\n1653\n01:27:59,677 --> 01:28:00,893\n>> Yeah.\nIt is massive.\n\n1654\n01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:04,131\nAnd there are numerous jokes\nthat we missed out on here.\n\n1655\n01:28:04,131 --> 01:28:04,712\n>> Yeah, oh gosh.\n\n1656\n01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,812\nYeah.\n>> But anyhow, so it is Massive.\n\n1657\n01:28:07,812 --> 01:28:10,063\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, when you have an address that big,\n\n1658\n01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:10,575\nall right?\n\n1659\n01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:15,507\nTo write out 128 bits in ones and zeroes,\nit would just wrap around your screen and\n\n1660\n01:28:15,507 --> 01:28:16,970\nbe ridiculous.\n\n1661\n01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:21,285\nSo, with IPB 6,\nwe use hexidecimal numbers, all right?\n\n1662\n01:28:21,285 --> 01:28:24,315\nIn decimal, we have zero through nine, and\n\n1663\n01:28:24,315 --> 01:28:27,845\neach place in the number\nis a value of ten,right?\n\n1664\n01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:29,825\nSo zero through nine has ten values.\n\n1665\n01:28:29,825 --> 01:28:31,109\nIn binary, you have zero and one.\n\n1666\n01:28:31,109 --> 01:28:33,105\n>> Right.\n>> You just have two values.\n\n1667\n01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:38,097\nBut in Hexadecimal, you have zero\nthrough nine, and then A through F,\n\n1668\n01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:39,807\nso you actually have 16 values.\n\n1669\n01:28:39,807 --> 01:28:41,997\nIt's base 16 mathematics.\n\n1670\n01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:44,937\nSo, when you look at a hexadecimal number,\nit's not really a number anymore.\n\n1671\n01:28:44,937 --> 01:28:50,050\nIt's numbers and letters that\nare represented to us as human beings.\n\n1672\n01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,650\nSo the address is big, right?\n\n1673\n01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:56,490\nAnd the way it's normally\nrepresented is eight blocks of\n\n1674\n01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:02,190\nfour hexadecimal digits each and\nthey're separated by a colon, okay?\n\n1675\n01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,750\nSo let me give some examples here.\n\n1676\n01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,120\n>> Yep.\n\n1677\n01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,980\nNow, while Don is talking about this,\nlet's talk about what\n\n1678\n01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,891\nwould happen if we talked about this\nidea in that dotted decimal notation.\n\n1679\n01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:19,510\nWe would actually have 16 separate octets,\nis what we would actually have.\n\n1680\n01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:22,610\nSo instead of seeing the four octets\nthat we've been seeing in IP version 4.\n\n1681\n01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:27,600\nWe tried to report this in that .decimal,\n16 .sections.\n\n1682\n01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,940\nTo make it easier,\nthe IETF actually ended up saying hey\n\n1683\n01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:34,350\nwe need to actually report this\nas something that is shorter.\n\n1684\n01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:36,990\nSo the very first time I read about this\nit said they shortened the format and\n\n1685\n01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:38,590\nI didn't understand why.\n\n1686\n01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:40,990\nBut because we have a base 16 here,\n\n1687\n01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:45,720\nwhat they did is that they made\n8 sections of 16 bits instead.\n\n1688\n01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,385\nAnd for us, we needed the way\nto report that easily, and\n\n1689\n01:29:48,385 --> 01:29:50,810\nthat's were hexidecimal comes in.\n\n1690\n01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:56,160\nSo Don is now typing out what\na possible ipv6 address ends\n\n1691\n01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,330\nup looking like for us here.\n\n1692\n01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:02,210\nAnd so you can actually see the eight\nsets here separated by the colons.\n\n1693\n01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:03,730\n>> Yep.\nSo what I did is,\n\n1694\n01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:08,440\nI took the IPv6 address from my laptop,\nand then I changed it a little bit so\n\n1695\n01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,730\nit would suit my needs here on screen.\n\n1696\n01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,890\nSo here's an example of an IPv6 address.\n\n1697\n01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:17,650\nI've got fe80:0000:, and so on.\n\n1698\n01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:20,800\nAnd I'm not I'm not gonna bore you\nas we're reading the whole thing cuz\n\n1699\n01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,570\nit is long.\n\n1700\n01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:22,870\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n1701\n01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,350\nSo anyhow, so\nwe got this nice big address, right?\n\n1702\n01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,430\nThat is an IPv6 address.\n\n1703\n01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:31,240\nIf I were to convert that into binary,\ninto ones and\n\n1704\n01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,620\nzeros, it would be 128 ones and zeros.\n\n1705\n01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,710\nAnd it would wrap around\nmy screen at least once.\n\n1706\n01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:40,210\nSo they're big addresses, all right?\n\n1707\n01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:43,850\nNow when they developed IPv6,\nthey said, we need a big address, and\n\n1708\n01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:48,380\nwe're gonna give the most possible\naddress space, room, that they could.\n\n1709\n01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,650\nSo they went with a big number like this.\n\n1710\n01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:54,690\nBut they built in some shorthand\nmethods to help us out,\n\n1711\n01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:56,280\nto make things a little bit easier.\n\n1712\n01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,640\n>> Yup.\nMakes it more humanly readable for us.\n\n1713\n01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,680\n>> First off,\nwe can leave off any trailing zeroes.\n\n1714\n01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,460\nSo here, where we've got 07b8, right?\n\n1715\n01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:10,990\nThe very first digit is a zero and\nyou can leave that zero off and\n\n1716\n01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,050\njust write it as 7b8.\n\n1717\n01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,766\nWe actually do that with IP V4 addresses.\n\n1718\n01:31:14,766 --> 01:31:19,586\n>> Yep.\n>> So like 192.168.0.1, that's actually\n\n1719\n01:31:21,933 --> 01:31:28,540\n192.168.000.001, but we leave off\nthe leading zeros cuz they're meaningless.\n\n1720\n01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,180\nRight?\n\n1721\n01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:31,140\nSo we end up writing it as192.168.0.1.\n\n1722\n01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:33,410\nIPv6 you can do the same thing.\n\n1723\n01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:36,180\nIf you have 07b8 you can\njust write it as 7b8.\n\n1724\n01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,295\nThat makes it a little bit shorter.\n\n1725\n01:31:39,295 --> 01:31:40,630\n>> Yap.\n\n1726\n01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,950\n>> Also,\nif you have one that's all zeroes,\n\n1727\n01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:47,940\nyou can leave off the leading zeroes and\njust have it zero, right?\n\n1728\n01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,490\nSo that way it becomes really short.\n\n1729\n01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:50,340\n>> Yup.\n\n1730\n01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:55,530\nBut then when you have sets of\nzeroes we can even shorten those up.\n\n1731\n01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:58,320\nAnd so normally when you\nhave multiple sets of zeroes\n\n1732\n01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:02,600\nyou can shorten them up in to what we\ncall a double colon notation instead.\n\n1733\n01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,430\n>> Yep.\nSo you'll see here where I took this where\n\n1734\n01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:06,810\nI have three sets of all zeros.\n\n1735\n01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:09,920\nAnd I just made colon colon, all right?\n\n1736\n01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,885\nThat is a shortcut,\na little shorthand notation.\n\n1737\n01:32:12,885 --> 01:32:16,085\nAnd this says everything between\nthese two colons are zeros.\n\n1738\n01:32:16,085 --> 01:32:17,845\nNow, important fact here.\n\n1739\n01:32:17,845 --> 01:32:21,605\nYou can only do that once per address.\n\n1740\n01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:24,455\nSo here, what happens is that\nthe computer looks at it and\n\n1741\n01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:26,520\nit says, okay, here's what I've got.\n\n1742\n01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:31,620\nI've got one, two, three,\nfour, five sets of numbers.\n\n1743\n01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,970\nAnd a colon, colon.\n\n1744\n01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,190\nI should have eight sets of numbers.\n\n1745\n01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:38,940\nSo, that means there's three more sets\nof zeros right here in the short cut,\n\n1746\n01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,190\nall right.\n\n1747\n01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:41,920\nIf I did that twice.\n\n1748\n01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,470\nIf I did it again right\nhere with the other zero.\n\n1749\n01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,120\nRight?\nNow it would say all right,\n\n1750\n01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:50,260\nyou gave me one, two, three,\nfour sets of numbers, I need four more.\n\n1751\n01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:53,090\nIs it one here and three here?\n\n1752\n01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,670\nIs it two here and two here?\n\n1753\n01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:56,360\nIs it three here and one there?\n\n1754\n01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,220\nWe don't know.\n>> Too ambiguous, yeah.\n\n1755\n01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,660\n>> That's why you can only\ndo it once per number.\n\n1756\n01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:03,000\nAnd so I'll have to put in a zero there,\njust so\n\n1757\n01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,190\nit knows that there's only one\nset of zeros in that spot.\n\n1758\n01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:06,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n1759\n01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:09,020\nSo that double colon\nnotation only appears once.\n\n1760\n01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:10,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> Make sure you remember that.\n\n1761\n01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,400\n>> So these are nice little shortcuts that\nmake the numbers a little more manageable.\n\n1762\n01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,400\nNow I'm not gonna lie to you.\n\n1763\n01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,035\nThey're still long and ungainly and\ndifficult to work with.\n\n1764\n01:33:18,035 --> 01:33:20,405\n>> Right.\n>> So it doesn't roll any easier,\n\n1765\n01:33:20,405 --> 01:33:22,500\nfe80::a0ac:0:86ba, I'm bored already,\n:7b8.\n\n1766\n01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:30,060\nIt's still a long number,\nwe're not gonna memorize it.\n\n1767\n01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:30,710\n>> Right.\n\n1768\n01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:35,870\n>> So under IPv6 other services, like DNS,\nbecome really super mega important.\n\n1769\n01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:36,580\nRight?\n\n1770\n01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:40,290\nBut just looking at the numbers here,\nthis is kinda how they work out.\n\n1771\n01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n1772\n01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:44,300\n>> All right.\nNow, with the IPv6 address,\n\n1773\n01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:48,440\nas soon as we wrap our minds around the\nfact that is still just a binary number,\n\n1774\n01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,450\nit's just written hexidecimal.\n\n1775\n01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:53,870\nEverything else is basically\njust like IPv4, right?\n\n1776\n01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:56,580\nYou have a subnet mask, but\nthe subnet mask may be very big.\n\n1777\n01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:59,280\n/64 is very common.\n\n1778\n01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,160\nThat means the first 64\nbits of the network id and\n\n1779\n01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,480\nthe remaining 64 bits of the host id.\n\n1780\n01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,170\nRight?\n>> Now one of\n\n1781\n01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,510\nthe things that I do\nappreciate about this Don,\n\n1782\n01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:11,140\nis I don't even have to have\na subnet mask, in the hexadecimal.\n\n1783\n01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,820\nWhat we see right here is\nthe standard way it is reported.\n\n1784\n01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:17,280\nAnd a lot of times you hear this as\nbeing called prefix notation here.\n\n1785\n01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:23,474\n>> Yeah, if we were to write that out in\nthe old notation, it would be ffff ffff.\n\n1786\n01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:26,492\nThere we go.\n\n1787\n01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:27,600\n>> Yup, there it is.\n\n1788\n01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:31,750\n>> There we go, that would be\na /64 subnet mask written out.\n\n1789\n01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,870\nObviously it's really long and\nkind of a pain to work with.\n\n1790\n01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:39,260\nAnd so they pretty much always use\nthe short hand notation there slash 64,\n\n1791\n01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:40,650\njust that prefix.\n\n1792\n01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:45,050\nSo once we've got that it really\nis just like an IPV4 address.\n\n1793\n01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:49,130\nAnd just like in the world of\nIPv4 we have reserve spaces now.\n\n1794\n01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,160\nIPv6 completely classless.\n\n1795\n01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,960\nSo there are no classes.\n\n1796\n01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,620\nThey kind of learned their lesson on that\none they didn't even bother on IPv6.\n\n1797\n01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:02,280\nSo all we really have to\nconcern ourselves with in IPv6\n\n1798\n01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,870\nare some of the special address\nranges that are out there.\n\n1799\n01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:07,150\nThere's some address\nranges that are reserved.\n\n1800\n01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:10,070\nAnd for this one,\nI actually did bring up the standards,\n\n1801\n01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,060\neven though I usually don't\nlike to bring up standards.\n\n1802\n01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:13,920\nI did bring up some.\n\n1803\n01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,380\nSo here is the IANA's website.\n\n1804\n01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:21,780\nAnd what they've got on\nhere is a table that lists\n\n1805\n01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:27,120\nthe IPv6 Address Space, and\nwhat is covered and isn't.\n\n1806\n01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,820\nSo basically, it's kinda laid out in here,\nand we can come through and look and\n\n1807\n01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,470\nsee what's available.\n\n1808\n01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:36,760\nAnd notice that they reserve\naddresses based on just\n\n1809\n01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,580\nthe very first set of numbers,\nmuch like the old classes in IPv4.\n\n1810\n01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:45,620\nThe ones to remember for the exam, cuz you\ndon't have to remember all of these,right?\n\n1811\n01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:47,370\nThe ones that we really\ndo need to remember for\n\n1812\n01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:50,150\nthe exam are ones like\nthis guy right here.\n\n1813\n01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:50,806\nThis is probably the most important one.\nRight?\n\n1814\n01:35:50,806 --> 01:35:51,445\n>> Right.\n\n1815\n01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:55,621\n>> 200::/ 3.\n\n1816\n01:35:55,621 --> 01:36:02,182\nThat means 2,000 followed by 7 sets of\nzeros with a / 3, just the first 3 bits.\n\n1817\n01:36:02,182 --> 01:36:04,760\nRight?\nAnd what they're saying is that pretty\n\n1818\n01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,446\nmuch any number that starts with 2 is 0.\n\n1819\n01:36:07,446 --> 01:36:10,099\nIs a global unicast.\n\n1820\n01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:14,570\nThat means a Public registered IP that\nyou have to register with the INA,\n\n1821\n01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,600\nthese are the internet routable addresses.\n\n1822\n01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,300\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, some of\n\n1823\n01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,020\nthe other ones that we need to know let\nme just scroll down a little bit here,\n\n1824\n01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:26,750\noh they actually don't show\nthe really important one.\n\n1825\n01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:30,260\nLet me go down even further.\n\n1826\n01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:34,326\nSo down here I've got FF00::/8.\n\n1827\n01:36:34,326 --> 01:36:39,052\nSo FF0, FF00: and\nthen seven sets of zeros.\n\n1828\n01:36:39,052 --> 01:36:43,265\nAnything that starts with ff0,\nthat's going to be a multicast\n\n1829\n01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:44,175\n>> Multicast.\n\n1830\n01:36:44,175 --> 01:36:44,713\n>> Address.\n\n1831\n01:36:44,713 --> 01:36:45,720\nRight?\n\n1832\n01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,585\nIn IPv6 we no longer have broadcasts.\n\n1833\n01:36:48,585 --> 01:36:50,195\nBroadcasts are completely gone, right?\n\n1834\n01:36:50,195 --> 01:36:52,005\nWhich they're inefficient anyway.\n\n1835\n01:36:52,005 --> 01:36:53,140\nSo we don't want that.\n\n1836\n01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,150\nSo instead multi-casts become\nthat backbone for IPv6.\n\n1837\n01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:00,920\nThat's what replaces the old broadcast.\n\n1838\n01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,160\nMuch more efficient.\n\n1839\n01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,570\nMuch more important.\n\n1840\n01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:07,260\nSo, where as you could almost\nignore multicast under IPv4.\n\n1841\n01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,790\nIt's used every single moment in IPv6.\n\n1842\n01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:18,460\nAll right, the other one I wanna point\nout while I'm in here is fe8, right?\n\n1843\n01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,629\nHere fe80::/10.\n\n1844\n01:37:19,629 --> 01:37:21,240\nRight?\n\n1845\n01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:26,050\nAny time you see fe8, like in my\nexample where I showed my address here,\n\n1846\n01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:28,980\nfe8 means link local.\n\n1847\n01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:32,840\nThis is a non routable IP that is\nnot valid out in the Internet.\n\n1848\n01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,950\nIt's used solely on your local network.\n\n1849\n01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,470\nWhen your PC talks to another device\nright there on the same network,\n\n1850\n01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:41,265\nthese are the addresses that they use.\n\n1851\n01:37:41,265 --> 01:37:45,020\nfe8, they're only unique\nwithin your network.\n\n1852\n01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,950\nThere could be other people in\nthe world using the same ones.\n\n1853\n01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:48,400\nThese are kind of like private IP's,\n\n1854\n01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,420\nright, except they're only on your\nlink and they're non-routable, so\n\n1855\n01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:54,800\nyou can't even use them like the normal\nprivate IP's because you can't route them.\n\n1856\n01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,670\nWe have other ranges that\nare set aside for that.\n\n1857\n01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:01,330\nAnd that's the other range that I\nmentioned was not on this page.\n\n1858\n01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:03,970\nIt was on a different standard, here.\n\n1859\n01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:09,390\nIn IPv6, we have a set of private\nIP's that are reserved for us.\n\n1860\n01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:14,302\nYou can spot them pretty easy\nbecause they start with fc0.\n\n1861\n01:38:14,302 --> 01:38:16,730\nSo fc00::/7.\n\n1862\n01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:21,160\nThose are our private routable\nIP's that we can use for\n\n1863\n01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,970\nour own private networks if we want.\n\n1864\n01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:27,840\nReality is the IPv6 router space is so\nbig that we usually just use public IP's\n\n1865\n01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,830\neverywhere, and\nwe don't worry about private.\n\n1866\n01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:33,530\nBut if you want to set up a private IPv6\nnetwork that is only locally unique,\n\n1867\n01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:35,530\nthen you can use the fc00 prefix.\n\n1868\n01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,670\nSo let's summarize that, Ronnie,\ncuz I threw a lot of them out there, so.\n\n1869\n01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:43,080\n>> We want to start out with that\nglobal unica, or no, you're, okay.\n\n1870\n01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,840\n>> Oh, no.\nI'm all over the place here, so.\n\n1871\n01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,184\n>> Yup.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1872\n01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,959\n>> All right, so global unicast.\n\n1873\n01:38:50,959 --> 01:38:52,041\n>> Global unicast for\n\n1874\n01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:55,630\nus are the IP addresses that\nwe'll see on the Internet itself.\n\n1875\n01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:59,328\nThis is our local,\nwhich we're gonna use for\n\n1876\n01:38:59,328 --> 01:39:02,113\nprivate IP addressing\nwithin our own network.\n\n1877\n01:39:07,944 --> 01:39:11,215\nAnd then we have the ff,\nwhich is gonna be for multicast.\n\n1878\n01:39:11,215 --> 01:39:18,490\n>> And so multicast is being used for\nDiscovery, for DHCP, for ARP.\n\n1879\n01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:19,560\nARP is technically gone.\n\n1880\n01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,389\nIt's replaced by Link Layer Discover\nProtocol, LLDP and all that good stuff.\n\n1881\n01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:30,200\nSo anyhow, so you have that kind of stuff\ngoing on there on the multicast side.\n\n1882\n01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,130\nWe have our Global Unicast,\nour Local Unicast.\n\n1883\n01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:36,820\nWe also have some other special ones\nlike the loopback address, right?\n\n1884\n01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:39,750\nIn IPv4,\nthe loopback address is 127.0.0.1.\n\n1885\n01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,575\nThat's a weird IP, right?\n\n1886\n01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:42,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n1887\n01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,660\n>> In IPv6, they said forget that, let's\njust go with the very first first IP.\n\n1888\n01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:51,955\nThe loopback address in IPv6,\nif I write the whole thing out,\n\n1889\n01:39:51,955 --> 01:39:58,545\nit's a bunch of zeros followed by one.\n\n1890\n01:39:58,545 --> 01:40:02,220\nRight?\nIt's the very first IP and since we've got\n\n1891\n01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:07,450\nall these zeros here and we've got three\nleading zeros here, the cool part about\n\n1892\n01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:12,548\nthe loopback, is we can abbreviate\nit all the way down to just ::1.\n\n1893\n01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:17,137\nRight?\nIf I wanna ping my loopback in IPv6,\n\n1894\n01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:21,577\nI just say ping ::1, and-\n>> There you go.\n\n1895\n01:40:21,577 --> 01:40:22,349\n>> That's pinging loopback.\n\n1896\n01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:23,067\nI'm pinging myself.\n\n1897\n01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:28,080\nAll right.\n\n1898\n01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:31,020\nRonnie, can you think of?\n\n1899\n01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,360\n>> We left off fe80.\n\n1900\n01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,060\n>> Good point.\n\n1901\n01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,170\nWe need that one on here.\n\n1902\n01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:36,660\nWhoops.\n\n1903\n01:40:41,509 --> 01:40:43,410\nAnd it is a /10?\n\n1904\n01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:43,910\n>> /10.\n\n1905\n01:40:46,764 --> 01:40:47,300\nIt's our Link Local.\n\n1906\n01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:51,500\n>> Let me get my alignment back.\n\n1907\n01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,050\nThere we go.\n\n1908\n01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:52,900\nAll right.\n\n1909\n01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:56,440\nSo for the exam,\nthese are the ones you want to memorize.\n\n1910\n01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,100\nWhen you're on the exam and\nyou see a two zero zero type address,\n\n1911\n01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:04,280\nthat's a global unicast, that's a public\nIP that was registered with IANA.\n\n1912\n01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,290\nIt might be 2001, 2003,\n\n1913\n01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:10,520\n2002, those are the ones that you see\nout there on the Internet right now.\n\n1914\n01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:13,290\nBut they're adding more\nas they issue them.\n\n1915\n01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:18,000\nIf you see fc0 something, then that\ntells you it's a private address.\n\n1916\n01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,690\nIt's internal use only.\n\n1917\n01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:21,890\nFE80, it's link local.\n\n1918\n01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:23,450\nIt's not even routable.\n\n1919\n01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:24,450\nFF00 is that multicast.\n\n1920\n01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:26,150\nAnd ::1, that's the loopback, right.\n\n1921\n01:41:26,150 --> 01:41:28,450\n>> All right.\n\n1922\n01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:29,840\nSo now that we have these addresses,\n\n1923\n01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,520\nDon, and we can identify them,\nhow is this gonna effect me?\n\n1924\n01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:39,481\nDo I have to now take a single\ncomputer and type out an IP version 6\n\n1925\n01:41:39,481 --> 01:41:42,670\naddress to actually to get an IP\naddress on my own computer?\n\n1926\n01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,590\n>> Well, yes and no.\n\n1927\n01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:47,010\nRight?\nSo if you want to be routed, yes.\n\n1928\n01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:49,340\nYou've gotta punch in an address, right?\n\n1929\n01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:50,580\nIf you don't want to be routed though,\n\n1930\n01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:53,350\nif you're just trying to talk locally,\nif my laptop wants to talk to yours.\n\n1931\n01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:55,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> We're on the same network.\n\n1932\n01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:56,970\nWe can use our Link Local address.\n\n1933\n01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:00,990\nYour system will automatically generate\na Link Local address and did I?\n\n1934\n01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,801\nYou know, I powered this router off.\n\n1935\n01:42:02,801 --> 01:42:04,057\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me power this router back on.\n\n1936\n01:42:04,057 --> 01:42:05,960\nI'll show you guys on the actual router.\n\n1937\n01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,380\nGive that a second to fire up.\n\n1938\n01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:14,419\nBut I'll show you on the router\nthat if you have IPv6 enabled it\n\n1939\n01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:20,830\nwill automatically generate a IPv6\naddress that is a link local, an FE80.\n\n1940\n01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:22,470\nIt does that for you.\n\n1941\n01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,070\nRight.\n\n1942\n01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:24,405\nBut it's non-routable.\n\n1943\n01:42:24,405 --> 01:42:25,450\n>> Right.\n>> If you wanna be routed,\n\n1944\n01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:27,320\nyou've got two choices.\n\n1945\n01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:31,560\nChoice number one, you statically\nassign an IP address, an IPv6 address,\n\n1946\n01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:36,370\nand you statically assign\na default gateway, just like IPv4.\n\n1947\n01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:44,400\nThe other option, though, is to Discover\nor learn a network and an address to use.\n\n1948\n01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,650\nAnd for those of you that go\non to do the CCNT you'll get\n\n1949\n01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:49,710\nto see how to set all that stuff up.\n\n1950\n01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:53,840\nWe might even do it in the CCNA class,\njust for fun during that show.\n\n1951\n01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,420\nBut basically the way it works is you have\na router that is advertising the PC's and\n\n1952\n01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,110\nsays hey here's our network ID.\n\n1953\n01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,020\nYou pick your host ID,\nI don't care about that.\n\n1954\n01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:05,270\nHere's the network ID and I'm a router.\n\n1955\n01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,420\nIf you wanna route through me,\nyou can get to the Internet.\n\n1956\n01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:12,130\nAnd so, just like DHCP,\nour routers can, or our PCs and so on,\n\n1957\n01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:15,580\ncan get their address, and\njump on the network and be routed.\n\n1958\n01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:18,290\nAnd for that,\nwe would hand out usually public IPs.\n\n1959\n01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:20,044\nUsually, the global unique, unicast.\n\n1960\n01:43:20,044 --> 01:43:22,610\n>> Yeah.\nThere's a lot of different ways that\n\n1961\n01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:23,170\nthis can be done.\n\n1962\n01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:26,410\nSo we can statically assign an IP address\njust like we're doing in an IP version 4\n\n1963\n01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:31,782\nthough, we may also be able to generate\na portion of our address as well.\n\n1964\n01:43:31,782 --> 01:43:33,980\nAnd so do you wanna talk about the EUI?\n\n1965\n01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,710\nNow?\nAre we going to do it?\n\n1966\n01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,260\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nSo you know, DHCP in IPv4,\n\n1967\n01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:41,030\nyou need a DHCP server to dynamically\nget your address on the network and\n\n1968\n01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:43,560\nmake sure you don't have duplicates.\n\n1969\n01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,300\nIn IPv6, they actually worked\nout a neat little idea that said\n\n1970\n01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,880\nwe can do away with DHCP.\n\n1971\n01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,990\nSince we discover our router anyway,\nand we can discover name servers,\n\n1972\n01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:56,890\nthat we can make it where PCs\ngenerate their own address also.\n\n1973\n01:43:56,890 --> 01:43:59,756\nA /64 network is really common with IPv6.\n\n1974\n01:43:59,756 --> 01:44:01,914\nLet me get back to my notes here,\nwhile that router is booting up.\n\n1975\n01:44:01,914 --> 01:44:06,802\nSo, if we take a /64, right?\n\n1976\n01:44:06,802 --> 01:44:12,790\nThat's gonna be 64 bits for the network ID\nand then 64 bits for the host ID, right?\n\n1977\n01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:18,370\nSo 128 bit address, 64 bits for\n\n1978\n01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:23,020\nnetwork ID, and 64 bits for host ID.\n\n1979\n01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:25,710\nNow it doesn't have to be this way right?\n\n1980\n01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:30,790\nThis is just how most people set it up\nbecause you have so many addresses so\n\n1981\n01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:34,390\nif we set it up this way,\nthe first 64 bits, that's our network.\n\n1982\n01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:36,070\nAnd our router can advertise that out.\n\n1983\n01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:38,310\nHey, here's the first 64 bits for you.\n\n1984\n01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:40,970\nYou're left to come up with\nthe remaining 64 bits.\n\n1985\n01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:44,210\nWell, what they said is,\nhey, we need a 64 bit,\n\n1986\n01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:47,310\nhexadecimal number that's unique\nto each machine on our network.\n\n1987\n01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:48,980\nAnd they said boy,\n\n1988\n01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:54,410\nwouldn't it be nice if there was already\na hexadecimal number that we could use.\n\n1989\n01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:56,580\nWell, there is, right?\n\n1990\n01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:00,690\nEvery network adaptor has a MAC address,\na media access control address.\n\n1991\n01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:03,510\nAnd it's a 48 bit hexadecimal number.\n\n1992\n01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:04,010\nRight.\n\n1993\n01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:05,944\nSo if I look on my laptop here.\n\n1994\n01:45:05,944 --> 01:45:09,574\nAnd I take a look, whoops, and\n\n1995\n01:45:09,574 --> 01:45:14,610\nI take a look at my\nadapter Bluetooth here.\n\n1996\n01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:17,220\nThis is my physical network adapter.\n\n1997\n01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:18,865\nSo here is my MAC address.\n\n1998\n01:45:18,865 --> 01:45:19,680\nRight?\n\n1999\n01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:25,370\nNow my MAC address is only 64 bits,\nI mean 48 bits.\n\n2000\n01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,180\nI need it to be 64 bits.\n\n2001\n01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:26,797\n>> Right.\n\n2002\n01:45:26,797 --> 01:45:30,510\n>> So that's where EUI 64 comes in.\n\n2003\n01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:38,140\nIf you've never head of it, EUI 64,\nit's a standard for address definition.\n\n2004\n01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:43,310\nAnd it basically says what you do is\nyou take somebody's MAC address and\n\n2005\n01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:43,820\nyou modify it.\n\n2006\n01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:49,610\nAnd basically you divide it up like this,\nokay?\n\n2007\n01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:53,870\nAnd actually, let me put it back here so\nwe still have the original, and\n\n2008\n01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:58,170\nyou pad it to add some bits\nto it to make it 64 bit.\n\n2009\n01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:03,330\nAnd the way they do it is they take the 48\nbit address, they divide it in half,\n\n2010\n01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:07,655\nand they add in FFFE, to the middle.\n\n2011\n01:46:07,655 --> 01:46:09,391\nFFFE.\n\n2012\n01:46:09,391 --> 01:46:11,500\nRight?\n\n2013\n01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:17,584\nWriting it out this way,\nthat would be more like there,\n\n2014\n01:46:17,584 --> 01:46:21,630\nso just in the middle I stick in FFFE.\n\n2015\n01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:25,300\nThat pads it and gets us to 64 bits.\n\n2016\n01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:28,360\nSo if I have a router advertising out.\n\n2017\n01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:36,690\nIf a router is advertised as,\nlet's say it's 2001.\n\n2018\n01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:40,950\nSo this is a registered network\nthat I've registered with the IANA.\n\n2019\n01:46:46,302 --> 01:46:47,750\nThere.\n\n2020\n01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,430\nSo this is similar to what\na router would advertise.\n\n2021\n01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:50,690\nIt would advertise to the network.\n\n2022\n01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:55,212\nIt would do a multicast on the network,\nand say here's the first 64 bits,\n\n2023\n01:46:55,212 --> 01:47:04,070\n2001 :1b3d:0:48:: that means\nthe remainders are all zeroes, /64.\n\n2024\n01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:09,165\nMy PC can then take it's MAC address,\npad it with that\n\n2025\n01:47:09,165 --> 01:47:14,130\nFFFE, and\nthen add on these 64 bits right here,\n\n2026\n01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:22,915\nwhich would result in a 128\nbit address that's unique.\n\n2027\n01:47:22,915 --> 01:47:25,080\nRight?\nThe network address we\n\n2028\n01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,020\ngot from the router, the remaining 64\nbits were calculated on my MAC address.\n\n2029\n01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:32,040\nThere should be no two computers in my\nbuilding with the same MAC address.\n\n2030\n01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,190\nThere might be computers somewhere\n\n2031\n01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:34,224\nelse in the world\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2032\n01:47:34,224 --> 01:47:35,755\n>> But there shouldn't be, right?\n\n2033\n01:47:35,755 --> 01:47:40,185\nSo this guarantees that I get\na unique 128 bit address,\n\n2034\n01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:42,315\nit's public in this case and\nI'm ready to rock.\n\n2035\n01:47:42,315 --> 01:47:46,585\nAnd there's no DHCP server so\nI'll always have this same address and\n\n2036\n01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:48,046\nI don't have to statically set it.\n\n2037\n01:47:48,046 --> 01:47:50,107\nRight?\nSuper convenient,\n\n2038\n01:47:50,107 --> 01:47:52,357\nmakes it where we don't have to work\nwith these addresses very much.\n\n2039\n01:47:54,117 --> 01:47:56,087\n>> Sounds like our router's\nactually ready to go, Don.\n\n2040\n01:47:56,087 --> 01:47:57,757\n>> It certainly is.\n\n2041\n01:47:57,757 --> 01:47:58,947\nThere we go.\n\n2042\n01:47:58,947 --> 01:48:02,013\nAll right, so\nlet me show you guys how this works.\n\n2043\n01:48:02,013 --> 01:48:05,153\nThis is a router that has\na stock configuration on it.\n\n2044\n01:48:05,153 --> 01:48:07,023\nRight?\nI haven't done anything crazy to it.\n\n2045\n01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:12,248\nAnd I definitely haven't\nassigned any IPv6 addresses.\n\n2046\n01:48:12,248 --> 01:48:14,093\nRight?\nSo if I look at the two interfaces here.\n\n2047\n01:48:14,093 --> 01:48:15,903\nSee where it says no IP address?\n\n2048\n01:48:15,903 --> 01:48:18,243\nThere's no addresses assigned.\n\n2049\n01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:18,991\nRight?\n\n2050\n01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:24,930\nBut if I do a show IPv6 interface brief.\n\n2051\n01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:29,990\nShow IPv, now I love show IP\ninterface brief, but that's for IPv4.\n\n2052\n01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:31,875\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So show IPv6 interface brief,\n\n2053\n01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,920\nthat'll show me the addresses for IPv6.\n\n2054\n01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,690\n>> Right.\n\n2055\n01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:39,530\n>> It's cool with Cisco anytime\nyou go from IPv4 to IPv6,\n\n2056\n01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:43,800\nyou just take the letters IP and you add\nV6 to it and now it's the V6 command.\n\n2057\n01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,210\nSo when I do that.\n\n2058\n01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:47,643\nNone of my interfaces are on,\nthat's gonna slow things down isn't it.\n\n2059\n01:48:51,257 --> 01:48:52,999\nLet me turn these on real quick.\n\n2060\n01:48:57,223 --> 01:49:00,015\nI didn't turn that switch on either.\n\n2061\n01:49:00,015 --> 01:49:02,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's just see,\n\n2062\n01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:04,260\nit may power up in time.\n\n2063\n01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,000\nSo if I run a show IPv6 interface brief,\nas soon as those interfaces come up,\n\n2064\n01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,170\nthey'll actually have addresses\nattached to them, okay.\n\n2065\n01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:13,070\nSo they'll have that.\n\n2066\n01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:18,101\nActually let me make sure that\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2067\n01:49:25,525 --> 01:49:26,750\n>> Yup, it's all there.\n\n2068\n01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,280\nOkay.\n\n2069\n01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,557\nSo as soon as those interfaces come up,\n\n2070\n01:49:29,557 --> 01:49:34,720\nwe'll see,\nWe'll see addresses show up there.\n\n2071\n01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:39,420\nBut basically, they'll have FEA addresses,\nthe link local addresses.\n\n2072\n01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,690\nThey'll get those automatically, and\n\n2073\n01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:43,840\nthat allows them to talk non-routed,\njust locally, right.\n\n2074\n01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,210\nThen, we need to add the addresses.\n\n2075\n01:49:46,210 --> 01:49:49,350\nSo if I want to configure that,\nI can do it in one of two ways.\n\n2076\n01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:52,440\nI can do it manually or\nI can do it with EUI 64, right.\n\n2077\n01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:58,110\nSo I might go into interface gi0/0 and\nsay IPv6\n\n2078\n01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,200\naddress and then specify what my\nfull address is going to be, right?\n\n2079\n01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:11,110\nSo maybe it's like this and I don't wanna\noverlap with my laptop or anything.\n\n2080\n01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:15,217\nSo I'll just say,\npunch it in like this /64.\n\n2081\n01:50:15,217 --> 01:50:19,340\nSo there is my address, and\nnow it's attached to that interface.\n\n2082\n01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:21,330\nI've now got an IPv6 address, right.\n\n2083\n01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:27,610\nI could also say, let me get into 0/1.\n\n2084\n01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:34,180\nAnd I'll just go up to\nthe next network in line.\n\n2085\n01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:37,380\nSo I did 48 for the first one,\nI'll do 49 for this one.\n\n2086\n01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,920\nRight, and see how I did ::/64?\n\n2087\n01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:43,640\nSaying zero out the rest of the address.\n\n2088\n01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:49,570\nSo 2001, 1B3D, 0 and\nthen 49 everything else is a 0.\n\n2089\n01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:53,060\nAnd I just add to the end of that, EUI-64.\n\n2090\n01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:57,082\nAnd that says figure out the last 64,\nuse your MAC address.\n\n2091\n01:50:57,082 --> 01:51:00,060\nAdd FFFE to it, and then off you go.\n\n2092\n01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,610\nAll right.\n\n2093\n01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:03,470\nSo I'm gonna punch that in there.\n\n2094\n01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:04,590\nIt's gonna change.\n\n2095\n01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:06,530\nMy switch is apparently booting up now so\n\n2096\n01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:09,970\nwe should see some better\nstuff with our interfaces.\n\n2097\n01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:10,720\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n2098\n01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,740\nI did do a no shut down on that one,\ndidn't I?\n\n2099\n01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,370\nYes.\n\n2100\n01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:13,870\nOkay.\n\n2101\n01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:21,010\nNow, if I do a show IP interface brief,\nI didn't assign any IPv4 addresses.\n\n2102\n01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:21,810\nI could've, right?\n\n2103\n01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:26,210\nIt's called dual stack when you run both,\nIPv4 and IPv6, but\n\n2104\n01:51:26,210 --> 01:51:32,230\nif I just add my IPv6 to that command,\nthere we go.\n\n2105\n01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:36,010\nI only assigned one address, but\nnotice how I have two right?\n\n2106\n01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:42,730\nI have FE80, those are those link locals\nand I've got the ones that I assigned.\n\n2107\n01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:46,020\nHere's the one that it assigned.\n\n2108\n01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:51,315\nAnd oh, you know what, shoot,\nI manually put FFFE in there, dadgummit.\n\n2109\n01:51:51,315 --> 01:51:57,112\nLet me change that cuz\nthat's gonna be confusing.\n\n2110\n01:51:57,112 --> 01:52:02,117\nWhen I assigned that IP,\nI manually put FFFE in there.\n\n2111\n01:52:02,117 --> 01:52:04,107\nSo let me fix that.\n\n2112\n01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,986\nI'll just stick zeros in there instead.\n\n2113\n01:52:14,028 --> 01:52:14,653\nOkay.\n\n2114\n01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:21,532\nThere we go.\n\n2115\n01:52:21,532 --> 01:52:24,700\nAll right, so now I can see,\nhere's the one that I statically assigned.\n\n2116\n01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,720\nRight?\nThere's the one that I manually put in\n\n2117\n01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:30,380\nthere, and\nit's abbreviated it as best as it could.\n\n2118\n01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:35,000\nIt's also got that FE80 right there,\nso that's that link local address, and\n\n2119\n01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,892\nthen beneath it,\nhere's the one where I used EUI 64,\n\n2120\n01:52:38,892 --> 01:52:44,130\nso 2001:ib3D/0/49, that's the network ID.\n\n2121\n01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:49,269\nEverything else it figured out\nbased on its MAC address, and\n\n2122\n01:52:49,269 --> 01:52:56,848\nso I can see where it's got that where\nyour 0217E0, FFFE, 696669, right?\n\n2123\n01:52:56,848 --> 01:53:01,661\nSo if I delete that FFFE,\nthe rest of that, 0217E0,\n\n2124\n01:53:01,661 --> 01:53:07,370\n696669 that's the MAC address for\nthat network adapter.\n\n2125\n01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,700\nSo, pretty cool,\neasy way to get that address on there.\n\n2126\n01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:13,330\nThe link locals\nare automatically generated.\n\n2127\n01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:18,160\nThe actual address is like these unicast\naddresses that we have attached here,\n\n2128\n01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,160\nwe have to manually input in.\n\n2129\n01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:21,450\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2130\n01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:22,240\n>> All right.\n\n2131\n01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:27,170\nNow, there is a lot more to IPv6, all the\ncrazy security features, and things like\n\n2132\n01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:31,990\nthat, but for the CCENT exam, they really\ndon't drill you on that very much.\n\n2133\n01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:34,830\nWe are going to see a little bit more of\nit later on as we get into our routing\n\n2134\n01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:35,720\nprotocols.\n\n2135\n01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,700\nBut the main thing that you wanna focus\non for the exam is basically the general\n\n2136\n01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:45,340\nconcepts, the idea of what those IPv6\naddresses look like, memorize that list.\n\n2137\n01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:46,840\nLet me, Jason can we bring that list?\n\n2138\n01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:48,070\nThere we go perfect.\n\n2139\n01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:51,840\nMemorize this list right here, the special\naddress ranges, because those will pop up,\n\n2140\n01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,060\nyou'll get questions on that.\n\n2141\n01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:57,500\nSo, these are things that you'll see,\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n2142\n01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,410\nLike I said there is a ton about IPv6.\n\n2143\n01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,880\nWe'll delve more into it in the CCNA show.\n\n2144\n01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:08,840\nAll right, Ronnie I think I blathered\na little too long and ran past our time.\n\n2145\n01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,090\nCan you think of anything I left out?\n\n2146\n01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:11,150\n>> I don't think so.\n\n2147\n01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:13,860\nI think we are done for this episode.\n\n2148\n01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:14,570\n>> Okay.\n\n2149\n01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:17,070\nWell let's wrap it up here.\n\n2150\n01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:20,920\nI know looking at IP address is\nnot the most exciting thing.\n\n2151\n01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,140\n>> Yep.\n>> In the next episode,\n\n2152\n01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,070\nwe're gonna start routing.\n\n2153\n01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,460\n>> That's right.\n>> We're gonna start learning about our\n\n2154\n01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:27,480\nrouting protocols and actually\nmoving traffic across the network.\n\n2155\n01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,945\nWe're also gonna get back\ninto the IPv4 world, so\n\n2156\n01:54:29,945 --> 01:54:34,940\nif that sounds exciting to you and I hope\nit does, definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n2157\n01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:38,000\nRemember, we are doing a double header\ntoday, so the next episode starts in,\n\n2158\n01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,050\nwell, a little over an hour.\n\n2159\n01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:40,040\n>> All right.\n>> So\n\n2160\n01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,740\nwe'll be seeing that one after\nwe get food in our bellies.\n\n2161\n01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,990\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n2162\n01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:47,860\nAs always, if you have any questions,\nyou're not on your own.\n\n2163\n01:54:47,860

right.\nGood morning.\n\n5\n00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:35,544\nGood afternoon.\n\n6\n00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:36,205\nAnd good evening.\n\n7\n00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,031\nWelcome back.\n\n8\n00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:38,711\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,660\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,200\nComing at you live with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,090\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,340\n>> It's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,880\nWe are ready for\na exciting episode in CCNT today.\n\n14\n00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,920\n>> As exciting as they get.\n\n15\n00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,460\nToday we are finally going to\ndive into what the bulk of\n\n16\n00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,010\nthe CCNT exam is based on.\n\n17\n00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,530\nWhich is routing, right?\n\n18\n00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,140\nIn our other episodes so far,\n\n19\n00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,890\nwe've tackled things like basic switch\nconfiguration, basic router configuration.\n\n20\n00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,230\nWe talk about IP subnetting,\nwhich is bubbling over with excitement.\n\n21\n00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,090\n>> That's right.\n\n22\n00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,535\n>> Yeah, its kind of lame.\n\n23\n00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,490\n[LAUGH] Today,\nwe're going to jump into routing.\n\n24\n00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,860\nWe can't just jump straight into our\nrouters and start routing stuff around,\n\n25\n00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,940\nwe need to have an idea of how routers\nwork, how they do what they do, and\n\n26\n00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,800\nwhat all goes on behind the scenes\nas routers make up their decisions.\n\n27\n00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,170\n>> Yeah, whereas packets are actually\ngonna be moving across our network,\n\n28\n00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,540\none of the key ideas of course,\nis so that.\n\n29\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,640\nWhen we actually understand the concepts,\nit helps us to be able to troubleshoot\n\n30\n00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,740\nwhen the packets don't arrive\nwhere they actually need to go.\n\n31\n00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,600\nSo for us we're actually going\nby those basic concepts today.\n\n32\n00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,880\nWanna make sure that you have a good\nunderstanding of how a router\n\n33\n00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,670\nprocesses a packet here, and what we\ncall the idea of forwarding as well.\n\n34\n00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,310\n>> So the first thing I wanna tackle is\n\n35\n00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,840\nwhat happens to our data as\nit passes across the network?\n\n36\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,440\n>> All right.\n\n37\n00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000\n>> That's a basic concept.\n\n38\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,330\nIt's how layer three\nrouting actually operates.\n\n39\n00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,330\nAnd I wanna take a look at that first,\nand then once we're done with that,\n\n40\n00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,450\nthen it'll probably be the next segment,\nat that point.\n\n41\n00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,280\nWe'll take a look at how routing tables\nwork, and then we'll be ready to jump\n\n42\n00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,110\nright into the routers, and actually\nget a chance to see routing in action.\n\n43\n00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,530\nSo let's start off with a diagram that\nI worked up right before the show.\n\n44\n00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,856\nAnd see my producer's frustration.\n\n45\n00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:26,710\nAnd [LAUGH] kinda give you\nguys demonstration now,\n\n46\n00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,746\nwhen you look at this,\nit does look kinda complex and\n\n47\n00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:35,794\nprobably because it is, but\nreally its pretty simple drawing and\n\n48\n00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:40,379\nwhat I'm doing is I'm throwing where,\nI got a PC or PC1 and\n\n49\n00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,096\nPC1 has an IP address of 172.19.1.28,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:50,800\nAnd it wants to browse across\nthe network to another machine.\n\n51\n00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,370\nNow, when I say browse\nmaybe it's a web browsers,\n\n52\n00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,320\nmaybe it's FTP, email, who knows?\n\n53\n00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,110\nWhatever client it is I'm not\nreally concerned about that.\n\n54\n00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,530\nPC1 just wants to contact\nPC2 all the way over here.\n\n55\n00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,433\nNow, PC2 has an IP address of\n209.251.133.16, all right?\n\n56\n00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,964\nSo PC1 is on one network.\n\n57\n00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,400\nPC2 is on another network.\n\n58\n00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,140\nNow I didn't put any subnet masks on here,\nbut these networks are so different.\n\n59\n00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,360\nNo matter what the subnet mask was,\n\n60\n00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,170\nthese two guys are gonna\nbe on different networks.\n\n61\n00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,510\nI think even if it was like a slash two,\n\n62\n00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,900\nthey'd still be on different networks,\nwouldn't they?\n\n63\n00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,040\n>> Yeah pretty much.\n\n64\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,980\nNow don't forget that what we have\nhere now is concepts that we've\n\n65\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,200\nalready gone over a little bit.\n\n66\n00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,230\nIf both of the devices were on the same\nnetwork, we wouldn't need routers at all.\n\n67\n00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,530\nBut now because both of the devices\nare on different networks\n\n68\n00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,430\nwe need to pass through routers.\n\n69\n00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,470\nWe're going to actually pass\nthrough routers here, for our data.\n\n70\n00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,720\nThat means we have to understand\nthe basic concept of how a router\n\n71\n00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,920\nprocesses the packet, and\nthen forwards it out the other side.\n\n72\n00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,930\nYeah.\n>> Yup.\n\n73\n00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,920\n>> So think back to our very first CCE and\nT episode,\n\n74\n00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920\nwhere we talked about the OSI model.\n\n75\n00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,440\n>> Right.\n>> When a PC, or any device goes to\n\n76\n00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,530\ncommunicate on a ethernet network, it's\nstarts at layer seven, the Application.\n\n77\n00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,850\nSo let's say this is web browsing.\n\n78\n00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,880\nLet's say that PC2 is a web server and\n\n79\n00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,730\nPC1 is me firing up Google Chrome or\nInternet Explorer or Firefox or whatever.\n\n80\n00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,000\nSo in my web browser I type in a name,\nright?\n\n81\n00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,730\nwww.amazon.com, right?\n\n82\n00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,060\nAnd it's going to do a DNS\nlookup to get an IP address, and\n\n83\n00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,570\nthat's how I know what\nIP I want to contact.\n\n84\n00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,730\nPC1 is going down the OSI model now,\nand it goes down to layer 6,\n\n85\n00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,410\nwhere it figures out that it's going to\nbe doing a HTML, or an HTTP get request.\n\n86\n00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,280\nThen it goes down to layer 5 where\nit says hey, this is web traffic.\n\n87\n00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,620\nSo it's gonna have\na destination port of port 80,\n\n88\n00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,210\na source port of something random\n40,000 to 60,000, somewhere in there.\n\n89\n00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,910\nThen it gets down to layer 4 and\nit says is this packet,\n\n90\n00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,190\nis this data, gonna be over 1500 bytes?\n\n91\n00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,650\nRight?\nAnd if it is,\n\n92\n00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,240\nthen we need to break it up into segments.\n\n93\n00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,554\nOtherwise we can just leave it as one.\n\n94\n00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n95\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,400\n>> Then we get down to layer three.\n\n96\n00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,590\nAt layer three, that's where PC1 sets\nup the source and the destination.\n\n97\n00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,640\nWhere this traffic is coming and\nwhere it's going to, right.\n\n98\n00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,050\nAnd that's what I want to show you guys,\nis as it builds that packet right.\n\n99\n00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,360\nAnd in layer three we're\ndealing with packets.\n\n100\n00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,870\nThe information that it provides us with,\nwell, it's gonna have a source IP.\n\n101\n00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,564\nAnd the source IP is going to be itself.\n\n102\n00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:34,116\nSo PC one's source IP\nwould be 172.19.1.28 okay.\n\n103\n00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,576\nSo it's gonna whoops.\n\n104\n00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:36,854\nDag gonnit.\n\n105\n00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,560\nSo it's gonna fill that in\nas it goes down its line.\n\n106\n00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,880\nI'll get a nice little type text\nhere on my screen there we go.\n\n107\n00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,390\nSo it's gonna fill that\ninformation in at layer three.\n\n108\n00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,050\nThe destination IP is gonna be PC2\nthe person we're trying to get to.\n\n109\n00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,640\nThis is the beginning and\nthe end of the communication.\n\n110\n00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,596\nSo the end of this communication is\ngoing to be that 209.251.133.16.\n\n111\n00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,380\nRight.\nWhere are traffic is coming from and\n\n112\n00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,610\nwhere are traffic is going to.\n\n113\n00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,080\nThink of this in terms when you\naddress a letter to send to somebody.\n\n114\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,000\nYou have the return address.\n\n115\n00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,110\nAnd the to address,\nwho it's from and who it's to.\n\n116\n00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,140\nThat's what we're doing here at layer\nthree, who it's from and who it's to.\n\n117\n00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,330\nNow, remember that this is\nan important concept for us because,\n\n119\n00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,390\na lot of times, we still have more to\ngo before we can send the packet along.\n\n120\n00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,620\nso the IP address really\nshows us the source, or\n\n121\n00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,750\nwhere it's coming from, and\nthe ultimate destination.\n\n122\n00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,200\nBut that doesn't mean that the packet is\nmoving yet, for us it just means that now\n\n123\n00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,790\nwe know where the packet is\ngoing to be delivered to, and so\n\n124\n00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,030\nafter we actually have this information,\nthen our computers have to actually add\n\n125\n00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,950\nin more because we're only at layer three,\nwe still have two layers to go here.\n\n126\n00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,100\n>> Yeah, now at layer two is where\nsomething really interesting happens,\n\n127\n00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,380\nall right, if PC1 and\nPC2 were on the same network,\n\n128\n00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,320\nthen we would send out an ARP broadcast,\nan Address Resolution Protocol broadcast\n\n129\n00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,500\nand we would say what is\nthe Mac address for this IP?\n\n130\n00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,920\nPC2 would respond with\nit's Mac address and\n\n131\n00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,060\nthe Mac address would go right here\ninto what's going to become a frame.\n\n132\n00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,950\nRemember at layer 3 it's a packet,\nbut at layer two it's a frame.\n\n133\n00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,800\nWell in our case,\nPC2 is on a different network.\n\n134\n00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,160\nIf we send a broadcast out\nit's not going to make it.\n\n135\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,290\nBroadcasts do not pass\nthe routers by default.\n\n136\n00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,860\nRight.\n\n137\n00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,380\nSo what we're gonna have to do instead,\n\n138\n00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,240\nis say all right PCI is gonna\nhave to go through a router.\n\n139\n00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,630\nIt's gonna have to go\nthrough its default gateway.\n\n140\n00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,820\nBut my source and\ndestination are already set.\n\n141\n00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,210\nSo how do I get this packet\ngo to a different destination\n\n142\n00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,240\nother than what 's here at layer 3?\n\n143\n00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160\nWell we use layer 2.\n\n144\n00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,120\nSo PC1 is gonna fill in\nit's layer 2 information.\n\n145\n00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,644\nAnd, or\nit will if I can click in the right spot.\n\n146\n00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:01,877\nThere we go, all right.\n\n147\n00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:04,231\nSo it's gonna fill in\na source MAC address,\n\n148\n00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:06,660\nwhich is going to be its own address,\nright?\n\n149\n00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,632\nSo here is the MAC address- For PC1.\n\n150\n00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:12,574\nFor the destination MAC address though,\n\n151\n00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:16,870\nit knows if it's in our broadcast and\nsays hey, who is PC2?\n\n152\n00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,392\nIt's not gonna get a response back, so\n\n153\n00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:24,800\ninstead it sends out an ARP broadcast and\nsays, who is my default gateway?\n\n154\n00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160\nOn your network card you've\nmanually set a default gateway, and\n\n155\n00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,370\nit'll broadcast to find\nthat one's MAC address.\n\n156\n00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,555\nIt probably already has it, right?\n\n157\n00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,950\nCuz we use it all the time.\n\n158\n00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,590\nBut if not,\n\n159\n00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,210\nwe'll broadcast out to get it and we'll\nadd that as our destination MAC address.\n\n160\n00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,200\nNow, that's kind of counter intuitive,\nbecause the destination MAC\n\n161\n00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760\naddress does not match\nthe destination IP address.\n\n162\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,200\nBut that's exactly what we want here.\n\n163\n00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,660\nBecause we need something to\nsteer this packet or this frame,\n\n164\n00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,180\nnow, across the network to the router,\nright.\n\n165\n00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,420\n>> So now, with the layer two address,\nAshley Dunn.\n\n166\n00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,480\nWe now have not only the source and\nthe destination IP address,\n\n167\n00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,600\nwhich tells us where\nit's ultimately going.\n\n168\n00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,100\nWe now have a pathway that we can take.\n\n169\n00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,910\nWe know the next device.\n\n170\n00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,180\nIn which this data packets gonna actually\nleave, out of this computer to go.\n\n171\n00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,440\nSo this is where we can now\ntake the entire frame, and\n\n172\n00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,840\nnow put it onto the wire,\nis what we can do.\n\n173\n00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,780\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the cool part about this is,\n\n174\n00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,260\nwhen the frame hits the switch, right?\n\n175\n00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,130\nSo PC one is connected to a switch.\n\n176\n00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,650\nAnd then router one is connected to\neither that one or a downstream switch.\n\n177\n00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,300\nSwitches look at the source and\n\n178\n00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,480\ndestination MAC address\nto move the frame along.\n\n179\n00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,350\nSwitches are layer two devices.they\ndon't look at layer three and\n\n180\n00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,590\nhigher the switches don't even\nsee this layer three data.\n\n181\n00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,350\nThey just see the source\nof destination MAC.\n\n182\n00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,940\nSo, when the switch gets it,\nit's gonna say oh, this is destined for\n\n183\n00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,070\nthis MAC address.\n\n184\n00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,380\nI know where that is.\n\n185\n00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,390\nAnd it's gonna send that\ntraffic to router one.\n\n186\n00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,330\nNow router one is gonna receive it and\nit's gonna go up the OSI model.\n\n187\n00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,140\nWe went down the OSI model on the way\nout now when we get to router one,\n\n188\n00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,280\nwe're gonna go back up it.\n\n189\n00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,170\nAnd as we go up that OSI model,\nrouter one is gonna look at the source and\n\n190\n00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,700\ndestination MAC address,\nit's layer two, right.\n\n191\n00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,530\nIt'll say, oh good.\n\n192\n00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,190\nAnd this is where the router\nbegins that process, right?\n\n193\n00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,950\nWe called it decapsulation at one point.\n\n194\n00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,080\nSo it processes layer two, right?\n\n195\n00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,430\nWhat it does is it takes a look\nat its own MAC address, and\n\n196\n00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,940\nit compares it to\nthe destination MAC address.\n\n197\n00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,250\nIf they match,\nit processes the layer two header.\n\n198\n00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,250\nOnce the layer two header\nis processed it says,\n\n199\n00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,000\nhey, you've arrived at the right device.\n\n200\n00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,530\nNow let's see if you're actually at\nthe destination device itself, and\n\n201\n00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,330\nit takes a look at layer three.\n\n202\n00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,970\nAnd you notice on router one at\nthe left-hand side, the IP address there\n\n203\n00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,250\ndoes not match the destination IP\naddress in that particular frame.\n\n204\n00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,900\nAnd this is where we'll have a problem.\n\n205\n00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,530\n>> Yeah.\nNow if this were a PC, it would say, oh,\n\n206\n00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,160\nthis is wrong.\n\n207\n00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,900\nThis isn't for me.\n\n208\n00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,730\nAnd it would,\nthrow the packet away, right?\n\n209\n00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,820\nBut a router doesn't do that,\na router looks at it and\n\n210\n00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,300\nsays, oh this came to me, but\nit's not destined for me.\n\n211\n00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,210\nThat means it time for\n\n212\n00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,460\nme to my job, I need to route this\npacket to get it where it needs to go.\n\n213\n00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,550\nAnd so what's it's gonna\ndo is it's gonna look, and\n\n214\n00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,500\nrouter one is gonna\nmaintain a routing table.\n\n215\n00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,530\nWe'll talk about the routing table later.\n\n216\n00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,490\nBut the routing table's how it\nfigures out where to send that data.\n\n217\n00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,198\nSo it's gonna look at the direction\nit needs to send the data in.\n\n218\n00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:28,331\nSo router one might say oh, you know what,\n\n219\n00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:31,255\nI know how to get to\nthe 209.251.133 network.\n\n220\n00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:31,946\nI know how to get there.\n\n221\n00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:37,490\nBut it's not through me I'm gonna send\nyou over to router two all right.\n\n222\n00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,500\nRouter one is gonna take that packet,\nand it's gonna re-write it.\n\n223\n00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,400\nIt's gotta reach in and\nchange some of the data.\n\n224\n00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,770\nIt's not gonna change layer three right,\n\n225\n00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,650\nthe layer three data is gonna stay the\nsame cuz that's, that's our beginning and\n\n226\n00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,940\nour end, we can't change that or\nthe packet will get lost on the way.\n\n227\n00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,870\nSo what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna go in there an it's going to\n\n228\n00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,930\npunch that same data in so\nthat the source and\n\n229\n00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,800\nthe destination IP address stay\nthe same as they did originally.\n\n230\n00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440\nThat is unchanged.\n\n231\n00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,110\nFrom up here.\n\n232\n00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,750\n>> Yeah okay.\n\n233\n00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,360\nNow that the router actually realizes\nit's gonna be routing it out.\n\n234\n00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,580\nIt's gonna now,\nsince we're not changing the IP address.\n\n235\n00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,350\nWhen it forwards it out\nthe interface it says look.\n\n236\n00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,474\nI've got to send this packet on,\nbut if it's coming form me,\n\n237\n00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,674\nthis is where the MAC addresses\nwill actually end up changing.\n\n238\n00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:33,591\nSo here the source MAC address is gonna\nbecome the MAC address of the exiting\n\n239\n00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:35,318\ninterface on router one.\n\n240\n00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:44,546\nAnd the destination MAC address will\nnow go across to router two, so\n\n241\n00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:50,110\nthat router two, will have a chance to\nforward that packet further as well.\n\n242\n00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,720\nAnd the we basically repeat the process.\n\n244\n00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,040\n>> Yep.\n>> Router one sends the packet along this\n\n245\n00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,920\nlink right here.\n\n246\n00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,250\nSo, it goes from router one to router two.\n\n247\n00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,690\nOnce it gets to router two,\nwe end up with the repeat process.\n\n248\n00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,010\nIt starts down at layer one, it gets\nelectricity, it converts it to 1 0's,\n\n249\n00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,390\ngets to layer two, looks at the source and\n\n250\n00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,490\ndestination MAC address, the destination\nMAC address is router two so its a match.\n\n251\n00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,250\nThen it goes to layer three, and it says,\n\n252\n00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,090\nwait a minute,\nthat destination IP is not me.\n\n253\n00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,160\nIt says but, I know how to get there.\n\n254\n00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,780\nSo let me forward you along.\n\n255\n00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,280\nNow we repeat the process once again.\n\n256\n00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,030\nThe source IP.\n\n257\n00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,090\nThe source IP, it stays the same,\nas it always does.\n\n258\n00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,910\nI'm going to punch that\nback in with the same data.\n\n259\n00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,640\nFrom the very beginning, and\n\n260\n00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,570\nthe destination IP stays the same, because\nagain, it's the beginning and the end,\n\n261\n00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,620\nthe source and the destination, and\nwe don't want to manipulate that.\n\n262\n00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n263\n00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,630\nBut once again the layer\nto address changes.\n\n264\n00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,370\nNotice now,\n\n265\n00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,920\nthe source map address will become the\nexiting interface on router two for us.\n\n266\n00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,660\nAnd then the destination, well this is\nactually where we will have that one\n\n267\n00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,668\ndevice that will actually be\nthe ultimate destination address.\n\n268\n00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:10,254\n>> And router two can find\nthat because it's plugged in\n\n269\n00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:12,384\nto this same network as PC two.\n\n270\n00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,516\nRouter two can send out a broadcast and\nsay hey what's the MAC address for\n\n271\n00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,560\n209.251.133.16.\n\n272\n00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,020\nPC two will respond back and\nsay hey, that's me.\n\n273\n00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,150\nRouter two will add that to its ARP cache\nand then be able to talk to that unit.\n\n274\n00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,280\nThe packet will make it to PC2, and\n\n275\n00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,560\nPC2 will learn that it can get back\nto PC1 by go through router one.\n\n276\n00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,640\nIt kind of goes full circle.\n\n277\n00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,420\nSo that packet started on PC1 and\n\n278\n00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,040\nit made that full journey\nacross the system over to PC2,\n\n279\n00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,900\nand as it did it, the routers had to\nmanipulate that packet along the way,\n\n280\n00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,170\nnow here's the really\ncool part about that.\n\n281\n00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,980\nWe always talk about how routers\nare layer three devices.\n\n282\n00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,540\nThey use the information of layer\nthree to move the packet along.\n\n283\n00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,500\nBut, because that data can't change.\n\n284\n00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,550\nThey need help.\n\n285\n00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,005\nAnd so what actually moves the packet\nalong is not the packet data at all, but\n\n286\n00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:07,988\nthe frame data.\n\n287\n00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:08,536\n>> Right.\n\n288\n00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,080\n>> The layer two data.\n\n289\n00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,240\nThe source and MAC address is what\nactually moved that frame, or\n\n290\n00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,490\nmoved that packet.\n\n291\n00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,740\nHop by hop by hop down the road.\n\n292\n00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,520\nSo, all though routers are layer three\ndevices, they do layer three look ups, but\n\n293\n00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,740\nthe real work that they do,\nthe manipulation they do is at layer two.\n\n294\n00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,730\n>> Now at destination PC2 here, right.\n\n295\n00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,870\nWe processed the layer two\nheader because it all matches.\n\n296\n00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,400\nBut this time instead of actually PC2\nlooking at the destination IP address and\n\n297\n00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,060\nthinking it's gonna actually\nneed to send it somewhere else.\n\n298\n00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,680\nit now actually takes a look at the\ndestination IP address and it matches, and\n\n299\n00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,870\nit processes the layer\nthree header as well.\n\n300\n00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,510\nAnd so that means once it processes that,\nits not gonna actually send it on any more\n\n301\n00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,230\nto any other direction, it means it has\nultimately arrived at its destination.\n\n302\n00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,627\nWe process layer two header,\nwe process layer three header,\n\n303\n00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,250\nthat means that the packet\nis where it belongs.\n\n304\n00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,768\n>> And this is happening over and\nover and over again on your network.\n\n305\n00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:08,369\nEvery single packet that you send\nis going through this process.\n\n306\n00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:11,899\nNow I drew it here with only two routers\nand I know you look at this diagram and\n\n307\n00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,310\nyou go man, that's kinda complex,\nI was keeping it simple right?\n\n308\n00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,380\nIn real life we may go\nthrough 20 hops right?\n\n309\n00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,410\nLet me give you an example,\nlet me bring up a command prompt here, and\n\n310\n00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,250\nwe'll take, let me do an NS lookup for\nITPro.TV, we'll take the ITProTV site.\n\n311\n00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,430\nAnd okay, and so\nthere's the IP address for ITProTV.\n\n312\n00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,460\nThe ITProTV site is hosted in a data\ncenter, not actually in this building.\n\n313\n00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,554\nIt's in the cloud.\n\n314\n00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,640\n>> Nice.\n>> You've got to use that buzzword.\n\n315\n00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,590\nSo if it's remote, right.\n\n316\n00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,280\nAnd we actually use a CDN so I don't even\nnecessarily know which city it's in.\n\n317\n00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,370\nIt's replicated across\nseven different cities.\n\n318\n00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,475\nSo if I reach out to the ITProTV site,\n\n319\n00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:55,915\nthere are several different\nways that I can get to it.\n\n320\n00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,525\nAnd we can see those by using\nthe trace-route command in Windows.\n\n321\n00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,585\nIn Windows, it's tracert.\n\n322\n00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,785\nIf I were actually on a Cisco router or\n\n323\n00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,810\nswitch, you just write out the full thing,\ntrace-route.\n\n324\n00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,630\nWith no spaces, but\notherwise the syntax is the same.\n\n325\n00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,140\nI'm gonna do a trace-route all the way to,\nI guess I\n\n326\n00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,150\ncould've just done the host name, but I'll\ndo it all the way to that IP right there.\n\n327\n00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,000\nTo see what I have to go through.\n\n328\n00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,880\nNow, I know I'm gonna pass\nthrough a minimum of two routers.\n\n329\n00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,020\nRight, because I've got a layer three\nswitch here, which is a router for us and\n\n330\n00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,000\nour firewall, which is doing routing.\n\n331\n00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,590\nSo the first two hops that I'll see here\nare actually equipment that's right here\n\n332\n00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,390\nin the building with me.\n\n333\n00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,475\nAfter that though,\nwe start to branch off, and\n\n334\n00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,505\nwe start to get in to our internet\nservice providers network.\n\n335\n00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:45,245\nSo gru.net,\nthat's our internet service provider, and\n\n336\n00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:46,735\nthen we're gonna start jumping cities.\n\n337\n00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,725\nSo we're gonna jump well,\nwe're still in Gainsville there, but\n\n338\n00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:53,550\nwe're about to jump either to Atlanta or\nMiami, looks like Atlanta.\n\n339\n00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,850\nThey have connections to both.\n\n340\n00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,610\nSo we're jumping out to Atlanta.\n\n341\n00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,780\nAnd then from Atlanta, let's see,\nwe're still in Atlanta.\n\n342\n00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,980\nAlthough we have jumped over\nto the Cogent network, now.\n\n343\n00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,538\n>> Still in Atlanta.\n\n344\n00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,977\n[LAUGH]\n>> And it's kinda moving slow, isn't it?\n\n345\n00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:09,850\n>> Looks like it's moving\naround Atlanta pretty good.\n\n346\n00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,970\n>> Yeah, apparently we're taking\nthe scenic tour of Atlanta.\n\n347\n00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,920\nEach one,\nwe just jumped to Washington, DC.\n\n348\n00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,620\nSo each of these hops is a server\nthat's in between me right now and\n\n349\n00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,610\nthe ITProTV website.\n\n350\n00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,070\nFor you guys at home if one\nof you guys were to do this,\n\n351\n00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,130\nif you were to run tracer out to ITPro.TV,\nyou might get a different path entirely.\n\n352\n00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,629\nEspecially if you're in Europe\nyou'll hit our server over there.\n\n353\n00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,400\nJust depending on where you're at, you'll\ngo a different path, but even if we were\n\n354\n00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,960\ngoing to the same server, you might get\ndifferent paths to the same server.\n\n355\n00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,700\nGee, this is really impressive.\n\n356\n00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,090\nI kinda figured it would\nbe less hops than this, but\n\n357\n00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,100\nI don't even know what city that is.\n\n358\n00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,675\n>> I don't know what EWR is.\n\n359\n00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:52,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n360\n00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,670\nwe've made it into city codes\nthat I don't recognize.\n\n361\n00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,625\n>> Yeah.\n\n362\n00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,390\n>> So yeah.\n\n363\n00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,876\nSo, oh there we go.\n\n364\n00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,187\n[CROSSTALK] 18 hops, right?\n\n365\n00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:07,625\nSo we had to go 18 hops, through 18\nrouters to get to the destination.\n\n366\n00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,780\nSo if we go back to my diagram,\nwhich I've lost.\n\n367\n00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,960\nHere, this diagram.\n\n368\n00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,950\nIf we go back to this diagram,\n\n369\n00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,360\nif I wanted to draw that whole process,\nI would have to draw 18 routers.\n\n370\n00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,570\nThat's how many times we\nwent through this change.\n\n371\n00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,310\nThat means the layer two\ninformation of my packet,\n\n372\n00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:30,260\nof my frame on the network, it changed 18\ntimes before it reached its destination.\n\n373\n00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,390\nNow layer three, four, five, six, seven\nthose guys, that all stayed the same,\n\n374\n00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,130\ncompletely untouched.\n\n375\n00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,060\nBut layer two, the MAC address, source and\n\n376\n00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,995\ndestination MAC address,\nwas changed with every single hop.\n\n377\n00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,220\n>> Right.\n\n378\n00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,190\n>> Now that's an important concept.\n\n379\n00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,400\nA lot of people overlook this.\n\n380\n00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,442\nIt does make for\nan excellent test question.\n\n381\n00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:51,995\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n382\n00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:55,915\n>> For example, what you can see\non the exam is where they give\n\n383\n00:19:55,915 --> 00:20:00,475\nyou a diagram very, very similar\nto this one, except the source and\n\n384\n00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:05,690\ndestination MAC addresses, source and\ndestination IPs are blank, right?\n\n385\n00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,140\nAnd they basically say,\nlet me see if I can recreate this somehow.\n\n386\n00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,990\nI'm probably gonna regret it if I try,\nbut they give it to you where it's blank.\n\n387\n00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,824\nAnd then instead of numbers or\nwhatever in there,\n\n388\n00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:25,322\nthey just put in something like,\nA, whoops.\n\n389\n00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:29,862\nB, C, and D.\n\n390\n00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:37,650\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,280\nAnd so the question might read,\nwhat is the proper address, or\n\n392\n00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,605\nproper value that should be in address B?\n\n393\n00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,610\nAnd so you look at this and you find B.\n\n394\n00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,350\nAnd your like, all right,\n\n395\n00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,320\nwhat would be the Source IP address\nat this step in the journey.\n\n396\n00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,920\nAnd you need to understand,\nthe Source IP, does that change?\n\n397\n00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,970\nNo.\nIt's the same across the entire path.\n\n398\n00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,970\nOr the destination.\n\n399\n00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,430\nSame across the entire path.\n\n400\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,250\nBut if it was the Source MAC address,\nif they're asking about A,\n\n401\n00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,790\nI would need to know that\nthat changes with every hop.\n\n402\n00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,710\nAnd when it says a source MAC address,\nit's for the exiting interface so\n\n403\n00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,980\non router one it's existing\nout this interface so\n\n404\n00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,877\nit would be this MAC address and\nnot the other MAC address.\n\n405\n00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:18,100\nCuz routers are gonna have at least two\ninterfaces which means at least two MAC\n\n406\n00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,280\naddresses.\n\n407\n00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,860\n>> You may also see this in,\nmaybe like a drag and drop as well,\n\n408\n00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,620\nwhere the information is at the top and\nyou have to put it in the right order, so\n\n409\n00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,080\nit's very possible.\n\n410\n00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,210\n>> So they love these questions.\n\n411\n00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,748\nThe other reason they love these\nquestions is they can re-use it three or\n\n412\n00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,590\nfour times in the exam.\n\n413\n00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,175\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n414\n00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:35,650\n>> Cuz they might ask you about\nthis value up here on one question.\n\n415\n00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,350\nThey might ask you about this\nvalue down here on another one.\n\n416\n00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,350\nAnd then jump up to this one for\nthe third one.\n\n417\n00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,038\nSo you might see the same exact\nquestion three times, but\n\n418\n00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,510\njust asking you about a number\nin a different place.\n\n419\n00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,790\nAnd a lot of times some or\neven all of these values may be blank, and\n\n420\n00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,460\nyou're completely relying on\nwhat's up here at the top.\n\n421\n00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,860\nYou wanna make sure that you've got a good\nhealthy understanding of this process.\n\n422\n00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,970\nThis is called\nthe Packet Forwarding Process and\n\n423\n00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,250\nhow that data moves from\nhop to hop along the way.\n\n424\n00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,550\nAll right,\nthis process is part of the work right?\n\n425\n00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,700\nThis is the grunt work,\n\n426\n00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,990\nthis is the hard work that the router\nhas to do as it moves the data along.\n\n427\n00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,580\nBut there's also a matter of our routing\ntables that are getting looked up and\n\n428\n00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,240\nRonnie we've got about five minutes to the\nbreak which is not really enough time for\n\n429\n00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,830\nme to dive in to the routing tables.\n\n430\n00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,283\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n431\n00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:25,376\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Why don't we take our break\n\n432\n00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,093\na little bit early?\n\n433\n00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,730\n>> Okay.\n\n434\n00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,800\n>> Unless you got anything\nelse to throw in on this one?\n\n435\n00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,240\n>> No.\nWe're ready to go.\n\n436\n00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,480\n>> Okay, let's stop right here and\ntake our break just a little bit early.\n\n437\n00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,081\nAnd when we get back,\nI wanna dive into the routing tables and\n\n438\n00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,230\ntake a look at how that\nlayer three process works.\n\n439\n00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,760\n>> Right.\n>> Because it's pretty neat.\n\n440\n00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,762\n>> Yep.\n\n441\n00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:43,085\n>> All right, well stay tuned and\nwe'll be back in just a few minutes.\n\n442\n00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:48,696\n[SOUND] All right welcome\n\n443\n00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:52,908\nback everybody.\n\n444\n00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:57,792\nSo what I want to do now is I wanna take\na look at the routing process that's going\n\n445\n00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,400\non as we pass through all\nthose different devices.\n\n446\n00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,350\nSo I've taken that same drawing that\nwe're working with earlier, Ronnie.\n\n447\n00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,160\nAnd I've just kind of stripped\nout all that layer two stuff, and\n\n448\n00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,080\ngone just layer three, so that we can\nget an idea of how these routers build,\n\n449\n00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,570\nwhat's called a routing table.\n\n450\n00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,020\nNow when we fire up a brand-new router,\nthe interfaces don't have IP addresses.\n\n451\n00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,308\nIt doesn't really do anything.\n\n452\n00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:23,650\nIt's non-functional, right?\n\n453\n00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,865\nBut then, we get in and we assign\nthe interfaces some IP addresses.\n\n454\n00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:31,230\nAnd the instant you've done that, the\ninstant you've assigned an IP address to\n\n455\n00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,780\ntwo or more interfaces,\nyour router begins to route.\n\n456\n00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,600\nAll right?\n\n457\n00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,490\nSo let's take router one for example.\n\n458\n00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,660\nRouter one has two interfaces, its got\nFa00, which has 172.19.1.1 as a network.\n\n459\n00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,594\nAnd Fa01 which has\n51.17.33.221 as a network.\n\n460\n00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:53,030\nLet's just assume for the sake of\nsimplicity that these are all class Cs.\n\n461\n00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,404\nRight?\nLet's do all of them is just 24 bit\n\n462\n00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,313\nsubject nets.\n\n463\n00:23:56,313 --> 00:24:00,680\nSo when router one powers on it looks at\nit's physical interfaces and it says hey,\n\n464\n00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,780\nI'm connected to these two networks.\n\n465\n00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,454\n>> And it's gonna add them\nto its routing table, so\n\n466\n00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:11,102\nit creates an entry that will say hey,\n\n467\n00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:16,840\non interface FA0/0, I've got the 172.19.1.\n\n468\n00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,500\n>> One .0/24.\n\n469\n00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,504\nHold on let me straighten\nthis up because it's.\n\n470\n00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,220\nThere we go.\n\n471\n00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,220\nIt creates an entry,\nthis network is out there.\n\n472\n00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:34,055\nAnd it's connected to me on FA00,\nand it also creates an entry for\n\n473\n00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,240\nFA0/1.\n\n474\n00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,050\n>> Which is for\nit the 51.17.33.0 again I'm just treating\n\n475\n00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,800\nall of these as class C's for\nsimplicity's sake.\n\n476\n00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800\nIn real life it can be any\nnumber of different networks.\n\n477\n00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,170\nSo our router actually ends up learning\nabout the routes or the networks.\n\n478\n00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,850\n>> That it's directly\nconnected to first here.\n\n479\n00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,860\nWhy?\nWell because\n\n480\n00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,080\nit's the easiest thing for it to learn.\n\n481\n00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,810\n>> Yeah, and they're directly plugged in,\nso it knows it's got that connection.\n\n482\n00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,590\nThe instant this happens,\nthe router is now routing.\n\n483\n00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,730\nRouter 1 says I know these 2 networks,\nI can route traffic between them.\n\n484\n00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:20,260\nSo if PC 1 watns to get to the 172.19\nnetwork, well it's plugged into it.\n\n485\n00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,998\nIt's already on that network.\n\n486\n00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:23,830\nIt doesn't need a router.\n\n487\n00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,920\nIf it wants to get to\nthe 51.17.33 network,\n\n488\n00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,630\nit can by going through\nits default gateway.\n\n489\n00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,420\nRouter 1 knows how to get to 51.17\nbecaues it's plugged into it.\n\n490\n00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,510\nAnd it can get there.\n\n491\n00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:42,750\nNow, once this happens, router 1 comes up,\nit's got its information, it's happy.\n\n492\n00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,980\nWe power on router 2 and\ndo the same thing.\n\n493\n00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,560\nNow router 2, very similar.\n\n494\n00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:53,585\n>> Basically,\nit's gonna come through and, [INAUDIBLE]\n\n495\n00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,935\nyou know, sometimes you just can't win.\n\n496\n00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:57,905\nWhat?\n\n497\n00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:01,275\nNow, I've ruined my little picture.\n\n498\n00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,930\nSo basically it's going to\ngo through the same process,\n\n499\n00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,180\nwhere it's got to figure out what networks\nare plugged in, and what networks aren't,\n\n500\n00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,805\nand everything was all nice and\npretty and now I ruined it.\n\n501\n00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:16,440\n>> [LAUGHS].\n\n502\n00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,350\n>> So anyhow,\nit's going to do the same process.\n\n503\n00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,725\nNow on router 2 It will say for\nexample that, what is it,\n\n504\n00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:28,994\nGI-0/0, cuz it's got gigabit cards,\nis on the 15.17.33.0/24 network.\n\n505\n00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:31,370\nSo I'll just throw that in there.\n\n506\n00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,011\nAnd then it'll say, all right,\nmy other network card, GI0/1,\n\n507\n00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:45,750\nis on the 209.251.133.0/24 network.\n\n508\n00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:55,390\nAll right, and so\nthose go in its routing table,\n\n509\n00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,920\nand it's just seeing that at\nboot time if it's got those.\n\n510\n00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,960\nAnd if we add them after it boots,\nit sees them then and adds them in.\n\n511\n00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720\n>> So that's gonna be its routing table.\n\n512\n00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,940\nNow any time I try and\nsend traffic across this router.\n\n513\n00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,930\nWhat the router is going to do is it's\ngoing to look at it's routing table\n\n514\n00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,273\nto see if it knows how to get there,\nright.\n\n515\n00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:19,850\nSo if PC 1 tries to ping 51.17.33.221,\nright?\n\n516\n00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,850\nIf it tries to ping that address,\n\n517\n00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,540\nwell PC1 knows that it's gotta go\nthrough its default gateway, right.\n\n518\n00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,600\nSo, it's going to send that to router 1.\n\n519\n00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,640\nAnd router one is gonna say,\nokay you're trying to get to 51.17.33.221.\n\n520\n00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,050\nThat's me, but\n\n521\n00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,720\nit's going to send it over to that other\ninterface where the ping can be received,\n\n522\n00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,970\nand then it's gonna respond back and\nit's gonna be able to respond all the way.\n\n523\n00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,835\nIt knew how to get to that network,\nbecause it was in the routing table.\n\n524\n00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:56,955\n>> Don, I just realized we may have a typo\non the, entering interface on router 2.\n\n525\n00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,215\nOn the left hand side.\n\n526\n00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:02,655\n>> On router 2.\n>> Is that suppose to be a 51.\n\n527\n00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:03,255\n>> Oh it is.\n\n528\n00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:03,865\nLook at that.\n\n529\n00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:05,130\n>> No I just saw it.\n\n530\n00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,430\nI was looking at it a little bit earlier,\nso that way we don't confuse anybody.\n\n531\n00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,840\n>> So it's wrong up there at the top and\nit's wrong down here so\n\n532\n00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,350\nlet's fix that in both places.\n\n533\n00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,860\n>> Yeah, so that way we don't\nget confused by accident.\n\n534\n00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,560\nAlright cool.\n\n535\n00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,875\n>> Too late, I'm already confused.\n\n536\n00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,690\n[LAUGH] Alright, there we go.\n\n537\n00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,440\nSo, that process is\nhappening all the time.\n\n538\n00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,360\nRight.\nThat's what routers do.\n\n539\n00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,220\nRouters look up in their routing table to\nfind a way to get to there destination,\n\n540\n00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,820\nand then they get the traffic over there.\n\n541\n00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,280\nNow, that means router 1, and\nrouter 2 are able to act as routers.\n\n542\n00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,230\nBut, there is a little bit of\na problem with our network.\n\n543\n00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,850\nRight.\n\n544\n00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,738\nThis configuration right here\nwill only get you so far.\n\n545\n00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:47,710\nFor example,\nlet's say that PC1 tries to ping router 2.\n\n546\n00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,780\nSo PC1, we'll say this right here, right.\n\n547\n00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:59,390\nRight, 172.19.1.28 tries to ping\nover to router 2, 51.17.33.43.\n\n548\n00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:05,800\nSo this is the ping that we're\ntrying to send right now.\n\n549\n00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,080\nRight.\nOkay.\n\n550\n00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,260\nWell, when PC1 goes to hit this other IP.\n\n551\n00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,680\nPC1 is not in the same network.\n\n552\n00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,640\nSo just like before the break,\nit's going to say.\n\n553\n00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640\nAll right.\nI got to go through the default gateway.\n\n554\n00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,560\nSo it's going to send its\ndata over to router 1.\n\n555\n00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,660\nRouter 1 is going to look\nat its routing table.\n\n556\n00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,110\nAnd it's going to say all right I need\nto find a route that matches this.\n\n557\n00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,430\nThey're trying to get to 51.17 right.\n\n558\n00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,660\nSo it's going to look at the first\nentry in the routing table but\n\n559\n00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,330\nthat doesn't match, right.\n\n560\n00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,970\nThen it's going to look at\nthe second entry that does match.\n\n561\n00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,070\nAnd it says, we can get to 51.17.33\nvia FA0/1, via that interface.\n\n562\n00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,080\nSo, it's then going to\n\n563\n00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,290\nforward that traffic out that\ninterface over to router 2.\n\n564\n00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,590\n>> And this is where we will\nhave our problem, okay?\n\n565\n00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,310\nOnce we're on router 2, we had it,\nthe ping that's actually arrived,\n\n566\n00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,900\nwhich is perfectly fine, but\nnotice that router 2, though, has to\n\n567\n00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,540\nbe able to communicate back to a network\nThat it is not directly connected on.\n\n568\n00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,400\nNotice that there is no entry for\nthe 172.19.1 network here.\n\n569\n00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,670\nAnd so even if router 2 can\nreceive the ping itself,\n\n570\n00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,410\nit has no way to return the actual ping.\n\n571\n00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,390\n>> Yeah, so, it's just gonna go right\ndown it's routing table and it's looking.\n\n572\n00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,720\nIt says alright, I'm gonna reply.\n\n573\n00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,880\nI wanna reply to 172.19.1.28.\n\n574\n00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,220\nIt goes down the routing table and\nas it goes down,\n\n575\n00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,290\nit does not find an entry for\n172.19.1.28, it cannot reply.\n\n576\n00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:44,040\nSo when this happens, we get usually\ndestination timed out, right?\n\n577\n00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,060\nDestination timed out is a response\nwe get via ping that says,\n\n578\n00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,460\n'We never got a response\nback from the other side.\n\n579\n00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,570\nWe sent our data out, but\nthey never responded.' that's\n\n580\n00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:59,080\nalmost always an indication that somewhere\nwe've got a bad route or a missing route.\n\n581\n00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,730\nAlright.\n\n582\n00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,870\nNow if you get destination unreachable\nthat's your own router saying, 'Hey,\n\n583\n00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:09,210\nI don't know how to get to it.' If PC1\nwere to try and ping PC2, right.\n\n584\n00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,666\nIf it were to try and ping 209.251.133.16.\n\n585\n00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,760\n>> Yeah.\nRouter 1 doesn't have anything for that.\n\n586\n00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,460\n>> The ping would go to router 1,\nit would look down the table.\n\n587\n00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,920\nIt wouldn't find it and it would return a\nmessage saying destination unreachable or\n\n588\n00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,100\ndestination host unknown.\n\n589\n00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,280\nI don't know how to get\nto that destination but\n\n590\n00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,090\nif we don't get any message at all\nthat's where we get the time out and\n\n591\n00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,560\nit just lets us know hey we never\ngot a response from the other end,\n\n592\n00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,120\nI don't know what the deal is right.\n\n593\n00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,830\n>> So routers can only do so much.\n\n594\n00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,360\nBased on what they're\ndirectly connected to.\n\n595\n00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,100\nSo, how do we fix all that, right?\n\n596\n00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,730\nWhat is our solution?\n\n597\n00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:54,375\nWell, the solution is a routing\nprotocol of some sort.\n\n598\n00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,496\nOr let's start simple.\n\n599\n00:31:57,496 --> 00:32:03,939\nthe easiest solution for us to tell the\nrouters how to get to these destinations.\n\n600\n00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,760\nWe can manually put entries in there that.\n\n601\n00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,536\nTell it how to get to certain places.\n\n602\n00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:12,779\n>> So for example,\non router 1 here, if I wanted to,\n\n603\n00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:19,540\nI could simply actually have asked\nsomeone else, what is your IP address?\n\n604\n00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,570\nAnd then,\nbe able to find the path there and\n\n605\n00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,430\nactually enter that information\ninto the routing table itself.\n\n606\n00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,510\nSo here Don is actually making an entry\nin which what we're gonna actually end up\n\n607\n00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:36,610\ndoing is we're gonna forward the packets\ndestined for the 209.251.133 network.\n\n608\n00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,413\nAll the way over to router 2,\n\n609\n00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:43,490\nthen router 2 will handle\nthe forwarding the rest of the way.\n\n610\n00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,980\nHere's what we're actually seeing\nhere in this particular entry.\n\n611\n00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,390\nSo, we're not quite done yet.\n\n612\n00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:47,900\nRight?\n\n613\n00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,100\nJust like the initial problem that we had,\nat the beginning,\n\n614\n00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,950\nwhere there was not a route in\nrouter 2 we have to actually provide\n\n615\n00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,110\na returning route as well, that can\ngive it back to my 172.19.1 network too.\n\n616\n00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,790\nIf I only do it on one side,\nit's gonna be incomplete.\n\n617\n00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,770\nSo just like the routers that couldn't\nroute past what it actually is directly\n\n618\n00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,920\nconnected to.\n\n619\n00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,160\nWithout the actual returning route, we do\nnot have the information that we need.\n\n620\n00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,580\n>> And that is one of\nthe trickier parts about routing.\n\n621\n00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,470\nYou always have to remember\nthat return trip, the way back.\n\n622\n00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,500\nOkay so we can tell router 1,\nthey call it a static assignment.\n\n623\n00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,870\nA static assignment is where we manually\ntell the router how to get to a network,\n\n624\n00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,770\nwhen we tell it that,\nwe can say oh, if you wanna get\n\n625\n00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,300\nto 209.251.133.0/24 if you wanna get to\nthat network, you need to go to router 2.\n\n626\n00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,800\nAnd we normally tell it\nbased on an IP address, so\n\n627\n00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,160\nwe give it the IP address of router 2.\n\n628\n00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,470\nOn router 2 we do the opposite.\n\n629\n00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,831\nWe say, hey if you wanna get to\n172.19.1.0/24 you can do it via router 1,\n\n630\n00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:53,790\nall right.\n\n631\n00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,710\nNow that's got our return trip or\n\n632\n00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,130\nyou can consider it the forward\ntrip if it was PC2 pinging to PC1.\n\n633\n00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,580\nThat's going to allow us\nfull connectivity, right.\n\n634\n00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,260\nSo, let's run through the process now.\n\n635\n00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,950\nOnce a PC1 tries to ping PC2,\nright, end to end connectivity,\n\n636\n00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,340\npinging all the way across\nPC1 is 172.19.1.28.\n\n637\n00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,680\nIt's gonna ping 209.251.133.16,\nso it's gonna say,\n\n638\n00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,760\nall right, that's a different network.\n\n639\n00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,030\nI need to go through my default gateway,\nrouter 1.\n\n640\n00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,019\nRouter 1's gonna look in\nits routing table and say,\n\n641\n00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:35,020\nokay, I can get you to\n209.251 via router 2.\n\n642\n00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,710\nIt's this entry right\nhere in my routing table.\n\n643\n00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,080\nThat matches so I'll send you to router 2.\n\n644\n00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,760\nRouter 2 is going to say yeah I\ncan get you there because well\n\n645\n00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,350\nI'm directly connected to that network.\n\n646\n00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,050\nIt's one of my built in interfaces.\n\n647\n00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,300\nSo I can send you and\nget you to that destination, and\n\n648\n00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,940\nthen when PC2 goes to respond,\nwell, it's just the opposite.\n\n649\n00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,121\nPC2 is responding to 172.19.1,\n\n650\n00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:04,900\nit knows it's gotta go through its default\ngateway, router 2 does an lookup and\n\n651\n00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,840\nsays I can get to 172.19 cuz it's in\nmy routing table sends us to routing 1.\n\n652\n00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,520\nRouter 1 has that one built in and\nso it's able to forward it on along.\n\n653\n00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,270\n>> On both sides we have to\nensure we have the routes\n\n654\n00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,846\nto the destinations that we want to do.\n\n655\n00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:27,790\nNow the static run is actually\na really good routing method for us.\n\n656\n00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,780\nBecause it actually puts the entry\nthat we want in the routing table.\n\n657\n00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,060\nAnd so it's really good and the second\nthing is it doesn't require anything\n\n658\n00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,110\nelse except for a few common entries.\n\n659\n00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, once we start getting larger,\n\n660\n00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,470\nit's getting more complex now.\n\n661\n00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,450\nThen it's a little bit more hefty.\n\n662\n00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,450\n>> The bigger your network is the more\nnetworks you've got to manage,\n\n663\n00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,980\nthe more static entries you've got to.\n\n664\n00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,490\n>> To create it, right.\nSo\n\n665\n00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,780\nI'm going to throw out a couple\nof buzz words here Ronnie.\n\n666\n00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,820\nSo when we have a bunch of routers and a\nbunch of networks, and every router knows\n\n667\n00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,690\nabout every route, what we have is\ncalled a converged network, right?\n\n668\n00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,800\nThat word, converged, Cisco loves it,\nI would be surprised if you went\n\n669\n00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,670\nthrough the exam and\ndidn't see that word at least once.\n\n670\n00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,520\nA converge network is just where all\nthe routers know the same stuff,\n\n671\n00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800\nthey all know the same routes.\n\n672\n00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,710\nIf you look at these routers\nthey're in different orders and\n\n673\n00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,180\nthey have different interface names, but\nI've got 3 networks listed on router one.\n\n674\n00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,230\nI've got the same three\nnetworks listed on router 2.\n\n675\n00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,810\nThat is a converged network.\n\n676\n00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,880\nWhen you add a new network and start\npopulating your systems, your network is\n\n677\n00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,840\nnot converged and your routers\nare said to be undergoing convergence.\n\n678\n00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,300\nWhich is you bringing\neverything back in line.\n\n679\n00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,020\nIt's a funny term, Cisco loves it.\n\n680\n00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,980\nAnd so it is one you'll see\ncreep up from time to time.\n\n681\n00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:51,220\nBut basically it's a pretty simple concept\nand it makes sense, it's like if you\n\n682\n00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,390\nhave a GPS in your car, it's only as good\nas the map data that you've downloaded.\n\n683\n00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,220\nIf it doesn't know about a road it's\nnot gonna suggest that you take it.\n\n684\n00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,370\nAnd that's how routers are.\n\n685\n00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,850\nThey've got to know about the road.\n\n686\n00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,760\nIf they don't know about the road then\nthey may not be able to get you to\n\n687\n00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,120\nthe destination.\n\n688\n00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,680\n>> But for simple networks, static\nrouting may be the way to go for us.\n\n689\n00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,080\nThe router doesn't have to to do anything,\n\n690\n00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,700\nit simply looks it up in the routing\ntable, and we're ready to go.\n\n691\n00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,480\nBut we're about to get into something\njust a little bit more complex here.\n\n692\n00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,050\nAt least describing the actual ideas\nof what we call dynamic routing in\n\n693\n00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,760\njust a moment here, in which really\ndoes help us to manage multiple routers,\n\n694\n00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,780\nmore and more routers here,\nand multiple routes as well.\n\n695\n00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,040\n>> You know, great point\nbecause static routes are fine.\n\n696\n00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,260\nYou know, they're perfectly fine\nto use if you don't have too many.\n\n697\n00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,670\nIf you have 1,000 routers out there,\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n698\n00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,950\n>> And you add a new route,\nyou've gotta go to 1,000 routers and\n\n699\n00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,430\nput a static route on them.\n\n700\n00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,090\nThat can be a nightmare,\nand so having a proper,\n\n701\n00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,410\nwell designed network That\ncan really be a challenge.\n\n702\n00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:01,290\nSo, our manual in the process is like\nthis, where we do the static entries.\n\n703\n00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,610\nAnd then, we also have dynamic entries.\n\n704\n00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,350\nDynamic entries are really cool\nbecause basically, the way it works.\n\n705\n00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,610\nWhen the routers come up,\nthey talk to each other.\n\n706\n00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,390\nAnd they just exchange information and\nrouter one says,\n\n707\n00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,328\nhey here's the networks that I know about,\ndo you know anything that I don't?\n\n708\n00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:20,880\nAnd they chitchat back and forth and just\nkind of determine what each other knows.\n\n709\n00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,080\nThey do an exchange of ideas,\nand once they're all in sync and\n\n710\n00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,640\nin line, then off they go and\nthey're happy.\n\n711\n00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n712\n00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,430\nThe nice thing about the dynam routes,\nagain, is that you and\n\n713\n00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,190\nI, pretty much all we have to do is\nturn on the routing protocol and\n\n714\n00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,310\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n715\n00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,150\nThey will do,\n\n716\n00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,460\naccording to their routing protocol,\nhow they want to exchange the information.\n\n717\n00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,340\nI don't have to tell it\nwhat particular route.\n\n718\n00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,970\nThey'll actually report everything that\nthey know they're directly connected\n\n719\n00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,940\nto and\n\n720\n00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,500\nif the other router is actually running\nthe same protocol they'll learn it.\n\n721\n00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,520\nThey'll be able to do what\nthey actually need to.\n\n722\n00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,880\nAnd then those 2 routers will\nagain be in convergence.\n\n723\n00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,730\n>> All right, so let's take a look\nat this on an actual router.\n\n724\n00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,450\nSo I'm gonna switch over to that Cisco\nrouter we've kinda been messing with.\n\n725\n00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,680\nAnd I think I've taken all the IP\naddresses off of it, so let's just, yup,\n\n726\n00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,570\nno IP addresses.\n\n727\n00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,090\nAll right, so\nhere I've got a Cisco router.\n\n728\n00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,380\nWe have 2 interfaces,\ngigabit ethernet 00 and gigabit 01.\n\n729\n00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,460\nIt's got these 2 interfaces but\nit's got no IP Addresses.\n\n730\n00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,668\nI'm just gonna go in and assign some IP\nAddresses real quick, I'll make this one\n\n731\n00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:28,600\nWe'll do 192.168.0.1 with\na class C subnet mask.\n\n732\n00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:36,870\nAnd then I'll get into the other one and\nI'll just do 1.1 for that one.\n\n733\n00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,440\nOkay?\n>> Remember that when we have to have it\n\n734\n00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,730\non the router, right.\n\n735\n00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,500\nIs actually two different routes right.\n\n736\n00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,220\nWe can actually be able to report one, and\n\n737\n00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,060\nwe don't have a IP address for\nthe other one.\n\n738\n00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,650\nSo we need two different networks so\n\n739\n00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,310\nthat the router can begin routing\nbetween those 2 networks here.\n\n740\n00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,305\nAnd you just made me think\nof something and Ronnie.\n\n741\n00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:54,911\nI'm going to.\n\n742\n00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,191\n>> [LAUGH] I hope.\n\n743\n00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:59,382\n>> I'm gonna shut those interfaces down.\n\n744\n00:39:59,382 --> 00:40:05,362\nRight now, if I take a look at the router,\nI've got the interfaces shut down.\n\n745\n00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,895\nSo, none of my interfaces are up.\n\n746\n00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:11,414\nAnd I've got a little command\n\n747\n00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:16,120\nI can run, it is show IP route.\n\n748\n00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,930\nShow IP route let's me see the routing\ntable that's on that router, so\n\n749\n00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,940\nI'm gonna run Show IP route and when I\nlook at it I get a lot of data, right?\n\n750\n00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,815\nIt looks like a lot of data,\nthis is actually an empty screen.\n\n751\n00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,773\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> What we have first off is,\n\n752\n00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:30,700\nthat we're going to see a bunch of routes.\n\n753\n00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,561\nAnd so it has a legend at the top that\nlets us identify what types of routes\n\n754\n00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,030\nwe're going to see.\n\n755\n00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,990\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n756\n00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,461\nWe've mentioned so\nfar only one real type of route, which or\n\n757\n00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:41,850\nactually we've mentioned two.\n\n758\n00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,640\nConnected.\n\n759\n00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And static.\n\n760\n00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,100\nRight.\nA connected route is one we're directly\n\n761\n00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,690\nplugged into,\n\n762\n00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,800\nand a static route is one we've manually\nentered and called the router about.\n\n763\n00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,900\nSo those are the two we've talked about so\nfar.\n\n764\n00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,350\nBut, you'll see there's a ton of others,\nmost of which don't appear on the exam, so\n\n765\n00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,860\nwe don't have to worry about.\n\n766\n00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,230\nBut, some of which do.\n\n767\n00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,970\nSo, we kind of get this legend to let\nus know that if we have a static route,\n\n768\n00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,520\nit will be marked with an S.\n\n769\n00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,960\nIf I have a connected route,\nit'll be marked with a C.\n\n770\n00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,620\n>> Right?\n\n771\n00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,990\nAnd then if I had a default route or\na gateway of last resort.\n\n772\n00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,060\n>> That's Cisco's term for\nthe fall back, which means if I go\n\n773\n00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,280\ndown the routing table and absolutely\nnothing matches, here's my go to guy.\n\n774\n00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,560\nHere's my just default.\n\n775\n00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,240\n>> I'll give it a shot and.\n\n776\n00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,910\n>> See what happens, right?\n\n777\n00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,010\nWhich we don't have one right now.\n\n778\n00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,550\nIf I turn those interfaces back on.\n\n779\n00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:34,930\nAnd notice I'm using the range\ncommand on a router.\n\n780\n00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,330\nThe range command works on routers\njust as well as on switches.\n\n781\n00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,480\nAlthough a lot of times on routers we have\nsuch different interfaces that it's not\n\n782\n00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:42,980\neffective.\n\n783\n00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,590\nBut in this case it works fine.\n\n784\n00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,260\nAll right, now those interfaces are up.\n\n785\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,860\nIf I go back into show IP route,\nit shouldn't be empty anymore.\n\n786\n00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,890\n>> Yep, there you go.\n\n787\n00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,470\n>> Now I've got the two networks\nthat I'm directly plugged into.\n\n788\n00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,560\nSee how they have a C beside them?\n\n789\n00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,250\nNow letting me know that\nit's directly connected.\n\n790\n00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:09,938\nI'm directly plugged in\nto 192.168.0.0/24 and\n\n791\n00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:13,660\n192.168.1.0/24.\n\n792\n00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,197\n>> And then some of the things we have to\nknow here as well is don't forget that\n\n793\n00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:19,196\nwhen we're dealing with static routes,\n\n794\n00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:22,240\nwe have to also know how to\nconfigure that static route as well.\n\n795\n00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,189\nSo on this one without actually\nhaving to worry about anything,\n\n796\n00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,550\nthe IP address it reported it,\nbut remember the S.\n\n797\n00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,960\nSince that's the one we also\ndid in our diagram before.\n\n798\n00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,290\nDo we wanna show that now or.\n\n799\n00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,280\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n800\n00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,030\nmanually telling it about a route\nis pretty easy, basically,\n\n801\n00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,670\nwe're give the configuration and\nwe have t figure out how to get to it.\n\n802\n00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,270\nRight?\n\n803\n00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,280\nSo we need to tell the router\na way to get this other network.\n\n804\n00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,839\nSo, maybe, you know, and\ndirectly connected to the 192.168.0 and\n\n805\n00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:53,220\n.1 networks, maybe the .2 and\n.3 networks are out there also.\n\n806\n00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,850\nAll right.\n\n807\n00:42:53,850 --> 00:43:00,090\nWell let's say that .2, I can get\nto 192.168.2 via a neighbor router.\n\n808\n00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,700\nAnother router that I'm connected to.\n\n809\n00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,831\nRight, well if If that router\nis on the same network as I am,\n\n810\n00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:08,640\nI can just point right to its IP address,\n\n811\n00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,205\nso maybe there's a router at 192.168.0.2,\nright?\n\n812\n00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:18,116\nNow, I am 192.168.0.1, so I'm saying\nthat there's a router at 0.2 that\n\n813\n00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:20,282\nknows how to get to this other network.\n\n814\n00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:25,842\nSo, I can punch in, the command is pretty\nstraight forward, ip route, right.\n\n815\n00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:30,230\nSo, I'm adding a route and\nI wanna specify the network.\n\n816\n00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,880\nAnd then how to get to it.\n\n817\n00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,790\nWell the network in this\ncase is gonna be 168.2.0.\n\n818\n00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,600\nSo I'm gonna say this is the network\nthat I know how to get to.\n\n819\n00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,820\nAnd I need to specify a subnet mask.\n\n820\n00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,800\nRemember that all modern Cisco\nrouters are classless so\n\n821\n00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,202\nit will not assume I'm\ntalking about a Class C.\n\n822\n00:43:48,202 --> 00:43:49,050\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n823\n00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,530\n>> I need to tell it the subnet mask and\nthen I need to tell it how to get there.\n\n824\n00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,120\nAll right?\n\n825\n00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,410\nNow, how to get there?\n\n826\n00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,355\nWell, there's another router\nout there at 192.168.0.2 and\n\n827\n00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:04,870\nI'm saying if you go through that router,\nyou will be able to get to this network.\n\n828\n00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:10,520\nThat will take effect immediately,\nand so if I run show IP route,\n\n829\n00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,950\nI can see that I now have a new entry\nin the routing table for 192.168.2.0.\n\n830\n00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,190\nNotice that it's available\nvia 192.168.0.2.\n\n831\n00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,650\nI can get to it by going\nthrough this other router.\n\n832\n00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,170\nAnd it is marked with an s over there,\nit is static.\n\n833\n00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,160\nNow when you're dealing\nwith In ethernet network.\n\n834\n00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,120\nRight.\nThat is a multi access network.\n\n835\n00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,010\nThere can be more than\none device on that cable.\n\n836\n00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,260\nAnd so normally we are going\nto things via IP like that.\n\n837\n00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,250\nBut, you might have a serial connection.\n\n838\n00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,730\nA point to point connection.\n\n839\n00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,520\nAnd we actually have a serial\nline in this router, don't we?\n\n840\n00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,230\n>> Yes we do.\n\n841\n00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,820\n>> Let's see,\ndo I wanna force it up just to show?\n\n842\n00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,570\nYeah, I'll force it up real quick.\n\n843\n00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:08,500\nThat should come up.\n\n844\n00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500\nLet's give it a second here.\n\n845\n00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,030\nOr not.\n\n846\n00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,610\n>> You don't need a cable?\n\n847\n00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,788\n>> Well, I did a node keep align which\nis normally enough to keep them up, but\n\n848\n00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:18,576\nthis one may not.\n\n849\n00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:23,765\nLet's go\n\n850\n00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:30,250\nchange that.\n\n851\n00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,680\nAll right, if it won't come up,\nif you do a route to a downed interface,\n\n852\n00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,170\nthen it won't show up\nin the routing table.\n\n853\n00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,900\nIt considers it down.\n\n854\n00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,760\nSo I'll just do one on\nan ethernet interface.\n\n855\n00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,390\nOr I could do a loopback I suppose.\n\n856\n00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,950\nBut I'll just do an ethernet one.\n\n857\n00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,700\nSo let's the 192.168.3\nnetwork is available.\n\n858\n00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,170\nAnd I've got an interface on my router\n\n859\n00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,480\nthat is directly plugged into\nthe neighbor router, right?\n\n860\n00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,760\nI'm not talked about plugged into\na switch and then the neighbor.\n\n861\n00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,840\nI'm talking about a cable,\nand with ethernet,\n\n862\n00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,610\nit would have to be a crossover cable.\n\n863\n00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,045\nA crossover cable from one router\ndirectly to another router, or\n\n864\n00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:10,240\nusually it's a serial cable like a T1\nline, right from one router to another.\n\n865\n00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,809\nMaybe it's MPLS or frame relay or\n\n866\n00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:16,950\nsome kind of direct connection\nbetween the systems.\n\n867\n00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,529\nIf it's a direct connection, I don't even\nhave to use an IP address for the route,\n\n868\n00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:28,031\nI can just say IP route, 192.168.3.0\nwith the subnet mask and instead\n\n869\n00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:33,370\nof pointing it to a destination IP, I can\npoint it to a destination interface and\n\n870\n00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:38,830\nyou'll see all the difference interface\ntypes listed here that I can pick from.\n\n871\n00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,120\nI'll send this one out GI 0/1.\n\n872\n00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,240\n>> Yeah, now instead of the destination\nas exiting interface, right?\n\n873\n00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,080\nIs that what we pointed out?\n\n874\n00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,863\n>> Yeah, this is where we're going\nto be throwing this traffic out,\n\n875\n00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:51,910\nwe're throwing it out of an interface\nto get to some other destination.\n\n876\n00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:56,712\nAnd if I take a look at my\nroutine table do a show IP route,\n\n877\n00:46:56,712 --> 00:47:02,747\nI can see that I now have a static\nroute for 192.168.3.0 and\n\n878\n00:47:02,747 --> 00:47:07,160\nit's directly connected\non interface GI0/1.\n\n879\n00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,120\nYou can use that for\npoint to point interfaces.\n\n880\n00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,271\nIf it's point, any kind of multi-point\ninterface, any kind of interface with\n\n881\n00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:18,820\nmultiple devices on the other end,\nthen you're going to do it by IP.\n\n882\n00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,392\nSo really the bulk of the time you're\ngonna do it by IP, really just when you're\n\n883\n00:47:23,392 --> 00:47:27,030\ndealing with serial lines that\nyou would do it to an interface.\n\n884\n00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,740\nI didn't do it with the serial\non here just cuz it's off.\n\n885\n00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,490\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n886\n00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,370\n>> So, which I guess I could hook a cable\nup and get it fired up but eh, whatever.\n\n887\n00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,160\nOkay.\n\n888\n00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,120\nSo just keep that in mind that you\ndo have two choices with the static.\n\n889\n00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,570\nThe command itself, let me reiterate that.\n\n890\n00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,578\nIt basically is IP route.\n\n891\n00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,379\nOr, you know what, I should just\ndo it in Notepad or something,\n\n892\n00:47:50,379 --> 00:47:51,738\nwell I'll do it here on the screen.\n\n893\n00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:56,891\nIP route, and\nthen it's the destination network,\n\n894\n00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:01,810\nsubnet mask and\nthe destination actually I should\n\n895\n00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,271\nprobably just leave destination out there.\n\n896\n00:48:06,271 --> 00:48:11,031\nAnd then the destination, how we get\nto it, so I'll say destination router.\n\n897\n00:48:11,031 --> 00:48:13,550\nSo the router that we need\nto go through to get there.\n\n898\n00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,709\nSo IP route.\n\n899\n00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:17,172\nThat tells the router\nwe're adding a route.\n\n900\n00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:20,854\nThe network and the subnet math\nthat we're teaching it about, and\n\n901\n00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:24,074\nthen the destination,\nwhere we go to actually get there,\n\n902\n00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:26,720\nthat's the syntax of that command.\n\n903\n00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,245\nThe router does not validate these routes.\n\n904\n00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It doesn't make sure they're\n\n905\n00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,940\nactually real.\n\n906\n00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,470\n>> Yep [LAUGH].\n>> It assumes we know what we're\n\n907\n00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,070\ntalking about.\n\n908\n00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:32,720\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n909\n00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,070\nSo if you do a static route it says,\nwell, you must know what you're doing.\n\n910\n00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,012\n>> Yep.\n>> Even though you might not, so\n\n911\n00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:39,663\ndefinitely be wary of that.\n\n912\n00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:43,263\nAll right the last thing that\n\n913\n00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,410\nI wanna mention is this is\nkind of automatic, right?\n\n914\n00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,950\nThat if I take an interface and\nI shut it down.\n\n915\n00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,910\nSo if I turn off one of those interfaces,\nthe routes tied to that interface go down.\n\n916\n00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,470\nSo if I take a look at\nmy routing table now.\n\n917\n00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:01,500\nSee how I lost 192.168.0.1\nwhich was directly connected.\n\n918\n00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,870\nAnd, 192.168.3, which was a static route.\n\n919\n00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,215\nBut it was via this interface\nthat's no longer active.\n\n920\n00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:10,965\nIt is smart about that.\n\n921\n00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:15,305\nIt does remove the routes when\nthey're no longer valid and\n\n922\n00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:18,865\nit puts them back when\nthey become valid again.\n\n923\n00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:22,590\nSo when that interface comes back\nup I can do a show IP route and\n\n924\n00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,170\nyou see those routes reappear.\n\n925\n00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,360\nSo it's pretty smart about this stuff.\n\n926\n00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,800\n>> It is.\n\n927\n00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,978\nThat was pretty fast.\n\n928\n00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:29,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n929\n00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,640\n>> So any time it's a local error\n\n930\n00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,770\nlike that, it gets fixed up pretty quick.\n\n931\n00:49:33,998 --> 00:49:37,950\nAll right, well, looking at the clock,\nwe've run right up on our break time here,\n\n932\n00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:38,680\nso let's stop here.\n\n933\n00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,090\nDo you have anything else to throw in?\n\n934\n00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,060\n>> Nope,\nI think we're ready on static routes.\n\n935\n00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,610\n>> All right,\nlet's go ahead and stop here.\n\n936\n00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,230\nWhen we get back.\n\n937\n00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,630\nBack, we'll go ahead and set up\nsomething a little more functional and\n\n938\n00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,880\nget a chance to see it.\n\n939\n00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,496\nBut, for right now, let's stop and\ntake a five minute break.\n\n940\n00:49:49,496 --> 00:49:51,289\nWhen we get back, more routing.\n\n941\n00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:55,374\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n942\n00:49:55,374 --> 00:50:01,371\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n943\n00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:05,049\nSo before the break, Ronnie and I were\ntalking about some of the steps we have to\n\n944\n00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,810\ngo through with initially\nsetting up some routers.\n\n945\n00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:12,290\nAnd we showed you guys how to\ncreate a static route right,\n\n946\n00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,170\nusing the IP route command.\n\n947\n00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:18,270\nAnd what I wana do now, is I've got this\nlittle stack of routers behind me here,\n\n948\n00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,140\nand I wanna show you guys what\nit's like on actual equipment and\n\n949\n00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,330\nkind of going through the process.\n\n950\n00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,890\nSo, what I did is I took these\ntwo routers behind me, and\n\n951\n00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,170\nI assigned them the names that\nwe were using in the diagram.\n\n952\n00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,197\nLet's go back to my diagram for\na minute my wonderful horrible diagram.\n\n953\n00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:35,730\n>> Nice.\n\n954\n00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,980\n>> So basically I named them\nrouter one and router two.\n\n955\n00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,010\nAnd router one is a 2800 series router\nthat has gigabit ports on it, so\n\n956\n00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,440\nI had to rename the ports up here.\n\n957\n00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,650\nGig00, Gig01.\n\n958\n00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,500\nAnd then router two,\nit's a bit of an older router and\n\n959\n00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,040\nso it's got a fast ethernet port,\nFa00 and Serial00 on it.\n\n960\n00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,170\nIt's got serial ports.\n\n961\n00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,850\nBut I left all the IPs the same so\n\n962\n00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,210\nI could show you guys this actual\nprocess here in real life.\n\n963\n00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,550\nAlthough, I didn't update the interfaces\ndown here because I'm a big slacker.\n\n964\n00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:06,130\n>> Yeah, you didn't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n965\n00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,190\n>> So, like that should be Gi0/0 and\n\n966\n00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,120\nthis should be Gi0/1, whoops.\n\n967\n00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:19,536\nAnd over here, we should have me\nmoving them things around at random.\n\n968\n00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:22,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This should be, Fa0/0.\n\n969\n00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,205\nAnd this should be\n\n970\n00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,460\nS0/0, like that.\n\n971\n00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,410\nAll right, but\nthe IP addresses are the same,\n\n972\n00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:40,130\nthe networks are the same, we just\nhave to teach the routers about it.\n\n973\n00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,030\nSo I went ahead and\nassigned these IPs through the interfaces.\n\n974\n00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,770\nAnd so when these routers come up,\n\n975\n00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,660\nthey're gonna have the routing\ntable minus these red routes.\n\n976\n00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,130\nThe red routes are going to be missing.\n\n977\n00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,820\nSo let me just jump on over to router,\nwho am I plugging into?\n\n978\n00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,830\nRouter one, router two, router 12?\n\n979\n00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,630\nRouter 1.\n\n980\n00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,160\nSo let me jump over to router one and kind\nof demonstrate what's gonna happen here.\n\n981\n00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,590\nSo Too many windows open.\n\n982\n00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,252\nAll right, so here's old router one and\n\n983\n00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:12,578\nif I look at the configuration\non the interfaces,\n\n984\n00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:18,037\nI'll see that gigabit zero\nzero has 172.19.1.1 and\n\n985\n00:52:18,037 --> 00:52:22,164\ngigabit zero one has 51.17.33 right.\n\n986\n00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:24,372\nSo those are the two\nnetworks that are out there.\n\n987\n00:52:24,372 --> 00:52:26,790\nThe interfaces are up, they're healthy.\n\n988\n00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:31,320\nIf I do a, show IP route, I'll see the\nrouting table contains just two routes.\n\n989\n00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,120\n>> Yep,\nour directly connected routes here.\n\n990\n00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,530\n>> Yeah, now the output that we're seeing\nhere is a little bit different than\n\n991\n00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,580\nearlier.\n\n992\n00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,340\nEarlier I was using the 192.168 networks\nand I was using them as Class C's,\n\n993\n00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:48,290\nwell when you're doing class full routing,\n192.168 is a class C so that matches up.\n\n994\n00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,390\nBut we're doing classless routing, but\nthe router still reminds us of that,\n\n995\n00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,258\nit reminds us that we're\ndoing classless routing.\n\n996\n00:52:54,258 --> 00:53:00,250\nNotice how, 51.0.0.0/24 is listed,\nand it says that it is subnetted.\n\n997\n00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:06,880\nThat is the note that lets me know hey,\nyou guys are doing CIDR.\n\n998\n00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,710\nYou're breaking the rules.\n\n999\n00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:14,150\nSo then it lists that\nI've got 51.17.33.0/24,\n\n1000\n00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,990\nso that's why it's kind of representing\ntwo lines for a route instead of one and\n\n1001\n00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,030\nthat's part of why I wanted to show\nyou guy this unreal equipment so\n\n1002\n00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,350\nyou could see that variation.\n\n1003\n00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,940\nAll right, now I do have the two routes\n51.17.33 and 172.19.1 just like back here,\n\n1004\n00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,900\nbut I'm missing that red route.\n\n1005\n00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:39,402\nI don't have a way to get\nto the 209.251.133 network.\n\n1006\n00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:43,370\nThat network is over on router two,\nand I don't know how to get there.\n\n1007\n00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,080\nNow I can get to router two.\n\n1008\n00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,150\nRouter two has an interface 51.17.33.43.\n\n1009\n00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,530\nAnd I'm directly plugged\ninto that network.\n\n1010\n00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,380\nSo I should be able to ping that.\n\n1011\n00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,800\nAnd let's find out.\n\n1012\n00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,130\nI will ping 51.17 .33.43.\n\n1013\n00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:03,440\nThat is the interface of router two and\n\n1014\n00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,070\nit's on a network that I'm\ndirectly plugged into so\n\n1015\n00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:10,310\nif I ping it after an arp request,\nI should find it.\n\n1016\n00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,700\nSo, there we go.\n\n1017\n00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,140\nAnd now if I repeat I\nget all five successful.\n\n1018\n00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,600\nThat first arp usually causes\na delay in the first ping pad.\n\n1019\n00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,230\nAlthough yesterday we had two pings fail.\n\n1020\n00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,680\nThat's a little unusual but who knows?\n\n1021\n00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,880\nAll right.\nSo things are looking good there, but\n\n1022\n00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,200\nif I try and ping the far side of\nrouter two, right, the far side of\n\n1023\n00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:38,710\nrouter two was 209.251.133.1.\n\n1024\n00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:45,460\nSo if I try and ping that far side\nof router two I know well not much.\n\n1025\n00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,400\nI don't know about that network.\n\n1026\n00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,960\nThat network is not in my\nrouting table I can't get there.\n\n1027\n00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,640\nIf I were to look and do a show IP route I\ncould see for myself that it's not there.\n\n1028\n00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,160\nThere's another way that\nwe could find that out.\n\n1029\n00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,110\nWe could do, show IP route and\nthen, we could punch it in.\n\n1030\n00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,510\nIf I just punch that in.\n\n1031\n00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,610\nThey'll tell me, network not on a table.\n\n1032\n00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,510\nThat's useful.\n\n1033\n00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,990\nRonnie and I were talking before the show.\n\n1034\n00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,520\nIf you're dealing with Internet routes,\n\n1035\n00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,610\nyou may have Hundreds\nof thousands of routes.\n\n1036\n00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,760\nSo the idea of just looking down\nthe table, that's not realistic.\n\n1037\n00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,910\nSo this little command is helpful.\n\n1038\n00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Show IP route followed by the specific\n\n1039\n00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,580\nnetwork or IP that you're looking for.\n\n1040\n00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,570\nYou can do that, and it will look and\nsee if it's in there and\n\n1041\n00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,670\nsee if it can find it.\n\n1042\n00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,910\n>> So this the same thing we were talking\nabout earlier with just a drawing,\n\n1043\n00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,650\nwhere what happens at this\npoint is that from our network\n\n1044\n00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,570\nwe just don't have a path\nto get to the destination.\n\n1045\n00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,322\nSo that's what we're taking a look\nat here, just inside of our router.\n\n1046\n00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:45,170\n>> So, we just need to tell\nit how to get there, right?\n\n1047\n00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,340\nAnd that's what I did in the drawing.\n\n1048\n00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,250\nThis red entry here was me saying, here's\nhow you can get to that network, and\n\n1049\n00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,980\nso I'll just put that back in right.\n\n1050\n00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,360\nAnd I know I can get there via\nrouter two's other address.\n\n1051\n00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,071\nI can get there via router two and\n\n1052\n00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:03,806\nhere's the IP address I\ncan contact router two on.\n\n1053\n00:56:03,806 --> 00:56:08,098\nSo I'll just get into\nthe configuration and\n\n1054\n00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:14,942\nsay IP route 209.251.133.0\ncuz we're doing a Class C.\n\n1055\n00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:15,462\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1056\n00:56:15,462 --> 00:56:16,123\n>> Right?\n\n1057\n00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,446\nAnd then I'll say how to get there.\n\n1058\n00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:21,303\nI can get there through router2,\n\n1059\n00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:25,429\nwhich is 51.17.33.43.\n\n1060\n00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:26,055\nAll right.\n\n1061\n00:56:26,055 --> 00:56:28,006\nAnd so I'll just punch that in.\n\n1062\n00:56:28,006 --> 00:56:33,390\nAnd now,\nif I take a look at my routing table.\n\n1063\n00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:39,018\nI have a route entry in there, for 209.251\nand notice how it's only on one line.\n\n1064\n00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:40,636\n>> Yep.\n>> And that's because 209-\n\n1065\n00:56:40,636 --> 00:56:41,638\n>> Yeah, it's a class C.\n\n1066\n00:56:41,638 --> 00:56:42,345\n>> It's, yeah.\n\n1067\n00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:45,606\nWe obeyed the rules, even if accidentally.\n\n1068\n00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:46,389\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n1069\n00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:48,808\nwhen we see this where it actually\ntells us where it's going to next.\n\n1070\n00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:52,131\n>> So, you actually see that next\ntop there is gonna send it over to\n\n1071\n00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:52,892\nthat router.\n\n1072\n00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:56,173\nNow, at this point, you might think,\nall right, we'll just ping.\n\n1073\n00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:57,348\nWe're perfectly fine.\n\n1074\n00:56:57,348 --> 00:56:58,224\n>> Sure.\n>> Let's give it a shot.\n\n1075\n00:56:58,224 --> 00:56:58,724\n>> Yeah.\n\n1076\n00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:03,976\nLet's see, who should I ping.\n\n1077\n00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:06,837\nI can try and ping, well let me try and\nping just the router itself.\n\n1078\n00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:07,890\n>> The interface, yep.\n\n1079\n00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:12,807\n>> So,\nif I ping 209.251.133.1 it's successful.\n\n1080\n00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:13,677\n>> Yeah.\n\n1081\n00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,930\n>> Now, why is that?\n\n1082\n00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:20,004\nBecause remember, in the picture\nI said hey we really need to have\n\n1083\n00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:24,030\ntwo-way routing, right, why did this work?\n\n1084\n00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:28,050\nWell, the reason it worked is the way\nthat pings work from a router.\n\n1085\n00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,940\nWhen you do a ping, a router has\nmore than one interface, right?\n\n1086\n00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:37,635\nSo, it has to pick a source IP, and the\nsource could be any of your interfaces.\n\n1087\n00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:40,012\nIt tries to pick the one\nclosest to your network.\n\n1088\n00:57:40,012 --> 00:57:40,628\n>> Yep.\n\n1089\n00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:45,051\n>> So, when it looked at router one and\nit said I'm about to ping router2,\n\n1090\n00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:47,891\nthe closes interface was\nthis one right here.\n\n1091\n00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:53,347\nSo the ping was sourced from 51.17.33.221.\n\n1092\n00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:57,176\nRouter2 has a route for that network.\n\n1093\n00:57:57,176 --> 00:57:59,137\nIt doesn't have a route for 172.19.\n\n1094\n00:57:59,137 --> 00:58:03,099\nSo, if that ping was sources from that IP,\nit wouldn't have worked.\n\n1095\n00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:07,126\n>> Now Don, if I don't have an actual\ncomputer plugged up to that,\n\n1096\n00:58:07,126 --> 00:58:09,225\nis there a way I can test that out.\n\n1097\n00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:10,850\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1098\n00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,500\nSo on a windows machine, you don't\nhave any control over your source.\n\n1099\n00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,900\nSee you just do a ping and that's it.\n\n1100\n00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,790\nAnd even like a Linux machine is\nlike that, but on a Cisco router,\n\n1101\n00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,770\nyou can manipulate the source\nof your ping, all right?\n\n1102\n00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,130\nAnd the way you do it is\nby repeating that ping, but\n\n1103\n00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:31,110\nthen you can continue on and you'll see\nI've got the option there for source.\n\n1104\n00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,120\nAnd that's where I can tell it,\nwhere to get the source address?\n\n1105\n00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,400\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to use\nthe source of my gigabit,\n\n1106\n00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,550\nactually I think it makes\nme type it all the way out.\n\n1107\n00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:46,500\nI'm gonna do the source based on gigabit\n0/0 and I've got this thing in the back of\n\n1108\n00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,230\nmy mind that tells me I'm supposed\nto type it all the way out, but\n\n1109\n00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,220\nlet's see if it'll does it works.\n\n1110\n00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,850\nAll right, it works with the abbreviation.\n\n1111\n00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,860\nThey're some commands where it\nwon't take the abbreviation, and\n\n1112\n00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,770\nI thought this was one but it's not.\n\n1113\n00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:02,450\nSo I'm trying to ping now, and notice how\nit says, packet sent with a source address\n\n1114\n00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:08,230\nof 172.19.1.1, that's my address for\nthis interface right here.\n\n1115\n00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,560\nAnd when I source it that way,\nI'm not able to get through.\n\n1116\n00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:19,810\nAnd that's because router 2 has no route\nfor 172.19.1, I need to give it one.\n\n1117\n00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,207\n>> Right.\n\n1118\n00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:24,509\n>> All right, so let's go fix that.\n\n1119\n00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:27,472\nI'm on a console cable,\nI guess I could remote.\n\n1120\n00:59:27,472 --> 00:59:28,474\nI'll just move the console cable.\n\n1121\n00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:33,218\nWe'll try not to get too complex here.\n\n1122\n00:59:33,218 --> 00:59:34,650\nThere we go.\n\n1123\n00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,754\nSo now, here I am on router2, and\n\n1124\n00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:40,467\nif I do a show IP route I can see\nthe routes that it knows about.\n\n1125\n00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:46,958\nIt knows about the 51.17.33, and\nit knows about the 209.251.133,\n\n1126\n00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,341\nit does not know about the 172.19.1.\n\n1127\n00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:55,457\n>> Right.\n>> So I'll just add a route in for\n\n1128\n00:59:55,457 --> 01:00:00,303\nthat 172.19.1.0.\n\n1129\n01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:03,679\nI tell it the network that\nI'm gonna inform it about,\n\n1130\n01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,292\nthe subnet mask and\nnow I need to tell it the destination.\n\n1131\n01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:15,470\nAnd let's see, it is 51.17.33.221.\n\n1132\n01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,029\nThat's the interface on route1\nthat I know I can connect to.\n\n1133\n01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:24,080\nSo I'm gonna give it that route and\nwhen I look at my routing table\n\n1134\n01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:29,804\nI can look in there and\nsure enough I see 172.19.1.0 is there.\n\n1135\n01:00:29,804 --> 01:00:34,974\nSo I see it, I could test it out.\n\n1136\n01:00:34,974 --> 01:00:36,464\nSo, I'll just test that out.\n\n1137\n01:00:36,464 --> 01:00:40,100\nSuccesses, right, so\nI'm getting to it that's a good sign.\n\n1138\n01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,142\nAnd I can jump back over to router one.\n\n1139\n01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:52,053\nAnd remember the ping over\nhere on router1 that failed?\n\n1140\n01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:54,430\nNow, I can try it again.\n\n1141\n01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:54,934\n>> And there you go.\n\n1142\n01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:56,261\n>> This time we get successes.\n\n1143\n01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,350\n>> Right.\nAll right?\n\n1144\n01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,953\nSo, reaching out from one system\nto another works out great, and\n\n1145\n01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,720\nnow we're in business.\n\n1146\n01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,960\nWhat we needed was a converged network,\nwe had to teach the routers about it,\n\n1147\n01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,890\nnow Ronnie you said it earlier,\nwith two routers?\n\n1148\n01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,120\nNot a big deal, with a thousand routers?\n\n1149\n01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,730\nBit of a problem.\n\n1150\n01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:19,610\nNow on the CCENT exam,\nyou really are dealing with just one or\n\n1151\n01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,600\ntwo routers,\neven in the simulations on the exam\n\n1152\n01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,180\nyou'll never really have more\nthan like three routers.\n\n1153\n01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:32,570\nSo, it's not a big thing using static\nroutes like this perfectly fine,\n\n1154\n01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,692\nbut in real life land we're really\ngona want this to be automatic.\n\n1155\n01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,450\nWe're gonna want the routers to\ntalk to each other to learn, so\n\n1156\n01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,280\nthat we don't have to do crazy amounts of\nmaintenance to keep all this in place.\n\n1157\n01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,638\n>> Now, when we talk about crazy amounts\nof information you might now think\n\n1158\n01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:47,949\n>> That changing one route would\n\n1159\n01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:48,970\naffect you.\n\n1160\n01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,515\nOn a 1000 routers, if all 1000\nrouters have to get to that one.\n\n1161\n01:01:52,515 --> 01:01:54,679\nIt may affect you, more than you realize.\n\n1162\n01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,006\nSo be careful.\n\n1163\n01:01:56,006 --> 01:01:58,556\n>> I work for\na bank out in Seattle Washington.\n\n1164\n01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:03,056\nAnd we had 90 bank branches\nspread across four states.\n\n1165\n01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:05,890\nAnd each branch had four networks.\n\n1166\n01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:11,722\nSo, four routes at each branch\ntimes 90 branches is, what is that?\n\n1167\n01:02:11,722 --> 01:02:12,511\n>> 360.\n\n1168\n01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,004\n>> 360 routes right.\n\n1169\n01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:16,178\nSo 360 routes at each branch.\n\n1170\n01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:22,304\nStack on top of that that each branch\nhad a dsl line and a t1, a point t1.\n\n1171\n01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:26,544\nSo, you had two routes to each to\nget to these four networks, so\n\n1172\n01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:28,920\nyou really had 720 routes.\n\n1173\n01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,480\nThat's a lot of routes and\n\n1174\n01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,350\nif those were all static,\nboy you'd be entering in a ton of routes.\n\n1175\n01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:40,690\nSo you try and find anything, that you\ncan to make the process more streamlined,\n\n1176\n01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,880\nmore efficient.\n\n1177\n01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,560\nIf you could summarize routes you do it.\n\n1178\n01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,730\nIf you can use dynamic routing protocols,\nyou do it.\n\n1179\n01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:51,010\nWhatever you can to make that traffic,\neasier to maintain,\n\n1180\n01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,310\neasier to support, and\nmore stable for the end user.\n\n1181\n01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,150\n>> Right.\n>> All right, well Ronnie,\n\n1182\n01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,620\nI'm somewhat tapped out on knowledge for\nstatic routes.\n\n1183\n01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:05,470\nThe logical next step is to jump\ninto dynamic routes, and the CCNT,\n\n1184\n01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:10,050\nif any of you guys study the older\nmaterials before Cisco updated this year.\n\n1185\n01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,470\nIn the older materials,\nthis is where we would jump into RIP,\n\n1186\n01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,380\nthe routing information protocol.\n\n1187\n01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,770\nThey bumped that off the exam and replaced\nit with OSPF, which is a great protocol,\n\n1188\n01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:22,412\nit's the most popular\ndynamic routing protocol.\n\n1189\n01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:23,920\nIt's gonna take a lot more time,\n\n1190\n01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,240\nthan we have on this show to\nbe able to dive into that.\n\n1191\n01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,010\nSo, this is a pretty good spot\nto wrap up for us for the day.\n\n1192\n01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,490\nAnd what we'll do is,\nin our next episode, which,\n\n1193\n01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:34,830\nwhen's our next Cisco episode, Ronnie?\n\n1194\n01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,730\nIs it Friday?\n\n1195\n01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,640\n>> It was Monday.\n\n1196\n01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,335\n>> Monday, okay.\n\n1197\n01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:40,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> So tune back in on Monday, and\n\n1198\n01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,160\nwe're gonna dive into the wonderful world\nof OSPF, and get to see dynamic routing,\n\n1199\n01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,620\nwhich is awesome.\n\n1200\n01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,840\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n1201\n01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,190\nAnd you'll get a chance to see complex\nnetworks, and how they can become so\n\n1202\n01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,780\nmuch more easy for us, when they're\nconfigured with a dynamic protocol.\n\n1203\n01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,880\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1204\n01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,070\n>> All right, well [COUGH] as always,\nwe hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1205\n01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,750\nKeep in mind if you have any questions,\nanything we didn't answer on the show,\n\n1206\n01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,200\nmake sure you jump on over\nto

if that's the track that you're on,\ndefinitely tune in on Monday.\n\n1227\n01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:47,760\n>> Right.\n>> And we will see you guys then.\n\n1228\n01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,843\nYou got anything else for us Ronnie?\n\n1229\n01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,099\n>> No, I'm trying to cover all the bases.\n\n1230\n01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:53,092\n>> I think we got it,\nalright signing out for

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening..\n\n5\n00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:37,703\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,501\ncoming at you live from\nbeautiful Gainesville, Florida.\n\n7\n00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:45,540\nI am your host, Don Pezet,\naccompanied by, well nobody.\n\n8\n00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,380\nWe're doing a short episode today,\nin the last Cisco episode,\n\n9\n00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,070\nwe started to cover things like Routing.\n\n10\n00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,450\nWe show the routing process and so on.\n\n11\n00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,960\nThe next episode is supposed to\nbe us diving right into OSPF,\n\n12\n00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920\nOpen Shortest Path First, or whatever.\n\n13\n00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,730\nI shouldn't say whatever,\n\n14\n00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,330\nit's the most popular interior\nrouting protocol in the world.\n\n15\n00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,810\nBut before we did that show I realized\njust kind of looking through my notes\n\n16\n00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,610\nthere were a couple of things\nwe really needed to talk about\n\n17\n00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,940\nbefore we dived right into\na dynamic routing protocol.\n\n18\n00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,620\nA couple of things kind of went unsaid.\n\n19\n00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,300\nSo I wanted to film a special, right?\n\n20\n00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,620\nThis is a one hour special season premier\nending whatever I don't know or something.\n\n21\n00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,600\nAnd like the little little\nclaps in the background.\n\n22\n00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,760\nBut just a little special to be\nable to cover some of those topics\n\n23\n00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,140\nthat are important.\n\n24\n00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,800\nJust to help us understand exactly\nhow these routing protocols work.\n\n25\n00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,470\nAll right.\n\n26\n00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,550\nSo in the last episode, we really\nonly saw one way to route things.\n\n27\n00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,630\nAnd that was with Static route, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,610\nI fired up a router our trusty\n2800 in the background here and\n\n29\n00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,850\nI manually put a route in place.\n\n30\n00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,020\nSo lets, lets review that real quick and\n\n31\n00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,000\nthen we'll kind of talk\nabout the alternative.\n\n32\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,770\nSo actually here,\nI'll just pull up that router again,\n\n33\n00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,140\nwhich a smarter me would have\ndone before the show went live.\n\n34\n00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,050\nBut I'll pull it up now,\n\n35\n00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,508\nsee if I can guess mine,\nI'll play guess the com port number.\n\n36\n00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,506\nAnd we have a winner,\n\n37\n00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,950\nall right.\n\n38\n00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,710\nWhen a router boots up,\nit looks at its interfaces and it says,\n\n39\n00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,335\n\"Okay, I've a couple of interfaces.\" and\nas long as those interfaces are up\n\n40\n00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:32,095\nit adds their routes to the routing table\nand that's what we saw last episode.\n\n41\n00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,100\nSo if I use a command,\n\n42\n00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,976\nthis is really of all the Cisco\ncommands this is my most favorite.\n\n43\n00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:42,980\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n44\n00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,710\nI use this command anytime I sit\ndown on a new piece of equipment or\n\n45\n00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,700\na piece of equipment I\nhaven't worked with recently.\n\n46\n00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,050\nBecause it gives me the summary\nof all the interfaces.\n\n47\n00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,540\nIt tells me their IP addresses if they\nhave one and it tells me if they're up or\n\n48\n00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940\ndown, so it's real useful stuff and\n\n49\n00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,610\nevery time I sit down at equipment it's\none of the first commands that I run.\n\n50\n00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,960\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n51\n00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,680\nAnd when I run that,\nI can see this router has four interfaces,\n\n52\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,268\ntwo of which are down so I'm going to\nignore those, but two of which are up.\n\n53\n00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:19,680\nOne is 172.19.1.1 and\nthe other is 51.17.33.221, all right.\n\n54\n00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,350\nWhen I fire up my router,\nit sees these two interfaces,\n\n55\n00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,870\nand those two interfaces\nare directly connected.\n\n56\n00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,100\nAnd so routes get added to the routing\ntables directly connected.\n\n57\n00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,420\nWe saw that in the last episode.\n\n58\n00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,190\nTo see the routing table,\nwe can do show IP route.\n\n59\n00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,960\nAnd if you run it just like that,\nit shows you the whole routing table.\n\n60\n00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,860\nBut you can actually add on to that\ncommand to filter what you're seeing.\n\n61\n00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,940\nAnd so, I'm going to add on\nto it the word connected.\n\n62\n00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,788\nShow IP route connected.\n\n63\n00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:55,870\nThat's going to give me my routing table\nand just show the directly related routes.\n\n64\n00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,350\nSo, I can see these two routes\nthey're directly connected,\n\n65\n00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,280\nthey're part of the routing table,\nI didn't have to enter those in.\n\n66\n00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,540\nThat happens automatically.\n\n67\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,280\nThe routing that we showed you\nlast episode was this as well as\n\n68\n00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,400\na static route, and a static route is\nwhere we teach the router a route.\n\n69\n00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,940\nWe tell it how to get somewhere, right?\n\n70\n00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,380\nAnd I use the IP route command to do that.\n\n71\n00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,340\nAnd so if I do a show IP route,\n\n72\n00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,060\nI can see that static route right there\nthat we put in in the last episode.\n\n73\n00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,680\nAll right?\n\n74\n00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,280\nAnd if I do a show run and I filter it.\n\n75\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,210\nFor the IP route command.\n\n76\n00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,650\nI can find a command we used.\n\n77\n00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,750\nHere it is.\n\n78\n00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,390\nSo here's that command we\nused to put that route in.\n\n79\n00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,780\nWe said IP route and then the network and\n\n80\n00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,000\nthe subnet mask for the network\nthat we're teaching the router.\n\n81\n00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,900\nAnd then how to get there.\n\n82\n00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,340\nHere's the destination IP or\nhow to get to that network.\n\n83\n00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,590\nRight here.\n\n84\n00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,790\nOkay, so pretty simple command.\n\n85\n00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,950\nBut the comment we left you guys hanging\nwith at the end of the episode was how\n\n86\n00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,260\nwhile this works, if you've got one or\nfive devices its a great solution.\n\n87\n00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,580\nBut what if you have 100 or\n1000 routers, right?\n\n88\n00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,540\nHaving to go and enter in static\nroutes in all 1000 routers,\n\n89\n00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,476\nthat's going to take a lot of time.\n\n90\n00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,440\nSo,static routes like\nthis,while they're viable,\n\n91\n00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,170\nwhile they do work, they're not ideal.\n\n92\n00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,290\nSo, we need some kind\nof other solution and\n\n93\n00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,425\nthat's where dynamic routing\nprotocols like OSPF come in.\n\n94\n00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,810\nCIsco doesn't change this to the exam,\nso the exam for\n\n95\n00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,030\nthe CCENT is now the 100-101 exam.\n\n96\n00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,690\nIt used to be that was 640-801 or\nwhatever the old number was.\n\n97\n00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,010\nBut now it's 100-101 and\n\n98\n00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,350\nwhen they did that they started\nmoving around some of the topics.\n\n99\n00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,120\nSome topics got moved to the second\nexam versus the first one.\n\n100\n00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,010\nThey really put a lot less emphasis on\n\n101\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,720\nmultiple routing protocols instead\nof focusing primarily on OSPF alone.\n\n102\n00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,710\nNow, that's fine for the CCENT,\nOSPF is the protocol that you're going to\n\n103\n00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,820\nencounter in the real world the most\noften, so it kind of works out.\n\n104\n00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,100\nBut I want a little more generally for a\nmoment, just to make sure that everybody,\n\n105\n00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,480\nall you guys out there in TV land\nhave a good understanding of exactly\n\n106\n00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,470\nwhat these protocols are and\nwhat's the variation between them.\n\n107\n00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,230\nNow when we do a static, we are teaching\nthe router how to get there.\n\n108\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,460\nAnd we're doing it by hand,\nso it's not ideal.\n\n109\n00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,650\nYou never want to have to go in and\nteach a computer how to do things.\n\n110\n00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,210\nWouldn't it be better if instead, the\nrouters could just learn from each other.\n\n111\n00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,220\nIf I have two routers come up,\n\n112\n00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,240\nthat they could talk to each other,\nlearn the routes that they have.\n\n113\n00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,600\nAnd make it where I don't have\nto manually put them in there.\n\n114\n00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,350\nThat's what a dynamic\nrouting protocol does.\n\n115\n00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,760\nA static protocol is where we\ntell the router how to get there.\n\n116\n00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,470\nA dynamic protocol is where\nthe routers learn from each other.\n\n117\n00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,370\nThe cool thing about a dynamic protocol,\n\n118\n00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,130\nnot only are they learning\nthe routes from each other,\n\n119\n00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,890\nif they learn more than one route to\nthe same place the dynamic routing\n\n120\n00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,470\nprotocols will actually make a decision\nover which route is better than the other.\n\n121\n00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,400\nThey'll figure it out for us and\n\n122\n00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,690\nthat's where the real value of\na dynamic routing protocol comes in.\n\n123\n00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,060\nIs it,\nthey make some real intelligent decisions.\n\n124\n00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,480\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n125\n00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,900\nSo that's what I want to talk about, I\nwant to take a look at some of those, and\n\n126\n00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,290\nmake sure that we've got a good\nunderstanding of all that.\n\n127\n00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,900\nAll right, so let's take a look here, I've\ngot a little drawing that I brought up.\n\n128\n00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,250\nThis guy right here.\n\n129\n00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,750\nAll right.\n\n130\n00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,240\nI've got two networks the 192.168.0\nnetwork over here on the left,\n\n131\n00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,900\nand the 172.16 over here on the right.\n\n132\n00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,930\nAnd they're connected to\nsome various routers, right?\n\n133\n00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,950\nRouter 1, directly plugged into 192 2168\nRouter two directly plugged into 172.16.\n\n134\n00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,830\nRouter 3 not directly\nplugged into any of those.\n\n135\n00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,552\nRight?\n\n136\n00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,764\nSo, when these routers fire up,\n\n137\n00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:59,404\nrouter 1 already knows about\nthis network over here.\n\n138\n00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:02,352\nRouter two already knows\nabout this network over here.\n\n139\n00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:07,899\nBut if I want router two to be able\nto get all the way over to 192.168 or\n\n140\n00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,302\nif I want router one to get\nall the way over to 172.16,\n\n141\n00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:16,330\nI'm gonna have to put static routes in for\nthat.\n\n142\n00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,700\nSo, I'm going to have to go and\n\n143\n00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,570\nupdate my routers to teach\nthem about these networks.\n\n144\n00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,430\nAnd with the static,\njust to review static one more time, I\n\n145\n00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,546\nwould have to take 172.16 and I would\nhave to manually add it to router 1,\n\n146\n00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,840\nand I would have to manually\nadd it to router 3.\n\n147\n00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,540\nAnd then I would need to take 192.168.0,\nand\n\n148\n00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,130\nmanually add it to router 2 and\nmanually add it to router 3.\n\n149\n00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,940\nAnd every time I added another new\nnetwork, I would have to go and\n\n150\n00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,662\nmanually add it to these routers.\n\n151\n00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,270\nAll right, the other thing to think about,\nthough, is that there is really\n\n152\n00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,130\nis that three is really more than one way\nto get between these networks, right?\n\n153\n00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,290\nSo, for example, let me, let me just\nundo all of my crazy lines there.\n\n154\n00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,785\nFor example, if router 2 wants\nto get to the 168.1.0 network,\n\n155\n00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:13,320\nit can go through router 1 and\nover to that network.\n\n156\n00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,410\nBut it could also go through router\nthree over to router one and\n\n157\n00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,240\nto that other network.\n\n158\n00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,460\nRight, so it's got two different ways,\n\n159\n00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,990\ntwo different paths to\nget to that destination.\n\n160\n00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,600\nNow you might ask yourself, why would it\never want to go through router 3, right?\n\n161\n00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440\nWell, most of the time it\nprobably wouldn't, right,\n\n162\n00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,810\nit's an extra leg in the journey,\nwhy do that?\n\n163\n00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,890\nBut what if there was a failure,\n\n164\n00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,350\nwhat if something happened\nwhere this link right here,\n\n165\n00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,540\nthe link that runs through router 2 to\nrouter 1, what if that link went offline?\n\n166\n00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,260\nWhat if it failed?\n\n167\n00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,760\nIt's nice that router 2 has a backup,\nas a backup\n\n168\n00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,090\nplan it can go through router 3 over to\nrouter 1, and on over to that network.\n\n169\n00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,530\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n170\n00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,240\nIf we're doing static routes,\nI would have to manually go in and\n\n171\n00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,860\ntell it which route to prefer\nto get to which destination.\n\n172\n00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,810\nThat's where things start to get tricky.\n\n173\n00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,940\nAnd if we're doing it by hand,\nit requires a lot of thought.\n\n174\n00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,510\nBy default, In a Cisco router, if we have\ntwo routers to the same destination,\n\n175\n00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,610\nthey both go in the routing table.\n\n176\n00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,250\nAnd they get load balanced across.\n\n177\n00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,870\nWe balance across them.\n\n178\n00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,950\nThat's not what we want in the event\nthat one path is better than the other.\n\n179\n00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,720\nSo we have something called a metric.\n\n180\n00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,830\nAnd a metric is a number that identifies\nwhich path we prefer over another one.\n\n181\n00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,430\nOkay?\n\n182\n00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,270\nSo for example,\nlet's take our topology here,\n\n183\n00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,535\nand let me get rid of our failure,\nhide our failure.\n\n184\n00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:51,250\n[LAUGH] So, let me say, say that\nthe red link, maybe I give that a,\n\n185\n00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:58,410\na metric of 10 Like that, all right,\n\n186\n00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,940\nand I take that green link and I give\nthe green link a metric of 20, all right.\n\n187\n00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,260\nBy doing that,\nI'm defining the preference,\n\n188\n00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,810\nthe link that I prefer over the other one.\n\n189\n00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,040\nI didn't match that green at all,\nbut anyhow, ten versus 20.\n\n190\n00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,870\nSo when router two tries to\nfigure out which one to use.\n\n191\n00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,900\nIt says, okay.\nWell, I could go through router one, or\n\n192\n00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,840\nI could go roundabout\nthrough router three.\n\n193\n00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,260\nWhich one do I want?\n\n194\n00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,820\nIt's gonna pick the one with\nthe lowest metric number.\n\n195\n00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,550\nNow, remember that for the exam,\n'cuz it does get confusing.\n\n196\n00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,390\nThe lowest metric number.\n\n197\n00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,490\nThe way I remember this.\n\n198\n00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,260\nIt's like running a race.\n\n199\n00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,780\nIn a race first place is the winner,\n100th place is not so good.\n\n200\n00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,750\nThat's how metrics are.\n\n201\n00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,850\nMetrics are like running a race.\n\n202\n00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,420\nThe lower number is the better.\n\n203\n00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,415\nYou want to be number one, all right.\n\n204\n00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,275\nNumber one is the winner,\nthat's the one you want.\n\n205\n00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:54,395\nIf you're number 100, well,\nyou're probably in last place or far back.\n\n206\n00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,665\nSo that's kind of how these metrics work\nand router 2 is gonna look at it and\n\n207\n00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:01,755\nit's gonna say, well tenth place\nis better than 20th place so\n\n208\n00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,995\nI'm gonna go through router 1 and\nthat the way I want it.\n\n209\n00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:09,880\nBut if the link to router one fails,\nif it goes offline.\n\n210\n00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,500\nIt says, well 20th place is better\nthan nothing, so I'll go that way and\n\n211\n00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,380\nthere's our other path all right.\n\n212\n00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,160\nSo if I wanted to create this topology,\nnow things get a lot more complex okay.\n\n213\n00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,910\nLet's count all the static routes that\nwe would have to put in to setup this\n\n214\n00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,880\nenvironment right here.\n\n215\n00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,950\nLet me get rid of all this\nextra stuff on my diagram.\n\n216\n00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,610\nThere we go.\nAll right, so, whoops,\n\n217\n00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,970\nif we think about all of the various\nstatic routes, all right.\n\n218\n00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,000\nFirst off, router 3 is not\ndirectly connected to anybody.\n\n219\n00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,660\nOkay.\n\n220\n00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,290\nSo on router three I would\nhave to add one static route\n\n221\n00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,480\nteaching it how to get to 192.168.\n\n222\n00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,460\nI would have to give it another\nstatic route teaching it the second\n\n223\n00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,450\npath to 192.168.\n\n224\n00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,210\nI would then have to give it a static\nroute telling it how to get to 172.16,\n\n225\n00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:10,028\nas well as another static route telling\nit the other path to get to 172.16.\n\n226\n00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,810\nI would have to add four static routes\nto accommodate the different scenarios\n\n227\n00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,418\nthat are right there.\n\n228\n00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,880\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,710\nOn router 1, it already knows how\nto get to 192.168.0.0, so on it,\n\n230\n00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,400\nI would have to add a static route\nof how to get to 172.16, and\n\n231\n00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,800\na second route to teach it the alternate\npath to that same network.\n\n232\n00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,980\nAnd then on router 2, same basic thing.\n\n233\n00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,760\nI gotta do one route to 192.168,\nand another route for\n\n234\n00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,380\nit's alternate path, I'm kinda running\nout of room here, to get to it.\n\n235\n00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,110\nSo to set up this topology with just\nthree routers, it would take me,\n\n236\n00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,550\nwhat is that seven static routes?\n\n237\n00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,250\nLet's see, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\n238\n00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,070\nEight static routes [COUGH] to be\nable to have a converged network\n\n239\n00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,240\nwhere everybody knew all the paths\nto get to the destination and\n\n240\n00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,050\nthat's not even counting the fact\nthat I then have to set my metrics.\n\n241\n00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,369\nI have to set preferences for these.\n\n242\n00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,090\nNow, let me show you an example of that.\n\n243\n00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,280\nI'm gonna go back into my router.\n\n244\n00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,110\nLet me pull that one up.\n\n245\n00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,370\nLet me just remove this route that\nwe put in, in the last episode.\n\n246\n00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,245\nLet me just get that one out of there.\n\n247\n00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,450\nOkay.\n\n248\n00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,280\nWhen you put in a route, that metric\nvalue is automatically assigned.\n\n249\n00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,170\nIn fact,\nif I put that route right back in.\n\n250\n00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,290\nI know, I just took it out,\nbut let me put it back in.\n\n251\n00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:35,710\nIf I put that route back in, and I look\nat it, here's the route that I put in.\n\n252\n00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,540\nAnd there's this number,\nright here in square brackets.\n\n253\n00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,780\nSee that 1/0.\n\n254\n00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,450\nThat first number is what's called\nyour administrative distance.\n\n255\n00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,660\nAnd the second number is your metric.\n\n256\n00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,160\nWith the static route,\nthe metric is always zero, or\n\n257\n00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,550\nat least by default it's a zero.\n\n258\n00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,880\nThe administrative distance of\nthat first number is a one.\n\n259\n00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,620\nLet me hold off on that administrative\ndistance, I do want to talk about that,\n\n260\n00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,010\nbut let me make my other points here\nfirst and we'll come back to that.\n\n261\n00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,590\nBut that metric is just a zero right now,\nthat's what it's assigned to.\n\n262\n00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,430\nMy directly connected routes,\n\n263\n00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,640\nthese guys, notice how they don't\nhave a number at all, all right?\n\n264\n00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,600\nDirectly connected routes\nhave a metric of zero.\n\n265\n00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200\nZero, that's the most preferred,\nthat's the one that they're gonna use.\n\n266\n00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,470\nAnd that means that they always win.\n\n267\n00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,670\nIt's very difficult to override and\ndirectly connect the route because,\n\n268\n00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,630\nhow can you have a better route than\nsomething you're directly plugged into.\n\n269\n00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,030\nBut all the other stuff, the static, the\ndynamic stuff, that's where we set it up.\n\n270\n00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,310\nWe plug into the system,\nso that we can override.\n\n271\n00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,610\nNow let me take that route back out.\n\n272\n00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,840\nAnd I'm gonna add that route again,\nbut this time,\n\n273\n00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,080\nI'm gonna add one extra\nnumber to that command.\n\n274\n00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,360\nIf you do question mark,\nyou'll see where you can do it.\n\n275\n00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,130\nRight here, the distance metric for\nthis route.\n\n276\n00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,413\nI'm gonna stick the number ten on it.\n\n277\n00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:05,090\nNow, I've got that route and\nI've set its metric to a ten.\n\n278\n00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,211\nAnd if I look at my table,\nsee how that one became a ten?\n\n279\n00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:13,660\nIt's modified that administrative\ndistance, the metric in this case for\n\n280\n00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,444\nthe static.\n\n281\n00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:17,340\nIt's modified it to become a ten.\n\n282\n00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,030\nBy doing this, I can cause it to\nprefer one route over another.\n\n283\n00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,680\nNow, it's hard to see it here\ncuz I've only got one route.\n\n284\n00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,770\nLet me add another one.\n\n285\n00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,790\nI will add another route,\n\n286\n00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,080\nmaybe there's another router on\nthat network that I can get too.\n\n287\n00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,780\nMaybe I got two routers for redundancy and\nso I'll add a second route.\n\n288\n00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,430\nThe first one went to\na router that ended at .43.\n\n289\n00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,370\nThis one, I'll just add .42, right?\n\n290\n00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,954\nSo there will be another router at .42\nthat I can go through to get there.\n\n291\n00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:44,640\nAll right.\n\n292\n00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,416\nNow when I take a look\nat my routing table,\n\n293\n00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:50,580\nsee how I've got two entries now for\nthat static route?\n\n294\n00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,448\nSo I've got one via the router that\nends in .43, and another that ends in\n\n295\n00:16:55,448 --> 00:17:00,840\nthe router that ends in .42, they both\nhave a metric of ten, so they're a tie.\n\n296\n00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,920\nAnd when there's a tie, they both\nmake it in the routing table, and\n\n297\n00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,720\nnow the router starts to load balance.\n\n298\n00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,950\nIt'll send half my traffic over one line,\nand half my traffic over the other line.\n\n299\n00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,720\nLoad balancing.\n\n300\n00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,380\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,930\nBut if that's not what I want.\n\n302\n00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,080\nIf the route through 43\nis my preferred route and\n\n303\n00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,320\nthe route through 42 is my backup, all I\nhave to do is take the route through 43.\n\n304\n00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,860\nSo I'm just gonna go and find that\ncommand right here that I put in.\n\n305\n00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,240\nAnd instead of a metric of ten,\nI'm gonna lower it to a metric of five.\n\n306\n00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,580\nAll right?\n\n307\n00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,310\nBy lowering it to five, the second\nroute has a ten, this one has a five.\n\n308\n00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,800\nThe five will be preferred.\n\n309\n00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,185\nAnd this is the one that will\nmake it into the routing table.\n\n310\n00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:49,831\nOkay?\nAnd so, oops, there we go.\n\n311\n00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:56,420\nSo once I do that, if I take a look at\nmy routing table, what is going on here?\n\n312\n00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,280\nApparently I've done\nsomething to my screen.\n\n313\n00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,901\nSo once it does that,\nnow I can look at my routing table and\n\n314\n00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,705\nsee that there's only one entry,\nthe entry through five.\n\n315\n00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:12,950\nOkay?\nNow, I did these mapped on an IP address,\n\n316\n00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,800\nso it's hard for\nme to show a failure here.\n\n317\n00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,450\nTo show what happens during\na failure situation, but\n\n318\n00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,790\nlet me show you what happens\nwith some different routes.\n\n319\n00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,400\nI'll do a route to\na very specific network.\n\n320\n00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,770\nOr you know what, I'll just,\nthe whole class A.\n\n321\n00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,430\nWe'll go crazy on this one.\n\n322\n00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,160\nSo I'm going to route the entire 1.0 Class\nA, I'm going to route that whole thing,\n\n323\n00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,710\nout my interface gi0/0.\n\n324\n00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,420\nAll right.\n\n325\n00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,120\nAnd I'm gonna give it a metric of five.\n\n326\n00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,830\nAll right.\n\n327\n00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,620\nI'm gonna add another route\nthat says I can get there on my\n\n328\n00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,760\nother interface with a metric of ten.\n\n329\n00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,840\nAll right, now,\nthese aren't valid routes, right.\n\n330\n00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,310\nCuz I'm just throwing\nthem out on interface and\n\n331\n00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,960\nit's a multi access interface anyways.\n\n332\n00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,700\nSo it's not gonna work.\n\n333\n00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,920\nBut I'm doing this just to show\nguys a quick example of failure.\n\n334\n00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,530\nI've got two routes.\n\n335\n00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,420\nThe route with a metric of\nfive should be preferred.\n\n336\n00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,180\nSo if I do a show IP route, I should just\nsee the entry with a metric of five.\n\n337\n00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,400\nI mapped it to an interface and so\n\n338\n00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,480\nit's showing us static and the statics\ndon't show their metric by default.\n\n339\n00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480\nBut see how I've only got the one entry?\n\n340\n00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,230\nI don't have the one through gi0/1.\n\n341\n00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,820\nIt's hidden because it has\na less preferred metric, right.\n\n342\n00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,800\nIf my gi0/0 interface were\nto go offline though.\n\n343\n00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,660\nIf I were to shut it down,\nthat route is no longer valid and\n\n344\n00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,630\nthe other route should take over.\n\n345\n00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,340\nAnd so if I do a show IP route now,\n\n346\n00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,760\nI still have a route to 1.0.0.0 except\nit's on the other interface now.\n\n347\n00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,270\nIt's on gi0/1.\n\n348\n00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,370\nIt just failed over to the other\ninterface to find another way out there.\n\n349\n00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,060\nRight.\n\n350\n00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,770\nWell that required a lot of thought,\ndidn't it?\n\n351\n00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,440\nI had to put two routes in,\nI had to adjust their metrics.\n\n352\n00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,870\nI had to do a lot of stuff\nto get that in place.\n\n353\n00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,130\nWith static routes,\nthat's what you have to do.\n\n354\n00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,200\nIt's time consuming, it's a pain, it\nreally does take a lot of work to do it.\n\n355\n00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,790\nWith dynamic routes,\nyour router would just learn this stuff.\n\n356\n00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,050\nIt would learn it, you wouldn't have\nto set it up yourself, you would figure\n\n357\n00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,445\nit out and get it added in to the system\nand it would all be done automatically and\n\n358\n00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,240\nthat's the real power of\na dynamic routing protocol.\n\n359\n00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360\nReally powerful.\n\n360\n00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,190\nSo, in our next episode,\nwe're gonna teach you OSPF, right?\n\n361\n00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,390\nOpen Shortest Path First,\nits the most popular routing protocol for\n\n362\n00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,470\nprivate businesses in the entire world,\nand so you're gonna get a chance to see\n\n363\n00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,090\nhow to set that up, and how it works and\nall the little bells and whistles with it.\n\n364\n00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,100\nAll right.\n\n365\n00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,440\nBut before we dive into OSPF I\n\n366\n00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,470\nwanted to make sure that everybody had\na good understanding of this, right?\n\n367\n00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,340\nOf the idea of the metrics and\nhow they work as well as\n\n368\n00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,388\nsome of the different types of dynamic\nrouting protocols that are out there.\n\n369\n00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,541\nAll right.\n\n370\n00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,830\nPrimarily we need to concern ourselves\nwith two types of routing protocols.\n\n371\n00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,880\nThere's what are called distance\nvector routing protocols and\n\n372\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,860\nthere's link state protocols.\n\n373\n00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,930\nAll right, let me go back to my drawing\nand we'll highlight some of these.\n\n374\n00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,590\nAll right let me, actually let me\nget rid of my spaghetti mess here.\n\n375\n00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,730\nOkay, so\n\n376\n00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,830\nthe first one I want to talk about is\nwhat's called a Distance Vector Protocol.\n\n377\n00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,390\nA Distance Vector Protocol has all of\nour routers talk to each other and\n\n378\n00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,770\nexchange routing information, right?\n\n379\n00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,980\nThey exchange routing\ninformation with each other, and\n\n380\n00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,280\nthen they make a decision on which way\nis the best based on one thing and\n\n381\n00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,250\none thing alone, and\nit's called the hop count.\n\n382\n00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,120\nThe hop count is how many routers\nwe have to pass through on our\n\n383\n00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,780\nway to a destination.\n\n384\n00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,730\nSo, for a distance vector,\nlet me write this up here so\n\n385\n00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,330\nwe don't forget what we're talking about.\n\n386\n00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,240\nDistance Vector Protocols,\nif I can spell it.\n\n387\n00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,680\nThere we go.\n\n388\n00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,070\nDistance Vector Protocols\njust care about hop count.\n\n389\n00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,140\nThat's their only concern.\n\n390\n00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,550\nSo if I'm on a computer, and\n\n391\n00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,500\nI'm over here at 192.168.0 and\nI need to get to 172.16.0.\n\n392\n00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,250\nAll right?\n\n393\n00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,650\nI'm gonna go to my default gateway,\nand my default gateway is router one.\n\n394\n00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,970\nRouter one then has to make a choice.\n\n395\n00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,913\nRouter one says hey,\nI need to get you over to 172.16.\n\n396\n00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:36,040\nI've got two paths.\n\n397\n00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,460\nWhich one do I prefer?\n\n398\n00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,960\nWell a distance vector protocol,\nit just looks at hop count.\n\n399\n00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,160\nSo it says all right,\nwell I've got one choice.\n\n400\n00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,192\nOne choice is I could go through router\ntwo and then to the destination.\n\n401\n00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:50,610\nAll right?\n\n402\n00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,220\nRouter one has to pass through one router,\nrouter two, to get to the destination.\n\n403\n00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,715\nThat's one hop.\n\n404\n00:22:57,715 --> 00:22:59,980\nRight?\nSo we're hopping from router one,\n\n405\n00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,530\nhop to router two and\nthen the destination.\n\n406\n00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,370\nThat last hop doesn't really count.\n\n407\n00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,330\nSo we get one hop between router one and\nthat destination.\n\n408\n00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,310\nThere's also another choice though.\n\n409\n00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,820\nRouter one could send us\ndown to router three and\n\n410\n00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,090\nthen over to router two and\nthen over to the destination.\n\n411\n00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,380\nIn this scenario router\none hops to router three.\n\n412\n00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,950\nHops to router two and\nthen to the destination.\n\n413\n00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,260\nThat's two hops, right.\n\n414\n00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,010\nSo the blue path versus the green path,\n\n415\n00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,250\nwe've got the green path at two hops.\n\n416\n00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,930\nAnd the blue path, whoops.\n\n417\n00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,800\nThe blue path at one hop, right?\n\n418\n00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,960\nSo when we go to make this decision,\nit's pretty easy, right?\n\n419\n00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,135\nBasically the distance vector protocol\nwill look at this, and it'll say well, I\n\n420\n00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:55,208\ncould go on the blue path for one hop, the\ngreen path is twice as long at two hops.\n\n421\n00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,242\nI don't want to go that way.\n\n422\n00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:56,786\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,609\nSo it's going to send us on the blue path.\n\n424\n00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,457\nAnd so our original PC that's reaching\nout It's gonna go, just like that,\n\n425\n00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,286\nand get to our destination.\n\n426\n00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:12,850\nThat is how a distance vector protocol\nworks, it just looks at hop count.\n\n427\n00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,130\nSo, let me add that to the note here.\n\n428\n00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,900\nDistance Vector Protocols.\n\n429\n00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,730\nRely on Hop Count, right.\n\n430\n00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,119\nHop count is all they care about,\nthat's all they want, and\n\n431\n00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,720\nthat's what they need to get from\npoint a to point b, all right.\n\n432\n00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,760\nNow, the way they learn the hop\ncount is pretty straightforward.\n\n433\n00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,620\nRouter 2 is connected to 172.16.00,\nso it is zero hops away.\n\n434\n00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,640\nIt's right there, it's directly connected.\n\n435\n00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,180\nSo, router 2 then tells router 1,\nand it tells router 3.\n\n436\n00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,200\nLet me clean up my arrows again.\n\n437\n00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,620\nLet me make some messy stuff, here.\n\n438\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,980\nSo, router 2 starts to\ntalk to the other routers.\n\n439\n00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,800\nIt's teaching them about the network,\nall right.\n\n440\n00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,908\nSo, router 2 builds up a routing\nannouncement, and it says, hey, router 3,\n\n441\n00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:12,810\nwhoops, I'll just move everything\naround in this diagram that's my goal.\n\n442\n00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,473\nSo, router 2 tells router 3,\nit says, hey, router 3,\n\n443\n00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:23,970\nI know about 172.16.0.0/16,\ndo you know about it?\n\n444\n00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,094\nAnd router 3 says, oh, no, I don't know\nabout it, so let me add that to my routing\n\n445\n00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:34,470\ntable, and it says, okay, well, router 2,\nhow far away are you from that network?\n\n446\n00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,020\nAnd router 2 says, far away?\n\n447\n00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,110\nI'm directly connected, I'm zero, baby.\n\n448\n00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,730\nThat's the best you can get.\n\n449\n00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,430\nAnd so router 3 says, wow, that is\nawesome, that's a really good connection.\n\n450\n00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,560\nYou're zero hops away, so I'm gonna\nadd that to my routing table, but\n\n451\n00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,910\nI need to go through you,\nand you are zero hops away.\n\n452\n00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,700\nIf I go through you,\nthat means I'm one hop away.\n\n453\n00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,346\nSo, when router 3 adds 172.16.0.0\nto it's routing table,\n\n454\n00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:02,220\nit adds it as 1 hop away, all right.\n\n455\n00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,640\nMeanwhile router 2 is doing the same\nthing with router 1, right.\n\n456\n00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,010\nRouter 2 is saying, hey router 1,\ndo you know about 172.16?\n\n457\n00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,350\nAnd router 1 is saying, nope.\n\n458\n00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,350\nNo, I don't know about it.\n\n459\n00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,140\nI'd love to add it to my routing table.\n\n460\n00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,680\nHow far away were you?\n\n461\n00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,350\nAnd router 2 says,\nwell I'm 0 hops away man.\n\n462\n00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,384\nI'm right here, and so\nrouter 1 says, great,\n\n463\n00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:25,690\nthat's an awesome connection,\nlet me add that to my routing table.\n\n464\n00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,758\nAnd it adds it and it says, well,\nI've got to go through router 2, so\n\n465\n00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:29,600\nI'm one hop away.\n\n466\n00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,505\nSince he's zero hops away, I'm one hop\naway, so I'll add it to the routing table,\n\n467\n00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,060\nall right.\n\n468\n00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,020\nSo, that's the first step of how\na Distance Vector Protocol works.\n\n469\n00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,732\nAnd here comes the neat part,\n\n470\n00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:47,060\nrouter 3 now knows about 172.16.0.0/16.\n\n471\n00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,795\nAnd so, it then tells router 1, hey\nrouter 1, I learned about a new network,\n\n472\n00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:56,668\nI learned about 172.16,\ndo you know about it?\n\n473\n00:26:56,668 --> 00:27:00,810\nAnd router 1 says, well, yeah,\nI kinda already know about it.\n\n474\n00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,030\nI've got this route through Router 2,\nI kinda like it, but what's yours?\n\n475\n00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,390\nMaybe yours is better, and router 3 says,\noh, yeah, mine's really good.\n\n476\n00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,210\nI'm only one hop away, if you come through\nme, I can get you there in one hop.\n\n477\n00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,960\nWell, router one says, all right, you're\none hop away, but if I go through you,\n\n478\n00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,420\nthat's one more router, so for\nme it would be two hops away.\n\n479\n00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,230\nSo, Router 1 says, all right,\nyou're two hops away.\n\n480\n00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,490\nI've already got a route\ndirectly through Router 2,\n\n481\n00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,050\nit's only one hop away, one hop versus\ntwo hops, let's stick with the one hop.\n\n482\n00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,140\nAnd so Router 1 says,\nthank you, but no thank you.\n\n483\n00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,190\nKeep your route Router 3,\nyou can stuff it, and\n\n484\n00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,355\nthen sticks with its original route,\nbut it's not forgotten.\n\n485\n00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:47,105\nWith Distance Vector Protocols, they have\na timer, and every so often, it's usually\n\n486\n00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:50,845\n90 seconds, but every so often the routers\nwill continue to advertise it.\n\n487\n00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,155\nSo, Router 3 will say, hey, remember me?\n\n488\n00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,325\nI still know that route,\ndo you want it now?\n\n489\n00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,665\nAnd Router 1 will say,\nno, I don't want it.\n\n490\n00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:59,225\nAnd then 90 seconds later,\nRouter 3, hey, what about now?\n\n491\n00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,065\nVery persistent.\n\n492\n00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:05,470\nThe reason it does that,\nis if we ever have a failure.\n\n493\n00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,450\nIf this link in between Router 1 and\nRouter 2 fails, then within 90\n\n494\n00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,400\nseconds Router 3 says, Router 1 I\nstill got this route do you want it?\n\n495\n00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,690\nAnd Router 1 goes, gee,\nI lost my one hop route.\n\n496\n00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,210\nYou're offering me a two hop route,\n\n497\n00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,430\nthat's better than nothing,\nyeah, I'll take it, wonderful.\n\n498\n00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,810\nIt takes it, and\nnow it's able to route around the failure.\n\n499\n00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,070\nCISCO used to have a series\nof TV commercials, and\n\n500\n00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,990\nin the TV commercials they advertised\nthe CISCO, self-healing network.\n\n501\n00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,480\nThis is what they were talking about.\n\n502\n00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,160\nWhen you have a failure on the network,\nthe router's figure it out themselves, and\n\n503\n00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,490\nif they can find a path around\nthe failure, they do it.\n\n504\n00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,910\nThey build that path around the failure,\nand your end users,\n\n505\n00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,240\nyour PCs, these guys right here.\n\n506\n00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,700\nThey get routed around the failure,\nand they have no idea that there was\n\n507\n00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,210\never a failure,\nit's completely invisible to them.\n\n508\n00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,170\nThe end user keeps working, everybody's\nhappy, it's utopia, sunshine and rainbows,\n\n509\n00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,400\ncats living with dogs,\nall sorts of good stuff.\n\n510\n00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,220\nSo, that's basically the process when\nit comes to a Distance Vector Protocol.\n\n511\n00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,760\nNow, that sounds great.\n\n512\n00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,520\nReal easy.\n\n513\n00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,610\nReal simple concept to understand, but\n\n514\n00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,080\nthere's one big problem with\nDistance Vector Protocols.\n\n515\n00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,330\nLet me get rid of the spaghetti\nmess I've dumped on you here.\n\n516\n00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,220\nDistance Vector Protocols\nlook at hop count.\n\n517\n00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,013\nHop count is what they care about, but\n\n518\n00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:37,350\nthere's some information that doesn't\nget conveyed with a hop count.\n\n519\n00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,940\nSome information that can be important,\nall right.\n\n520\n00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,288\nSo for example, what if the link\nbetween Router 1 and Router 3,\n\n521\n00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:50,850\nlet's say, this link between Router 1 and\nRouter 3 is a T1 line.\n\n522\n00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,794\nWhich is 1.544 megabit, and let's say,\n\n523\n00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:07,151\nthat the link between Router 3 and\nRouter 2 is also\n\n524\n00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:12,020\na T1 line, 1.544 megabit, all right.\n\n525\n00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,890\nAnd let's say, that the link\nbetween Router 1 and Router 2.\n\n526\n00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,222\nIs dial-up, it's a 56K connection\nbetween the two systems, and\n\n527\n00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:28,172\nwith dial-up 53K is really\nthe maximum that you can get,\n\n528\n00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:32,430\nbut we'll just say, 56k because that's\nwhat the marketing people tell us to say.\n\n529\n00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,467\nSo, let's say, it's a dial-up line, or\n\n530\n00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:38,880\nmaybe I should pick something that isn't\nancient, nobody uses dial-up anymore.\n\n531\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,125\nMaybe it's like a backup ISDN line,\n\n532\n00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,564\n[LAUGH] which I just misspelled ISDN,\nwhich is pretty amazing.\n\n533\n00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,255\nSo, it's a backup ISDN line,\nwhich is 128K, kilobits.\n\n534\n00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:56,415\nSo, now that link between router 1 and\nrouter 2 at 128K,\n\n535\n00:30:56,415 --> 00:31:02,635\nthat is less than 10% of\nthe bandwidth of a T1 line.\n\n536\n00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:11,340\nSo, if we compare it, even though the path\nthrough oop, that's not what I wanted.\n\n537\n00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,056\nEven though the path through router\n3 to router 2 to the destination,\n\n538\n00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:20,929\neven though that's two hops versus\nthe path through router 1 straight to\n\n539\n00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,508\nrouter 2, to the end which is one hop.\n\n540\n00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:29,680\nOne hop versus two hop a Distance Vector\nProtocol will prefer that one hop route.\n\n541\n00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,497\nEven though it's less routers,\nit's a slower line with less bandwidth,\n\n542\n00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:36,110\nit's not as good a line.\n\n543\n00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,010\nYour end users will have a faster\nconnection, if they go the longer route.\n\n544\n00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,307\nIf they go that route,\nRouter 1 to Router 3 to Router 2,\n\n545\n00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:46,500\nif they go that longer route,\n\n546\n00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,400\nthey will get there faster because they\nare going over a higher bandwidth line.\n\n547\n00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,610\nA T1 line at 1.544 megabit.\n\n548\n00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,624\nMore bandwidth, better connection.\n\n549\n00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,457\nSo in this case,\nwe may prefer the T1 link,\n\n550\n00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:04,133\nthe longer link to the shorter link,\nand in that scenario\n\n551\n00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:08,514\nThe Distance Vector Protocols\nare gonna make bad decisions for us.\n\n552\n00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:10,390\nThat's a problem.\n\n553\n00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,160\nWhen Distance Vector Protocols\nwere created back in the 80s,\n\n554\n00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,670\nevery line was slow, so it didn't\nreally matter, hop count was perfect.\n\n555\n00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,430\nBut in today's world,\nlines vary significantly, and\n\n556\n00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,940\nso that means we need a more\nintelligent protocol.\n\n557\n00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,040\nAnd the more intelligent protocols\nof the Link-State Protocols, but\n\n558\n00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,940\nI see I'm kind of running\nout of time on this segment.\n\n559\n00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,720\nLet's stop here, and take a break.\n\n560\n00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,940\nWhen we get back,\nwe'll take link state protocols, and\n\n561\n00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,920\nwrap up with a few other fine points.\n\n562\n00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,732\nAnd then we will be all geared up and\nready to go to jump into that OSPF stuff,\n\n563\n00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,890\n[LAUGH] as we jump into the next episode.\n\n564\n00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,080\nSo, let's take a break,\nI hope you guys enjoyed it so far.\n\n565\n00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,067\nStay tuned, we'll be back in a few\nminutes for Link-State Protocols.\n\n566\n00:32:57,067 --> 00:33:03,418\n[SOUND] All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, welcome back.\n\n567\n00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:07,200\nSo, before the break, I was talking\nabout Distance Vector Protocols.\n\n568\n00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,683\nAnd the last thing I did was I\nhighlighted the problem with\n\n569\n00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:10,988\nDistance Vector Protocols.\n\n570\n00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,611\nThe fact that they prefer hop count, and\n\n571\n00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:16,710\nthat's the only thing\nthey take into account.\n\n572\n00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,540\nThey don't look at things like bandwidth,\nor whatever else on the line, and so\n\n573\n00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,905\nyou get this connection that\nis just not a true reflection,\n\n574\n00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,710\nthat this map is not a true\nreflection of your network, and\n\n575\n00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,200\nit may not make the most\nintelligent decisions.\n\n576\n00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,700\nAnd that's where our next\nsolution comes into play.\n\n577\n00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,771\nAs a replacement to\nDistance Vector Protocols, or\n\n578\n00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:41,500\njust as an alternative to\nDistance Vector Protocols,\n\n579\n00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,472\nwe have another choice which is, now I'm\njust gonna move that off to the side and\n\n580\n00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,950\nadd a new one here, which is what's\ncalled a Link-State Protocol.\n\n581\n00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,330\nA Link-State Protocol, or Link-State\nProtocols cuz there are more than one.\n\n582\n00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:05,110\nThese guys use additional metrics, so\nthat they can make better decisions.\n\n583\n00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,820\nFor example, I'll use OSPF cuz that's\nthe one you need to know for CCNT.\n\n584\n00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,130\nOSPF, Open Shortest Path First,\nit uses bandwidth.\n\n585\n00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,140\nIt actually uses the bandwidth of\nthe line, as part of it's calculation.\n\n586\n00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,070\nAnd so, it says, when I'm trying to\nfigure out the best way to get from\n\n587\n00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,650\npoint a to point b, I don't care about\nhop count cuz hops really don't matter.\n\n588\n00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,420\nAt the end of the day,\nI care about bandwidth.\n\n589\n00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,260\nLet me look at the bandwidth on each leg\nof the journey, build out a total path,\n\n590\n00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,130\nand determine whether that's\nthe way to go or not.\n\n591\n00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,590\nSo, Links-State is far,\nI don't wanna call it far superior,\n\n592\n00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,930\nbut it's far more detail oriented.\n\n593\n00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,160\nIt does make a better\ndecision in most scenarios.\n\n594\n00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,900\nNow, why don't I wanna say, it's better?\n\n595\n00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,860\nIf it makes a better decision,\nwhy isn't the protocol better?\n\n596\n00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,590\nAnd the reason is, in some scenarios,\n\n597\n00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,950\nDistance Vector Protocols may\nbe preferred to Link-State.\n\n598\n00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,630\nHere's the main reason, Distance Vector\nProtocols are really easy to implement.\n\n599\n00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,670\nThey're super easy, so\nif you're looking for a low-maintenance,\n\n600\n00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,320\neasy way to implement dynamic\nrouting protocol, a distance vector,\n\n601\n00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,020\nit's really just a matter of\nturning it on, and you're done.\n\n602\n00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,430\nA Link-State Protocol, on the other hand,\nthere are more complex.\n\n603\n00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,440\nThere's more to them, there's a little\nbit more that we gotta get configured and\n\n604\n00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,000\nset up on them, to get them operating,\nand doing their job properly.\n\n605\n00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,120\nSo, because of that some people opt to\nstick with a Distance Vector Protocol,\n\n606\n00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,859\neven though it may not\nmake the best decision.\n\n607\n00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,850\nThat being said, in real life land, every\norganization I've ever worked for, or\n\n608\n00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,610\nset up a network for,\nI've always gone on OSPF.\n\n609\n00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,340\nIt's an open standard,\nalmost all network gear supports it, and\n\n610\n00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,713\nit makes really good decisions.\n\n611\n00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,900\nBut let's not talk about OSPF specifically\ncuz we'll do that in the next episode.\n\n612\n00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,175\nSo, let's just talk about\nLink-State Protocols in general.\n\n613\n00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:58,010\nLink-State Protocols look at the actual\nlinks in between our different routers,\n\n614\n00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,040\nand the different networks\nthat are in place.\n\n615\n00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,947\nSo, if we take the connection between\nrouter 1 and router 2 here for example,\n\n616\n00:36:04,947 --> 00:36:08,480\nit'll look at that, and\nit will see it as a 128k line.\n\n617\n00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,040\nAnd then the link from router 1 to router\n3, it sees that as a 1.544 megabit line.\n\n618\n00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,900\nAnd the link from router 3, to router 2,\nit sees that as 1.544 megabit.\n\n619\n00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,880\nSo, it's seeing these links, and\nit's developing an understanding of\n\n620\n00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,990\nwhat the bandwidth is,\nwhich line would actually be preferred.\n\n621\n00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:34,550\nAnd in the case of the Distance Vector,\n\n622\n00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,290\nwe know that the blue path\nwould have been preferred,\n\n623\n00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,646\nbecause it was only 1 hop, versus\nthe green path which would be 2 hops.\n\n624\n00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:47,227\nBut that 2 hop path has an average\n\n625\n00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:52,137\nbandwidth of 1.544 megabit,\n\n626\n00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:57,373\nwhereas that 1 hop path has an average\n\n627\n00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:01,312\nbandwidth of 56 kilobit.\n\n628\n00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,433\nSo, when a Link-State Protocol looks\nat this, it's gonna say, well,\n\n629\n00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,195\n56k, that's pretty poor.\n\n630\n00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:10,310\n1.544 megabit, now, that's business.\n\n631\n00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,000\nWe're gonna run with that.\n\n632\n00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,800\nAnd so a Link-State Protocol would pick\nthe green path, and not the blue path.\n\n633\n00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,740\nNow, that means we get nice, solid\nbandwidth, reliable communication between\n\n634\n00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,280\nthe sides, if we have a failure, and\nhere we got multiple points of failure.\n\n635\n00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,204\nSo, we could have a failure here,\nor here, or\n\n636\n00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:34,047\nrouter 3 as a whole,\nany one of those things could fail.\n\n637\n00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:38,589\nIf any any one of those fail\nthe Link-State Protocol would say, oh,\n\n638\n00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,190\nwell, you know what, that's 56k.\n\n639\n00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,986\nI'd said, it's actually 128k,\nit was dial-up originally, and\n\n640\n00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:47,720\nthen we changed it to ISDN,\nI forgot, there we go.\n\n641\n00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:53,761\nSo, it's gonna say, 128k is better than\nnothing, let's go over the ISDN line,\n\n642\n00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:57,321\nand it'll flip over to that one,\nand it'll move across it.\n\n643\n00:37:57,321 --> 00:38:01,996\nSo, deep down underneath the hood,\nit the heart of the matter,\n\n644\n00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:07,107\nDistance Vector Protocols rely on\nhop count, Link-State Protocols\n\n645\n00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:12,320\nuse other metrics, specifically\nbandwidth to make those decisions.\n\n646\n00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,201\nAnd so between the two,\n\n647\n00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:16,210\nLink-State Protocols typically make\nsmarter decisions based on our network.\n\n648\n00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,970\nNow, there is a third type of routing\n\n649\n00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,640\nprotocol that they don't specifically call\nout right here, or even in the objectives.\n\n650\n00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,360\nThere's a third type which is called\na Hybrid Distance Vector Protocol, and\n\n651\n00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,110\nthat's where some vendors take a Distance\nVector Protocol and they retrofit it.\n\n652\n00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,400\nThey add on to it to make it where's\nan easy to implement protocol, but\n\n653\n00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,900\nit takes into account other things,\nand Cisco did this.\n\n654\n00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,550\nCisco created a protocol called EIGRP,\nwhich is\n\n655\n00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,360\nthe Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing\nProtocol, rolls right off the tongue.\n\n656\n00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,380\nIt's Cisco proprietary,\nit's not a standard,\n\n657\n00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,040\nnobody supports it other than Cisco,\nso it's not very popular, but\n\n658\n00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,680\nit is out there, and at its heart,\nit's a Distance Vector Protocol.\n\n659\n00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,700\nBut, you know what?\n\n660\n00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,440\nIn the protocol itself,\nit ignores the hop count.\n\n661\n00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,138\nIt's a Distance Vector Protocol it doesn't\neven pay attention to the hop count, and\n\n662\n00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,170\nit does look at bandwidth and delay.\n\n663\n00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,820\nIt looks at delay on the line too.\n\n664\n00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,970\nSo, it's even going more specific.\n\n665\n00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,620\nSo, it's an amazing protocol.\n\n666\n00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,800\nPhenomenal, makes really good decisions.\n\n667\n00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,850\nYou guys will learn about\nit in the CCNA show,\n\n668\n00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,440\nwhen we get into that show\nwe'll tackle the EIGRP.\n\n669\n00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,310\nBut phenomenal protocol.\n\n670\n00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,370\nBut it is based on a Distance Vectors, so\n\n671\n00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,730\nyou will see that most protocols fall into\neither Distance Vector, or Link-State.\n\n672\n00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,519\nBut just keep in mind, there can be some\nthat are called a hybrid, or sometimes,\n\n673\n00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,419\nthey call it a Hybrid Distance Vector,\nor sometimes they call\n\n674\n00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:46,689\nit an Advanced Distance Vector cuz\nthere's no official term for it.\n\n675\n00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,849\nCuz really, some vendor who's chosen\nto bastardize one of the standards,\n\n676\n00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,400\nthat's basically what it comes down to.\n\n677\n00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,903\nAnd so,\nthere's not really an official term.\n\n678\n00:39:55,903 --> 00:40:01,147\nSo, just keep in mind right here,\nDistance Vector and\n\n679\n00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:06,850\nLink-State, those are kind of\nthe two that we really see.\n\n680\n00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,500\nAll right.\n\n681\n00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,030\nWhat was the other thing\nthat I wanted to mention.\n\n682\n00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,370\nLet me check the objectives here.\n\n683\n00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,500\nI think we've got to through most of it.\n\n684\n00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,700\nLet's see, talk about next hops,\ntalked about the routing table.\n\n685\n00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,780\nOh the last thing I wanted to mention is\n\n686\n00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,800\nwhat if I'm running more\nthan one routing protocol?\n\n687\n00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,950\nRight?\nIt is possible.\n\n688\n00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,940\nYou could run both.\n\n689\n00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,820\nLike a distance vector and\na link state protocol.\n\n690\n00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,790\nSo you can run more than one routing\nprotocol if you want, all right?\n\n691\n00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,590\nIf you do, it's possible that your router\n\n692\n00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:44,200\ncould learn the same route via\ntwo different routing protocols.\n\n693\n00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,020\nIt could learn it via a distance vector\nprotocol, and via link state protocol.\n\n694\n00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,910\nIf it's learning the same route\nthrough two different protocols,\n\n695\n00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,220\nhow does the router figure out\nwhich one to prefer, all right?\n\n696\n00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,900\nWell, earlier, I mentioned a metric.\n\n697\n00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,580\nAnd the metric is used to\ndetermine which route is the best.\n\n698\n00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,180\nWhen it's the same routing protocol.\n\n699\n00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,140\nBut if they're different\nrouting protocols,\n\n700\n00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,990\nthere's another number,\nthe administrative distance.\n\n701\n00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,420\nAnd when we looked at that routing table,\nlet me pull that routing table back up.\n\n702\n00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,260\nWhen we look at that number in\nthe routing table, I can see here, 5/0.\n\n703\n00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,600\nThe first number is the administrative\ndistance, the second number is the metric.\n\n704\n00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:35,450\nThe metric is used as a tie-breaker when\nwe have two routes from the same protocol.\n\n705\n00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,710\nThe administrative distance is used as\nthe tie-breaker when I get the same\n\n706\n00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,100\nroute from two different protocols.\n\n707\n00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,710\nAll right.\n\n708\n00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,770\nAnd Cisco has some arbitrary\nnumbers that they've assigned\n\n709\n00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,120\nto help us decide which ones win and\nwhich ones don't.\n\n710\n00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,240\nLet me just kind of throw\nthose up here on the screen.\n\n711\n00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120\nSo we have\n\n712\n00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,430\nAny directly connected routes have\nan administrative distance of zero.\n\n713\n00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,840\nIf it is an EIGRP, hang on.\n\n714\n00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,560\nLet me do static.\n\n715\n00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,140\nStatic routes By default have\nan administrative distance of one.\n\n716\n00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,360\nAnd then we have CISCO's EIGRP,\nthat's their proprietary protocol.\n\n717\n00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,374\nHas an administrative distance of 90.\n\n718\n00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,100\nOSPF which is a link state protocol,\nright.\n\n719\n00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,030\nThis one is a hybrid distance vector.\n\n720\n00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,600\nAnd then 120 is RIP.\n\n721\n00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,228\nWhich is a distance vector protocol.\n\n722\n00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,610\nOkay, so, these are the main ones.\n\n723\n00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,360\nLet me make this font a little bit bigger.\n\n724\n00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,090\nThese are the main ones\nthat show up on the exam.\n\n725\n00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,820\nA directly connected route is always\npreferred over any other route.\n\n726\n00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,330\nSo, a directly connected route gets\nan administrative distance of zero and\n\n727\n00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,585\nlet me just have that.\n\n728\n00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:23,690\nOh, that's cute.\n\n729\n00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,300\nWhy would I want that font size to match?\n\n730\n00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,540\nThat would be crazy talk.\n\n731\n00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,990\nThere we go.\n\n732\n00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,110\nZero is directly connected.\n\n733\n00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,040\nDirectly connected is always prefered.\n\n734\n00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,890\nA one, that's a static route.\n\n735\n00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,090\nThat's one that we told the router, and\n\n736\n00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,280\nthe router assumes that\nwe know what we're doing.\n\n737\n00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,230\nIt might be wrong.\n\n738\n00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,430\nBut it assumes that we\nknow what we're doing.\n\n739\n00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,490\nAnd so, if we manually put a route in\nthere, the router's going to prefer it.\n\n740\n00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,080\nBut after that,\nit comes down to Cisco's choice.\n\n741\n00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,600\nNow Cisco loves their own protocol.\n\n742\n00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,980\nThey love EIGRP, and so\nthey give it a metric of 90, all right?\n\n743\n00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,870\nBut after that look at OSPF and RIP.\n\n744\n00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:08,230\nOSPF is the most popular\nLink State Protocol and\n\n745\n00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,460\nRIP is the most popular\nDistance Vector Protocol.\n\n746\n00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,620\nAnd see how they've arranged it, where\nthe Link State Protocol gets a 110 and\n\n747\n00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,770\nthe Distance Vector Protocol gets a 120.\n\n748\n00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,350\nThat means if your router learns,\nthe same route,\n\n749\n00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:29,000\nif it learns 192.168.0.0/24, if it learns\nthat via RIP and it learns it via OSPF,\n\n750\n00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,340\nit's going to prefer the route from\nOSPF which is based on bandwidth\n\n751\n00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,930\nover the route that was learned from\nRIP which is based on hop count okay.\n\n752\n00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,740\nSo inside of the router,\nthere's like a pre built in or\n\n753\n00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,310\na built in predisposition, right.\n\n754\n00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:49,500\nIt's already biased to choose\nlink state over distance vector.\n\n755\n00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,130\nNow for\n\n756\n00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,060\nthose of you that go on to the CCNP\nwe'll talk about how to override this.\n\n757\n00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,430\nYou can override it choose whatever the\nheck you want, but in the router itself,\n\n758\n00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,670\nwhat's built in there it\nfollows this order right here.\n\n759\n00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,050\nAnd just remember its like a race.\n\n760\n00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,420\nYou know,\nfirst place is better than 90th place.\n\n761\n00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,560\nAnd so, a static route will be\npreferred over EIGRP, right.\n\n762\n00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,760\nNow, in a lot of the text books that you\nfind out there, if you go buy the Cisco\n\n763\n00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,850\npress book for CCNT, which is a really\ngood book, if you need a book.\n\n764\n00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,850\nBut, if you pick one of those up they'll\nusually have a few more entries in here\n\n765\n00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:32,230\nlike, they may have BGP and external\nEIGRP and a few other entries in here.\n\n766\n00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,220\nThose are good to know but these\nare the ones that show up on the exam.\n\n767\n00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,290\nThese five right here.\n\n768\n00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:41,074\nSo you can memorize your giant table\nif you want but these are the five that\n\n769\n00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:45,091\nreally turn up and the ones that\nwe really need to be aware of.\n\n770\n00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:48,449\nAll right, so\nthat pretty much wraps up all I've got,\n\n771\n00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,375\nI'm kind of highlighting\nthese differences.\n\n772\n00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:55,077\nI just wanted to make sure that all of\nyou guys out there in TV land had a good\n\n773\n00:45:55,077 --> 00:45:58,666\nunderstanding of the ending of these\ncategories of routing protocols\n\n774\n00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:01,320\nthe distance vector verses link stay.\n\n775\n00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,070\nThese categories that kind of\ndescribe the functionality of each\n\n776\n00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,980\nprotocol because in the next episode we're\ngoing to dive right into OSPF, okay?\n\n777\n00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,380\nIt didn't used to be like that in\nthe old exam, we would do RIP first,\n\n778\n00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,530\nwhich was distance vector,\nand then we would do OSPF.\n\n779\n00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,190\nBut when Cisco updated the exam\nobjectives, they bumped RIP off.\n\n780\n00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,410\nIt's gone now.\n\n781\n00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,230\nAnd so it's hard to put all this stuff\ninto context if you don't have that basic.\n\n782\n00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,420\nSo I wanted to take a little time and\nmake sure everybody had a good,\n\n783\n00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,080\nfirm understanding.\n\n784\n00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,140\nIf any of that is still confusing\nto you always remember to jump\n\n785\n00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,670\nover to our website at ITPro.TV and go to\nthe Q and A section and post a question.\n\n786\n00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,780\nWe monitor that, Ronnie, Nate,\nMike, Wes, Me all the hosts.\n\n787\n00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,560\nAnybody you see in front of the camera.\n\n788\n00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,080\nWe all monitor that and we answer\nthe questions as you guys ask them so\n\n789\n00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,230\nwe can always explain it there and\nremember, when we do live shows like this,\n\n790\n00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,660\njust jump over to itpro.tv/live, you might\nbe watching from there right now and\n\n791\n00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,350\nthe chat screen is right at the bottom,\n\n792\n00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,730\nyou can post your chats you just\nhave to be logged in to chat and\n\n793\n00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,910\nyou can comment and\nthrow in whatever you want right there.\n\n794\n00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,950\nSo, pretty cool stuff.\n\n795\n00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,440\nLets see, other than that,\nthat's basically it.\n\n796\n00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,910\nI hope you enjoyed the show today.\n\n797\n00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:15,180\nIt was a little unusual, a little\nshorter episode at a different time, but\n\n798\n00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,590\nstay tuned for next week.\n\n799\n00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,810\nI think it's on Monday, I'll check the\nschedule, that way we're jumping in and\n\n800\n00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,540\ntackling the OSPF of our first\ndynamic routing protocol.\n\n801\n00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,410\nWe'll take some routers, we'll have\nthem learn routes from each other.\n\n802\n00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,840\nIt's pretty cool, and you'll get\na chance to see how all that functions.\n\n803\n00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,440\nSo, that's about all I've got.\n\n804\n00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,180\nLike I said, I hope you enjoyed\nthe show and signing off for ITProTV,\n\n805\n00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,337\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n806\n00:47:39,337 -->

neat stuff today.\n\n20\n00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,020\nIn our last episode,\nwe took a look at static routes and\n\n21\n00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,410\nwe talked about how we can set\nup routes between routers.\n\n22\n00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,930\nBut one of the things that I had\nmentioned was, the bigger a network gets,\n\n23\n00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,510\nthe more burdensome it becomes to try and\nkeep putting in all these static routes.\n\n24\n00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,930\nSo today, first, a network first.\n\n25\n00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,850\nWe're going to implement a dynamic\nrouting protocol so that our routers can\n\n26\n00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,670\ntalk to each other and they can learn\non their own without even knowing it.\n\n27\n00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,973\n>> Learn without even knowing it.\n\n28\n00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:41,417\n>> [LAUGH] Look at that.\n\n29\n00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,597\n>> Wow, that's awesome.\n>> I played it off our slogan.\n\n30\n00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:47,129\nAll right so, the sad jokes we make.\n\n31\n00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:48,244\n>> So speaking about routing protocols.\n\n32\n00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:51,528\nLet's see,\nthe routing protocol that we're gonna\n\n33\n00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,570\nactually introduce today is one called\nOSPF and I don't care what you say.\n\n34\n00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,490\nFor the longest time I\nwas calling OPF OPSF.\n\n35\n00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,170\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,972\n>> Don looks at me and goes, it's OSPF.\n\n37\n00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:03,970\nI'm like, oh, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,780\n>> Oops.\n>> Yeah oops.\n\n39\n00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,480\n>> So stuff like that.\n\n40\n00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,760\nBut it stands for\nopen shortest path first.\n\n41\n00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,990\nAnd this is, by far,\n\n42\n00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,700\nthe most popular routing protocol\nthat we have out there today.\n\n43\n00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,390\nAnd so\nwe want to introduce you to that topic.\n\n44\n00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,619\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:19,570\nSo, OSPF.\nVery powerful protocol right?\n\n46\n00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,040\nLet's talk about some of the benefits and\nlet me,\n\n47\n00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,680\nI'll fire up a fancy dancy\nNotepad window here.\n\n48\n00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,860\n>> Nice, yes.\n>> And let's see.\n\n49\n00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,470\nHere we go.\n\n50\n00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,861\nAnd, so what we're gonna do is we\nare going to take a look at OSPF,\n\n51\n00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:38,010\nkind of what the protocol is, what it\ndoes, how it works, all that good stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,322\nAnd let me, I'm sorry.\n\n53\n00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:40,156\nI didn't, there we go.\n\n54\n00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,060\n>> So\nas we're actually taking a look at this.\n\n55\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,818\nLet's kind of do a basic review again.\n\n56\n00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,900\nJust briefly, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,860\nFor us, we have two different ways or\n\n58\n00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,450\nactually I guess multiple ways that we\ncan have a router learn about routes.\n\n59\n00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,530\nWe can do it statically, where we can\nactually manually assign the routes here.\n\n60\n00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,120\nWe can type them in.\n\n61\n00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,930\nAnd we configure them.\n\n62\n00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,837\nThe downfall of that is that if\nanything changes, we have to go in and\n\n63\n00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,242\nchange them for\nevery single router that we're doing.\n\n64\n00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:07,106\nWhat we wanna focus in on is the idea\nof dynamic routing protocols, and\n\n65\n00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:11,439\nthe one that we're focusing in on today\nis the most popular one, called OSPF.\n\n66\n00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,787\nAnd that one is, it allows us to\nturn on that routing protocol and\n\n67\n00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:16,830\nthey can begin to learn routes.\n\n68\n00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,940\n>> Yep.\nNow the name,\n\n69\n00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,360\nlet's start with the name, right?\n\n70\n00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,350\n>> Sure.\n>> The o for open, right.\n\n71\n00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,060\nThat means it's an open standard.\n\n72\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,760\nAny vendor can support it without\npaying royalty fees to somebody else.\n\n73\n00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,388\nSo Cisco, 3Com, HP, Juniper,\nyou name it, they can all support OSPF.\n\n74\n00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:37,498\nAnd they all operate to that standard so\nthey can interact, and you don't\n\n75\n00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:42,550\nhave to have a homogenous environment,\nyou can have a heterogeneous environment.\n\n76\n00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,620\nAnd you can mix vendors.\n\n77\n00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,220\n>> Wow, nice.\n>> I know.\n\n78\n00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,100\nThere's a lot of big words.\n\n79\n00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,400\nEverything I learned off a milk carton.\n\n80\n00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,980\nSo it is a dynamic routing protocol.\n\n81\n00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,440\nIt is an open standard, so\na lot of people support it.\n\n82\n00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,990\n>> And nobody gets paid for it.\n\n83\n00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,360\n>> Yeah, technically nobody gets paid.\n\n84\n00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,160\nSomebody always gets paid right?\n\n85\n00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,970\nThe other part of the name shortest\npath first SPF, that's the Algorithm.\n\n86\n00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,600\n>> Spell the guy's name [LAUGH].\n\n87\n00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,188\n>> And it is sometimes known as the-\n>> Oh, very good.\n\n88\n00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,738\n>> Djikstra Algorithm named after\nthe gentleman who wrote it who,\n\n89\n00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,890\nI don't know Djikstra, what is that\nlike a Nordic or Icelandic last name.\n\n90\n00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,440\n>> I'm going to say Chinese at this point.\n\n91\n00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,055\n>> Chinese, not the traditional Chinese.\n\n92\n00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:33,950\n[LAUGH] So, anyhow, it is sometimes\nreferred to as the Djikstra Algorithm,\n\n93\n00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,390\nbecause the gentleman who wrote it, but\nin the official standard it's called SPF,\n\n94\n00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,470\nthe Shortest Path First Algorithm.\n\n95\n00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,130\nAnd it's a simple formula of figuring\nout what's the best path to take,\n\n96\n00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,170\nthe best path being\nconsidered the shortest path.\n\n97\n00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,070\nNow don't be confused with\na distance vector protocol.\n\n98\n00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,980\nA distance vector protocol\nuses a metric of hop count.\n\n99\n00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,110\nThe less hops, the shorter the path,\nthe more it's preferred.\n\n100\n00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,155\nThe more hops, the longer the path,\nthe less it's preferred.\n\n101\n00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:07,325\nIn OSPF though, Bandwidth is the Metric.\n\n102\n00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,005\nAnd which, I'm spelling completely wrong.\n\n103\n00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,605\nThere we go.\nBandwidth is the Metric yeah, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,590\nSo when it goes to figure out a path\nit doesn't really care about hops.\n\n105\n00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,340\nIt cares about bandwidth.\n\n106\n00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,500\nWhat's the bandwidth between two links?\n\n107\n00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,535\nSo that it is very different, and\n\n108\n00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:28,950\nthat's because it is a link state\nprotocol not a distance vector protocol.\n\n109\n00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,770\nIt does not care about hop count at all.\n\n110\n00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,430\n>> Yeah, and so in terms of the link\nstate protocol for us, right?\n\n111\n00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,770\nUnlike what we were talking about in terms\nof number of routers in between us and\n\n112\n00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,190\nour destination here.\n\n113\n00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,010\nLink state actually begins\nto actually take a look at\n\n114\n00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,240\nwhat they're directly connected to and\n\n115\n00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,770\nthe information that they get from\nthat picker connection right away.\n\n116\n00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,830\nAnd so once you actually have that built\nup here, then we're about ready to go.\n\n117\n00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,765\n>> The other thing that I want to mention,\nis with distance vector protocols,\n\n118\n00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:02,430\nrouters only see their neighbors.\n\n119\n00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,420\nThey just see their direct neighbors and\nthat's it.\n\n120\n00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,280\nBut with a link state protocol,\n\n121\n00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,385\nthe routers will actually communicate\nbetween each other and through each other.\n\n122\n00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:19,160\nAnd that means that routers have end\nto end visibility of the network, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,500\nSo our routers not only see the beginning\nand their neighbor the next top,\n\n124\n00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,960\nthey see beyond that,\nall the way to the destination.\n\n125\n00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,880\nSo they have a much bigger picture\nof what's going on on the network.\n\n126\n00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,175\nThat means they can make more\nintelligent decisions, better decisions,\n\n127\n00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:37,060\ncuz they're not just seeing that one hop,\nthey're seeing all the way down the line.\n\n128\n00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,660\n>> Usually the analogy that I like\nusing is the idea of like a road atlas.\n\n129\n00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,350\nRight?\n\n130\n00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,850\nYou actually have where you are.\n\n131\n00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,960\nAnd then you have a road atlas.\n\n132\n00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,990\nAnd it means you can\nfind any path through it.\n\n133\n00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,750\nAnd that's the way SPF works.\n\n134\n00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,990\nEssentially is that we're\nactually getting an entire atlas\n\n135\n00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,030\nof the entire network\nthat we're connected to.\n\n136\n00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,080\n>> I like your atlas example.\n\n137\n00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,010\nI've never used that before.\n\n138\n00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,170\nBut if you think about it, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,200\nLet's say that you're in\nthe state of Florida, and\n\n140\n00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,960\nyou decide that you're gonna drive\nto the state of Washington, right?\n\n141\n00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,720\nSo the southeast all the way to northwest.\n\n142\n00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,904\nIf you had a map of\nthe entire United States,\n\n143\n00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:09,300\nyou could probably plan\nout a pretty good route.\n\n144\n00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,514\nBut what if while you were in Florida,\nyou just had a map of Florida?\n\n145\n00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,646\n>> Yeah.\n\n146\n00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:16,784\n>> And then when you got out of\nFlorida and into Alabama or whatever,\n\n147\n00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,660\nyou just had a map of Alabama.\n\n148\n00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,450\nIf you went state by state like that,\nyou might make a a decision or\n\n149\n00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,130\nwhatever that is not optimal because\nyou didn't have that big picture.\n\n150\n00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,060\nDistance vector protocols\nsuffer from that quite often.\n\n151\n00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,210\nLink state protocols don't.\n\n152\n00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,440\nThey see the end to end.\n\n153\n00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,950\nNow the trade-off, right?\n\n154\n00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,910\nSo these are all positive things.\n\n155\n00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,117\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n156\n00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:39,257\n>> These are all good things about OSPF.\n\n157\n00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,230\nBut there are negatives.\n\n158\n00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,876\nAll right?\nThe biggest negative with OSPF Is that\n\n159\n00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:45,209\nit's a little bit resource intensive.\n\n160\n00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,033\n>> Right.\n\n161\n00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,066\n>> The router has to see the big picture.\n\n162\n00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,450\nIt processes a lot of information that\na distance vector router wouldn't.\n\n163\n00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,600\nSo as a result it needs more memory,\nmore CPU.\n\n164\n00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,590\nSo let me just add that to my list.\n\n165\n00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:04,184\nMore Memory/CPU than Distance Vector.\n\n166\n00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,623\nAll right, the other negative.\n\n167\n00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:10,114\nIt can be complex to configure.\n\n168\n00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,088\nWe're gonna see the introduction\nto OSPF today and\n\n169\n00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:16,560\nyou guys will see,\nit's really not that hard to get set up.\n\n170\n00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,292\nBut for those of you who continue on to\nthe CCNA, you're gonna see there's a lot\n\n171\n00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:25,379\nmore to OSPF,\nit's got a ton of bells and whistles.\n\n172\n00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,510\nAnd it's pretty challenging\nto set it up sometimes.\n\n173\n00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,330\nSo, it can be complex to configure.\n\n174\n00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,430\n>> It's kind of interesting\nin terms of the introduction,\n\n175\n00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,840\nhow easy this can be configured compared\nto when you actually really get into it.\n\n176\n00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,820\nHow complex it can be.\n\n177\n00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,890\nIt's amazing once you get\ninto the other things.\n\n178\n00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,060\n>> So, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a couple of routers, and\n\n179\n00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,960\nwe're gonna set up OSPF between them.\n\n180\n00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,210\nSometimes, seeing is easier than telling.\n\n181\n00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,760\nSo, our topology,\nlet me just bring this up, and\n\n182\n00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,970\nJason, can we full screen that, so\nmy head's not on top of that network?\n\n183\n00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,600\nWith my giant head in the way.\n\n184\n00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,020\nSo, basically,\nwe're gonna have three routers.\n\n185\n00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,490\nRouter one, router two and router three.\n\n186\n00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,155\nThank you, Jason.\n\n187\n00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:10,670\nRouter one, two and three, they're\ngonna be configured just in a triangle.\n\n188\n00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,397\nEach router has its own\nprivate network attached.\n\n189\n00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:17,896\nRouter one has 192.168.1.0.\n\n190\n00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,570\nIt's just a Class C network.\n\n191\n00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,300\nRouter two is connected to 2.0 and\nRouter three is connected to 3.0.\n\n192\n00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,730\nNow, each router is then connected to\neach other via some various links.\n\n193\n00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,600\nAnd we've got some hundred megabit links,\nEthernet links, and\n\n194\n00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,340\nwe've got a serial link or a T1 line.\n\n195\n00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,175\nRonnie, you set it up,\ndid you catch the bandwidth on it?\n\n196\n00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,460\nIs it-\n>> I did not.\n\n197\n00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,870\n>> Well,\nwe'll look when we get onto the routers.\n\n198\n00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,380\nIt's probably, the Cisco routers\nwill default to 64k a lot of times.\n\n199\n00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,070\nSo, it's probably set really low.\n\n200\n00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,230\nBut the point is they are different\nbandwidths and that's important for\n\n201\n00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,360\nour example.\n\n202\n00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,700\nNow, if I'm on router one, router one\ndoes not know about 192.168.3 and it\n\n203\n00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,690\ndoesn't know about 192.168.2 because it's\nnot directly plugged into those networks.\n\n204\n00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,530\nIt's indirect.\n\n205\n00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,480\nIt's got to pass these other routers.\n\n206\n00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,980\nSo, in the last episode,\nwe saw how to do that with static routes.\n\n207\n00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,090\nSo, we put a static route in and tell it.\n\n208\n00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,280\nWell, in this topology,\nI have to put two static routes on\n\n209\n00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,760\neach router to tell it\nabout the other networks.\n\n210\n00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,860\nAnd that means six static\nroutes all together.\n\n211\n00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,980\nAnd as the routes start to grow as\nnew networks get added, it's more and\n\n212\n00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,122\nmore routes, and more and more burden.\n\n213\n00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:30,200\nWe're gonna configure OSPF on these\nthree guys so they exchange information.\n\n214\n00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,203\nAnd once that's done,\nthey come up, they're happy, and\n\n215\n00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:36,224\nthey learn the routes without\nus having to influence them.\n\n216\n00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:38,987\n>> Yep.\n\n217\n00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,090\n>> So, let's tackle it.\n\n218\n00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,460\nLet's jump in there and\nsee this for example.\n\n219\n00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,310\nWe'll start on router one.\n\n220\n00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,380\nLet me fire that guy up.\n\n221\n00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,208\nAnd actually, I'm already in router\none except my connection has died.\n\n222\n00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let me restart my connection.\n\n223\n00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:56,787\n[SOUND]\n\n224\n00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:02,864\nThere we go.\n\n225\n00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:07,655\nSo, here I am on router one, and\nif I do a show IP interface brief,\n\n226\n00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:13,430\nI can see that it's connected\nto the 192.168.1.1 network.\n\n227\n00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,500\nSo, I'm connected there, that's awesome.\n\n228\n00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,560\nAnd I can see that I've\ngot some other networks.\n\n229\n00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,032\nMy Ethernet connections\nto the other routers.\n\n230\n00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,870\nRouter one is at the top of that triangle,\nso it's only got Ethernet connections.\n\n231\n00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,810\nIt doesn't have anything serial.\n\n232\n00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,340\nSo, it's up and it's happy.\n\n233\n00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,150\nIf I do a show IP route,\nit's got some routes and the routes\n\n234\n00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,880\nare all just regular IP based routes so\nnothing too crazy or fancy there.\n\n235\n00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,460\nAnd it's up and it's happy.\n\n236\n00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,320\nNow, looking at this,\nthey are no dynamically learned routes.\n\n237\n00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,410\nI'll see the Cs and the L.\n\n238\n00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,310\nThe C indicating a directly\nconnected network.\n\n239\n00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,370\nThe L indicating our local\nIP on those networks.\n\n240\n00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,095\nBut I don't see any Os or Rs or Es,\n\n241\n00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:01,450\nanything that indicates that\nI'm running a dynamic protocol.\n\n242\n00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,940\n>> So, whatever's not in the routing table\nmeans that we can't actually get to it.\n\n243\n00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,500\nSo, one of the things wanna do,\nof course, is make sure,\n\n244\n00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,420\nthat we wanna be able to reach\nthat 192.168.2 or .3 network here.\n\n245\n00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,400\nWe've got to get them\ninto this routing table.\n\n246\n00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,220\n>> Yep.\nAnd we could do it with statics,\n\n247\n00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,505\nbut that would kinda defeat\nthe purpose of this objective.\n\n248\n00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna configure OSPF instead.\n\n249\n00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,503\nNow, we're gonna start with IPv4, and then\nwe'll do it again with IPv6 afterwards.\n\n250\n00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:33,350\nSo, we're gonna start with IPv4 which\nis what you'll usually see on the exam.\n\n251\n00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,450\nSo, step one, I need to turn on OSPF.\n\n252\n00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,475\nNow, when you turn on OSPF,\nthe command is really easy, it's router,\n\n253\n00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:47,720\nOSPF, followed by a process ID.\n\n254\n00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,895\nNow, this is really important.\n\n255\n00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The process ID is a unique number\n\n256\n00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,798\nthat identifies this instance of OSPF.\n\n257\n00:12:56,798 --> 00:13:01,795\nYou can actually run more than\none copy of OSPF if you want to.\n\n258\n00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,535\nIf you're an internet service provider and\n\n259\n00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:06,935\nyou've got a bunch of different customers\nand you want them to run OSPF for\n\n260\n00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:10,965\nwhatever reason, you could run a separate\ninstance of OSPF for each customer.\n\n261\n00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,665\nThat way they don't learn\neach others' routes.\n\n262\n00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,035\nMost people will never have a need for\nthat and\n\n263\n00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:19,590\nso, we just pick a number here and\nassign it.\n\n264\n00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,560\nThe thing is, anytime you wanna go and\nconfigure OSPF,\n\n265\n00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,860\nyou've got to remember\nthis process number.\n\n266\n00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,330\nNow, the process number is\nlocally unique on this router.\n\n267\n00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,610\nSo, you could use a different process\nnumber on every router if you wanted and\n\n268\n00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,750\nit wouldn't make a difference.\n\n269\n00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,370\nIt's only locally unique to this system.\n\n270\n00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,780\nIt's just this one router\nthat cares about it.\n\n271\n00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,525\nSo, what I normally do to make it easy\non myself is I just say router OSPF one.\n\n272\n00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is my first instance of OSPF,\n\n273\n00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,730\nand it's gonna run with process ID one.\n\n274\n00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,800\nIf I ever need a second instance,\nI'll do two or three,\n\n275\n00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,610\nbut most of us don't have a need for that.\n\n276\n00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,558\n>> So, now, that we've got the initial\nconfiguration, essentially what we've\n\n277\n00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,680\ndone here on the Cisco router is\nwe've turned on the idea of OSPF.\n\n278\n00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,740\nOnce we've turned it on,\ndoesn't mean that it's actually ready yet.\n\n279\n00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,380\nWe now need to configure it,\nit's what we actually need to do.\n\n280\n00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,010\nNow, for the initial configuration for\nus, we're gonna need a network statement.\n\n281\n00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,780\nWe're gonna need an IP address.\n\n282\n00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,444\nAnd the one that's kinda tricky for\nus that we haven't been practicing,\n\n283\n00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,583\nis gonna be what we\ncall the wildcard mask.\n\n284\n00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,818\nAnd then, we're gonna need\na weird thing at the end there,\n\n285\n00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:28,920\nit's gonna be called area and\nthen whatever number that we're gonna use.\n\n286\n00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,940\n>> So, when we go to advertise this,\nwhen we go to turn on OSPF,\n\n287\n00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,720\nwe're not done with just this one command.\n\n288\n00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,215\nIn fact, if I exit out right now,\nOSPF isn't even turned on.\n\n289\n00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:36,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n290\n00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,780\nthe network command's still like, hey,\nwe need to advertise these networks.\n\n291\n00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,548\nAnd just like Ronnie said, the command is\nkind of a long one, we say network, and\n\n292\n00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:48,705\nthen we tell the router really what\ninterface is we want OSPF to run on.\n\n293\n00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,588\nSo, with the network command,\n\n294\n00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:54,372\nI'm specifying networks that I\nhave interfaces connected to.\n\n295\n00:14:54,372 --> 00:15:01,160\nSo, one of my interfaces, for\nexample, is the 192.168.0 network,\n\n296\n00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,126\nand it's a class C, 255 255 255 0.\n\n297\n00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:10,800\nHowever, OSPF doesn't take a subnet mask.\n\n298\n00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,560\nIt takes what's called a wild card mask.\n\n299\n00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,840\nAnd wild card masks are different\nthan some of the masks.\n\n300\n00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,760\nIn a subnet mask,\nif you convert them to binary,\n\n301\n00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,330\nthe ones identify the network ID and\nthe zeroes identify the host ID.\n\n302\n00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,520\nIn a wildcard mask,\nit's kind of the opposite.\n\n303\n00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,690\nA zero identifies a number\nthat has to match.\n\n304\n00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,810\nA one identifies a number\nthat doesn't have to match.\n\n305\n00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,650\nSo, if I'm saying I'm looking for\nan interface to turn on OSPF.\n\n306\n00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,873\nAnd I want that interface\nto start with 192.168.1.\n\n307\n00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,130\nAnd then, it can end with whatever.\n\n308\n00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:53,145\nThen, my wild card mask would\nbe like this, 0.0.0.255.\n\n309\n00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:57,581\nThe first three zeros are saying\nthe first three octets have to match.\n\n310\n00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:02,015\nI'm looking for\ninterfaces that start with 192.168.1.\n\n311\n00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:06,125\nAnd then, the last octet,\nwhere I've got this 255, can be whatever.\n\n312\n00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:11,530\nAny interface that matches this pattern\nwill turn on OSPF for it [SOUND].\n\n313\n00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,315\nSo, it's kind of the opposite of a subnet\nmask and we're gonna talk more about\n\n314\n00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:20,170\nthis in the CCNA show when we\nstart doing access control lists.\n\n315\n00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,315\nWe'll see wild card masks like crazy.\n\n316\n00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,700\nFor the CCENT exam,\nthey keep it pretty simple though.\n\n317\n00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,770\nThey usually don't go too much beyond\nwhat we are seeing right here.\n\n318\n00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,870\nJust kind of reversing of subnet mask.\n\n319\n00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,200\nAnd the last thing Ronnie\nmentioned was the area.\n\n320\n00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,830\nOn the CCENT exam,\nyou only deal with single area OSPF.\n\n321\n00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,890\nAnd that means, you'll take all of your\nrouters, and put them in the same area.\n\n322\n00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,680\nIn the CCNA exam, you'll do multi-area.\n\n323\n00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,260\nNow, what are areas?\n\n324\n00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,660\nWell, remember how I said in OSPF\neach router can see the whole\n\n325\n00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,740\npath beginning to end?\n\n326\n00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,310\nWell, that's really cool on a small\nnetwork or on a medium-sized network.\n\n327\n00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,840\nBut on a larger or an enterprise level\nnetwork, it becomes really burdensome, and\n\n328\n00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,710\nyour routers may not have enough juice for\nthat.\n\n329\n00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,500\nThey may not be powerful enough.\n\n330\n00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,420\nSo, you can divide your OSPF\nenvironment up into areas.\n\n331\n00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,440\nYou can break it into pieces.\n\n332\n00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,240\nAnd then, each router router gets\nassigned to a different area.\n\n333\n00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,070\nWe're just gonna do one.\n\n334\n00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,160\nAnd if you're doing single-area OSPF,\nyou'll want to do area zero.\n\n335\n00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000\nGo ahead.\n\n336\n00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,540\n>> I have to say, that area of\nzero is a special area for us.\n\n337\n00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,630\nA lot of times, you hear about it\nbeing called the backbone area.\n\n338\n00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,590\nThis area allows us to be\nable to configure this for\n\n339\n00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,140\nthat end-end connectivity that we see.\n\n340\n00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,300\nBut at the same time, it also allows for\nwhen we get into it, a little bit later\n\n341\n00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,680\non, where all the others must transit\ntheir data through this area zero.\n\n342\n00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,640\nAnd so, this is gonna be the important\none at the beginning that we all have to\n\n343\n00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,890\nbe able to configure.\n\n344\n00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,540\nWhen we actually start right here,\nthese areas.\n\n345\n00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,350\nNow, let's be clear,\narea space zero is actually the key here.\n\n346\n00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n347\n00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,950\nIf you do an area zero without the space-\n>> It gets upset with you.\n\n348\n00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,020\n>> It gets upset.\n\n349\n00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,920\n>> If we did area one, or\narea two, those would work also.\n\n350\n00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,230\nThis does need to match on the various\nrouters that I wanna talk to,\n\n351\n00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,040\nthat area number has to be the same.\n\n352\n00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,920\nThe process ID could be different.\n\n353\n00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920\nWe don't care about that.\n\n354\n00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,450\nBut the area number does have to\nmatch unless I'm doing multi area.\n\n355\n00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,940\nSo, that's gonna take care\nof the 192.168 network.\n\n356\n00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,150\nI've got two other networks\nthat I need to advertise.\n\n357\n00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,255\nSo, I can say network 172.16.1.0 [SOUND],\n\n358\n00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:32,324\nwhich I'll put into area zero.\n\n359\n00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:38,988\nAnd the other one which was 2.0 [SOUND].\n\n360\n00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:45,440\nSo, those are my three networks\nthat I'm putting into area zero.\n\n361\n00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,770\nNow, OSPF is running.\n\n362\n00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,920\nAnd I'm trying to discover other routers.\n\n363\n00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,200\nThe easiest way to verify\nthat OSPF is running is with\n\n364\n00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,050\na nice little command\nshow IP per protocols.\n\n365\n00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,340\nIf you're running any kind of dynamic\nprotocol, when you run show IP protocols,\n\n366\n00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,860\nit gives you the status screen for\n\n367\n00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,840\neach Because you might be\nrunning more than one.\n\n368\n00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,470\nI might run EIGRP and RIP also.\n\n369\n00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,540\nAnd so, when I run it,\nI can see that I am running OSPF.\n\n370\n00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,320\nMy OSPF process ID is one, and\nI'm routing for these three networks.\n\n371\n00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,700\nI'm up and I'm happy.\n\n372\n00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,670\nEvery once and a while, I know that in\nterms configuration, I've done this.\n\n374\n00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,000\nWhen I thought I configured it perfectly,\neverything should be working, and\n\n375\n00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520\nthen one route don't show up.\n\n376\n00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,830\nThis is a great place for\nme to actually verify that in OSPF,\n\n377\n00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,410\nI can actually see if I did\nconfigure all three routes or not.\n\n378\n00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,940\n>> Now, the way that we just configured\nit, it's up and it's running on this one\n\n379\n00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,610\nrouter, but if I run show IP router,\nI still don't have any special routes.\n\n380\n00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,250\nAnd the reason is I'm not running\non any other routers yet.\n\n381\n00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,230\nSo, let's jump over to routers two and\nthree, and kind of repeat the process.\n\n382\n00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,100\nNow, I did it here,\nthe full way, the long way.\n\n383\n00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,990\nSo, if I pull up that configuration again,\nhere it is.\n\n384\n00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,410\nWe did router OSPF 1, and then I\nmanually advertised the three networks.\n\n385\n00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,816\nThere's actually some shortcuts\nwe can use to advertise networks\n\n386\n00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:12,979\na little more simply.\n\n387\n00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,835\nSo, let me connect to some\nof the other routers and\n\n388\n00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:19,040\nwe'll see some of the other\nways that we can set this up.\n\n389\n00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,117\n[SOUND] So, here's router two and\nif I look at it,\n\n390\n00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:33,025\nit's got interfaces 172.16.1.2,\n\n391\n00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:37,343\n192.68.2.1, and\n\n392\n00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:41,156\n172.16.3.2.\n\n393\n00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:46,001\nSo, it's got several of them that\nare there and ready to rock.\n\n394\n00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:49,430\nAnd so, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna cheat on this one.\n\n395\n00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,580\nI'm gonna just turn on OSPF for\nall of my interfaces at once.\n\n396\n00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,263\nWhat we can do is we can say router\nOSPF and then our process ID, and\n\n397\n00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,859\nI could pick a different process ID here,\nit wouldn't matter.\n\n398\n00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,700\nBut I'm gonna use one, again just\nto make it easy for me to remember.\n\n399\n00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,230\nAnd instead of advertising\neach network individually,\n\n400\n00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,250\nI'm gonna do a full wild card.\n\n401\n00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,845\nWith a full wild card like this,\nwhat I'm saying is network 0000,\n\n402\n00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:25,780\nbut then the all 255s in the wildcard\nmass that says no bit has to match,\n\n403\n00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,400\nthey could be anything I don't care,\narea zero.\n\n404\n00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,080\nThis one line will turn on OSPF for\nall of my interfaces.\n\n405\n00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,670\nSo, when I run that, OSPF is now\nrunning for all of my interfaces.\n\n406\n00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,840\nAnd I should,\n\n407\n00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,340\nin some short amount of time-\n>> Yeah.\n\n408\n00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,250\n>> Discover router one, and\nstart to communicate with it.\n\n409\n00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,170\nSo, kind of a neat way to do it.\n\n410\n00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,160\nNow, there is one problem with this.\n\n411\n00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,200\nSometimes, there might be one interface\nthat I don't want to participate\n\n412\n00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,750\ninto OSPF.\n\n413\n00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:05,369\nI'm not doing terminal monitor [SOUND].\n\n414\n00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,100\nSo, let me do this.\n\n415\n00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,576\nLet me repeat that process [SOUND].\n\n416\n00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:15,395\nSo, the terminal monitor command is what\nmakes status messages come up when you're\n\n417\n00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:15,932\nusing SSH or\n\n418\n00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:20,038\nwhatever, and I wasn't doing that, that's\nwhy I didn't see the status message there.\n\n419\n00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,030\nSo, I am just gonna rerun this, this time.\n\n420\n00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,570\nAnd this time we'll see, there you go.\n\n421\n00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,680\n>> Yup.\n>> See how it's discovered router one and\n\n422\n00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,050\nit's up there,\nit's communicating and it's happy.\n\n423\n00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:35,800\nNow, I may not want OSPF to run\non every interface that I have.\n\n424\n00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,074\nSo, when I take a look at,\nwhoops [SOUND], oh my goodness.\n\n425\n00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:46,963\nSo, it's picking up a bunch of OSPF\nroutes here, when I do a show IP route\n\n426\n00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:51,705\nbecause OSPF is now running on our\ninternal, on our ITProTV network.\n\n427\n00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:56,702\nSo, it's picking a bunch of networks\nin our building which I don't really\n\n428\n00:22:56,702 --> 00:22:59,473\nwant here in the show,\nso what I can do is,\n\n429\n00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:04,635\nwhen I use a blanket wild card like this,\nit grabs every interface.\n\n430\n00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:09,453\nI can then go back and turn off OSPF\njust for individual interfaces and\n\n431\n00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:13,459\nwe can do that with the passive\ninterface command [SOUND].\n\n432\n00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,760\nLet me just figure out which\ninterface it is I need to turn off.\n\n433\n00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,218\nSo, our studio network is-\n>> 0.1.\n\n434\n00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:21,990\n0/1.\n\n435\n00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,507\n>> Okay.\n\n436\n00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,410\nPerfect.\n\n437\n00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,830\nSo, here inside of our\nrouter configuration,\n\n438\n00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,366\nI can just say, passive-interface fa0/1.\n\n439\n00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,158\nAnd what's that's going to do is,\n\n440\n00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:36,680\nit's going to do turn off\nOSPF on that interface.\n\n441\n00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,570\nSo, there,\nit just dropped our building switch.\n\n442\n00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,971\nAnd so, all of those other networks from\nhere inside of our building are gonna\n\n443\n00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:45,589\ndrop off.\n\n444\n00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,003\nAnd now, my [LAUGH] routing table\nwill be back to a normal size.\n\n445\n00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:53,785\nSo, I'm just gonna do a show IP protocols.\n\n446\n00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:57,524\nJust to verify, well,\nI still do show that gateway.\n\n447\n00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:01,235\nLet me do a show IP route.\n\n448\n00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:01,907\nOkay, much.\n\n449\n00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,370\n>> Yep. [LAUGH] >> Okay.\n\n450\n00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,820\nSo now I'm not getting all\nthose crazy building ones.\n\n451\n00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,595\nSo that passive interface command,\nthat is in the exam objective.\n\n452\n00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So one you need to be aware of.\n\n453\n00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,280\nAllows you to turn off OSPF for\na particular interface.\n\n454\n00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,270\nNow, it stops you from learning\nroutes in that interface.\n\n455\n00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,440\nBut you are still advertising that\nnetwork's existence into your environment.\n\n456\n00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,365\nYou would use the passive interface\ncommand on any interface that connects\n\n457\n00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:30,535\nto an ISP, on any interface that connects\nto a network with no other routers,\n\n458\n00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,535\nor on any interface where\nyou specifically don't\n\n459\n00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,145\nwant to connect to other routers,\nall right?\n\n460\n00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:38,920\nThose are the three scenarios where\nyou use the passive interface command.\n\n461\n00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,960\nAnd so I use it here cause I specifically\ndid not want to connect to that\n\n462\n00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,570\noffice switch.\n\n463\n00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,480\n>> Now Don,\nif you do that show IP protocols again,\n\n464\n00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,310\nwe've got one more objective that\nwe wanna take a look at here.\n\n465\n00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,960\nIn that third line underneath there,\nthe router ID.\n\n466\n00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,380\nHow do we determine that number?\n\n467\n00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,310\nThat's what we want to\ntry to figure out here.\n\n468\n00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,790\n>> OSPF uses router ID's to keep\ntrack of which routers are which and\n\n469\n00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,770\nthat's important because, since you\nhave total visibility of the network.\n\n470\n00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,720\nIf you see two paths,\n\n471\n00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,460\nhow do you know whether those two paths\npass through the same router or not.\n\n472\n00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,670\nIt can be confusing.\n\n473\n00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,430\nSo the router ID is what tells that.\n\n474\n00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,990\nThe router ID is automatically\ngenerated by OSPF.\n\n475\n00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,860\nAnd what it does is it looks at all of\nthe interfaces that are involved in OSPF.\n\n476\n00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,760\nAnd it picks the highest one, right?\n\n477\n00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,970\nThe highest IP address that's on\nyour system at the time OSPF starts.\n\n478\n00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,830\nRight?\nSo usually it's\n\n479\n00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,100\nwhen the router boots up that it does it.\n\n480\n00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,710\nAnd so\nthat's how it's picking out that ID.\n\n481\n00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,960\nNow if you're issuing network commands,\n\n482\n00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,440\nusually the very first one you enter in,\nit picks that up, and\n\n483\n00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,630\nthen your other network commands come\nafterwards, the router ID is already set.\n\n484\n00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,470\nSo you may end up with it being in\na lower one, so it can get confusing.\n\n485\n00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,740\nBut if you reboot the router or restart\nthe OSPF process, when it starts up,\n\n486\n00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,010\nit'll pick the highest IP on\nthe interfaces that are running OSPF.\n\n487\n00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,846\nYou can statically assign it, I like to\nstatically assign them sometimes just to\n\n488\n00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:11,466\nbe able to remember, it's really easy\nto do, you can just say router-id and\n\n489\n00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:16,971\nthen specify what you want it to be, so\nmaybe I want this one to be 192.168.2.1.\n\n490\n00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,990\nYou might as yourself, wait a minute Don.\n\n491\n00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,350\nThat's already the router ID,\nwhy would you do that?\n\n492\n00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,230\nBy manually putting it in, I can ensure\nthat this will always be the router ID.\n\n493\n00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,040\nIf I get a new higher IP or\nsomething like that this one will stick.\n\n494\n00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,380\n>> The only other way that\nthis is also done is.\n\n495\n00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,800\nIf you assign, we talked about\nloop back interfaces before.\n\n496\n00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,480\nIt always actually takes a look\nat a loop back interface and\n\n497\n00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,710\nwhatever the highest\nloop back interface is.\n\n498\n00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,530\nSo, when a router reboots, usually\nloop back interfaces are all ready on.\n\n499\n00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,830\nSo, that IP address is actually gonna\nbe there and a lot of times with OSPF.\n\n500\n00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,690\nThat means that's gonna\nbecome your router ID.\n\n501\n00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,360\nBut by manually setting it, it makes\nit easier for us to actually be able to\n\n502\n00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,140\nidentify, especially in a lab environment,\nit really helps.\n\n503\n00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,200\n>> All right, now there is one\nmore way to configure OSPF,\n\n504\n00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,820\nanother shortcut that I like.\n\n505\n00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,430\nThe first way I showed you was\nindividually listing each network,\n\n506\n00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,690\nthe second way I showed you was\nputting in a gigantic wildcard, and\n\n507\n00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,280\nthen doing exclusions\nwith passive interfaces.\n\n508\n00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,180\nThe third way is to manually configure\nOSPF on each interface that you\n\n509\n00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,720\nwant specifically, that way you don't\nneed the passive interface commands.\n\n510\n00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,620\nSo I'll do the third way over on router\nthree, let me jump over to router three.\n\n511\n00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,130\n>> Now, the advantage of what we're about\nto do here is actually pretty neat,\n\n512\n00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,480\nespecially if you're beginning with this,\n\n513\n00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,170\nif you get this opportunity to\non the exam, if they let you,\n\n514\n00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:40,280\nlet's put it that way, is the idea of\nhaving to determine that wildcard mass.\n\n515\n00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,720\nMay actually go away with this one.\n\n516\n00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,350\nThis is actually a very nice\nconfiguration here as we take a look.\n\n517\n00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,820\nActually, it's relatively\nintuitive by comparison.\n\n518\n00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,926\n>> On this system, for example,\nI might not want OSPF running on fa0/0,\n\n519\n00:27:55,926 --> 00:28:01,553\nbut maybe I do want it on fa0/1,\nand 1/0, and serial 2/0.\n\n520\n00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:06,075\nSo, I can go into my configuration, and\n\n521\n00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:11,129\nI can go into my interfaces, like FA0/1,\n\n522\n00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:17,114\nand on the interface itself\nI can say ip ospf area 0 and\n\n523\n00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:22,200\nthat will, apparently that's not right.\n\n524\n00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,140\n>> You need process number too I think.\n\n525\n00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,120\n>> Let's see.\n\n526\n00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,000\nOh, shoot.\nIt's IP OSPF 1 area zero, there we go.\n\n527\n00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,310\nSo I'm saying IP OSPF 1,\nthe process number, and then area zero.\n\n528\n00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,220\nThat's gonna put this\ninterface into area zero.\n\n529\n00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,380\nAnd then I can move to the next\ninterface which was 1/0.\n\n530\n00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,000\nAnd i can put that one into area zero,\nand then there was the serial interface.\n\n531\n00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,170\nWhat was that one?\n>> Two slash zero.\n\n532\n00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,940\n>> Was it two slash zero?\n\n533\n00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,500\nAnd I can put that one into area zero,\nokay?\n\n534\n00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,030\nBy doing that all three, and I didn't\nturn on my terminal monitor again,\n\n535\n00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,970\nbut now, all three of them\nare in the OSPF environment.\n\n536\n00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,490\nI don't need to do a passive\ninterface command, and\n\n537\n00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,700\nI didn't need to figure\nout any wild card masks.\n\n538\n00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,810\nSo this is usually the easiest and most\nspecific way to jump in and turn OSPF on.\n\n539\n00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,420\nThe other cool part about this is\nif I ever go and change the IP\n\n540\n00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,940\naddress of an interface, OSPF will turn\noff that interface regardless of its IP so\n\n541\n00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,870\nwhen you change the IP address,\nit's updated and fine.\n\n542\n00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,710\nSo it's a neat, flexible way.\n\n543\n00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,150\nThis is normally the way I\ndo without the field, but\n\n544\n00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,730\nall three methods are perfectly viable.\n\n545\n00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,335\nWhen I get out of config and\ndo a show IP protocols.\n\n546\n00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:41,940\nAll right?\n\n547\n00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,100\nI can see it up and running,\n\n548\n00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,580\nI can see that it's got its\nneighbors that are out there.\n\n549\n00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,313\nAnd I forgot to hard set my router ID,\nso let me get back in there and do that.\n\n550\n00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,360\nAnd then we'll be up, and good.\n\n551\n00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,290\nThere we go.\n\n552\n00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:04,440\nAll right, we've turned on OSPF and I\nshowed you three different ways to do it.\n\n553\n00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800\nIt wasn't so bad.\n\n554\n00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,960\nThe next thing we need to do is\nverify that it's working and\n\n555\n00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,020\nkinda see what it's doing.\n\n556\n00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,100\nBut, we're running right up on our\nbreak here so why don't we stop.\n\n557\n00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,110\nWe'll take a break.\n\n558\n00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,841\nWhen we get back, we'll continue to\ndelve a little more deeply into OSPF.\n\n559\n00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:19,421\nSounds good?\n\n560\n00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:20,149\n>> Sounds great.\n\n561\n00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,507\n>> All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n562\n00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:23,380\nWe'll be back after these messages.\n\n563\n00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:32,114\n[MUSIC]\n\n564\n00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,530\n>> Welcome back everybody.\n\n565\n00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,760\nSo before the break we did a pretty\nbasic OSPF implementation.\n\n566\n00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,570\nWe turn on OSPF.\n\n567\n00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,610\nI showed you guys three\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n568\n00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,480\nWhichever way makes you\nhappy is the way to go.\n\n569\n00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,190\nSo we did the long way, the short way,\nand even the shorter way.\n\n570\n00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,520\nAnd the one thing we didn't\ndo though was we didn't show\n\n571\n00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,060\nverifying that OSPF is working and\ntaking a look at the neat stuff it does.\n\n572\n00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,230\nSo let's do that right now.\n\n573\n00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,820\n>> Yeah.\n\n574\n00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,680\nWe want to get into some very basic\ncommands that you're gonna end\n\n575\n00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,260\nup seeing on the exam here.\n\n576\n00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,250\nAbout verifying the configuration of OSPF.\n\n577\n00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,952\nSo one of the very first\nthings I remember,\n\n578\n00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:08,620\nwhen I first time set it up here, I said,\nall right, it's gotta be working.\n\n579\n00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,950\nAnd I didn't get any\ncommands coming through.\n\n580\n00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,360\nSo one of the first commands that I\nactually ended up doing was the show IUP,\n\n581\n00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,530\nOSPF, neighbors is one of\nthe very first ones that I did.\n\n582\n00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,084\n>> Yes.\nSo let's look at our topology real quick\n\n583\n00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:26,347\nso we can see what to expect, and then we\nwill actually jump in and do the commands.\n\n584\n00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:30,617\nWe are going to look at router one,\nrouter one is not directly\n\n585\n00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:34,906\nconnected to 192.168.2 or 192.168.3.\n\n586\n00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:38,996\nSo it should be learning those via OSPF,\nlearning this network and\n\n587\n00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:42,219\nlearning this network is\nwhat should be happening.\n\n588\n00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:43,353\nSo we're gonna verify that and\n\n589\n00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:46,149\nwe'll run through some of the commands\nlike what Ronnie was talking about.\n\n590\n00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:49,331\nSo let me get back over to router one.\n\n591\n00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:54,040\nRight here, okay, so on router one,\nI'm gonna start with just show IP route.\n\n592\n00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,645\nThe easiest way to see if OSPF is working\nyou're like minus troubleshooting.\n\n593\n00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:59,920\n>> Right.\n>> If everything's working fine,\n\n594\n00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,410\nwe should see that we're\nlearning OSPF routes.\n\n595\n00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:09,030\nAnd I should see 192.168.2 and\n198.168.3 when I look at my routing table.\n\n596\n00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,303\nAnd so when I fire up my routing table,\nsure enough, right there 198.168.2 and\n\n597\n00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:19,490\n.3 and on the left side of\nthe screen I can see an O.\n\n598\n00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,530\nLetting me know that I\nlearned it via OSPF.\n\n599\n00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,890\nRight?\nAnd your legend up here at the top,\n\n600\n00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,350\nyou can hunt down the O.\n\n601\n00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,580\nNot the lowercase O, but the capital\nO which is apparently off my screen.\n\n602\n00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,610\nThere it is.\n\n603\n00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,320\nO is OSPF.\n\n604\n00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n605\n00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,780\n>> All right.\n\n606\n00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,896\nAnd I can do some quick tests and\ntry and ping those networks.\n\n607\n00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,600\nAll right.\n\n608\n00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,010\nThere's 2.1 and 3.1.\n\n609\n00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,940\nSo it looks like I've got connectivity\nto them which is a good sign.\n\n610\n00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,120\n>> Right.\n\n611\n00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,130\n>> But let's say that those\nrouters didn't show up there.\n\n612\n00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,030\nOkay.\nSo they weren't showing up in our output\n\n613\n00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,840\nso we can do like Ronnie said, right?\n\n614\n00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,260\nShow IP OSPF neighbor.\n\n615\n00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,490\nIt's a really cool command.\n\n616\n00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,550\nThis will show you what other\nOSPF routers you're talking to.\n\n617\n00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,285\nIn fact, let me back backtrack here.\n\n618\n00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:12,805\nIf I do a show IP protocols, in this\noutput down here where it says Gateway,\n\n619\n00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:14,795\nthese are other routers\nthat you're talking to, but\n\n620\n00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:17,285\nit doesn't give you a whole\nheck of a lot of information.\n\n621\n00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:22,370\nIf we do show IP OSPF neighbor,\nit gives us a little more.\n\n622\n00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,348\nIt tells us who the neighbor is.\n\n623\n00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:29,982\nAnd it was a little wider than my screen.\n\n624\n00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,577\nLet me rerun that.\n\n625\n00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,641\nThere we go.\nIt tells me who the neighbor is.\n\n626\n00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:36,000\nIt tells me what their dead time is..\n\n627\n00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,970\nIn other words how long it's\nbeen since I've heard from them.\n\n628\n00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,620\nWhat their IP address is.\n\n629\n00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,000\nAnd what interface I'm talking to them on.\n\n630\n00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,140\nAll right?\n\n631\n00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,350\nThere's also some other information\nin here like a priority in state.\n\n632\n00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,540\nAnd we don't really get into those for\nthe CCENT.\n\n633\n00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,070\nIn the CCNA you need to be aware of those.\n\n634\n00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:58,500\nBut basically on any kind of shared\nlink on an OSPF environment,\n\n635\n00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,890\nsomebody, some router,\nhas to be the master of that link.\n\n636\n00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,778\nAnd so you have what's called a designated\nrouter and a backup designated router and\n\n637\n00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:09,008\nother routers, and so they get those\nstate names attached to them, so\n\n638\n00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,150\nthat's what we're seeing there.\n\n639\n00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,020\nBut the important part for CCENT is\nthis first part, when you see full.\n\n640\n00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,280\nThat means that you have a full adjacency\nbetween you and the other router.\n\n641\n00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,630\nYou're exchanging routes and\neverything's good.\n\n642\n00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,034\nIf you see other things in there\nit usually indicates a problem.\n\n643\n00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:27,777\n>> Right.\n\n644\n00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:31,020\n>> All right, so\nthose are a couple of commands,\n\n645\n00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,000\nthere a few others that we could use but\nthose are the bulk of them.\n\n646\n00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,130\nOne I like to use.\n\n647\n00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,320\nIf you have a really big routing table,\n\n648\n00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,870\nshow IP route can show\nyou a ton of routes.\n\n649\n00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,810\nYou can add the keyword OSPF to\nthe end and when you do that,\n\n650\n00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,250\nit will only show you the OSPF routes.\n\n651\n00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,700\nSo there's another little shortcut\nthat I use when verifying OSPF.\n\n652\n00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,190\n>> Oh, and that actually brings us to a\nnice little point just right here, right?\n\n653\n00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,520\nWe really were looking just for\nthe 2.and the 3.network.\n\n654\n00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,020\nBut notice the very first\nline that we see in this, and\n\n655\n00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,630\nit actually shows two different routes for\nus and so\n\n656\n00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,650\nOSPF also does what we call\nequal cost load balancing, too.\n\n657\n00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,310\n>> Yeah, if we go back to the diagram,\nrouter one up here,\n\n658\n00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,140\nwhat it's doing is it's seeing\nthis network down here.\n\n659\n00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,840\nAnd there's two ways to get there.\n\n660\n00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,370\nOne way is to go through router two and\none way is to go through router three.\n\n661\n00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,580\nBoth of them are 100 megabit links.\n\n662\n00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,660\nSo at the end of the day it's got two\nways to get there and they're both equal.\n\n663\n00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,820\nSo what does it do?\n\n664\n00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,030\nSticks both routes in the routing table.\n\n665\n00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,010\nAnd then the router can load balance,\nand so it's load balancing\n\n666\n00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,210\nhalf the traffic to the 172.16.3\nnetwork will go through router two.\n\n667\n00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,510\nThe other half will go\nthrough router three.\n\n668\n00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,510\nIt takes advantage of\nthe links that are there.\n\n669\n00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,310\nReally really cool stuff.\n\n670\n00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,010\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n671\n00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,920\n>> All right, so OSPF is working\ngood here, it's up, we're happy.\n\n672\n00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,210\nNow let's show the really cool stuff.\n\n673\n00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,870\nOSPF is very, very fast.\n\n674\n00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,680\nIt will detect a failure\non the network and\n\n675\n00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,630\nupdate to reflect that failure,\nusually in under two seconds.\n\n676\n00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,490\nTwo seconds is extremely fast.\n\n677\n00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,736\nSo for example, right now I know\nthat I can get to the 192.168.2\n\n678\n00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:14,460\nnetwork by going through 172.16.1.2.\n\n679\n00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,635\nThat's router two.\n\n680\n00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,195\nLet me go back to my topology.\n\n681\n00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:22,175\nSo if router one wants to get\nto this network over here,\n\n682\n00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:26,745\nit knows that it can go right across\nthis link and over to router two, right.\n\n683\n00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:28,425\nSo, it's got that path.\n\n684\n00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:29,789\nThe path is right there.\n\n685\n00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,260\nAnd off we go.\n\n686\n00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,100\nOkay.\n\n687\n00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,880\nBut what if this link were to fail?\n\n688\n00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,570\nIf that link were to go offline then\n\n689\n00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,770\nOSPF will have to learn that it\ncan go the long way to get there.\n\n690\n00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,570\nOkay?\n\n691\n00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,905\nAnd it does that very, very quickly.\n\n692\n00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:48,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n693\n00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,870\nLet me jump back over to the routers,\nand we'll make that happen.\n\n694\n00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,710\nSo router one is just gonna stay and\nbe happy.\n\n695\n00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,590\nIt's routing over that\n171.116.1.2 interface.\n\n696\n00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,700\nSo let me get over to router two.\n\n697\n00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,190\nThat's not router two.\n\n698\n00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,920\nThat is.\n\n699\n00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,830\nOkay.\n\n700\n00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,970\nSo router one is connecting via\nthis link right here on FA0/0,\n\n701\n00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,409\nI'm gonna shut that interface down.\n\n702\n00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,737\nAll right.\n\n703\n00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:19,170\nSo I\"m gonna run a shutdown and\nthat's gonna down that link.\n\n704\n00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:25,060\nSo now router one has lost it's\nconnection that was in the routing table.\n\n705\n00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,700\nBut if I pull up my routing table again,\n\n706\n00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,423\nI can see 172.16.3.0 is still there,\n\n707\n00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:40,390\n192.168.2.0 is still there and\nnow it's routed a different way, okay.\n\n708\n00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,060\n>> All right.\n\n709\n00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:46,800\n>> Just a moment ago,\n192.168.2.0 was available\n\n710\n00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,020\nvia 172.16.1.2 out the FA0/0 interface.\n\n711\n00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,150\nNow, after the failure, it's available\nvia 172.16.2.3 out the FA0/1 interface.\n\n712\n00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,550\nIt flipped over to the other link.\n\n713\n00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,790\nTo be able to get there.\n\n714\n00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,870\nAnd I can see just now\nthe neighbors disappearing.\n\n715\n00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,780\nSo my dead timer expired.\n\n716\n00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,230\nBut if I try and ping that network,\nthere we go, I can still get to it.\n\n717\n00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,085\nThis was part of,\n\n718\n00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:18,310\nCisco did this huge marketing campaign\ncalled the self healing network.\n\n719\n00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,220\nAnd that's what this is.\n\n720\n00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,740\nThe network just healed itself.\n\n721\n00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,980\nThere's an outage.\n\n722\n00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,170\nIt routed around it.\n\n723\n00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,860\nSo your end user doesn't realize that\nit happened and your system stays up.\n\n724\n00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,650\n>> This is one of those big advantages of\ndoing this idea of that link state routing\n\n725\n00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,990\nwe were talking about.\n\n726\n00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:36,280\nWhere router one actually\nalready had the entire atlas,\n\n727\n00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,590\nthe entire network already in there.\n\n728\n00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,910\nAnd so when it went down it was\nactually able to go ahead and\n\n729\n00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,370\nretrieve it right away.\n\n730\n00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,930\nAnd able to put it back in and\nwe were ready to go.\n\n731\n00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n732\n00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,780\nAnd that's all done via what's\ncalled the link state database.\n\n733\n00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,650\nEach router is maintaining a database\nof all the links that are out there.\n\n734\n00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,690\nAnd it runs the shortest path first\nalgorithm against that database to\n\n735\n00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,440\nconstruct a map.\n\n736\n00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,530\nWhere that router is\nthe center of the universe.\n\n737\n00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,740\nAnd then it maps everything\nout from its perspective.\n\n738\n00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,300\nEach router in OSPF is doing that for\nitself,\n\n739\n00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,510\nmaking itself the center of the universe.\n\n740\n00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,840\nSo by doing that it gets\na better picture but\n\n741\n00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,650\nit is a little more CPU intensive and\nall that.\n\n742\n00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,070\nIf you're running a mid range or\nhigher router it does it no problem so\n\n743\n00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,480\nit's not really something\nthat we have to sweat.\n\n744\n00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,730\nBut you can actually see\nthe link state database,\n\n745\n00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,320\nit's not the easiest thing\nin the world to read.\n\n746\n00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,370\nBy doing show IP OSPF Database.\n\n747\n00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,630\nThere it is.\n\n748\n00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,440\nWhoops.\nDatavase.\n\n749\n00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,430\nIt's a pot, it's got flowers in it.\n\n750\n00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,321\nAnd there we go.\n\n751\n00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:39,243\nSo if I do a show IP OSPF database, here's\nthe various links that are in the network.\n\n752\n00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,808\nAnd so as it goes down the line I can see\nsome of the routers that it's talked to\n\n753\n00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,444\nand the links that it's learned.\n\n754\n00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,836\nAnd so it's got unpopulated in here.\n\n755\n00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:52,100\nSo I can see the 192.168.1, 2, and\n3 routers that are participating in OSPF.\n\n756\n00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,785\nAnd if I jump to each\nof the other routers.\n\n757\n00:39:54,785 --> 00:39:56,180\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> They should have the same thing.\n\n758\n00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,080\nIt should be converged.\n\n759\n00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,520\nThey should all have the same data.\n\n760\n00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, let's see.\n\n761\n00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,530\nWhat else do we have?\n\n762\n00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,340\nOh, and it'll recover from the outage so\non Router 2,\n\n763\n00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,620\nif I bring that interface back up again,\nthe interface is gonna come up and\n\n764\n00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,550\nRouter 1 is going to\nredirect back over it again.\n\n765\n00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:25,260\nSo when I do that show IP route OSPF,\nright now it's routing that over Fa0/1.\n\n766\n00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,570\nAnd if I give it just a moment,\nit's going to detect that new route and\n\n767\n00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,140\nit will flip back to being\nover at phase 0/0 again.\n\n768\n00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,520\nNow it doesn't do it instantly\nbecause the routers have what's called\n\n769\n00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,810\nflat protection.\n\n770\n00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,560\nSometimes you can have\na route that's unstable.\n\n771\n00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,220\nIt comes up and goes back down,\ncomes up and goes back down.\n\n772\n00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,020\nSo, it doesn't want to\nfail over immediately.\n\n773\n00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,530\nIt uses a hold down timer to say\nI'm gonna hold that route down.\n\n774\n00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,440\nI'm gonna suppress it until\nI'm sure it's stable.\n\n775\n00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,540\nI don't remember, is it 30 seconds or\n60 seconds on the default timer?\n\n776\n00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,370\nI don't remember that one\non the default timer.\n\n777\n00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,120\n>> I don't either.\n\n778\n00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,700\nLet me see.\n\n779\n00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,430\nI'm running a command here show ipospf1\n\n780\n00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,710\nthat gives you all the detailed\ninformation about that OSPF process.\n\n781\n00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,160\nAnd in here you can find the downtimers.\n\n782\n00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,103\nAnd so you'll see, like, how often it runs\nthe algorithm, every 5 seconds, and so on.\n\n783\n00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:19,763\nAnd in here somewhere,\nwe'll find the hold downtimers.\n\n784\n00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,860\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n785\n00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,948\nBy the time I find it,\nwe'll have exceeded the timer.\n\n786\n00:41:24,948 --> 00:41:25,596\n[LAUGH].\n\n787\n00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:26,244\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n788\n00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,938\n>> That's how it normally works at least.\n\n789\n00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:32,690\n>> Is that 10,000 milliseconds,\nwas that what it was up above?\n\n790\n00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,930\n>> Oh, did I go past it.\n\n791\n00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,963\n>> I don't know.\n>> Up there where it says,\n\n792\n00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:39,220\nnum hold town between 2 consecutive SPFs.\n\n793\n00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,740\n>> That's just in between\nrunning the algorithm.\n\n794\n00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,620\n>> Okay.\n>> Well running\n\n795\n00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,170\nthe algorithm is where it'll find it, so.\n\n796\n00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,870\nWell anyhow, I'm sure it's done by now.\n\n797\n00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,300\nLet's go ahead and look.\n\n798\n00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,140\nAnd yup, sure enough.\n\n799\n00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140\n192, 168, flipped over to fa0/0.\n\n800\n00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,640\nSo just enough time passes to make\n\n801\n00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,310\nsure that everything's stable, flips over,\nand now we're routing back over that way.\n\n802\n00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,110\nSo the router heals itself.\n\n803\n00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,780\nIt works around the failure.\n\n804\n00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,580\nAnd then when you fix the failure,\nthe router rights itself again.\n\n805\n00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,160\nPuts it back to the way that it was,\nand it's up and it's happy.\n\n806\n00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,670\nAll right now, all of that so\nfar has really all been IP version 4.\n\n807\n00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:21,130\nBut for the exam, Cisco does want us to\nbe familiar with IP version 6 also, okay?\n\n808\n00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:25,180\nAnd IP version 6,\nnot very difficult to get configured,\n\n809\n00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,470\nbut we do need to assign some IP addresses\nand some other things to get in place.\n\n810\n00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,680\nSo if we want to run IPv6 in our network,\n\n811\n00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,920\nwe are gonna have to\ncreate some entries here.\n\n812\n00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,190\nWe don't have any IPv6 addresses\nassigned to these routers.\n\n813\n00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,200\nSo we need to do that.\n\n814\n00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,930\nMaybe we'll do that during the instead\nof kinda drawing it out here.\n\n815\n00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,190\nHave we tackled all the OSPF\nstuff as far as IPv4?\n\n816\n00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,400\nLet me just check my objectives here.\n\n817\n00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,700\nWe did router IDs, we did passive\ninterfaces, we talked about single area.\n\n818\n00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,220\nThe only thing we really didn't\nmention was like debugging OSPF.\n\n819\n00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,850\nIf OSPF is working right, if everything\nis working the way that it's supposed to,\n\n820\n00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,730\nyou don't really have to do much, right?\n\n821\n00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,570\nBut if something goes wrong and\n\n822\n00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,270\nyou have to troubleshoot it,\nthere's several debug commands we can run.\n\n823\n00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,860\nAnd the debug commands are really\nneat because it let's you see stuff\n\n824\n00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,520\nthat's going on in the background\nthat you don't normally see.\n\n825\n00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,800\nSo for example debug IP ospf.\n\n826\n00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,420\nAnd then you can limit it by\nprocess number if you want.\n\n827\n00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,010\nADJ this is the one that I normally use.\n\n828\n00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,380\nIf for some reason 2 routers\naren't talking to each other.\n\n829\n00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:42,160\nIf I debug their OSPF information and\nI tell it to show me adjacency data.\n\n830\n00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,450\nThat'll show me what i'm trying to with\nthe neighbor and if there is an issue,\n\n831\n00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,540\nit will usually tell me what the issue is,\nso that I can fix it.\n\n832\n00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,640\nSo, for example,\nI'm going to turn on that debugging and\n\n833\n00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,970\nI'm going to create an issue,\nlet me jump over to router two and\n\n834\n00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,290\nI need to mess with 00 [INAUDIBLE]\nI'm\n\n835\n00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,800\ngonna put this one in\na different area number.\n\n836\n00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,700\nSo I'm gonna take router 2 and\nmove it to area 5.\n\n837\n00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,720\nAll of our other routers are in area 0.\n\n838\n00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,910\nSo I'm gonna have an area mismatch, okay?\n\n839\n00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,750\nSo when I do that,\nthat link is gonna go down.\n\n840\n00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,869\nAnd back over here,\nwhere I'm doing my debugging.\n\n841\n00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,260\nYou know what I should do, I should shut\nthe interface down, well, there we go.\n\n842\n00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,690\nI can see right here, I just received\na packet from 172.16.1.2, that's router 2.\n\n843\n00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,410\nI'm in area 0 and I'm getting a mismatch.\n\n844\n00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,520\nThe area I'm receiving\nis area 5 in the header.\n\n845\n00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,180\nOkay?\n\n846\n00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,290\nAnd so now I can see.\n\n847\n00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,840\nSo I might be saying, hey,\nwhy am I not building up an adjacency?\n\n848\n00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:53,428\nWhy, when I pull up my OSPF neighbors,\ndo I not see router 2?\n\n849\n00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:54,039\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n850\n00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:54,860\n>> All right?\n\n851\n00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,170\nI turn on my debug, and here, I can see\nthose packets coming in every 10 seconds.\n\n852\n00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,460\nOSPF defaults sends hello\nmessage every 10 seconds.\n\n853\n00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,550\nSo every 10 seconds I'm getting\na message from that other router and\n\n854\n00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,210\nthe header's not matching.\n\n855\n00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,400\nSo I can look right there,\nI can see I've got this area mismatch.\n\n856\n00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,550\nI can go and fix it.\n\n857\n00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,330\nI almost put the wrong area back in.\n\n858\n00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:19,240\nI can fix it and as soon as it fixes,\n\n859\n00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,100\nhere I can see the full data as that\nneighbor relationship comes back up.\n\n860\n00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,310\nSo, I can see the router ID,\nI can see the elections that occur,\n\n861\n00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,930\nI can see the link state coming up,\nI can see receiving the database.\n\n862\n00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,030\nThe database delta from the other side.\n\n863\n00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,300\nSo we're exchanging information and\nI see a lot of that stuff that's\n\n864\n00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,610\ngoing on in the background that's not\nnormally right here visible for us.\n\n865\n00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,050\nAnd actually Don this may be a good\ntime to bring up the very fact,\n\n866\n00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,940\nthere's just a few elements\nthat are required to insure\n\n867\n00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,130\nthat the routers actually\ndo become neighbors.\n\n868\n00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,250\nAnd right here,\nwe show one of them, right.\n\n869\n00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,980\nThe idea that the area number.\n\n870\n00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,110\n>> Yes.\n>> Has to actually be there.\n\n871\n00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:02,180\nThere is one that I can't reminder but\nthe hello times, and\n\n872\n00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,940\nthe dead timer on each one\nhas to actually match.\n\n873\n00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,080\nAs well.\n>> Yeah, you know hello and dead timers,\n\n874\n00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,400\nthey're pretty important.\n\n875\n00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,880\nThe hello timer, or\n\n876\n00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,430\ninterval it's kinda both ways, is how\noften your router introduces itself.\n\n877\n00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,040\nAnd by default OSPF does every 10 seconds.\n\n878\n00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,230\nIf you have another router that's out\nthere that's set to something different,\n\n879\n00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,970\nthen they can't become neighbors.\n\n880\n00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,050\nThe hello timer has to match.\n\n881\n00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,230\nYou also have the dead timer and\n\n882\n00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,870\nthe dead timer is normally three times\nthe hello interval and it basically just\n\n883\n00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,980\nsays if I miss 3 hello messages then\nI'll consider the neighbor to be dead.\n\n884\n00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,900\nAll right?\n\n885\n00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,420\nWell, 3 times 10 seconds is 30 seconds.\n\n886\n00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,380\nSo normally after 30 seconds we\nflag the neighbor as being offline.\n\n887\n00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,680\nOkay, so\nthat's kind of the way it happens.\n\n888\n00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,910\nIf there is a mismatch, if those numbers\naren't the same, then it breaks, right?\n\n889\n00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,640\nAnd things don't communicate properly.\n\n890\n00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,372\nAnd let's see if I can\nremember how to set that, it's\n\n891\n00:46:55,372 --> 00:47:01,340\nthe shoot, IP OSPF is it dead interval or\nhello interval.\n\n892\n00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,830\nDead interval.\n\n893\n00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,610\n>> Hello and dead right there.\n\n894\n00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n895\n00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,680\n>> So if I come in here and I change these\nthings, and I set the hello interval to 30\n\n896\n00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,070\nseconds, and I set the dead interval to,\nwe'll set it to 90 seconds.\n\n897\n00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:17,770\nOkay.\n\n898\n00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:21,010\nSo here on router 2 I've just\nadjusted those intervals.\n\n899\n00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,150\nAnd back here on Router 1, that neighbor\nadjacency is gonna try to build up.\n\n900\n00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,805\nYou know what, the adjacency's already\nin place, that's not gonna take effect.\n\n901\n00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,988\nI'm gonna shut the interface down.\n\n902\n00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:36,680\nIf the adjacency's already up,\nthey've already agreed on their terms.\n\n903\n00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,421\nSo I'm just gonna turn it off and\nthen turn it back on again.\n\n904\n00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:44,350\nAssuming I'm still in the right interface.\n\n905\n00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,710\nI never saw an interface down\nmessage over here on router one.\n\n906\n00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,600\nThere we go.\n\n907\n00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,170\nSo I see the neighbor dying.\n\n908\n00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,370\nHere, I see the link trying to come up.\n\n909\n00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,170\n>> And there it is, neighbor down.\n\n910\n00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:00,380\n>> And, you know what?\n\n911\n00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,020\nI'm gonna debug a little more.\n\n912\n00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,690\nThe dead interval.\n\n913\n00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,960\nThat might be being checked before\nthe adjacency even tries to build up.\n\n914\n00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,780\nSo, you can go a little further, and\nI think it's packet that I'm looking for.\n\n915\n00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,230\nYep, debug IPOS Packet.\n\n916\n00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,920\nNow I'll see the raw packets as they\ncome through, and every ten seconds,\n\n917\n00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,000\nrouter two should be sending me a packet,\nand\n\n918\n00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,810\nI should see that the intervals don't\nmatch, and we should get a failure.\n\n919\n00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,170\nAnd that should be on FA0/0\non this router, right?\n\n920\n00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,660\n>> Yes, I think it's what it is.\n\n921\n00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,700\n>> So we might have to wait a few\nseconds before that happens.\n\n922\n00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,410\nOr we might just not.\n\n923\n00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:38,800\nDid I, I'll just make sure\nthat's in the right area.\n\n924\n00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,538\nI may have screwed it up.\n\n925\n00:48:39,538 --> 00:48:43,500\n[LAUGH] There comes one.\n\n926\n00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:49,050\nSo I just received an LSA or\na hello message from the other router.\n\n927\n00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,750\nAnd when you look inside of these messages\nhere, it's got a bunch of data in here but\n\n928\n00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,250\nit actually has information on there\nas far as the version of OSP, and so\n\n929\n00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,580\non, the router ID.\n\n930\n00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,660\nSo I can see it got the message.\n\n931\n00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,240\nIt's not getting upset about it though,\nis it.\n\n932\n00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,960\nIt seems to have come to terms with\nthose intervals being different.\n\n933\n00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,920\n>> I think once it's dead it just stopped.\n\n934\n00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n935\n00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,122\nYeah, it's not building up the adjacency,\nbut it's not complaining about it either.\n\n936\n00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:24,259\nLet's see.\n\n937\n00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,138\nHere.\n\n938\n00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:31,254\nI'm just adding hello debugging so\nwe can get that information, and, so\n\n939\n00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:35,430\nhere's some hellos, or that's me sending\nhellos, let's wait for us to receive some.\n\n940\n00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,430\n>> There's a received, but\nit's from the other router.\n\n941\n00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,100\n>> But it's from router 3, yeah.\n\n942\n00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,820\nLet's wait until we receive some\nfrom router 2, there we go.\n\n943\n00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,940\nMismatched hello parameters.\n\n944\n00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:48,030\nAnd I can see right here the dead I\nreceived a 90 but mine is set to 40.\n\n945\n00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,810\nThe hello I received a 30 but\nmine is set to 10.\n\n946\n00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,850\nSo it's right there in the debug output.\n\n947\n00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,610\nAnd so\nit makes it real easy to troubleshoot.\n\n948\n00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,580\nYou wouldn't normally see this, you would\nsee like the neighbors just not showing\n\n949\n00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,490\nup, but\nyou throw some debug commands on there and\n\n950\n00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,070\nthen it's right there in the debug\noutput so it's pretty handy.\n\n951\n00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:13,070\n>> And there's one more command while we\nhave time, the Show IP/SPF, is interfaces?\n\n952\n00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,110\nInterface?\n>> I think it's just interface.\n\n953\n00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:15,930\nIs there an s on it?\n\n954\n00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,110\nYeah, it's just interface.\n\n955\n00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,090\n>> Okay.\nYeah.\n\n956\n00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,720\nThis is where we can actually go in and\nsee if you actually take a look at\n\n957\n00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,830\nthe line on the left, it says,\ntimer intervals configured.\n\n958\n00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,720\nAnd so the original one here, Don,\n\n959\n00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,310\nthe one that we didn't configure,\nis 10 and 40 on the hello and dead timer?\n\n960\n00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:32,960\nIs that right?\n>> Yeah,\n\n961\n00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,030\nI think I said three times earlier\napparently it's four times, so if you miss\n\n962\n00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,196\nfour of them it'll flag it as dead.n\n>> And so for us this is important,\n\n963\n00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:44,450\nbecause this means that we can go over\nto the other interface and compare.\n\n964\n00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:49,330\nAnd we can see if the area is actually\nthe same, hello and dead timer.\n\n965\n00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,370\nI know that there's two,\nif we're doing authentication.\n\n966\n00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,260\n>> The authentication key.\n\n967\n00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,370\n>> The authentication and\nI think they call it a stub area flag or\n\n968\n00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,010\nsomething like that.\n\n969\n00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,904\nYeah, we're not worried about that.\n\n970\n00:50:58,904 --> 00:50:59,821\n>> For another show.\n\n971\n00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:00,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> But for us\n\n972\n00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,570\n>> We have to at least at this point on\n\n973\n00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,810\nthe CCNT, area and\nthe hello and dead timers.\n\n974\n00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,350\nYou wanna make sure that at\nleast those are actually up.\n\n975\n00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,060\nUsually the other ones we\nkind of are doing anyways.\n\n976\n00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,880\n>> And I can see right here where they\ndon't match and so I can just go in and\n\n977\n00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,400\nput them back.\n\n978\n00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,686\nSo, the Hello interval was 10 and\nthe Dead interval was 40.\n\n979\n00:51:21,686 --> 00:51:24,760\nWe can put them back and\nthat will make it happy.\n\n980\n00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,400\nAnd within a short period of time,\n\n981\n00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,810\nwe should see that come\nback up here in router 1.\n\n982\n00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n983\n00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,370\n>> Well, Ronnie, let's stop here.\n\n984\n00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,130\nIt actually already came up that fast.\n\n985\n00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,720\nLet's stop here.\n\n986\n00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,360\nAnd when we get back,\n\n987\n00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,420\nduring the break we'll through some\nIPv6 addresses on these turkeys.\n\n988\n00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,970\nAnd when we get back\nwe're gonna show that.\n\n989\n00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,280\nIt really is basically the same\nprocess just with longer addresses so\n\n990\n00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,750\nwe'll get a chance to see that.\n\n991\n00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,530\nAnd yeah we'll cruise from there.\n\n992\n00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,261\n>> So you think anything else we\ncan throw them before the break?\n\n993\n00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:54,080\n>> No.\nI think we're ready to go IPv6.\n\n994\n00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,460\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen\nwe're gonna stop and take a break.\n\n995\n00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,323\nStay tuned for\nmore OSPF action after these messages.\n\n996\n00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:08,773\n[MUSIC]\n\n997\n00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:10,460\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n998\n00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,580\nSo during the break, I undertook the\ninfinitely pleasurable tech challenge of\n\n999\n00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,560\nassigning IPv6 addresses to our\ninterfaces, so we're all IPv6 up now.\n\n1000\n00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,860\n>> That's right.\n\n1001\n00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:28,520\n>> The OSPF implementation we did before\nthe break, that was strictly IPv4.\n\n1002\n00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,400\nSo I left that running,\ncuz it didn't hurt anything.\n\n1003\n00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,001\nBut it doesn't do anything with IPv6.\n\n1004\n00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:39,403\nThe cool thing though is when it comes\nto implementing IPv6, or OSPF for IPv6,\n\n1005\n00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:43,225\nit's really the same commands,\njust anywhere you would have typed IP\n\n1006\n00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:44,029\nbefore,\n>> IP\n\n1007\n00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:44,933\n>> You type IPV6 now.\n\n1008\n00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:46,003\n>> That's it.\n\n1009\n00:52:46,003 --> 00:52:49,955\n>> Now, there is one real important thing\nthat I want to mention before we get\n\n1010\n00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:50,543\nstarted.\n\n1011\n00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,186\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1012\n00:52:51,186 --> 00:52:51,940\n>> Cisco routers support IPV6.\n\n1013\n00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,605\n>> [LAUGH] Mm-hm.\n\n1014\n00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,728\n>> Most of them, not all of them.\n\n1015\n00:52:56,728 --> 00:53:01,080\nBut even on the ones where it's supported,\nit's not turned on by default.\n\n1016\n00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,070\n>> Right.\n>> So you've got to turn on IPV6\n\n1017\n00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,800\nrouting if you expect\nyour router to do it.\n\n1018\n00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,600\nIf we take a look at router 1 here.\n\n1019\n00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:11,880\nAnd I do a show IP.\n\n1020\n00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,690\nOh, I guess, I already did it.\n\n1021\n00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,410\nSo, I do a show IPv6 route and\nI get a bunch of routes.\n\n1022\n00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,790\nIf you run show IPv6 route, and\n\n1023\n00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,195\nnotice that just like show IP route but\nI add v6 to the end.\n\n1024\n00:53:23,195 --> 00:53:28,704\nIf it comes back with no routes, you're\nlikely missing one important command\n\n1025\n00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:35,020\nwhich is if you're gonna do IPv6 routing,\nyou need to issue the IPv6-unicast.\n\n1026\n00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,270\nRouting command, or unicast-routing.\n\n1027\n00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,730\nThere we go, command.\n\n1028\n00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:42,040\nThat tells the router to do it and\nto populate that routing table.\n\n1029\n00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,180\n>> And this is very important.\n\n1030\n00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,650\nIt has to be the first command\nif we're gonna be turning on\n\n1031\n00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,280\nany routing protocol for IPv6, and\n\n1032\n00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,660\nthis is true for OSPF, as well as\nsome other ones that we're gonna see.\n\n1033\n00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,010\nSo now that Don already\nhas all the IPv6 addresses\n\n1034\n00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,770\nthat he's actually come up\nwith here on our routers.\n\n1035\n00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,690\nYeah, and so IPv6 addresses they're long.\n\n1036\n00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,810\nThey're kind of frustrating.\n\n1037\n00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,780\nSo that's why I did it during the break\ninstead of making you guys have to type\n\n1038\n00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,100\nall this junk in here.\n\n1039\n00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,755\nBut basically I created these links and\njust like with the older\n\n1040\n00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:21,060\n192.168 stuff here we've\ngot the same basic idea.\n\n1041\n00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,230\nEach router is connected to it's\nown network, should be 2000 and\n\n1042\n00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,070\nthen the router number.\n\n1043\n00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:31,760\nSo this number is connected\nto 2000 1 1 1 1:: whatever.\n\n1044\n00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,020\nRouter two is connected\nto 2000222:: whatever and\n\n1045\n00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:42,673\nrouter three is connected\nto 2000333:: whatever.\n\n1046\n00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:43,650\nSo, this router,\n\n1047\n00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,680\nrouter one is not directly connected\nto those other two networks.\n\n1048\n00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,430\nIf I wanna see them, I'm gonna need\nto fire up OSPF on my interfaces, and\n\n1049\n00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,480\nget it up and running.\n\n1050\n00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n1051\n00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,490\nNow don't forget, we could actually ask\nDon to go ahead and do the static route.\n\n1052\n00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,093\nNow, we're not gonna do it.\n\n1053\n00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,106\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm joking.\n\n1054\n00:54:58,106 --> 00:55:00,590\n[LAUGH] OSPF is probably the way that\nwe're gonna actually really want to work\n\n1055\n00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,300\nwith this instead.\n\n1056\n00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> This just went from a two hour\n\n1057\n00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,300\nepisode to a two day episode if I'm\ngonna have to type all that junk in.\n\n1058\n00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,660\n>> Oh, no!\n[LAUGH] So, all right.\n\n1059\n00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,230\nSo dynamic grounding protocols,\nreally handy with IPv6, cuz again,\n\n1060\n00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,860\nit is less typing for us.\n\n1061\n00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,120\nTo get IPv6's version of OSPF up and\n\n1062\n00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,730\nrunning, the commands are pretty\nstraightforward, okay?\n\n1063\n00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:22,121\nIn fact it's even easier\nthan under version four.\n\n1064\n00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,328\n>> Yeah.\n\n1065\n00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:26,010\n>> I showed you three ways\nto configure version four.\n\n1066\n00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,431\nThe last way I showed you is the way\nthat I kinda do it out in the field.\n\n1067\n00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:31,171\nWhere you assign it on\nthe actual interface.\n\n1068\n00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:33,897\nWell in IPv6 land, that's how you do it.\n\n1069\n00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,963\nSo that makes life easy.\n\n1070\n00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:40,452\nBasically, I just need to look\nat my [SOUND] interfaces and\n\n1071\n00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:44,205\nwhoops, I'm in config so\nI need my do command.\n\n1072\n00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:48,225\nI need to look at my interfaces and\nsee which ones are running IPv6, and\n\n1073\n00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:51,180\nthen I just need to go and\nturn OSPF on for those guys.\n\n1074\n00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,330\nSo, I can get into interface fa0/0.\n\n1075\n00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,823\nWhere I can say IPv6, OSPF,\nand a process number and\n\n1076\n00:55:57,823 --> 00:56:03,505\nI'll just continue using that same process\nnumber, process number one, area zero.\n\n1077\n00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:08,497\nAnd so, I'm putting this interface\ninto area zero but instead of just IP,\n\n1078\n00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:09,380\nI say IPv6.\n\n1079\n00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,120\nBefore the break, we just did IP.\n\n1080\n00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,591\nAnd then, I'll do that for each of the\nother interfaces that I'm running IPv6 on.\n\n1081\n00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:19,490\nSo, I'm just gonna go through and\nspecify those.\n\n1082\n00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,222\nThe other one is 1/1.\n\n1083\n00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:32,110\nAnd so, now, all three interfaces have\nOSPF turned on for them for IPv6.\n\n1084\n00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,015\n>> And just for verification for us,\n\n1085\n00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,898\nthe same things that we're doing\nearlier like the show IP protocols.\n\n1086\n00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:41,448\nAgain, instead,\nit would be like show IPv6 protocols,\n\n1087\n00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:44,850\nand that would actually help us out here.\n\n1088\n00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,860\nAnd there you go.\n>> Yep.\n\n1089\n00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,580\nSo, we are running an OSPF instance for\nIPv6.\n\n1090\n00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,170\nIt's on for these interfaces.\n\n1091\n00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,231\nIt's got no neighbors.\n>> Yep.\n\n1092\n00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:57,676\n>> It's just sitting there, so\nif I say [SOUND] like that.\n\n1093\n00:56:57,676 --> 00:56:58,907\nWas it not neighbor?\n\n1094\n00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,539\nOh, I spelled it European style.\n\n1095\n00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:04,013\nLook at that, all like cultured.\n\n1096\n00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:04,720\n>> That's right.\n\n1097\n00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:11,570\n>> [LAUGH] So anyhow, we can punch it in,\nand I have no neighbors.\n\n1098\n00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,870\nSo, I just need to repeat the process\non the other two routers.\n\n1099\n00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,070\n>> Now, before we go on there, Don,\n\n1100\n00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,870\nif we take a look at the show\nIPv6 protocols there.\n\n1101\n00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,320\nNotice the Router ID Number.\n\n1102\n00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,130\nThis is by far the strange one here.\n\n1103\n00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:22,650\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1104\n00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n1105\n00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,290\nWe would expect that it would\nbe an IPv6 number, but it's not.\n\n1106\n00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,960\nThey actually still keep with\nthe little 32-bit number.\n\n1107\n00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,090\n>> Yeah.\nThe router ID is a 32-bit number.\n\n1108\n00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,960\nAnd that's where it gets confusing\ncuz it looks like an IP address,\n\n1109\n00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,100\nbut it's actually not an IP address\n>> You can make it\n\n1110\n00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,330\nall sorts of things that you wouldn't\nnormally we allowed to have.\n\n1111\n00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,590\nSo, for example,\nI can do a router ID of 127.0.0.1, and\n\n1112\n00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:47,520\nit will be perfectly valid, cuz it looks\nlike an IP, but at the end of the day,\n\n1113\n00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,639\nit is just a number,\nit's not an IP address.\n\n1114\n00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,406\n>> Yeah.\nSo, regardless of whether an IP version 4\n\n1115\n00:57:53,406 --> 00:57:57,420\nor IP version 6,\nthe router ID looks the same.\n\n1116\n00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,355\nAnd usually in IPv6, they do recommend\nthat you set that, but you don't have to.\n\n1117\n00:58:01,355 --> 00:58:05,342\n[LAUGH] If it finds an IP address\non the interface, it'll pull it up.\n\n1118\n00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:08,631\n>> [SOUND] So, I'm just gonna jump over to\nrouter two and repeat the same process.\n\n1119\n00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:15,590\nGoing into each interface that has\nan IPv6 address and turning on OSPF.\n\n1120\n00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:19,418\nSo, I need, let's see, zero zero and\none zero and the serial interface.\n\n1121\n00:58:19,418 --> 00:58:26,059\n[SOUND] So, there's zero zero.\n\n1122\n00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:28,103\nAnd I said, what, one zero?\n\n1123\n00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:30,483\n>> Already loading it up here.\n\n1124\n00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,284\n>> And then, the serial interface.\n\n1125\n00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,300\nOkay.\n\n1126\n00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,970\nSo, we did get a neighbor message there\nsaying that we are seeing somebody\n\n1127\n00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:45,950\nout there.\n\n1128\n00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,950\nSo, we're seeing somebody.\n\n1129\n00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,110\nWe're involved.\n\n1130\n00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:55,280\nAnd if I do a show IPv6 OSPF neighbor,\nI do have a neighbor that's out there.\n\n1131\n00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,130\nSo I've got that built\nup on that interface.\n\n1132\n00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:04,140\nAnd if I do a show IPv6 protocols,\nI can see that I'm up.\n\n1133\n00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,960\nI don't have any gateways in the list yet,\n\n1134\n00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,310\nthe route exchange must\nnot have happened yet.\n\n1135\n00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,570\nSo, anyhow, we can be patient on that.\n\n1136\n00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,370\nSo, I'm gonna jump over and\ntackle router three next.\n\n1137\n00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:19,015\nYou know what, on router two I\ndidn't do IPv6 unicast routing?\n\n1138\n00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:22,367\n[SOUND] Let me explain why I\nwasn't exchanging routes there, so\n\n1139\n00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:24,148\nwe'll just throw that in there.\n\n1140\n00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:27,858\nAnd then, on router three,\nI will rinse and repeat.\n\n1141\n00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:35,363\n[SOUND] Just turning all of this on.\n\n1142\n00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,632\n[SOUND] Let's see, so\n\n1143\n00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:43,362\nwe need 0/1 we need 1/0.\n\n1144\n00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:47,031\nAnd we need the serial interface.\n\n1145\n00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:59,476\n[INAUDIBLE] I can type really,\nI can sometimes.\n\n1146\n00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:03,627\nYou know what,\nit's gonna drive me nuts isn't it?\n\n1147\n01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:07,501\nThere.\n\n1148\n01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:12,444\nSo, normally we do the IPv6 unicast\nrouting command first cuz that kinda turns\n\n1149\n01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:14,240\non that processing.\n\n1150\n01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,290\nI did it last, which is fine.\n\n1151\n01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:16,970\nIt works.\n\n1152\n01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,640\nBut the whole thing doesn't work\nuntil I issue that command.\n\n1153\n01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,685\nThat's why we normally issue it first,\nI just forgot and did it at the end there.\n\n1154\n01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,750\nSo, I forgot even-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1155\n01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,160\n>> Though we just talked about it less\n\n1156\n01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,510\nthan two minutes ago.\n\n1157\n01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,220\nIt escaped my mind.\n\n1158\n01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,260\nSo, there we go.\n\n1159\n01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,990\nSo, this guy's got two neighbors.\n\n1160\n01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,080\nI'm on router three,\nit's seeing routers two and\n\n1161\n01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,310\nrouter one out the various interfaces.\n\n1162\n01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,520\nAnd we should be exchanging\nsome routes by now.\n\n1163\n01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,170\nI'm gonna jump back to router one and\njust take a look at our routing table.\n\n1164\n01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,710\nIf I wanna see, oh I still have,\ndo I have debugging turned on or\n\n1165\n01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,825\nsomething, what is this?\n\n1166\n01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:55,298\n[CROSSTALK] That's from-\n>> No, it's actually saying from-\n\n1167\n01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:55,819\n>> I think, yeah,\n\n1168\n01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,720\nit's actually getting bad checks on.\n\n1169\n01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,210\nSo, looks like I got a corrupt\npacket in there at some point.\n\n1170\n01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,710\nWe'll see, it'll probably work itself out.\n\n1171\n01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:06,390\nBut now that it's there,\nwe should be up, we should be running,\n\n1172\n01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:07,880\nlet's take a look at this routing table.\n\n1173\n01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,220\nNormally, I would say show IP route\nto see the IPv4 routing table.\n\n1174\n01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,730\nBut what I wanna see is\nthe IPv6 routing table, so\n\n1175\n01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,120\nI just add v6 to the end of that.\n\n1176\n01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,620\nShow IPv6 route.\n\n1177\n01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,478\nAnd I can see my routing table.\n\n1178\n01:01:19,478 --> 01:01:20,180\n>> There it is.\n\n1179\n01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:27,010\n>> What I'm looking for\nis the 2000:222 network.\n\n1180\n01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,830\nAnd the 2000:333 network.\n\n1181\n01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:30,780\nThere they are.\n\n1182\n01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,570\nThey've got an O to the left of them, that\nlet's me know I learned them via OSPF.\n\n1183\n01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:40,537\nAnd they're out the various\ninterfaces that are out there,\n\n1184\n01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:43,346\nso I can now ping them [SOUND].\n\n1185\n01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:46,030\nAnd notice with ping,\nI don't have to tell it I'm doing IPv6.\n\n1186\n01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,350\nIt just knows from\nthe format of the address\n\n1187\n01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,810\nthat I'm typing in an IPv6 address.\n\n1188\n01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:55,370\nSo, it's aware of that, and\nit sends the ping appropriately.\n\n1189\n01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,940\nAnd I'm able to ping across\nthat network and we can decide.\n\n1190\n01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,900\nWhy am I getting a bad check sum?\n\n1191\n01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,696\nWhat interface is that on?\n\n1192\n01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,810\nFA01, that should be\na good clean connection.\n\n1193\n01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,147\nMaybe, a bad cable or something.\n\n1194\n01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:08,609\n>> Yeah, could be.\n\n1195\n01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:11,300\n>> We weren't having that\nproblem under IP before though.\n\n1196\n01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,290\nThat's strange.\n\n1197\n01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,730\nSo, a bad check sum, not something I\nexpect to see here, that means that\n\n1198\n01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:21,410\nwhen the packet came in, either it\nhit some electric interference and\n\n1199\n01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,326\ngot damaged or somebody tampered with it.\n\n1200\n01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:24,590\nSomebody tampered with the packet.\n\n1201\n01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,390\nNow, we set this equipment up.\n\n1202\n01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,110\nI mean, the routers are right over there.\n\n1203\n01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,680\nSo, I know that's not the case.\n\n1204\n01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,341\nSo, we may be dealing with like a bad\ncable and IPv4 seemed to be happy with it,\n\n1205\n01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,614\nbut IPv6 seems to be slightly upset.\n\n1206\n01:02:37,614 --> 01:02:39,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, that's definitely a problem,\n\n1207\n01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,480\nsomething we'll wanna look into to try and\nisolate and correct.\n\n1208\n01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,165\nIf this were a production environment, my\nfirst step would be to replace that cable.\n\n1209\n01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:53,485\nBut we can also look in the interface\nto see if we're getting errors.\n\n1210\n01:02:53,485 --> 01:02:55,748\nThat's FA 0/1.\n\n1211\n01:02:55,748 --> 01:02:59,289\nSo, we could take a look at\nthe error counters right here.\n\n1212\n01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,044\nSo, I did a show interface\nfast Ethernet 1/0, and\n\n1213\n01:03:05,044 --> 01:03:10,450\nlooking in here, I can look for things\nlike under runs and errors and so on.\n\n1214\n01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:14,070\nAnd I'm not seeing any\nerrors on the interface.\n\n1215\n01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,250\nSo, it does appear to be an OSPF issue.\n\n1216\n01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,316\nSo, I wonder why OSPF\nis unhappy about that.\n\n1217\n01:03:19,316 --> 01:03:21,813\nMaybe, the other side has\nsome kind of different,\n\n1218\n01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:24,774\nwe might have a different IOS\non the two ends or something, so\n\n1219\n01:03:24,774 --> 01:03:27,641\nthere may be some problem with\nthe check sum calculation.\n\n1220\n01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,199\nStrange.\n\n1221\n01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:30,866\nI do have one interface reset, but\n\n1222\n01:03:30,866 --> 01:03:34,331\nthat could have been just from when\nI was turning interfaces off and on.\n\n1223\n01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:37,480\nThat's not necessarily\nsomething to worry about.\n\n1224\n01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,800\nSo, the moral of the story here though is,\nwas it harder to do OSPF under IPv6?\n\n1225\n01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,670\n>> No.\n>> No, it's actually easier.\n\n1226\n01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,030\nSo, it's not a difficult thing.\n\n1227\n01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:53,070\nDon't get worked up or panicky\nabout it if you get it on the exam.\n\n1228\n01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,720\nJust remember you go and\nturn it on on the interfaces.\n\n1229\n01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,900\nYou issue the IPv6 unicast\nrouting command and\n\n1230\n01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,870\nthen you go to the individual\ninterfaces and you say, IPv6, OSPF,\n\n1231\n01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:07,150\nand your process ID, area,\nand your area number.\n\n1232\n01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,692\nSo, really straight forward.\n\n1233\n01:04:08,692 --> 01:04:12,295\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, let's see, so that is,\n\n1234\n01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:15,990\ncan you think of anything else for IPv6?\n\n1235\n01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:20,698\nI mean all debug commands are the same\nexcept you add IPv6 to the name\n\n1236\n01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:21,780\ninstead of IP.\n\n1237\n01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,110\nThere's really, really not much to it.\n\n1238\n01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:23,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1239\n01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,990\n>> The hardest part with IPv6\nis simply the addresses.\n\n1240\n01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1241\n01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,180\n>> And that's why during the break,\nI punched all those in.\n\n1242\n01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:35,080\nIf I do a show IPv6 interface brief,\nyou'll see all the addresses I punched\n\n1243\n01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,110\nin as I created the links between\nthe routers, so this is the network\n\n1244\n01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:43,220\nbetween router one and router three, or\nthe links that I'm directly attached to.\n\n1245\n01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:48,080\nOne thing worth pointing out is with IPv6,\nyou always have a link local address,\n\n1246\n01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,350\nso an FE80 address.\n\n1247\n01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,110\nAnd OPSF, when you're communicating,\n\n1248\n01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:55,150\nyou actually communicate\nusing those link locals.\n\n1249\n01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:00,184\nSo, when I look at that routing table and\nI see the routes, you'll see where they're\n\n1250\n01:05:00,184 --> 01:05:06,320\nconnected via an interface or they are via\nthe link local address of the neighbor.\n\n1251\n01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,198\nYou always communicate\nusing those link locals.\n\n1252\n01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:15,270\nSo, that's really, that's about all I got.\n\n1253\n01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:20,310\nSo, the last thing that we're gonna talk\nabout in this episode is what is called\n\n1254\n01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,606\nrouter on a stick.\n\n1255\n01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:22,470\n>> Router on a stick.\n\n1256\n01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,290\n>> Or sub interface routing.\n\n1257\n01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:28,280\nAnd it's not something\nthat we do very often.\n\n1258\n01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,940\nIn frame relay world, we do it, I guess.\n\n1259\n01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,669\nBut the reason they bring it up in this\nclass is, if you've got a switch or\n\n1260\n01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:39,280\nmultiple switches, and you're doing VLANs,\nyou might wanna route between the VLANs.\n\n1261\n01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,150\nAnd they call that inter-VLAN routing.\n\n1262\n01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:46,020\nIt is a common thing for\ncompanies that have a lot of VLANs.\n\n1263\n01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,970\nYou wanna route between them.\n\n1264\n01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:50,435\nThe best solution, a layer three switch.\n\n1265\n01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:53,780\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n>> If you have a switch that has a router\n\n1266\n01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,290\nbuilt into it, it can do a great\njob routing between the VLANs.\n\n1267\n01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,360\nSo, in the CCNA class, your show,\n\n1268\n01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,000\nwe'll actually take a look at that and\ntackle that stuff.\n\n1269\n01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,170\nBut for CCENT,\nthey don't worry about that.\n\n1270\n01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,010\nInstead, they show you\nhow to use a router.\n\n1271\n01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,110\n>> And so, for us here,\nthe idea of the Inter-VLAN routing.\n\n1272\n01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,090\nRemember, if we go back to\none of those episodes, VLANs,\n\n1273\n01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:20,660\neven on the same switch,\ncannot communicate between each other\n\n1274\n01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,840\nwithout going through\na layer three device.\n\n1275\n01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,360\nAnd we have a couple was that we can do\nthat, but the most popular way to do that\n\n1276\n01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,320\nis by implementing that\nidea of router on a stick.\n\n1277\n01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,840\nWhich means instead of using multiple\ncables that are gonna be plugged into each\n\n1278\n01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,180\nVLAN that actually plug into the router,\na router may only have two or\n\n1279\n01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,130\nthree interfaces.\n\n1280\n01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:38,860\n>> Good point.\n>> So,\n\n1281\n01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,770\nwhat I may ask you to be able to do or\n\n1282\n01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:45,210\nwhat I can do, I should say,\nis I can take a single physical link,\n\n1283\n01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:49,240\nplug it into one port on the switch,\nplug it in to the actual router and\n\n1284\n01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,240\nbe able to route between those VLANs\nby using what we call a trunk.\n\n1285\n01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,460\n>> Yeah.\nIf you only had two VLANs,\n\n1286\n01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,520\nyou could take a router with two\ninterfaces, plug one into one VLAN,\n\n1287\n01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,090\nplug one into the other and\nset up your routing.\n\n1288\n01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,220\nBut what if you have 50 VLANs?\n\n1289\n01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,650\nAre you gonna have a router with 50 ports?\n\n1290\n01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,570\n>> Nope.\n\n1291\n01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:06,360\n>> You can, it'd be really expensive,\nbut you can.\n\n1292\n01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,103\nBetter would be to have a router\nwith one interface, and\n\n1293\n01:07:10,103 --> 01:07:12,980\ndivide it up to route for\neach of the VLANs.\n\n1294\n01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,970\nNow, Cisco routers are not\nVLAN aware by default.\n\n1295\n01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:19,060\nVLAN is a layer two thing,\nit's a switch thing,\n\n1296\n01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,880\nso routers don't get involved in that.\n\n1297\n01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,021\nRouters don't run spanning three\nprotocol,they don't run VTP,\n\n1298\n01:07:24,021 --> 01:07:26,170\nthe virtual trunking protocol.\n\n1299\n01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:31,490\nThey don't run really any trunking\nprotocols at all by default.\n\n1300\n01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:35,230\nBut you can tell the router that it's\ngoing to be participating in that kind of\n\n1301\n01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,070\nenvironment if you need to.\n\n1302\n01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:40,380\nSo, for example, and\nI'll just take router one here.\n\n1303\n01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,518\nWe're pretty much done with these so\nI can junk them up.\n\n1304\n01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:46,222\n[LAUGH] I guess let me save before\nI start dividing things up.\n\n1305\n01:07:46,222 --> 01:07:49,740\nI'm gonna shut off some of\nthese other interfaces and\n\n1306\n01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,020\nlet me just trim some of our config down.\n\n1307\n01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:58,080\n>> For right now, we spent a lot of\ntime in the VLAN show that we did,\n\n1308\n01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,310\nshowing you how to configure VLANs\non the actual switch itself.\n\n1309\n01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,230\nSo, we're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime doing that on this episode.\n\n1310\n01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,380\nWhat we wanna do is we wanna\nconfigure the other end.\n\n1311\n01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,940\nWe wanna configure the router portion\nof this so that once we do plug that\n\n1312\n01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,760\ncable into the switch, every VLAN on\nthat single switch should be able to use\n\n1313\n01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:22,470\nthat same link going to the router to\nbe able to send information up there.\n\n1314\n01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,380\nSo, that is what we're\ngonna spend our time doing.\n\n1315\n01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,680\nAnd what we're talking about\nnow with inter VLAN routing,\n\n1316\n01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,180\nis that we have two technologies that we\nreally actually have to think about here.\n\n1317\n01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,260\nOne by default, a router doesn't like to\nactually have to send information to that\n\n1318\n01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,115\none physical interface, and\n\n1319\n01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,960\nits destination come back out\nthat same interface as well.\n\n1320\n01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,840\nSo, we end up dealing with something\nthat we call split horizon.\n\n1321\n01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,320\nI couldn't remember what it was called for\na moment here.\n\n1322\n01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,650\nAnd so, we can overcome that,\n\n1323\n01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:56,630\nand the way that we overcome that is by\nlogically dividing up a physical port.\n\n1324\n01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,490\nSo, we're not really taking one port and\nthen actually chopping it up here.\n\n1325\n01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,530\nBut what we're doing is\nwe're fooling the software.\n\n1326\n01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,640\nWe're actually saying hey,\nwe're gonna take this one port and\n\n1327\n01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,210\nwe're gonna treat it as multiple\nports here, is what we're gonna do.\n\n1328\n01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:13,570\n>> So, what I've got right here is\nrouter one and it's Fa1/1 interface.\n\n1329\n01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:17,030\nI've got it with an IP\naddress of 192.168.1.1.\n\n1330\n01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:19,160\nIt's class C network, so\nthat's connection there.\n\n1331\n01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,130\nThis is what we would\nnormally see in a router,\n\n1332\n01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,130\nconfiguration right on the interface.\n\n1333\n01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:28,890\nBut Ronnie mentioned breaking up\nthat interface into sub-interfaces.\n\n1334\n01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,990\nIf we do that, we can start attaching\nthe sub interfaces to different,\n\n1335\n01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:35,460\nvirtual networks, to different VLANs.\n\n1336\n01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,650\nSo, let's say, that this router was\nplugged into a trunk port on a switch.\n\n1337\n01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,179\nAnd it was connected to 192.168.2.0 or\n\n1338\n01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:44,660\n192.168.3.0, it was\nconnected to all of those.\n\n1339\n01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:50,210\nSo, what we would do is on this router,\n\n1340\n01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,990\nwe would jump into that particular\ninterface and we would get it set up for\n\n1341\n01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,830\nwhat's called the native VLAN,\nthe untagged VLAN.\n\n1342\n01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,170\nNormally, VLAN1 for most people.\n\n1343\n01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:04,030\nBut then, every other VLAN,\nI would set up on a sub interface.\n\n1344\n01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:11,000\nSo, I would say,\ninterface Fa1/1.2 for VLAN2.\n\n1345\n01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:16,280\nThe sub-interface number doesn't actually\nmatter, you pick whatever you want.\n\n1346\n01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,720\nBut it's a good idea to have it match the\nVLAN number just to keep things straight.\n\n1347\n01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,670\nSo, you don't have to but\nit is a good idea.\n\n1348\n01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:25,350\nSo, I'll get into interface Fa1/1.2.\n\n1349\n01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,460\nIf I try and assign an IP address,\nit's not gonna let me.\n\n1350\n01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,750\n>> Nope.\n>> Or at least, it shouldn't.\n\n1351\n01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,816\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's try it here.\n\n1352\n01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:36,557\nSo, it's gonna get mad\nbecause it's gonna say, hey,\n\n1353\n01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:38,900\nyou're not a trunk port or\nanything like that.\n\n1354\n01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,030\nYou're just a regular sub-interface,\nyou can't assign an IP address.\n\n1355\n01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,470\nSo, what I have to do\nis I have to tell it.\n\n1356\n01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,690\n>> You have to spell encap.\n\n1357\n01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,690\n>> Oh, well, I'm trying to save\nmoney by typing less letters.\n\n1358\n01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,610\n>> That's right.\n\n1359\n01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:55,505\n>> So, you have to tell it that\nit's connected to a switch\n\n1360\n01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,517\nthat's running 802.1q trunking.\n\n1361\n01:10:58,517 --> 01:11:03,300\nNow, notice up here it says ISL,\nvery few systems support ISL anymore.\n\n1362\n01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,160\nSo, encapsulation dot 1q and\n\n1363\n01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,830\nthen you have to tell it which VLAN\nis attached to this interface.\n\n1364\n01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:14,351\nAnd this where I mention the sub-interface\nnumber doesn't really matter because it's\n\n1365\n01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:16,890\nthis number right here\nthat determines the VLAN.\n\n1366\n01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:21,324\nBut really, you normally want them to\nmatch just so you can keep them straight.\n\n1367\n01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:26,241\nNow, it knows, this is going\nto be attached to a trunk And\n\n1368\n01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:28,198\nit's VLAN number 2.\n\n1369\n01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:31,833\n>> Make sure you remember that last number\nis going to be more important when you do\n\n1370\n01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,000\nconfigure for inner VLAN routing.\n\n1371\n01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,655\nIf you forget it, the good thing is\nthat on a real router it will tell you,\n\n1372\n01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:38,370\nyou're not complete with it.\n\n1373\n01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:41,150\nBut, on the exam,\nyou may not get that opportunity.\n\n1374\n01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,830\nSo remember that last number's\ngoing to be very important.\n\n1375\n01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,480\n>> And now when I attach my\nIP address to it, it's happy.\n\n1376\n01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:52,450\nAnd I can keep going creating my\nother interfaces the same way.\n\n1377\n01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:56,090\nSo however many VLAN's that I have,\nI might have a ton of them.\n\n1378\n01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,670\nAnd I'm just going to go through.\n\n1379\n01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:04,090\nI'm basically creating the interface,\nassigning the VLAN number, and\n\n1380\n01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:06,050\nthen assigning the IP address.\n\n1381\n01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,670\nThen I just rinse and repeat.\n\n1382\n01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:10,370\nKeep going through,\nyou can create as many as you need.\n\n1383\n01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,870\nThe virtual interface is\nnot physical interfaces,\n\n1384\n01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,230\nthese aren't costing us any money.\n\n1385\n01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:19,450\nJust keep in mind that this is not\nreally for high performance networks.\n\n1386\n01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:23,300\nTraffic has to go in the port,\nget routed to the other VLAN,\n\n1387\n01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,290\nand then come back out the port again.\n\n1388\n01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:30,100\nSo, it's kind of a whole up and\ndown the same cable process,\n\n1389\n01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,950\nwhich is not all that efficient\nat the end of the day.\n\n1390\n01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:40,420\nSo, as I create each one of these though,\nI can see in a show IP interface brief.\n\n1391\n01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,936\nHere's all those interfaces.\n\n1392\n01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:43,316\nWhoops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n1393\n01:12:43,316 --> 01:12:49,240\nAll those interfaces that I'm\nconnected to, the VLAN 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\n1394\n01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,220\nThey each have their own addresses.\n\n1395\n01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,520\nBut it's all splitting\nthat single interface.\n\n1396\n01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:00,240\nAnd if I do a show IP route, I can see\nall of those networks in there and I've\n\n1397\n01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:06,420\ngot microconnected, and let me filter that\ndown a little bit to just do connected.\n\n1398\n01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,750\nThose local ones, oh,\nshoot, let me do this.\n\n1399\n01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:15,990\nLet me exclude anything\nwith a capital L in it.\n\n1400\n01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,850\nThere we go.\n\n1401\n01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,930\nSo now I can start to see those locals and\n\n1402\n01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:25,970\nI can see each route right there and\nthey're all tied to those sub interfaces.\n\n1403\n01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:30,130\nThat lets us use that one router\nto route for more than one VLAN.\n\n1404\n01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,010\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n1405\n01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:31,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n1406\n01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,090\nThe only physical thing to remember here\nis that we wanna make sure that this\n\n1407\n01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:38,820\nparticular port is at least a fast\nethernet port on the router.\n\n1408\n01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,740\nIf you try and do it on ethernet port,\n\n1409\n01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,260\nyou're probably gonna actually find\nmore problems than you realize.\n\n1410\n01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,710\nSo at least a fast ethernet,\na gigabit port if you can spare it.\n\n1411\n01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,270\n>> Let me draw a picture here real quick\nto kinda show what happens, right?\n\n1412\n01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:58,570\nSo we have a router and so\nI'll just draw my router over here.\n\n1413\n01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,980\nAnd this will be router 1.\n\n1414\n01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:03,830\nAnd then the router,\nit has to be plugged into a switch, right?\n\n1415\n01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:08,890\nAnd so, whoops, and so that switch, it's\ngonna have however many ports that your\n\n1416\n01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:13,990\nvarious PCs are plugged into, so everybody\ngets plugged into their various ports.\n\n1417\n01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,585\nNow the router only has one connection,\none cable that runs over to it.\n\n1418\n01:14:21,585 --> 01:14:27,115\nSo if I start to divide my switch\nup into VLAN, so if I have like,\n\n1419\n01:14:27,115 --> 01:14:31,185\nthis guy right here might be VLAN 1.\n\n1420\n01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:36,980\nAnd then I might have, these guys\nover here in VLAN 2, for example.\n\n1421\n01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,810\nOkay.\n\n1422\n01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:44,200\nSo if I start to divide things up\nlike that, well, that's fine, and\n\n1423\n01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,590\nmy trunk cable right over here,\nit can carry VLANs 1 and 2, so\n\n1424\n01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,870\nI just create my sub\ninterfaces on the router.\n\n1425\n01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:51,740\nAll right.\n\n1426\n01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:58,086\nBut if a PC on VLAN 1 wants to talk to\na PC on VLAN 2, what's gonna happen?\n\n1427\n01:14:58,086 --> 01:15:02,300\nWell, the PC sends it's data in on VLAN 1.\n\n1428\n01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:06,340\nIt then gets sent all\nthe way up to the router.\n\n1429\n01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,390\nThe router then routes it\nover to the other VLAN.\n\n1430\n01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,170\nAnd then it comes back down to that host.\n\n1431\n01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:16,034\nSo see how the data went up the cable and\nback down the cable again and\n\n1432\n01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:20,592\nthen the reply from the other host is\ndoing the same thing when it replies back.\n\n1433\n01:15:20,592 --> 01:15:22,767\nIt's gotta go up the cable and\n\n1434\n01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:28,200\nback down the cable so you end up\ncrossing up and down the same cable.\n\n1435\n01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,860\nRonnie said make sure it's at least\nfast ethernet because if you do,\n\n1436\n01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,840\nyou can make sure that you do full duplex.\n\n1437\n01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,810\nYou can send and receive at the same time.\n\n1438\n01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:40,220\nBut, every host communicating between\nthe VLANs is gonna hit this bottleneck\n\n1439\n01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,150\nright here.\n\n1440\n01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,600\nSo it's a big bottleneck,\nit really hurts performance.\n\n1441\n01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,050\nAnd so in an enterprise environment,\nthat is not ideal.\n\n1442\n01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,562\nIf you've got 10 machines or\n20 machines, it's not a big deal.\n\n1443\n01:15:51,562 --> 01:15:55,400\nBut if you've got 1,000 machines,\nit's a huge performance bottleneck.\n\n1444\n01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,880\nSo that is something we\nneed to keep in mind.\n\n1445\n01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,770\nAnd that's where if this router right\nhere can be built into the switch,\n\n1446\n01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:07,220\nright, if it's built in where\nthe switch is able to do its\n\n1447\n01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,830\nown routing between those VLAN's,\nthat's a different story, right.\n\n1448\n01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:14,340\nIt can do that very fast, it can do that\nright inside the hardware of the switch.\n\n1449\n01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,370\nAnd it's not a performance hit.\n\n1450\n01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,780\nAnd that's where layer 3 switches come in,\nwhich we'll see in the CCNA show.\n\n1451\n01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,640\nYou know, the whole thing,\nit's got a silly name.\n\n1452\n01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,000\nIt sounds like something we made up.\n\n1453\n01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,490\nRouter on a stick.\n\n1454\n01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:30,100\nBut that is the official name for\nthe technology, router on a stick.\n\n1455\n01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,600\nAnd it just comes from the idea that\nyou've just one cable to the stick, so\n\n1456\n01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,530\nthat's it, from the one cable to\nthe router, so it's a single link.\n\n1457\n01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:39,340\n>> It always reminds me of a lollipop,\nis what it reminds me of.\n\n1458\n01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,000\n>> Yes.\n>> Sticking out of the switch.\n\n1459\n01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,220\nWhen you draw a diagram of it.\n\n1460\n01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,990\n>> Yes, and that is basically it, and\n\n1461\n01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,690\nyour router would just have\nto have one interface.\n\n1462\n01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,120\nNow I don't know that you can find\na router anywhere that just has one\n\n1463\n01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,610\ninterface, but\nthat is really all you would need.\n\n1464\n01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,440\nNormally, we have more.\n\n1465\n01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,390\n>> Right.\n>> So,\n\n1466\n01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,830\nlet me go back to\nthe router that we setup.\n\n1467\n01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,280\nAnd I just want to show everybody,\nso that you can see it,\n\n1468\n01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,116\nwhat the final configuration looks like,\nand\n\n1469\n01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:05,660\nkind of get an idea of that\nmore general application.\n\n1470\n01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,600\nSo, there it is.\n\n1471\n01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,590\nSo, basically, the final configuration for\nthe interfaces.\n\n1472\n01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,649\nYou know, let me, I'm gonna move it in to\nNotepad where its a little easier to see.\n\n1473\n01:17:26,316 --> 01:17:27,400\nThere we go.\n\n1474\n01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,333\nSo basically,\nwe went into interface FA 1/1.\n\n1475\n01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:35,850\nAnd this is where you assign the IP\naddress for your native VLAN,\n\n1476\n01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,489\nyour untagged VLAN, right?\n\n1477\n01:17:37,489 --> 01:17:40,590\nSo whatever is native, by default, it's 1.\n\n1478\n01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:44,330\nBut if you've changed to something else,\nthen that's what this would match.\n\n1479\n01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:47,722\nAnd then down here are all your\ntagged VLAN's, everything else.\n\n1480\n01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:52,200\nVLAN 2, VLAN 3, VLAN 4,\nwe create a subinterface.\n\n1481\n01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,970\nThe encapsulation line is the most\nimportant because it's what attaches\n\n1482\n01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,950\nthe VLAN,\nthis subinterface number is just a number.\n\n1483\n01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,440\nYou can pick whatever number you wanted.\n\n1484\n01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,100\nI think it's got a maximum of like 4\nmillion because it's a 32 bit number.\n\n1485\n01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:08,040\nBut there are four billion,\nsomething like that.\n\n1486\n01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,670\nBut that's basically it.\n\n1487\n01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,980\nNot all that much to it.\n\n1488\n01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,870\n>> Now, the only thing to remember just in\ngeneral networking terms, is that these\n\n1489\n01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:18,460\nparticular numbers are these IP addresses\nthat we attached to the interfaces.\n\n1490\n01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:23,500\nSub interfaces here are typically\ngoing to be the default gateway for\n\n1491\n01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,750\nour internal devices here, okay?\n\n1492\n01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,020\nIf we have a different default gateway,\nwe're probably not actually be able to\n\n1493\n01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,850\nroute between our VLAN, so\nmake sure you remember that too.\n\n1494\n01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,340\n>> All right, well that's really\nall I've got on router on a stick.\n\n1495\n01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:36,960\nHow about you?\n\n1496\n01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,560\n>> I think so, I think we're doing good.\n\n1497\n01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,560\n>> Okay, well that's pretty much\nall we've got for our show.\n\n1498\n01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,620\nThe next objective on here is SVI or\nswitch virtual interfaces,\n\n1499\n01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,150\nwhich you need switches for.\n\n1500\n01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:48,940\nWe have routers here, so\nwe'll need to get a switch after that.\n\n1501\n01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,260\nWe'll do that in the next show, though.\n\n1502\n01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,400\n>> Yes.\n>> So stay tuned.\n\n1503\n01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,210\nIf you're really excited about that,\nit'll be in the next episode.\n\n1504\n01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:54,740\n>> Yes.\n\n1505\n01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,780\n>> But other than that,\nremember as always, if you guys have\n\n1506\n01:18:58,780 -->

01:19:28,010\nJust about.\n\n1518\n01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:33,210\nYeah, I do not know the winning lottery\nnumbers for next week, but I do know\n\n1519\n01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:38,880\nhow to redistribute OSPF into BGP, so\nif you need to do that, we can do it.\n\n1520\n01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,570\nSo anyhow, post your questions and\n\n1521\n01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:43,140\nremember you

and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,420\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,870\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,400\n>> Hello, how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,810\n>> I am doing just swell, right?\n\n8\n00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,290\nI'm pumped up, energized, and ready to go.\n\n9\n00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,910\n>> I am doing better than any\ndress maker for Lady Gaga.\n\n10\n00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,260\n>> Does she even wear dresses any more?\n\n11\n00:00:55,260 -->

raw meat or\nsomething?\n\n14\n00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,730\nAll right, well today we have another\nexciting Cisco show lined up for you guys.\n\n15\n00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,440\nWe're gonna be tackling\nnetwork address translation,\n\n16\n00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,980\nwhich is a very very commonly\nused technology, very widespread.\n\n17\n00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,990\nIt unfortunately has the negative side of\nbeing one of the harder technologies to\n\n18\n00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,870\nimplement in this show, but it's really\nnot that bad once you get the hang of it.\n\n19\n00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n20\n00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,640\nFor us in terms of network\naddress translation,\n\n21\n00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,390\nthis one of the neat thing's that\nreally helps us out, but it is one of\n\n22\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,370\nthe harder concepts if you haven't\nactually been around the technology.\n\n23\n00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,690\nSo we want to make sure that we have a\ngood conceptual basis of the idea of NAT,\n\n24\n00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,825\nand then we're gonna go into a course\nconfiguring it on our Cisco routers, and\n\n25\n00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,675\nwe'll do a little bit more of that.\n\n26\n00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:48,277\nSome of the different things that\ncould be tricky for us, too.\n\n27\n00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,585\n>> So, most of us our doing that.\n\n28\n00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,215\nNetwork Address Translation,\nyou're probably doing it right now.\n\n29\n00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,365\nIn fact, I know I'm doing it for\nmy laptop right now, and\n\n30\n00:01:56,365 --> 00:02:00,505\nthe idea is that the,\nlike we said in the IPv4 episode,\n\n31\n00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:05,090\nthe IPv4 address space is not very big,\nand we're running out of addresses.\n\n32\n00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,130\nSo most people in their homes and\n\n33\n00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,360\nin their business,\nthey're running on private addresses.\n\n34\n00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,560\nPrivate IP addresses or\nRFC 1918 addresses, right?\n\n35\n00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,850\nWhich we can spot pretty easy.\n\n36\n00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,420\nActually, let me fire up old Notepad.\n\n37\n00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,590\nWe'll write them out just so\n\n38\n00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,180\nwe've kinda got it in our-\n>> For\n\n39\n00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,270\nus in terms of the way that we're actually\ndoing the, the idea of NAT right now.\n\n40\n00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,880\nIs that we've got a couple of problems,\nright?\n\n41\n00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,970\nThe IP version 4 address\nspace is not big enough,\n\n42\n00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,230\nwe also talked about it in our episode\nwhen we did sub netting when we also\n\n43\n00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,090\nintroduced the concept of variable\nlength of sub net masking.\n\n44\n00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,160\nBut one of the big concepts that actually\nhas helped us slow down the depletion\n\n45\n00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,152\nof the IP version for addresses on the\nInternet is not only variable in subnet\n\n46\n00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:53,220\nmasking as well as,\nI can't remember what I was about to say.\n\n47\n00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,720\n>> Cider.\n\n48\n00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,500\n>> Cider?\n\n49\n00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,210\nYeah, as well as domain routing here,\nis also NAT.\n\n50\n00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,270\nThe reason why NAT's actually important\nfor us today is because it allows us to\n\n51\n00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,290\ntake these classes that Don's actually\ntyping up here on the screen for us.\n\n52\n00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,990\nAnd being able to say hey, companies\ncan actually take these addresses and\n\n53\n00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,520\nuse them however they want to.\n\n54\n00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,990\nSo they're no longer dependent upon\npulling out of the address pool\n\n55\n00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,740\nthat's available on the internet.\n\n56\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,950\nSo that's where it actually begins for us.\n\n57\n00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,770\nAnd then the technology that we'll use\ntoday shows us how we actually use it much\n\n58\n00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,940\nmore efficiently too.\n\n59\n00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,630\n>> Yeah and\nwhen it comes to public addresses, right?\n\n60\n00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,040\nPublic addresses have to be\nregistered with the IANA because\n\n61\n00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,675\nno two people can use the same number.\n\n62\n00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:37,505\nSo if you want a public IP,\nyou've gotta get a registered IP address.\n\n63\n00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:42,351\nBut these,\nRFC1918 is defining private addresses.\n\n64\n00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,525\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n65\n00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:47,695\nWhich are non registered addresses.\n\n66\n00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,105\nAnd that means that anyone\ncan use these addresses\n\n67\n00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,675\nwithout even knowing who the INA is.\n\n68\n00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:54,605\nAnd most of us do, right?\n\n69\n00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,740\nSo most of us.\n\n70\n00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,670\nAre using one of these ranges right now.\n\n71\n00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,965\nAnd the INA probably doesn't\nknow about it at all, right?\n\n72\n00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:01,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n73\n00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,600\n>> So now, for example,\nhere in the office.\n\n74\n00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,690\nSo here at the office we use the 10.\n\n75\n00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,570\nWe use this network.\n\n76\n00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,321\nWe divide it up to make it a lot smaller,\nbut we use that class A.\n\n77\n00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,861\nAt my own house, I use 192.168.0, right?\n\n78\n00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,710\nMost homes are setup with that.\n\n79\n00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,150\nBecause a class C is 254 usable IPs,\nmore than enough for most households.\n\n80\n00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,100\nSo those are really common.\n\n81\n00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,090\nNow, here's the problem.\n\n82\n00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,840\nPrivate addresses are non registered and\n\n83\n00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,600\nthat means that more than\none person can use them.\n\n84\n00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,190\nSo Ronnie you might have\na system at your house that\n\n85\n00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,640\nhas the same exact ip\naddress as mine at my house.\n\n86\n00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,270\nBut it's no big deal\nbecause they're private.\n\n87\n00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,740\n>> Right.\n>> And when go out to the internet,\n\n88\n00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,430\nonce you hit the internet, you're not\nallowed to use those private addresses.\n\n89\n00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,890\nThey are non routable on the internet.\n\n90\n00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,800\nSo if your ISP, your internet service\nprovider, if they see you sending traffic\n\n91\n00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400\nfrom one of those private addresses,\ntheir gonna throw one out.\n\n92\n00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800\nAnd you're not gonna make it out to the\ninternet, you're not gonna get anywhere.\n\n93\n00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,010\n>> This is where what we're talking\nabout today in terms of network address\n\n94\n00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,640\ntranslation helps us out.\n\n95\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,740\nIt allows us to take those private\nranges and like we say here,\n\n96\n00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,690\nnetwork address translation to translate\ninto one of those publicly available ones.\n\n97\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,530\nThe ones that are registered\non the internet for us.\n\n98\n00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,230\nAnd so today, that's what this\nwhole episode is about for\n\n99\n00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,230\nus, is ensuring we understand that\nficker concept, and then how we normally\n\n100\n00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,350\ntake our Cisco devices and configure\nit to work with that ficker technology.\n\n101\n00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,165\n>> So let's take a look at this\nfrom a diagram standpoint, and\n\n102\n00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,230\nthen we'll see how to actually implement.\n\n103\n00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,944\nSo here I drew a little picture, and\n\n104\n00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,870\nthis is pretty close to what our\nlayout is here at the office.\n\n105\n00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,652\nI've got my laptop,\nwhich is 192.168.0.222, right?\n\n106\n00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:48,085\nI've got my router, Router 1,\nthat's this 2800 router behind me.\n\n107\n00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:51,177\nThat is 192.168.0.1, right?\n\n108\n00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:57,420\nThose are private addresses in\nthe 192.168.0 class C range.\n\n109\n00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,791\nThe other interface of my router is\nconnected to my internet service provider.\n\n110\n00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,740\nSo I've got 209.251.133.187.\n\n111\n00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,920\nThat's a real public IP in\nthe registered IP range.\n\n112\n00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,100\nThat means that this is\nregistered with the INA.\n\n113\n00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,410\nNow, we never called the INA.\n\n114\n00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,300\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Right?\n\n115\n00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,290\nInstead, we buy internet service\nthrough a provider here in town.\n\n116\n00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,530\nAnd they called the INA\nto get these ranges.\n\n117\n00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,820\nOr they set up with a top level provider,\nmore than likely.\n\n118\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,230\nBut anyhow, somebody, somewhere,\nregistered those IPs.\n\n119\n00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,630\nAnd we've been assigned that address,\nwe've got it, nobody else.\n\n120\n00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,401\nThat is ours to use on the internet.\n\n121\n00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,664\n>> When RSPs gives us this particular\naddress, or when we lease it from them,\n\n122\n00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:42,197\nthis is where we put on the outside\ninterface facing their particular network,\n\n123\n00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:44,570\nthis particular address here.\n\n124\n00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,477\nThis address for\n\n125\n00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:50,970\nus is actually gonna be representative of\nwho were gonna be on the entire internet.\n\n126\n00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,580\nSo for us in this particular diagram\nthat we see, we have one ficker host.\n\n127\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,170\nWe have our router.\n\n128\n00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,410\nThen we have on the interface configure\nthe IP addresses that we want to have.\n\n129\n00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,990\nThen we can get out to the internet.\n\n130\n00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,240\n>> So what network address translation\ndoes, what NAT does at its heart,\n\n131\n00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,680\nit allows you to change the IP\naddresses attached to a packet.\n\n132\n00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,410\nSo to change either the source or\nthe destination or both\n\n133\n00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,400\nof a packet as it's being routed through\nthe network so we can disguise a machine.\n\n134\n00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,266\nNot disguising it for nefarious purposes,\nalthough you certainly can, but\n\n135\n00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,892\nto disguise it to allow it\nto go out under a public IP.\n\n136\n00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:34,347\nSo, for example, if my laptop\nhere is going out the internet,\n\n137\n00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:38,551\nas it passes through the router,\nwhoops, if I can draw it,\n\n138\n00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:43,595\nif it passes through the router, and\ngoes out to the internet with it's\n\n139\n00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:49,229\noriginal source of 192.168.0.222,\nmy ISP will throw it away and\n\n140\n00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,768\nit wont make it, but\nthe router can stop that packet midstream,\n\n141\n00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:58,223\nstop it right here, break it open,\nchange my source address to\n\n142\n00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:03,058\nthe external IP of the router, And\nthen send it out to the Internet.\n\n143\n00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:08,330\nNow the Internet is gonna see traffic\ncoming from the router itself.\n\n144\n00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,910\nAnd when the host out on the Internet\ngoes to reply to us that traffic will\n\n145\n00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,620\nturn right back around and come to\nour router and our router will say,\n\n146\n00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,770\noh yeah, that's right,\nI translated that from Don's laptop, and\n\n147\n00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,190\nsend it the rest of the way in so\nI receive that communication.\n\n148\n00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,790\nProper, full communications, right?\n\n149\n00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,500\nSo the actual definition of NAT\nis simply changing the source or\n\n150\n00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,822\ndestination IP address of the packet\nfrom one address to another, that's it.\n\n151\n00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,180\nAll right so,\n\n152\n00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,400\nthere is a lot more to it then kind of\nwhat we saw there but let me do this.\n\n153\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,770\nLet's kind of show what our packet might\nlook like as we build it, all right.\n\n154\n00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,677\nLet's say that I'm gonna go to Amazon com,\nright, so.\n\n155\n00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:01,388\nSo amazon.com, 72.21.215.232.\n\n156\n00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,813\nSo let me copy that,\ncuz I'm not gonna remember that.\n\n157\n00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:07,352\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n158\n00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:12,928\nwhen I decide I'm gonna talk to Amazon,\nI build up a packet and\n\n159\n00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:18,197\nthat packet is going to look\nsomething like, let's see,\n\n160\n00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,089\nThis isn't going to be the prettiest,\nall right, but\n\n161\n00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,457\nit's gonna look something like this.\n\n162\n00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:35,030\nIt's going to have a SRC IP which\nis gonna be 192.168.0.222, and\n\n163\n00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:41,510\nit's going to have a destination IP,\nGod forbid it maintain the same\n\n164\n00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,470\nfont size, there we go.\n\n165\n00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,900\nWhich is gonna be the IP\naddress of Amazon, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,420\nSo it's gonna build that up and\nstick it in the packet and\n\n167\n00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,620\nget it ready to be sent along, right?\n\n168\n00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,040\nNow the IP address, as the source IP and\nthe destination IP,\n\n169\n00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,540\nthat's the layer three\ninformation of my packet.\n\n170\n00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,450\nThen we got our layer two information,\nalso and the layer two,\n\n171\n00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,180\nyou know that's going to\nbe your MAC address, right?\n\n172\n00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,950\nThe MAC address of my laptop and\nMAC address of the router so\n\n173\n00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,150\nit knows to get there.\n\n174\n00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,940\nAll right?\n\n175\n00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,710\nWhen it passes through the router, the\nrouter is going to open up this packet and\n\n176\n00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,866\nit's going to change it.\n\n177\n00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:25,700\nAll right, so NAT is going to\noccur right here in the middle, so\n\n178\n00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,550\nthis is where we're NAT occurs,\nthat's nice and pretty and\n\n179\n00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,390\nso this is my NAT line.\n\n180\n00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,150\nIn my head it looked a lot better,\nbut anyhow.\n\n181\n00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,150\nThat's where my NAT's happening.\n\n182\n00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,540\nAnd after NAT happens, well,\nthings are a little bit different.\n\n183\n00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,040\nWe.\n\n184\n00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:55,480\nWell, that didn't work at all.\n\n185\n00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,881\nWe basically take our source IP here,\nthis, [LAUGH] oh,\n\n186\n00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:05,755\nmy mastery of this tool is not where it\nshould be, let's just do an all new one.\n\n187\n00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:14,718\nThe source IP will become\n209.251.133.187 and the destination IP.\n\n188\n00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:22,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n189\n00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,270\nThere we go.\n\n190\n00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,990\n>> Will stay the same.\n\n191\n00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,870\nThe destination IP stays\nthe same because well\n\n192\n00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,750\nAmazon already has a public IP, right?\n\n193\n00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,760\nSo it's a real registered IP,\nwe don't have to manipulate that.\n\n194\n00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,250\nThat's what it gets turned into.\n\n195\n00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:35,830\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,190\nSo now we go out on the Internet,\nyour Internet service provider looks and\n\n197\n00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,430\nthere's two public IPs, the source and\n\n198\n00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,950\nthe destination are both public IPs,\nfully routable on the Internet.\n\n199\n00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,680\nData goes out, data comes back and\nwhen it comes back, the routers\n\n200\n00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,570\nhas to match it up with our PC on the back\nend to figure out where to send it to.\n\n201\n00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,830\nAnd it then does reverse net\nit undoes the translation.\n\n202\n00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,490\nIt turns that public IP\nback into 192.168.0.222 and\n\n203\n00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,880\nthrows the packet on\nthe LAN to get over here,\n\n204\n00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,430\nmeaning that my PC has\nno idea this happened.\n\n205\n00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,550\nIt doesn't see that it happened at all and\nthat's it.\n\n206\n00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,930\n>> The nice thing about this for\nus is that for you and me.\n\n207\n00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,940\nWe have ready addresses that\nare actually the RFC 1918.\n\n208\n00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,920\nWe don't actually see this occurring.\n\n209\n00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,750\nIf I'm using my computer,\nI don't ever have to sit and go,\n\n210\n00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,320\nI hope this correctly translates.\n\n211\n00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,590\nIt's all happening what we call\ntransparently to the end user.\n\n212\n00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,110\nSo the user never has to worry about it,\nor ever has to actually think about it.\n\n213\n00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,720\nBut you though, as a CCENT technician,\nyou're the one that actually has\n\n214\n00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,210\nto at least be able to troubleshoot when\nsomething else like this happens, and\n\n215\n00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,700\nhas to know the basic configuration\nof how we set this stuff up.\n\n216\n00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,420\n>> Now how do you know\nif you're being natted.\n\n217\n00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,989\nOne of the easy ways to tell is\nif you've got a private IP and\n\n218\n00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,887\nyou can still get to the Internet,\nyou're being added, right?\n\n219\n00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:02,400\nBut let's go a little further,\nlet's look at my computer.\n\n220\n00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,715\nSo if I open up a command prompt here,\nand I do a little IP config\n\n221\n00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:12,005\nI can find my network adaptor,\nand there I am.\n\n222\n00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:17,902\nMy IP address is 192.168.0.222,\nmy default gateway is 192.168.0.1.\n\n223\n00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:22,557\nI've got a private address and and my\nrouter does too, at least on the inside.\n\n224\n00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:29,527\nSo I know that's my address but\nif I fire up a web browser, and\n\n225\n00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,777\nI go to, let's see what site\ndo I want to use today?\n\n226\n00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,417\nLet's do ipmonkey.com.\n\n227\n00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,780\nWe'll see what the monkey says.\n\n228\n00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,725\nAll right.\nSo, the IP monkey tells me\n\n229\n00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,670\n>> The monkey kills me.\n\n231\n00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,193\n>> For our viewers,\nif you're not a big fan of monkeys or\n\n232\n00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,190\nwhatever there is an alternative,\nyou can go to IP chicken.\n\n233\n00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,510\n>> IP chicken.\n\n234\n00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,330\n>> And there we go.\n\n235\n00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,755\nThe chicken tells me.\n\n236\n00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:56,000\n[LAUGH] I wonder what other\nanimals we could pick from.\n\n237\n00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,810\n>> No, please don't.\n\n238\n00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,278\n>> There's probably IP Horse,\nor eventually ipfreely.com.\n\n239\n00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:07,658\nSo [LAUGH] anyhow, so the IP Monkey tells\nme that my IP address is 209.251.159.184\n\n240\n00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:12,790\nbut I just checked a second ago and\nthat's not what my IP address is.\n\n241\n00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,046\nThat's because I'm getting natted,\nI'm getting translated,\n\n242\n00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:23,818\nmy address is being changed from\n192.168.0.222 into 209.251.159.184.\n\n243\n00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,369\n>> So Don, let me make sure\nthat I'm getting this straight,\n\n244\n00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:32,297\nthe packet leaves my particular computer\nwith my private IP address, the router\n\n245\n00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:36,791\nitself is actually what translates\nthat into that public IP address, and\n\n246\n00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,850\nthen that web server that we just hit,\nIP monkey.\n\n247\n00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,275\nWhen it returned it,\n\n248\n00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:46,160\nit changed the destination to\nthe address of the outside router.\n\n249\n00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,930\n>> Yeah because it has no idea\nwhat our internal address is,\n\n250\n00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,800\nit never even saw that.\n\n251\n00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,630\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so,\n\n252\n00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,890\nthat's all due to the fact of\nNAT actually changing it for us.\n\n253\n00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,090\nSo it makes our packets be able to be\nrouter on the Internet even if I have\n\n254\n00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,150\nthat private IP address again it really\ndoes help us out tremendously here.\n\n255\n00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,330\n>> And what's really cool is\nif you're like a home user and\n\n256\n00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,750\nyou've got 10 computers at home,\nhopefully you don't.\n\n257\n00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,501\nSo,\n>> Yeah.\n\n258\n00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,041\nSo we'll use me as an example.\n\n259\n00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,400\nSo I've got three Roku boxes at home and\n\n260\n00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,460\nmy laptop, and my wife's laptop and\nour cell phones.\n\n261\n00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,140\nSo those are all devices so all in all I\nguess I've got like seven devices at home.\n\n262\n00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,890\nWell I have a service provider that's\nour cable company so we have cable,\n\n263\n00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,390\nhigh speed Internet and\nthey only give us one public IP.\n\n264\n00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,290\nSo I run that cable modem\ninto my firewall, and\n\n265\n00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,398\nmy firewall gets that one, public IP.\n\n266\n00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:37,595\nMeanwhile my seven devices\nare all behind the firewall.\n\n267\n00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,915\nThe firewall does network\naddress translation so\n\n268\n00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:44,215\nthat all of our devices get\ntranslated into that one IP.\n\n269\n00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,895\nAnd out on the Internet they just think\nit's one computer, they think it's that\n\n270\n00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,665\none system, my firewall,\ngoing out and browsing the Internet.\n\n271\n00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:55,887\nWhen in reality, I've got several machines\nthat are sharing a single IP, all right?\n\n272\n00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,799\nAnd that concept is called overloading.\n\n273\n00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,328\n>> We're overloading the IP and IP\naddress is designed to carry traffic for\n\n274\n00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,705\none machine, and one machine only but\n\n275\n00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:07,838\nwhen most people do NAT\nthey also do overloading.\n\n276\n00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:11,379\nAnd they jam more than one\nmachine behind a single IP.\n\n277\n00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:14,928\nSo that's an important concept which we're\ngonna take a look at a little bit later\n\n278\n00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:15,750\nin the show.\n\n279\n00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,408\n>> Yeah.\n\n280\n00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,150\nWe're also gonna end up seeing that\nthere's actually even more than just\n\n281\n00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,990\noverloading.\n\n282\n00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,770\nThe earlier versions of NAT, for\n\n283\n00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,550\nus, include what we just shown you\nwhich is a one-to-one translation.\n\n284\n00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,480\nI have one public IP address that was\nassigned to me by my internet service\n\n285\n00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,580\nprovider, and\n\n286\n00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,000\ninside I only have one particular device\nthat has that private IP address.\n\n287\n00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,700\nNow there's even another one that's\nout there, where, if you actually have\n\n288\n00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,200\na lot of devices inside, but let's say\nyou have a pool of public IP addresses.\n\n289\n00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280\nSo let's say you have five or\n\n290\n00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,990\nsix IP addresses that\nare available on the Internet.\n\n291\n00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,490\nIf you want to translate those into it,\nwe can also talk about that.\n\n292\n00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,835\nSo for most of us here, actually I\nthink that may be all that there is,\n\n293\n00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:58,350\nthere's what we call the idea\nof static IP addressing,\n\n294\n00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,480\nwhich is the one-to-one translation.\n\n295\n00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,960\nThen there's what we call the idea of\ndynamic addressing, which is the pool.\n\n296\n00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,920\nYou have many devices that you're gonna\ntranslate into many public IP addresses.\n\n297\n00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,910\nAnd then you have the one that Don was\ntalking about which we call overloading or\n\n298\n00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,655\nNAT overloading, a lot of times, in which\nyou have many devices on the inside\n\n299\n00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:20,065\nit's gonna get translated to one public\nIP address on the outside as well.\n\n300\n00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:24,055\nSo we normally use the term mapping here,\n\n301\n00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:28,800\nto actually show how that private IP\naddress is going to get link up or\n\n302\n00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,700\nget translated into that\npublic IP address, as well.\n\n303\n00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,250\nNow there's another term, I don't,\ndo we even use that in Cisco?\n\n304\n00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,330\nDo we use port address\ntranslation in Cisco?\n\n305\n00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,410\n>> Yes, absolutely, they love to\nthrow that one in on the exam.\n\n306\n00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,480\nIt's kinda hard to explain right now\nwithout having actually seen that.\n\n307\n00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,330\n>> Right.\n>> So I'm gonna add PAT.\n\n308\n00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,540\nSo PAT is really the technology\nthat makes NAT overloading work.\n\n309\n00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,400\nSo I'm gonna add that to my notes here,\nand\n\n310\n00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,260\nwe'll tackle that one later in the show,\nbut basically this port address\n\n311\n00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,460\ntranslation and what most of us\nthink is NAT is actually PAT.\n\n312\n00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,920\nAnd most people never heard the term\nPAT and don't care about it, but\n\n313\n00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,180\non the exam,\nyou need to have heard about it and\n\n314\n00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,860\nyou need to care about it because\nthey love to throw it on there.\n\n315\n00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,990\nSo we will tackle that one.\n\n316\n00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, well Ronnie,\n\n317\n00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,690\nlet's start with the easy stuff.\n\n318\n00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,120\n>> Okay.\n>> Let's start with what's called a static\n\n319\n00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,410\nNAT mapping.\n\n320\n00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,250\nA static NAT mapping is when we\ntell a router to take one internal\n\n321\n00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,770\nhost and\ntranslate it into one external IP.\n\n322\n00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,010\nAll right.\n\n323\n00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,440\nThis does not involve sharing.\n\n324\n00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,180\nSo if I have 15 internal computers,\n\n325\n00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,730\nI would have to do 15 separate\nmappings to 15 public IPs.\n\n326\n00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,650\nMost of the time we don't have that,\nright?\n\n327\n00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,120\nSo static mapping is the most\nbasic of the options.\n\n328\n00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,790\nAnd we really use it for servers.\n\n329\n00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,480\nYou might have a server on your\nnetwork that has an internal address.\n\n330\n00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,690\nAnd you wanna map it to\none of your public IPs so\n\n331\n00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,340\nyou can expose it to the Internet and\nallow people to get to it.\n\n332\n00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,000\nSo for\nthat you would do a one-to-one mapping.\n\n333\n00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,450\nThe internal server has full\ncontrol of that one IP.\n\n334\n00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,330\nWell, let me bring up my router here,\nnow my machine,\n\n335\n00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,834\nmy laptop is 192.168.0.222,\nand that is a private IP, so\n\n336\n00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:22,280\nI already know that I can't get out\nto the Internet with my current IP.\n\n337\n00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,360\nAnd I can't get into the router\nif I don't know the password.\n\n338\n00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,922\nThere we go.\n\n339\n00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:29,046\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n340\n00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:34,038\nI'm just doing a show IP\ninterface brief here real quick.\n\n341\n00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:40,670\nThis router has 192.168.0.1,\nwhich is what my laptop is plugged into.\n\n342\n00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,230\nAnd then for it's internet connection,\nit's got 10.1.230.15,\n\n343\n00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,890\nnow you might notice, you know,\nhang on a second Don, that's a private IP.\n\n344\n00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,270\nWell it's in our lab here, so\nit doesn't actually have a public IP.\n\n345\n00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,735\nSo let's in our minds,\n\n346\n00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,800\njust kind of pretend here,\nthat 10.1.230 was a public IP.\n\n347\n00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,150\nYou don't have to NAT between private and\npublic.\n\n348\n00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,650\nYou can NAT between private and\nprivate like I'm about to.\n\n349\n00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,090\nYou can NAT between public and public.\n\n350\n00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,900\nThere's not a lot of reason to,\nbut you can.\n\n351\n00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,780\nSo, when my laptop passes through\n192.168.0.1 and heads out to the Internet.\n\n352\n00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,387\nBy default, the router is\nsending me out as 192.168.0.222.\n\n353\n00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,790\nIt's not changing my address at all.\n\n354\n00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,580\nCisco routers do not do NAT by default.\n\n355\n00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,770\nWe have to configure it, or\nit's not going to do it.\n\n356\n00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,310\nSo I'm going to configure\na statement in here.\n\n357\n00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,400\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI'm going to say like right now,\n\n358\n00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,050\nif my laptop passes through this system,\nit's gonna pass through, and\n\n359\n00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,580\nI will show up as being 192.168.0.222,\nnow how do I know that?\n\n360\n00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,218\nWell, let me show you,\nI'll remote into another system.\n\n361\n00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,208\nAll right.\n\n362\n00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:58,410\nSo I'm logging into another\nsystem here through that router.\n\n363\n00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,260\nAnd when I do a show user, it's gonna\nshow who's logged into this switch.\n\n364\n00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,970\nRight?\n\n365\n00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,760\nAnd that's me right there.\n\n366\n00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,030\nI SSHed in, so I'm on VTY 0.\n\n367\n00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,990\nI logged in as user admin, and\nright there you can see my address.\n\n368\n00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,543\nI'm 192.168.0.222.\n\n369\n00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:25,150\nWhen I passed through that router, it did\nnot NAT me, it left me at 192.168.0.222.\n\n370\n00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:31,724\nNow the problem here is, this switch has\nto know how to get back to me, all right.\n\n371\n00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:39,615\nAnd so before the show, I put in a route,\n\n372\n00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:45,854\nand let's see if we can find it,\ngive it just a minute, there we go!\n\n373\n00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:49,630\nI put in a route, so\nit would know how to get to me.\n\n374\n00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,416\nAnd I said, 192.168.0,\nthe class C is available\n\n375\n00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:57,900\nthrough 10.1.230.15,\nwhich is the router, router 1.\n\n376\n00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,580\nSo if I look back here,\nsee that is the IP in Router 1.\n\n377\n00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,150\nSo I told that switch how to get back\nto me, but if it's an Internet router,\n\n378\n00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,710\nlike it's your ISP, it's not gonna\nhave any routes for 192.168.\n\n379\n00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,050\nIn fact, it's gonna have the opposite.\n\n380\n00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,770\nIt's gonna have blocked\nrules that deny 192.168,\n\n381\n00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,250\ncuz they're required to drop it\nbefore passing into the Internet.\n\n382\n00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,961\nSo if I were to remove\nthis route statement,\n\n383\n00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,100\nif I were to take that out of there.\n\n384\n00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:27,757\nThere we go.\n\n385\n00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,460\nWell, what happens?\n\n386\n00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,530\nI actually just lost my connection.\n\n387\n00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,940\nI can't type, whatever,\nI've lost my connection to the switch,\n\n388\n00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,270\ncuz the switch has no way to\nfind its way back to me anymore.\n\n389\n00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,580\nIt doesn't know how to get to 192.168.\n\n390\n00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,340\nAnd that's exactly what would\nhappen if you didn't NAT\n\n391\n00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,370\nyourself on the way out to the Internet.\n\n392\n00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,800\nThe ISPs wouldn't know how to get to you,\n\n393\n00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,980\nthat would be the end\nof your communication.\n\n394\n00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,343\nThere you go, my connection just went out.\n\n395\n00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:52,222\nAll right.\n\n396\n00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,380\nSo how can I fix that?\n\n397\n00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,720\nHow can I get around it?\n\n398\n00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,540\nWell, we can do a translation.\n\n399\n00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,780\nNow with a static NAT, we map one\ninternal address to one public address.\n\n400\n00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:11,904\nI'm gonna map my 192.168.0.222\naddress to 10.1.230.16.\n\n401\n00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,205\nJust the next available address.\n\n402\n00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,380\nIt's important that you\nactually own that address.\n\n403\n00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can't take somebody else's address.\n\n404\n00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,560\nThat won't work either.\n\n405\n00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,870\nAll right.\n\n406\n00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,360\nSo here's gonna be our first\ntranslation command, and\n\n407\n00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,090\nthis one is one of the shorter ones,\nthe syntax for NAT.\n\n408\n00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,280\nYou have to say IP NAT, so\nwe're turning that on, and\n\n409\n00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,270\nthen we have to tell it what\ninside addresses we want to map.\n\n410\n00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,970\nAnd I'm gonna say, the inside\nsource is going to be a static map.\n\n411\n00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,540\nOkay, so the inside address is gonna\nbe something that I statically put in.\n\n412\n00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,970\nSo inside source static, and\nthen I need to put what it is.\n\n413\n00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,946\nSo, in my case, that guy right there,\nthat's my laptop.\n\n414\n00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,643\nAnd then I need to tell it\nthe destination, right?\n\n415\n00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,152\nWhat I want it to become.\n\n416\n00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:05,961\nAnd I'm gonna tell it\nto become 10.1.230.16.\n\n417\n00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,140\nAll right?\n\n418\n00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,912\nSo whenever it sees traffic\ncoming from 192.168.0.222,\n\n419\n00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:16,850\nit will change the traffic to\nshow as being from 10.1.230.16.\n\n420\n00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,436\n>> Now, a lot of times when we do this,\nwe think that at this point, we've got it\n\n421\n00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:26,180\nmade, we're done, we shouldn't\nhave to worry about anything else.\n\n422\n00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,880\nSo this is where, we as beginners, may\nactually get a little bit frustrated here.\n\n423\n00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,460\nWhat I would do right now,\njust go ahead and ping.\n\n424\n00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,570\nAnd when that happens, I'm gonna see that,\neven though I think I've done it\n\n425\n00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,940\ncorrectly, it is not gonna work anything\nin like the way that I want it to.\n\n426\n00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,990\nAnd that is because NAT,\nlike a couple of other things here,\n\n427\n00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,610\nthat we already talked about,\nreally access control list,\n\n428\n00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,180\nthere's two parts to the idea\nof configuring that here.\n\n429\n00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,440\nNot only do we need to configure\nthe rule to make it work, but\n\n430\n00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,600\nwe also have to configure\nwhere it's gonna work as well.\n\n431\n00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n432\n00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,510\n>> In that command, I specified that\nthe inside source was a static address.\n\n433\n00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,130\nWell the router doesn't know\nwhat's inside and what's outside.\n\n434\n00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,700\nWe've got to tell it.\n\n435\n00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,239\nSo when I look at my\n\n436\n00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:20,209\ninterfaces, I can see that Gig\n\n437\n00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:25,750\n0/1 is my inside, and Gig 0/0 is my\noutside, so I need to go and tell it that.\n\n438\n00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:31,960\nSo I'm gonna get into interface Gi0/0,\nwhere I will say IP net outside.\n\n439\n00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:40,120\nAnd then I'll get into interface Gi0/1,\nas soon as it gets happy again.\n\n440\n00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,620\nThere we go.\n\n441\n00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,140\nWhere I will say IP net inside.\n\n442\n00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,706\nOkay, so now it knows,\nwhen I pass from Gi0/1,\n\n443\n00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:56,210\nover to Gi0/0,\nthat's when we're going to apply NAT.\n\n444\n00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,310\nNAT only applies when you pass\nfrom one interface to another, and\n\n445\n00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,750\nwhen one is marked as inside and\none is marked as outside.\n\n446\n00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,330\n>> Two very important configurations.\n\n447\n00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,430\nThe rule for what we just did, which was\nthe one that Don typed in there with\n\n448\n00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,690\nthe static address that we put in there.\n\n449\n00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,460\nSecondly, we must\nconfigure the interfaces.\n\n450\n00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,790\nI can't tell you how many times I've done\njust portions of it, I actually just did,\n\n451\n00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:25,000\nalso just NAT IP inside, and\nforgot to do the IP NAT outside.\n\n452\n00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,770\nOr just switched them around.\n\n453\n00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,810\nIf you switch it around,\nin our particular configuration here,\n\n454\n00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,844\nwhere 0/0 is IP NAT inside, and\n\n455\n00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:38,690\nthen 0/1 is IP NAT outside, we\n\n456\n00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,152\nwould actually have a problem again which\nshould might not actually work either.\n\n457\n00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,100\n>> All right, so\nhere's the three commands that we ran.\n\n458\n00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,580\nThe first one I did was\nthis IP NAT source static,\n\n459\n00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,660\nmapping my internal IP to my external IP.\n\n460\n00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,340\nThen I went into these two interfaces and\nflagged on as outside and one as inside.\n\n461\n00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,320\nNAT should be working now, and if I go and\n\n462\n00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,380\nI try that ping again that was failing\nearlier, I am able to ping now.\n\n463\n00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,000\nBut I don't really know if\nI'm being NATed or not.\n\n464\n00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,660\nSo I'm gonna repeat my session\nhere that died a moment ago.\n\n465\n00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,450\nI'm gonna restart my\nsession to that switch.\n\n466\n00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,590\nAnd just the fact that\nit's letting me log in,\n\n467\n00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,730\ntells me that I am getting to the system.\n\n468\n00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,680\nNow notice before when I ran show User,\nI showed up as 192.168.0.222.\n\n469\n00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,224\nNow, I show up as,\n\n470\n00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:31,338\n10.1.230.\n\n471\n00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:31,851\nOops, sorry, my head's on top of that.\n\n472\n00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:32,894\nThere we go.\n\n473\n00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:36,528\nNow I show up as 10.1.230.16, right?\n\n474\n00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,432\nSo I am being translated now.\n\n475\n00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:42,940\nI have control over my destination device,\nthat's why I'm able to see that.\n\n476\n00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,810\nWhat if you didn't have control\nover your destination device?\n\n477\n00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,350\nWell, we can see our translations\nright on the first router.\n\n478\n00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,200\nOn the router that's\ndoing the translation,\n\n479\n00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,230\nyou can run show IP net translation.\n\n480\n00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,030\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,980\nAnd when you run that it will show any\ntranslations that you have in place.\n\n482\n00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,012\nAnd I can see right here 10.1.230.16\nmapped with 192.168.0.222.\n\n483\n00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:17,990\nAll right, now this screen right here is\nchock-a-block full of information that\n\n484\n00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,071\nis extremely valuable and definitely needs\nto be known for the exam, all right?\n\n485\n00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,390\nBut looking at the clock,\nwe're pretty close to break time.\n\n486\n00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,720\nI don't think I can\nexplain all this in time.\n\n487\n00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,770\nSo why don't we do this.\n\n488\n00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,360\nWhy don't we stop here.\n\n489\n00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,860\nAnd when we get back from the break,\nwe'll dive into what each of these means:\n\n490\n00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,190\ninside global, inside local,\noutside local, outside global.\n\n491\n00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,115\nVery important stuff.\n\n492\n00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:41,360\n>> Yes\n>> Can\n\n493\n00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,480\nyou think of anything else we\nneed to mention before break?\n\n494\n00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,810\n>> Not yet,\nwe've got a lot more to cover though.\n\n495\n00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,510\n>> So let's stop here.\n\n496\n00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,760\nWe've only seen one of\nthe three methods of NAT and\n\n497\n00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,740\nwe got some dictionary\nterms to go over here.\n\n498\n00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,810\nQuite a bit more to go.\n\n499\n00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,074\nDefinitely stay tuned.\n\n500\n00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:00,124\nMore Cisco after this.\n\n501\n00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:08,880\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, Welcome back everybody!\n\n502\n00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,520\nSo, let's see,\n\n503\n00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,462\nlet's pull back up my session which\nI'm sure has timed out by now.\n\n504\n00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:18,440\nAll right, so let's take a look at this\nNAT screen that I've pulled up just\n\n505\n00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,700\nbefore the break and kind of go over what\nwe're seeing, because this gets a little\n\n506\n00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,820\nconfusing and it's almost a guarantee\nit's going to be on the exam.\n\n507\n00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,360\nYou got four terms across the top here.\n\n508\n00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,050\nInside global, wow,\n\n509\n00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,840\ntotally failed to highlight what\nI intended to highlight there.\n\n510\n00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,556\nAnyhow, inside global, inside local,\noutside local, outside global, right?\n\n511\n00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:43,480\nFour terms very similar,\nvery easy to confuse.\n\n512\n00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay?\n\n513\n00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,040\nSo, what it's basically doing here is,\n\n514\n00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,670\nit's showing us the translation\nthat happened, all right.\n\n515\n00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,120\nOn the left side of the screen, over here.\n\n516\n00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,988\nOh, that didn't work either.\n\n517\n00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like\n\n518\n00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,100\nthe computer is working against me.\n\n519\n00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,450\nThere we go.\n\n520\n00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,570\nOn the left side of the screen\nare our inside addresses, and\n\n521\n00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,440\nthe right side of the screen\nare the outside addresses.\n\n522\n00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,660\nNow remember, we mapped the interfaces,\n\n523\n00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,350\nwe told it that one interface was inside,\none interface was outside.\n\n524\n00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:18,030\nSo the inside addresses really relate\nto us, the machines we control,\n\n525\n00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,100\nand the outside pertains to\nthe machines that are outside.\n\n526\n00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,430\nYeah, we don't control those guys.\n\n527\n00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,590\nSo when it starts to\ntell these terms apart,\n\n528\n00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,240\njust remember the first word\nis either inside or outside.\n\n529\n00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,650\nAnd that refers to who\nowns these machines.\n\n530\n00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,830\nInside is us.\n\n531\n00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,410\nOutside is everybody else.\n\n532\n00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,240\n>> Yes.\n\n533\n00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,750\nThen we come to the second term\n[LAUGH] which is the one that\n\n534\n00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,410\nusually becomes confusing.\n\n535\n00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,490\nRemember, the key term there, keep in\nmind inside versus outside is the key.\n\n536\n00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,900\nNow, notice that on both sides though,\nthis is where the terms match, right?\n\n537\n00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,940\nWe have an inside local, and\nalso an outside local here.\n\n538\n00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,080\nSo the inside local addresses, for us, are\nusually the ones that we're actually gonna\n\n539\n00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,760\nbe using with our private IP addresses,\nis the one that we're gonna have.\n\n540\n00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,700\n>> Now the way that I remember these,\n\n541\n00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,880\nis local versus global is talking\nabout the uniqueness of the address.\n\n542\n00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,830\nA local address is locally unique.\n\n543\n00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,160\nThat means, I'm the only one using\nthat address on my local network.\n\n544\n00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,291\nBut there might be other people\nin the world using that address.\n\n545\n00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:30,780\nSo 192.168.0.222 is locally unique and\non my inside network.\n\n546\n00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,080\nIt's inside my network,\nI own it, all right?\n\n547\n00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,207\nBut when I send it out to the Internet,\nI translated it.\n\n548\n00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,045\nSo it's still inside.\n\n549\n00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:40,845\nIt's still my machine, but\n\n550\n00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,445\nthe address that I translated\nit to is globally unique.\n\n551\n00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,575\nIt's normally a public.\n\n552\n00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,725\nWe did a fake one here\nbecause I control it, but\n\n553\n00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:50,030\nnormally we do this to our public address.\n\n554\n00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,150\nAnd your public address is\nunique across the entire world.\n\n555\n00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,740\nThe global, the uniqueness.\n\n556\n00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,076\nSo that's where the local and\nthe global side comes in.\n\n557\n00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:02,244\nNow the tricky part here is,\nwhen we talk about NAT,\n\n558\n00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:05,206\nwe're normally translating\nour own machines.\n\n559\n00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:09,421\nBut you can actually translate\nthe outside address too, if you wanted.\n\n560\n00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:12,432\nIf you wanted to translate\nthe person you're getting to,\n\n561\n00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,570\nnow there's not many scenarios\nwhere you would do this.\n\n562\n00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,640\nOne example might be,\nmaybe you're a company, and you acquire\n\n563\n00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,740\nsome other company, and they're using\nthe same IP address ranges as you are.\n\n564\n00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,340\nSo you might choose to NAT that, so\n\n565\n00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,620\nthat you don't see they're running\nthe same address as you, right?\n\n566\n00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,920\nSo it's not a very common thing,\nbut you can.\n\n567\n00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,890\nAnd so it's listing the outside local,\nand outside global here.\n\n568\n00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,970\nNow I was on my way to an outside system,\nright?\n\n569\n00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,800\nLike to Amazon or whatever,\nwe'll just say this IP here.\n\n570\n00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,710\nAnd notice how the outside local and\noutside global are the same.\n\n571\n00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,590\nThat's because we didn't translate those.\n\n572\n00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,140\nWe didn't translate the destination,\nwe translated the source.\n\n573\n00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,138\nAnd looking at the source,\nit did change, from 192.168.0.222\n\n574\n00:32:57,138 --> 00:33:01,620\nto 10.1.230.16,\nthat was the change that we made, right?\n\n575\n00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,440\nSo for the exam,\nremember these four addresses.\n\n576\n00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,220\nInside global, right?\n\n577\n00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,210\nThat's our local machine, and\nthe address that we're translating it to,\n\n578\n00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,260\nthe global unique address\nwe're translating it to.\n\n579\n00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,150\nInside local, that's our inside machine,\nour own machine, and\n\n580\n00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,660\nthe address that it had that's\nlocally unique, typically the private.\n\n581\n00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,780\nAll right?\n\n582\n00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,300\nOutside local, that's the outside machine,\nand if we were translating it,\n\n583\n00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,670\nthis is the local address that\nwe would recognize it as.\n\n584\n00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,150\nAnd then outside global,\nthat's the outside machine again.\n\n585\n00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,485\nAnd the global unique address across\nthe entire planet that that machine has.\n\n586\n00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,572\n>> Yeah, a couple of other things\nabout this translation here.\n\n587\n00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,790\nOr I should say at least one\nother thing here, right?\n\n588\n00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,610\nDon, if we do another show IP nat trans\nright now, is the information still there?\n\n589\n00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,110\nLet's see.\n\n590\n00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:00,550\nSome of it.\n\n591\n00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,340\nYeah, some of the information\nis actually still there.\n\n592\n00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,520\nFor us, there are some times where we\nwill end up with the idea of a static\n\n593\n00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,200\ntranslation, which means it will\nalways stay in the table, okay?\n\n594\n00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,970\nAnd so it will always translate that\nparticular one address to that particular\n\n595\n00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:19,030\nIP address, from the inside local to\nthe inside global address for us.\n\n596\n00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,070\nSometimes, though, we're gonna\nsee in just a few minutes here,\n\n597\n00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,920\nwhere it's not gonna\nstay in there forever.\n\n598\n00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,070\nAnd that actually allows us to be able\nto reuse, I don't wanna say reuse,\n\n599\n00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,810\nactually be able to dynamically\ntranslate the information.\n\n600\n00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,660\nSo we'll see that that information will\nkind of disappear after a while, too.\n\n601\n00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,430\n>> Yeah, and the static mappings\nare really easy to spot.\n\n602\n00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,860\nBecause you'll see 'em in here\nwith the destination blanked out.\n\n603\n00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,590\nSo see those two blanks right there?\n\n604\n00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:47,026\nWhat that's doing is saying,\nI'm gonna put this map in for 192.168.222,\n\n605\n00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:53,180\nmapping it to 10.1.230.16, and it's\nalways there even if it's not talking.\n\n606\n00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,140\nIf I start to talk, that's when it\ncreates all these other entries up here.\n\n607\n00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,640\nThese are all the ones\nthat kind of come and\n\n608\n00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,670\ngo, but\nthere's this permanent entry right here.\n\n609\n00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,780\nNow we did a one to one static mapping.\n\n610\n00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,880\nSo we mapped my internal\nIP to this external IP.\n\n611\n00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,360\nWhen you do that,\nyou'll get this permanent entry.\n\n612\n00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,120\nThe other types of NAT that we're\ngonna show, are not like that, right.\n\n613\n00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,090\nThis is the only time we get the permanent\nentry just like this, all right.\n\n614\n00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:27,970\nAnd, when we start to communicate, so like\nif I open up a ping to 4.2.2.1, all right.\n\n615\n00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,490\nAnd I go back here, and\nI start looking at my translations.\n\n616\n00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,670\nThe pings are gonna start appearing,\nso there they are, right?\n\n617\n00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,280\nOr at least, there's one of them.\n\n618\n00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,100\nAnd so it's gonna start\ndoing that translation, and\n\n619\n00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,060\nwhen we stop, over time,\nthat's gonna age out.\n\n620\n00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,780\nAnd it'll drop out of the table.\n\n621\n00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,560\nSo you'll see the address\ntranslations come out.\n\n622\n00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,985\nNow, we can clear that.\n\n623\n00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,859\nThere we go, clear ip nat translation, and\n\n624\n00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,870\nthen I could have specified\na particular session.\n\n625\n00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,870\nI just did a star.\n\n626\n00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n627\n00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,280\n>> And if we take a look at it now,\n\n628\n00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,970\nyou'll see where that ping is now gone,\nthe permanent one is still there.\n\n629\n00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,620\nAnd it looks like I opened up\na connection to this address really fast.\n\n630\n00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,740\nI wonder what that is.\n\n631\n00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,948\nIt's probably something I've\ngot open in the background.\n\n632\n00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:20,640\n>> Now Don brings up a good point\nabout that clear ip nat translation.\n\n633\n00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,260\nThe reason why I remember that\nbecause all this is syntax, right.\n\n634\n00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,140\nIt has to be exact here for us.\n\n635\n00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,948\nIf you just do a clear ip nat translation,\n\n636\n00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:33,820\nyou're gonna see that there may\nactually be an issue in comparison.\n\n637\n00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,660\nWe lose our IVG,\n>> He's nodding at me.\n\n638\n00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,640\n>> That's fine.\n>> Apparently.\n\n639\n00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,700\n>> Yeah, but remember that you\neither have to specifically state\n\n640\n00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,820\nwhich particular address that\nyou're trying to clear out.\n\n641\n00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,890\nOr you just go ahead and\nclear out the whole table.\n\n642\n00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,580\nAnd make sure you have the asterisk or\nthe star in there.\n\n643\n00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,090\nIf not, you're gonna actually see that\nthat may not be a correct answer.\n\n644\n00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,750\nOh, it's back up.\n\n645\n00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,455\nSo there you go.\n\n646\n00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,200\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n647\n00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,920\nSo static mapping's like this and\nwe use them typically with servers.\n\n648\n00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,660\nYou got an internal server,\nyou wanna give it an external IP, so\n\n649\n00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,140\nyou map one IP to a server all right.\n\n650\n00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,730\nBut, this is not the most\ncommon of NAT forms.\n\n651\n00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,505\nIn fact, of the three NAT forms,\nthis one's probably in second place.\n\n652\n00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n653\n00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,770\nThe next one we're gonna\ntalk about is in last place.\n\n654\n00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,580\nThis is the least commonly used.\n\n655\n00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,540\nLet's say that you've got\na pool of public IP addresses.\n\n656\n00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,468\nSo maybe you buy a T1 line or\nMPLS line or whatever, and\n\n657\n00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:31,430\nthe service provider\ngives you 15 addresses.\n\n658\n00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,180\nAll right.\n\n659\n00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,460\nWell, you can create a pool\nof 15 addresses, and\n\n660\n00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,150\nyou can set them up on a first come,\nfirst serve basis.\n\n661\n00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,500\nYou can say all right,\n\n662\n00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,240\nanybody whose going out,\nyou can just grab from this bank of IP's.\n\n663\n00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,552\nGrab the first one available all right,\nand then the second person who comes\n\n664\n00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:52,820\nalong can grab the second address, and the\nthird one the third address, and so on.\n\n665\n00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,820\nIf they don't use the address for\na period of time, it'll age out and\n\n666\n00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,060\nthe address will get freed up for\nthe next person.\n\n667\n00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,430\nIf all of the addresses are in use,\nthough, and\n\n668\n00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,330\nsomebody else comes along,\nthey can't get translated.\n\n669\n00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,480\nYou're out of IPs, all right?\n\n670\n00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,980\n>> So the sixteenth one just doesn't\nget an IP address, and has to wait.\n\n671\n00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,370\n>> That's it.\nYeah it'll actually try and\n\n672\n00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,740\ngo out non-translated\n>> Yeah.\n\n673\n00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,450\n>> And the ISP will throw it away.\n\n674\n00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,300\nSo if you're gonna do this route,\nwhat's called dynamic NAT.\n\n675\n00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,930\nIf you're going to do dynamic NAT, you've\ngot to make sure that you have enough\n\n676\n00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,340\npublic IPs to service the amount\nof internal IPs that you've got.\n\n677\n00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,840\nAnd most people don't.\n\n678\n00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,170\nIP addresses are at a premium,\n\n679\n00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,570\nmost people don't have enough public\nIPs to match their internal systems.\n\n680\n00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,610\n>> So for us,\nthis is that least common one,\n\n681\n00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,063\nbut it is still something\nthat they do require you.\n\n682\n00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:42,480\nNow just when we talked about the\nconfiguration side of the static one as\n\n683\n00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,420\nbeing fairly simple when we did it, this\none's just a little bit more complicated.\n\n684\n00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,050\nIt doesn't have to be super complicated,\nbut\n\n685\n00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,080\nit is a little bit more\ncomplicated at this bigger point.\n\n686\n00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,890\nSo Don right now is going ahead and\n\n687\n00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,150\nclearing out the current translation for\nus.\n\n688\n00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,800\n>> Yep.\n\n689\n00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,600\nSo I'm just gonna bump that one out.\n\n690\n00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:05,440\n>> And verify that we actually don't\nhave any translations going on.\n\n691\n00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720\n>> There we go.\n\n692\n00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,240\nWhen you're not doing NAT,\nif you run show ip NAT translations,\n\n693\n00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,063\nyou'll just get a blank line\nlike I did right there.\n\n694\n00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:16,890\nAnd that tells me there are no\ntranslations in place, and there we go.\n\n695\n00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,670\nNow I still have my interfaces\nflagged as inside and outside.\n\n696\n00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,180\nWe need that with all\nthree translation types.\n\n697\n00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,830\nSo I'm leaving that be,\nbecause I still need it, but\n\n698\n00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,140\nI've removed that static entry,\nI'm no longer being natted.\n\n699\n00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:34,830\nAnd if I really wanted to doubly verify,\nI could reconnect to this switch here.\n\n700\n00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,667\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n\n701\n00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:40,550\nAnd oh, I remove the route.\n\n702\n00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,640\nSo I'm not gonna be able to meet you.\n\n703\n00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,650\nSo I'm not natting so\nI can't even get to the switch.\n\n704\n00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,320\nSo all right.\n\n705\n00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,940\nSo I know that that's proper and\nwe're in business there, all right.\n\n706\n00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,920\nSo now, let's set up dynamic NAT.\n\n707\n00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,585\nStep one with dynamic NAT,\nwe have to define our pool of addresses.\n\n708\n00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:59,535\n>> And this is where we actually\nhave to rely on the skill that we\n\n709\n00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:03,728\nlearned on another show here, which is\nabout the access control list essentially.\n\n710\n00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:07,830\nWhat we're really gonna end up doing,\nis we're going to Define that pool\n\n711\n00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,920\nof addresses, so that we can classify what\nwe want to actually be able to NAT here.\n\n712\n00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,040\nAnd usually the way that we do this\nis by creating a standard [LAUGH]\n\n713\n00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,740\naccess controller.\n\n714\n00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,330\nI couldn't remember what I was about say.\n\n715\n00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:19,920\nHappens, yep.\n\n716\n00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,220\n>> Now, for the pool, we don't have to\ndo an ACL, but for the inside we will.\n\n717\n00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,200\nFor the pool here, we'll gonna\nstart off just by giving it a name.\n\n718\n00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,490\nI'll call it the ITProTV pool.\n\n719\n00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,300\nThen it's going to ask for\na starting address and an ending address.\n\n720\n00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,614\nAnd so what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna say 10.1.230.17 and\n\n721\n00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:45,656\nthen the ending address\nwhich will be 10.1.230.20.\n\n722\n00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:48,141\nAll right, so that, whoops!\n\n723\n00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,570\nAnd what did I leave out?\n\n724\n00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,300\n>> Netmask.\n>> Oh,\n\n725\n00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,440\nI guess I have to give a netmask,\nwhich is a class C.\n\n726\n00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,100\n>> Now make sure you do include\nthe actual term netmask in there.\n\n727\n00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,600\nI know it seems unusual.\n\n728\n00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,820\nSometimes you read it, and you just\nstart typing in the subnet mask, and\n\n729\n00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,240\nthat's where you're gonna actually\nget also that kind of invalid or\n\n730\n00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,850\nambiguous type of command there.\n\n731\n00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,620\nSo make sure you do use that\nkeyword netmask before you type\n\n732\n00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,360\nin the subnet mask.\n\n733\n00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,210\n>> So now, any time somebody\ngoes from inside-to-outside,\n\n734\n00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,390\nwhat we're gonna tell the system to grab\nan IP address from this pool right here.\n\n735\n00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,780\nAnd the pool goes from 17 to 20,\nwhich is only four addresses.\n\n736\n00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,330\nRight?\n\n737\n00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:28,925\n17, 18, 19, 20.\nYeah, four.\n\n738\n00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:29,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I understand.\n\n739\n00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,850\n>> I gotta count on my fingers here.\n\n740\n00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,600\nSo it's only four addresses.\n\n741\n00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,540\nSo the first four people to go through and\nget addresses, the fifth person,\n\n742\n00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,770\nout of luck, right?\n\n743\n00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,620\nBut, over time as people idle out,\nthey'll give up their IP and\n\n744\n00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,000\nit'll become available again.\n\n745\n00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,340\nBut this pool is so small that only four\npeople are gonna be able to get out.\n\n746\n00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,515\nThe second thing that I need is an access\ncontrol list, like Ronnie was saying.\n\n747\n00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:59,740\nI need an ACL to define who's\nallowed to use this address.\n\n748\n00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,160\nIf I've only got four addresses available,\n\n749\n00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,050\nI might wanna limit this\ndown to just four people.\n\n750\n00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,110\nWell, when we're NATing like this,\nwe're NATing the source address.\n\n751\n00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,750\nSo we just need a standard ACL.\n\n752\n00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:16,300\nA standard ACL is enough to filter our own\nsource and we can start to specify that.\n\n753\n00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:22,110\nNow, on some routers,\nyou can do a numbered ACL,\n\n754\n00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,290\non other routers,\nyou can do numbered or named ACLs.\n\n755\n00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,760\nBut not every router supports\nnamed ACLs with NAT, so\n\n756\n00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,780\nI've kind of gotten in the habit\nof always doing a numbered ACL.\n\n757\n00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,955\nBut just be aware that some\nrouters do support a named.\n\n758\n00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:38,730\n[COUGH] So what I'm gonna do is say,\naccess-list 1.\n\n759\n00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,957\nHang on, let me verify that I\ndon't already have an access-list.\n\n760\n00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:44,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't.\n\n761\n00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,400\nGood.\n\n762\n00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,720\nSo I'm gonna say access-list 1, permit.\n\n763\n00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,190\nAnd now I'm going to specify\nwho's allowed to use this pool.\n\n764\n00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:00,530\nI'm just going to say 192.168.0.0\nwith a 0.0.0.255 subnet mask.\n\n765\n00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,170\nSo basically, anybody.\n\n766\n00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,340\n>> Anybody.\n>> Inside on my 192.168.0.0 network is\n\n767\n00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,455\nallowed to use it.\n\n768\n00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:07,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n769\n00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,080\nBut you can get a specific and\ngranular as you want in here,\n\n770\n00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,655\nlimiting it to particular IPs.\n\n771\n00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,390\n>> Now that we have both the pool is find.\n\n772\n00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,470\nAs well as who's gonna be\nactually translated in that pool,\n\n773\n00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,185\nwe have to now make a statement\nthat combines them both together.\n\n774\n00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:23,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n775\n00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,812\nSo now comes the long command.\n\n776\n00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:32,890\nBefore, when we created that access list,\nI ran IP here.\n\n777\n00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,910\nLet's do this.\n\n778\n00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,760\nOkay, I ran IP NAT,\nwhich told that I'm turning on NAT,\n\n779\n00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,110\ninside source, so where the source address\nis coming from, well in my case I said,\n\n780\n00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:51,500\na static of 192.168.0.222, and\nthen I had to tell the destination,\n\n781\n00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,170\nwhich was going to be\ntranslating it into 10.1.230.16.\n\n782\n00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,490\nSo first off,\nmy source is no longer static mapping.\n\n783\n00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,420\n>> Right.\n>> My source is now an ACL.\n\n784\n00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,430\nSo I need to change this to say,\nIP NAT inside source list 1.\n\n785\n00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,740\nOkay?\n\n786\n00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,140\nSo the source addresses\nare coming from that access list.\n\n787\n00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,350\nAnd then for the destination,\nthe destination is no longer a single IP.\n\n788\n00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,620\nIt's now a pool, and\nthe pool is called ITProTV.\n\n789\n00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,890\n>> Now Don, is that name case sensitive?\n\n790\n00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,946\n>> As far as I'm aware.\n\n791\n00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:26,576\n>> Yeah.\n\n792\n00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:31,640\n[LAUGH] Make sure, a lot of times,\nyou may actually go,\n\n793\n00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,110\noh it's not case sensitive and you type\nit in and there's the problem again.\n\n794\n00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,160\nSo yeah, this is case sensitive.\n\n795\n00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,720\n>> I thought you were about to\nsay it wasn't, I was like, Oh,\n\n796\n00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,940\nI'm about to learn something.\n\n797\n00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,888\n>> No, no.\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n798\n00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,438\n>> Yeah, you do have to be careful\n\n799\n00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:44,170\nabout this.\n\n800\n00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,210\nAnd same thing with named ACLs.\n\n801\n00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,610\nWhen you create named ACLs,\nthey are case sensitive.\n\n802\n00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,320\nYep.\n>> Yeah.\n\n803\n00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,515\n>> So when I run that,\nthat's what's binding the two things.\n\n804\n00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:56,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> My source is now access list 1, so\n\n805\n00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,880\nthe inside source is defined\nby that access list and\n\n806\n00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,605\nmy translated IP is\ncoming from pool ITProTV.\n\n807\n00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:04,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n808\n00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:04,920\n>> Alright.\n\n809\n00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,000\nStating it like this\nis now one-to-one map.\n\n810\n00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,430\nIn hindsight it would be a good\nidea to add these to show notes.\n\n811\n00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,260\nBecause if you're watching this later on,\n\n812\n00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,430\nyou'd probably want to\nreconstruct these events.\n\n813\n00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,942\nSo you know, I had to create the pool,\nI had to create the ACL.\n\n814\n00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:30,030\nSo we created the pool, we created the ACL\nand now we tied it together, right?\n\n815\n00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,440\nSo there's the three commands\nthat went into this and\n\n816\n00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,050\nI don't know if I still have from up\nbefore, the commands that we did.\n\n817\n00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,040\nI did output it at one point.\n\n818\n00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,690\nLet's just jump all the way back here.\n\n819\n00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,010\nThings that would be useful after the-\n>> There it is.\n\n820\n00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:44,510\n>> There it is.\n\n821\n00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:49,797\nAnd I'll post these show notes\nwith the video on the website, so\n\n822\n00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:53,540\nif you're watching this live,\nthey're not gonna be there right now.\n\n823\n00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,780\nBut tomorrow, when the show gets posted in\nthe episode library, I'll attach these.\n\n824\n00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,980\nSo we started off with\na One-to-one Static Mapping.\n\n825\n00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,910\nRight, so that's what's defined here.\n\n826\n00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:13,520\nAnd then here,\nI'm doing a dynamic mapping,\n\n827\n00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,224\nwhich is also called a many-to-many,\nsometimes.\n\n828\n00:46:20,832 --> 00:46:24,330\nAll right and, the commands are already\ndone so I didn't have to do them again.\n\n829\n00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,810\nBut assuming I was starting from scratch,\n\n830\n00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,930\nI would have needed to map my inside and\noutside.\n\n831\n00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,918\nSo I'm gonna add those, right there.\n\n832\n00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:35,839\nAnd then let me just put these back.\n\n833\n00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:40,187\nAll right.\n\n834\n00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:44,748\nSo there's the commands for doing\ndynamic NAT like we're doing right now.\n\n835\n00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:49,970\nSo we're done right here as far\nis this thing is concerned.\n\n836\n00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,980\nThe dynamic NAT is created.\n\n837\n00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,130\nIf I get out, it might even be in action\nbecause, did I leave that ping running?\n\n838\n00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:56,910\nNo, I stopped the ping.\n\n839\n00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,440\nHere, I'll start that ping again.\n\n840\n00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,840\nSo there goes that ping, running.\n\n841\n00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,430\nAnd as I pass through that router,\nI should be getting translated.\n\n842\n00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,360\nI guess I can verify that,\n\n843\n00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,170\nI should be able to get to\nthat other switch right now.\n\n844\n00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,844\nLet me go and restart it.\n\n845\n00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,036\nWhat is my password?\n\n846\n00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,398\nThere we go.\n\n847\n00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:24,753\nAll right, and so there I am,\nI'm getting 10.1.230.17,\n\n848\n00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:26,810\nthe first address from the pool.\n\n849\n00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,210\nI just grabbed it right out\nof the pool and ran with it.\n\n850\n00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,060\nIt's tied to me.\n>> Yep.\n\n851\n00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:37,789\n>> And If I go back here,\nshow IP net translations, and there we go.\n\n852\n00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:44,206\nWe can see 192.168.0.222 is now\nbeing mapped to 10.1.230.17.\n\n853\n00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:48,030\nSo we're getting mapped and\n\n854\n00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,060\nif another person came along,\nplugged in here and started to work.\n\n855\n00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,330\nThey would then get 10.1.230.18.\n\n856\n00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:57,190\nAnd then, 19 and then, 20.\n\n857\n00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,525\nAnd the next person-\n>> No 21.\n\n858\n00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,660\n>> Would get nothing,\nthey'd be out of luck.\n\n859\n00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,080\n>> So here's the least popular version\nthat we'll actually end up seeing for us.\n\n860\n00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,694\nAnd so,\nwe probably don't see that as often.\n\n861\n00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:12,477\nSo now, anything else we need to\nadd here on this dynamic mapping?\n\n862\n00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:14,729\n>> I'm just gonna add\nsome related commands.\n\n863\n00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:15,913\n>> Okay.\n\n864\n00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:18,501\nHere because we've done, yep, [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep.\n\n865\n00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:23,697\n>> So we did was show ip nat translations,\n\n866\n00:48:23,697 --> 00:48:27,966\nas well as clear ip nat\n>> Translations, star,\n\n867\n00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:30,700\nthose are some good commands to remember.\n\n868\n00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,730\n>> Yep.\n\n869\n00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:36,350\n>> All right, so, you can see\nthe limitation of many to many, right.\n\n870\n00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,660\nYou gotta have this pool, and most of us\ndon't have that kind of pool available.\n\n871\n00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,970\nEven us, ITPro tv we have, I think,\n\n872\n00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,690\nwe have 32 public IP addresses,\nwhich is a lot.\n\n873\n00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,240\nYou know, for most people, but\nwe've got like 150 machines here, and\n\n874\n00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,140\nso there's nowhere near enough, and\nthat's how almost every company is.\n\n875\n00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,380\nIt doesn't matter how big you are,\nmost companies don't have enough IPs,\n\n876\n00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,290\nso I've never used many in production\nanywhere, have you anywhere?\n\n877\n00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,240\n>> Nah.\n\n878\n00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,480\n>> So yeah, that's not a big one.\n\n879\n00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,630\nInstead, we're gonna see this last one.\n\n880\n00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:10,658\nThis last one is the most popular,\nit is when we do a many\n\n881\n00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:17,150\nto one mapping, and\nlet me just kind of change that,\n\n882\n00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,710\nit is called dynamic overload.\n\n883\n00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,040\nAll right.\n\n884\n00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,490\nIt's dynamic, just like the last example,\nin that we don't have static mappings,\n\n885\n00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,500\nthat's kind of done on\na first come first serve...\n\n886\n00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,440\nBut, we're gonna overload the IP, so\n\n887\n00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,880\nthat we can have many machines\nsharing a single address.\n\n888\n00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,010\nAnd this is what almost everybody does.\n\n889\n00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,310\nAll right.\n\n890\n00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,480\nNow, before I show the implementation of\nthis one though, I want to draw a picture,\n\n891\n00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,959\ncuz there's a little more to be concerned\nabout on this one then on all the others.\n\n892\n00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,440\nOn all the others, on a static mapping,\nor a dynamic mapping with a pool.\n\n893\n00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,560\nOne internal host is being\nmatched to one public IP.\n\n894\n00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,260\nSo when the router receives\na reply from the internet,\n\n895\n00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,700\nIt knows exactly who to send\nit to based on that IP, right?\n\n896\n00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:16,036\nLet me draw a better picture,\na picture with more room maybe.\n\n897\n00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:18,950\nOr you know what?\n\n898\n00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,760\nLet's do this.\n\n899\n00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,080\nI wanna draw a good picture,\nnot a crap picture like I normally draw.\n\n900\n00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,250\nAnd we're getting pretty\nclose to break time.\n\n901\n00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,180\nSo how bout this?\n\n902\n00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,450\nWhat don't we stop and take a break?\n\n903\n00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,660\nI'll draw a, well I don't want\nto build up expectations.\n\n904\n00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,425\nSo I'll build a mediocre\npicture during the break.\n\n905\n00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:35,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And when we get back I wanna show you\n\n906\n00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,340\nguys just what it looks like graphically,\nwhen we do a dynamic to a pool.\n\n907\n00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,810\n>> And\nthen show you dynamcic with overload, and\n\n908\n00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,380\nit is really the one that\nwe use almost everywhiere.\n\n909\n00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,920\nSo it's probably the most important of the\nthree NAT types that we show you today.\n\n910\n00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,180\nAll right so stay tuned.\n\n911\n00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,911\nWhen we get back,\nmore art lessons from Ronnie and Don.\n\n912\n00:50:53,911 --> 00:50:54,703\n>> That's right.\n\n913\n00:50:54,703 --> 00:51:00,261\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back\n\n914\n00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:05,610\nit is mediocre picture time.\n\n915\n00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,536\n>> That's right.\n\n916\n00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,930\n>> All right, so\nI drew a kind of a layout here.\n\n917\n00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,990\nAnd in our diagram earlier, and\n\n918\n00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,720\neven in our examples,\nit's always been just my laptop.\n\n919\n00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,078\nMy one machine going out to the internet,\nand that's it.\n\n920\n00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:21,651\nAnd, that's fine when you're\ndoing static mappings, and\n\n921\n00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:23,650\nwhen you're doing dynamic mappings.\n\n922\n00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,970\nBut when we're doing overload,\n\n923\n00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,630\nwe really need to see what happens when\nwe've got more than one machine involved.\n\n924\n00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,430\nSo, let's take a look\nat my awesome diagram.\n\n925\n00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,720\n>> Oh, look.\nEven a drop shadow.\n\n926\n00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,330\nYou're good.\n\n927\n00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,570\n>> I go the extra mile for our viewers.\n\n928\n00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,362\n>> Yeah, that's\n>> Pretty cool.\n\n929\n00:51:36,362 --> 00:51:39,244\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI think it just does that automatically.\n\n930\n00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:41,020\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH] Wow.\n\n931\n00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,470\n>> [LAUGH] So\nif I have one machine like PC1 here.\n\n932\n00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,130\nAnd it's going across the network and\ngoing out, right?\n\n933\n00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,080\nSo, you know I didn't draw IP addresses\non the router, so on the router,\n\n934\n00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,790\nyou know on the inside,\nit might be 192.168.0.1, like that.\n\n935\n00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,660\nBut on the outside, right,\n\n936\n00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,810\non the outside it might be something\nentirely different like 209.251.133.187.\n\n937\n00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:13,110\nLet me make that actually\nfit in the space I provided.\n\n938\n00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,222\nThere.\n\n939\n00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:17,010\nAll right, so\nit might be an address like that.\n\n940\n00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,770\nOkay?\n\n941\n00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:22,500\nNow when the routers pass through, if I've\ngot a ton of public addresses, then I'll\n\n942\n00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,630\njust go ahead and map them to each have\ntheir own address, and we're in business.\n\n943\n00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,690\nWhen somebody outside,\nlike Amazon, replies back,\n\n944\n00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,770\nit'll keep track of that, right?\n\n945\n00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,120\nSo let's say, for example, that my pool.\n\n946\n00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,080\nSo if I had a pool, a cement pond.\n\n947\n00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,070\nAnd it was, [LAUGH] see how many viewers\nhave watched Beverly Hillbillies.\n\n948\n00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:48,850\nAnd it was like 188 through 1 99, okay?\n\n949\n00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,580\nSo if that was my pool.\n\n950\n00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,890\nWhen we did dynamic net,\n\n951\n00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,810\nas people went out they would just\ngo first come first serve, right?\n\n952\n00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,400\nSo they would come in and\nthat's exactly what I wanted.\n\n953\n00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,390\nAnd they would get 192.168.0.11.\n\n954\n00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,310\nI'm just going to write it down here and\nthen I'll have to move it.\n\n955\n00:53:12,912 --> 00:53:16,070\nAll right, and when it went out to the\noutside it would just grab the first one\n\n956\n00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:22,190\nthat was available, like that.\n\n957\n00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:27,870\nAnd then the other guys, the other PCs,\nas they started to go out to the internet,\n\n958\n00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:33,120\nthey also grab addresses and\nstart to pass out.\n\n959\n00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,010\nSo, so 12 would come along, and 12 would\njust get the next address in line.\n\n960\n00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:43,630\nAnd then 13 would come along, and it\nwould just grab the next address in line.\n\n961\n00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,830\nAnd all along,\nthe router is keeping track of this.\n\n962\n00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,355\nThe router is writing it in\nwhat's called it's NAT table.\n\n963\n00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:51,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or the translation table.\n\n964\n00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:55,290\nAnd that's what we look at when\nwe do show IP net translations.\n\n965\n00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,760\nAll right.\n\n966\n00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,460\nNow, the reason I show you this,\n\n967\n00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,930\neven though we've already done it,\nis 'cuz I wanna highlight something.\n\n968\n00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:07,620\nIf I'm on PC number two, and\nI'm going to the Amazon website.\n\n969\n00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,530\nWhen I go out to the internet, like this,\n\n970\n00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:14,914\nI'm passing through the router, and\nthe router is translating my source.\n\n971\n00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:18,363\nTranslating 192.168.0.12\ninto 209.251.133.189.\n\n972\n00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:25,863\nWhen Amazon replies back,\nwhen they go to send a message back,\n\n973\n00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:34,730\ntheir reply has a destination\nof 209.251.133.189.\n\n974\n00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,470\nOkay.\n\n975\n00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,070\nSo when router one receives that,\nit looks at it's translation table, and\n\n976\n00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,400\nit says 189,\nthat's mapped to dot 12, and so\n\n977\n00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,120\nit translates it back and\nsends it to dot 12, right?\n\n978\n00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,330\nIt knows who to send it to.\n\n979\n00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:56,315\nBecause the global address is uniquely\ntied to individual internal machines.\n\n980\n00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:57,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n981\n00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:00,340\nStatic NAT and dynamic NAT both have that.\n\n982\n00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,110\nThe router does all the translation\nsolely based on IP address.\n\n983\n00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,970\n>> So what we're presenting here\nin our dynamic NAT overload.\n\n984\n00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,600\nIs that we're going to have\na problem at this point, right?\n\n985\n00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,970\nBecause what we're taking is we're taking\nall of our internal ip addresses, and\n\n986\n00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:20,830\ntranslating them into a single\npublic ip address for us.\n\n987\n00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:26,240\nSo we don't have that direct link in\ntranslation inside of the table itself,\n\n988\n00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,970\nis what is going to end up happening for\nus.\n\n989\n00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,550\n>> Yes.\n>> And so, the idea of NAT overload which\n\n990\n00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,190\nDon is going to show us how this works now\n>> And how we actually keep that separate.\n\n991\n00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,440\n>> So on most of our home routers, you get\na home router, you plug your cable modem\n\n992\n00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,936\nor DSL into it, the router gets\nthe one public address that you get.\n\n993\n00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:50,750\nSo here, 209.251.133.187, and\neverybody who passes through,\n\n994\n00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:55,710\nas they pass through the router gets\ntranslated to that one address.\n\n995\n00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,020\nNow here's the problem.\n\n996\n00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,070\nSo PC1, or let's say PC2 again.\n\n997\n00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,375\nWhoops.\n\n998\n00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:00,995\nPC2.\nDag gummit,\n\n999\n00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:03,605\nI'm just gonna mess this thing up.\n\n1000\n00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:05,608\nI'm destined to ruin this diagram.\n\n1001\n00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:09,381\nSo PC2 passes out to router one.\n\n1002\n00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:15,662\nRouter one receives it and translates\nit Sends it along out to Amazon.\n\n1003\n00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:19,990\nSo Amazon sees a connection\ncome in from 209.251.133.187.\n\n1004\n00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:25,480\nIt replies to that 187 address.\n\n1005\n00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,540\nNow the router gets it, and it looks\nat it's MAC table and what does it see?\n\n1006\n00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,450\nEverybody's mapped to 187.\n\n1007\n00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,020\nWho does it send it to?\n\n1008\n00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,040\nIt doesn't know.\n\n1009\n00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,000\nIt has no idea based on\nthe IP address alone,\n\n1010\n00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,520\nit's not enough information\nto figure out who it goes to.\n\n1011\n00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,660\n>> Right.\n\n1012\n00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,600\n>> So when we do, overload, when we have\n\n1013\n00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,250\nmore than one machine share an IP, it's\nnot enough to just have the IP address.\n\n1014\n00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,930\nWe also have to have the-\n>> Port.\n\n1015\n00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,060\n>> Port number used with the traffic.\n\n1016\n00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,730\n>> Yep\n>> All right?\n\n1017\n00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,820\nWhenever we open up a connection, so for\nexample, let me just drop back here.\n\n1018\n00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,160\nSo.\n\n1019\n00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,780\nHere.\n\n1020\n00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,340\nSo I'm gonna open up an SSH\nsession to this switch.\n\n1021\n00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,640\nLet me restart that session.\n\n1022\n00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,940\nAll right,\n\n1023\n00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,320\nso I'm connected to this switch,\nand this switch is 10.1.10.1.\n\n1024\n00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,460\nWhen I go back here,\nif I do a netstat-m, there.\n\n1025\n00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:30,320\nI've got a connection to\n10.1.10.1 on port 22.\n\n1026\n00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,245\nSSH uses TCP port 22.\n\n1027\n00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:34,809\nThat's what I'm seeing right\nhere on this bottom line.\n\n1028\n00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,307\nBut look at my source.\n\n1029\n00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:41,949\n192.168.222:50831.\n\n1030\n00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:46,710\nMy source board is 50,831.\n\n1031\n00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:51,784\nNow, every time I open up a connection to\na system, I'm using a dynamic source port.\n\n1032\n00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:52,805\nSee all these other ones?\n\n1033\n00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:56,729\n50801, 50804, and so on.\n\n1034\n00:57:56,729 --> 00:57:58,351\nDifferent PCs do it different ways, but\n\n1035\n00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,886\nyou start Ronnie do you remember\nthe exact number it starts on?\n\n1036\n00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:03,135\n>> 49,152.\n\n1037\n00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:08,349\n>> Okay, so a lot of times you'll start\nat 49,152 and just keep counting up.\n\n1038\n00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:12,750\nAnd when you hit 65,534,\nthen you start over again.\n\n1039\n00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,300\nRight?\n\n1040\n00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,670\nSo most PCs are doing this.\n\n1041\n00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:20,220\nThis source port is a method that\nthe router can use to tell these\n\n1042\n00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,680\ncommunications apart, all right?\n\n1043\n00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,890\nSo when we have a communication like in my\ndrawing, instead of just tracking an IP,\n\n1044\n00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,180\nwe can go a step further.\n\n1045\n00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,263\nAnd I'm gonna have to make my font\na little smaller to make room.\n\n1046\n00:58:34,263 --> 00:58:35,145\nSo.\n\n1047\n00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:45,700\nLet me just add the port\nnumbers onto my drawing here.\n\n1048\n00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,980\nSo as we start to map this stuff.\n\n1049\n00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,770\nIn addition to mapping the IP address,\nnow we add the port number.\n\n1050\n00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:59,200\nAnd these port numbers are semi\nrandomly generated, right?\n\n1051\n00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,610\nI saw semi,\nbecause we kinda know where they start.\n\n1052\n00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,553\nMaybe this computer just booted up so\nit's at 49,152.\n\n1053\n00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:15,709\n>> Now notice on the inside global we are\nactually adding in the port number from\n\n1054\n00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:17,118\nthe source address.\n\n1055\n00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:20,669\nAnd that's whats gonna help us to\nlink that all the way back inside,\n\n1056\n00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:23,492\non the inside local address\nas traffic returns here.\n\n1057\n00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,454\nHere we go.\n\n1058\n00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:39,639\n>> So now when Amazon receives that\nconnection from PC2, well PC2 went out.\n\n1059\n00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:44,204\n>> Mhmm.\n>> And it's source port was 192.168.0.12,\n\n1060\n00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,405\nport number 49,152.\n\n1061\n00:59:46,405 --> 00:59:51,810\nSo when Amazon replies back, it replies\nback to 209.251.133.187 on port 49,152.\n\n1062\n00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:56,810\nWhen router one receives that,\nit looks at its NAT\n\n1063\n00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:03,940\ntable, and it says oh yeah,\nI've got a connection on 49,152.\n\n1064\n01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,534\nIt maps back to 192.168.0.12.\n\n1065\n01:00:08,534 --> 01:00:13,270\nNow, it knows exactly who to\nsend that connection to, and\n\n1066\n01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,952\nit gets back to PC2 and not to PC1 or PC3.\n\n1067\n01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,320\nAll right?\n\n1068\n01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,460\nSo the port makes the real\ndifference there.\n\n1069\n01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,800\nAnd that's why when we do overload,\nit's not traditional NAT anymore.\n\n1070\n01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,220\nIt is still NAT,\nit's network address translation,\n\n1071\n01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,090\nwe're changing the network address.\n\n1072\n01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,910\nBut, it's called port address translation\n\n1073\n01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:36,600\nbecause we need the port to recognize\none address from another, all right.\n\n1074\n01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,455\nNow, there is one scenario\nI haven't called out here,\n\n1075\n01:00:38,455 --> 01:00:39,849\nis that what you were about to say Ronnie?\n\n1076\n01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:40,788\n>> Yeah.\n\n1077\n01:00:40,788 --> 01:00:44,060\n>> So, there's one scenario I\nhaven't called out here, all right?\n\n1078\n01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,461\nOne PC can open up many connections,\nright?\n\n1079\n01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:50,250\nIt can open up connections to several\ndifferent computers, or whatever.\n\n1080\n01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:55,990\nAnd as it does that,\nit's possible that two machines\n\n1081\n01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:00,580\ncould talk to the same destination\non the same port at the same time.\n\n1082\n01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,850\nIt could happen, not common,\nbut it does happen.\n\n1083\n01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:12,830\nSo maybe PC number 3, was going to\nAmazon at the same time as PC number 2.\n\n1084\n01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,050\nIf that were to happen, and\n\n1085\n01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,130\nthey use the same port number I end\nup in a slightly different problem.\n\n1086\n01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:18,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n1087\n01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,060\nlet me take PC number 3 here.\n\n1088\n01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,390\nAnd let's just say that it\nhappened to have just booted up.\n\n1089\n01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:27,400\nAnd it was browsing to\nAmazon at the same time.\n\n1090\n01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400\nAll right.\n\n1091\n01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,470\nAnd so it's using the same port number.\n\n1092\n01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,680\nTo go out.\n\n1093\n01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,780\nSo Amazon gets these two connections,\nthinks it's the same computer,\n\n1094\n01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,410\nonly replies to one of them.\n\n1095\n01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:42,740\nWell when router one gets the reply,\nit's not gonna know which one to send to.\n\n1096\n01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,680\n>> And you can clearly see that\non the inside global table here.\n\n1097\n01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,820\nNotice how we have the two\npublic IP address, or\n\n1098\n01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:51,545\none public IP addresses, both with\nthe same map into the same port number.\n\n1099\n01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:52,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n1100\n01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:55,800\nhow does the router actually know\nhow to separate this out Don?\n\n1101\n01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,630\n>> So what it does is when\nit translates the address.\n\n1102\n01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:03,960\nWhen it changes 192.168.0.13 into\n209.251.133.187, when it goes to change\n\n1103\n01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,310\nthem, it also changes the port number.\n\n1104\n01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,160\nIt translates the port.\n\n1105\n01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,910\nPort address translation.\n\n1106\n01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,040\nSo, it usually just bumps it up by one.\n\n1107\n01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,206\nSometimes.\nSometimes it has to\n\n1108\n01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:18,731\npick something completely random.\n\n1109\n01:02:18,731 --> 01:02:23,980\nBut it normally just bumps it up by\none to make it 49,153, all right?\n\n1110\n01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,490\nThat way when Amazon replies.\n\n1111\n01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:32,360\nIf it's a reply to 49152, it goes to PC 2,\nif it's a reply to 49153, it goes to PC3,\n\n1112\n01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,990\nbut if we left it that, it would break, it\nwouldn't match up with the session on PC3.\n\n1113\n01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,600\nSo when router 1 receives\nit's communication back,\n\n1114\n01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,440\nit has to translate not only\nthe address but the port number also.\n\n1115\n01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,323\nSo it'll have to change it from 49153,\nback to 49152, and send that to PC3.\n\n1116\n01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:53,910\nPC3 will never even know what happened.\n\n1117\n01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:56,590\nSo we're not just changing\nlayer three addresses,\n\n1118\n01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,820\nwe're also changing our layer\nfive session port numbers.\n\n1119\n01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,040\nSo that is a pivotal piece.\n\n1120\n01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,850\nOf overload, of dynamic overload,\nwhen we do a many to one\n\n1121\n01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:13,690\nmapping we've gotta have that port number\n>> Are we ready to show\n\n1122\n01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,860\nthe configuration now?\n\n1123\n01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:20,900\n>> Sure, now this configuration is not as\ndifficult as the one we did a minute ago,\n\n1124\n01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,230\nbecause we don't need a pool.\n\n1125\n01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,650\nSo let's just go back here and\nlet me find the system.\n\n1126\n01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,210\nSo I guess first off I need to turn off\nthe NAT that we put in place a moment ago.\n\n1127\n01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,870\n>> So remember as you practice this,\n\n1128\n01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,740\nmake sure you do turn off\nthe different translations.\n\n1129\n01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,860\nYou have in between.\n\n1130\n01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,300\nOr you may get more of a problem\nthan you realize a lot of times.\n\n1131\n01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,920\nSo usually it's as simple as actually\ntyping in the word no right in front of\n\n1132\n01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,760\nthe statement we created.\n\n1133\n01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,590\nAnd then verifying, and\nwe still have a pool number showing up.\n\n1134\n01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,963\nThere we go.\n>> Well the pool is still there,\n\n1135\n01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:01,179\nI'm just gonna toast it, and\njust make sure that's gone.\n\n1136\n01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:03,300\nThere we go.\n\n1137\n01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,722\nSo I do still have my interfaces flag,\nthere's inside and outside,\n\n1138\n01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,264\ncuz we still have to have that.\n\n1139\n01:04:08,264 --> 01:04:10,969\nI need, well I still need an ACL.\n\n1140\n01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:14,324\nI still need an access list to\nidentify my source systems, right?\n\n1141\n01:04:14,324 --> 01:04:19,372\nSo if I do a, let's see,\nlet me show everything\n\n1142\n01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:23,790\nthat I've gotten in place, let's see,\n\n1143\n01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:29,400\nwe need that, we need that and\nwe need that.\n\n1144\n01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,430\nThere we go.\n\n1145\n01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:35,590\nAlright, so so far I've gone into\ninterface gig 00, and did ip net outside.\n\n1146\n01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:40,060\nI've gone into interface gig 01,\nand done ip net inside, and\n\n1147\n01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:45,880\nI've done access list one permit\n192.169.0.0, with a class c wildcard mask.\n\n1148\n01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,492\nSo basically saying, that these are the\nranges that are allowed to be netted,\n\n1149\n01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:50,850\nall right.\n\n1150\n01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,240\nNow with nat overload we're\nnot mapping to a pool anymore.\n\n1151\n01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,010\nSo we're not mapping to a pool anymore.\n\n1152\n01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:03,170\nSo I don't need to define a pool, but I\nam going to need to define who we map to.\n\n1153\n01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,500\nSo who can we map to?\n\n1154\n01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,940\nWell, we can map to a single IP\nthat we just Pick out of a hat.\n\n1155\n01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,600\nWell, you can't do it that way, it's gotta\nbe one that you actually own and control.\n\n1156\n01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,230\nOr you can map to the IP address\non the interface of the router.\n\n1157\n01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,400\nAnd that's what a lot of us do.\n\n1158\n01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:25,480\nSo if my router already has a public IP,\nright, like on your router at home,\n\n1159\n01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,870\nyou probably have this.\n\n1160\n01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:30,470\nIf it's already got a public IP,\nmight as well use it.\n\n1161\n01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:35,190\nSo I can nat all my internal people\nto this one IP on the way out, and\n\n1162\n01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:37,290\nthen I only need one address.\n\n1163\n01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:40,220\nPerfect for home and small business,\nsmall office, home office, and\n\n1164\n01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,450\nlikely what you;ll see on the exam.\n\n1165\n01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,820\n>> Yup.\n\n1166\n01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,180\n>> Alright in a public,\nin a bigger network like ours here.\n\n1167\n01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,390\nWe've got a public address on our\nfirewall, but we don't nat to it.\n\n1168\n01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,650\nWe actually nat to a separate IP that\nI used from the public range, and\n\n1169\n01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,260\nI do that for tracking purposes.\n\n1170\n01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,720\nBut we wanna keep track of who\nuses what bandwidth and so on, so.\n\n1171\n01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,020\nSo to go ahead and\nset this up, we need, whoops.\n\n1172\n01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,820\nWe need to stop running\nprograms accidentally.\n\n1173\n01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,560\nI'm gonna launch my to-do list here,\n\n1174\n01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,530\nyou'll see all that work\nthat I've got piled up.\n\n1175\n01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:12,170\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1176\n01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,060\nSo we need to define inside-outside,\nwe need to define our access list, and\n\n1177\n01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:22,085\nthen we tie it all together with ip\nnat inside source List 1, right?\n\n1178\n01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:25,095\nSo I'm saying the inside IPs,\nthat's coming from an access list, and\n\n1179\n01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:26,250\nit's access list number one, right?\n\n1180\n01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,405\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1181\n01:06:27,405 --> 01:06:30,825\n>> And then for\nthe addresses that we get changed to,\n\n1182\n01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:35,852\nbefore I said pool whatever, here\n>> I can either type in an address,\n\n1183\n01:06:35,852 --> 01:06:41,110\nyou know, telling them what address\nto use, or I can say interface, and\n\n1184\n01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,092\nspecify the interface\nwhose IP I want to use.\n\n1185\n01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:49,050\nUm-huh. Right? So I'm going to tell it,\nwhen somebody from access list 1,\n\n1186\n01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,770\ngoes from inside the network\nto outside the network,\n\n1187\n01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:58,250\nchange their source address\nto gi0/0 address, right?\n\n1188\n01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,870\nNow, if I stop right here,\nlike I just did?\n\n1189\n01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:02,290\n>> Yeah.\nYou're in trouble.\n\n1190\n01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,110\n>> We're going to have a problem, right?\n\n1191\n01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,970\nIt's a one to one mapping, so\nthe first person to go is going to get it,\n\n1192\n01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,430\nthe second person, out of luck.\n\n1193\n01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:15,900\nSo there's an extra word I need to\nadd on there Which is overload.\n\n1194\n01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,998\nWhen I add that word overload, whoops!\n\n1195\n01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:22,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I get rid of that word no,\n\n1196\n01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,125\nat the beginning.\n\n1197\n01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:23,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That'll help.\n\n1198\n01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:24,800\nThere we go.\n\n1199\n01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:31,110\nWhen I add that word overload, that's\nwhat's gonna make this all come together.\n\n1200\n01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,140\nThat's the secret sauce of this equation.\n\n1201\n01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:38,270\nI'm saying, anybody from the inside,\non access-list 1,\n\n1202\n01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:43,670\nthat's going to the outside,\nchange their address to match GI zero\n\n1203\n01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:48,820\nslash zero's address, and overload it,\ntrack their port numbers so\n\n1204\n01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:54,210\nthat more than one person can\nuse the same address, all right?\n\n1205\n01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:59,180\nWith that in place,\nnow I can do a many to one translation,\n\n1206\n01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,380\nand it's going to start tracking the port.\n\n1207\n01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,860\nAnd that's in place, right?\n\n1208\n01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,730\nDid I hit enter?\n\n1209\n01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,200\nSometimes I don't.\n\n1210\n01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:13,590\nSo, if I go and, let me just flip over\nto this connection to that other switch.\n\n1211\n01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,990\nAnd I'm going to restart that session.\n\n1212\n01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,430\nActually, it seems to think that\nI'm still connected from before,\n\n1213\n01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,940\nso let me close that.\n\n1214\n01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,320\nAnd I'll open a new session.\n\n1215\n01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,199\nNow, The GI0/0 interface on this router\nbehind me, Is 10.1.230.15 ,allr ight?\n\n1216\n01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,620\nSo that's what my address\nshould show up as right now.\n\n1217\n01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,320\nAnd sure enough 10.1.230.15.\n\n1218\n01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,160\nNow my old session is still there.\n\n1219\n01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,890\nSee how it's idle 11 1.2 minutes,\nso it hasn't timed out yet.\n\n1220\n01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:56,498\nBut my current session, the one with\na asterisk by it, that shows who you are.\n\n1221\n01:08:56,498 --> 01:09:00,540\nHas that 10.1.230.15\nshowing up right there.\n\n1222\n01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,560\nSo that's my address.\n\n1223\n01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,320\nI'm there, and I'm cool.\n\n1224\n01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,910\n>> Yeh, and remember the advantage of\nthis is multiple computers on the inside.\n\n1225\n01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:14,540\nIf you were to do this again, and others\nwere to connect to this same router,\n\n1226\n01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:19,850\nthat they would also see 10.1.230.15,\nand continue all the way down.\n\n1227\n01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:25,250\nSo remember that this is\neverybody to one IP address here.\n\n1228\n01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,070\n>> So we are in business there.\n\n1229\n01:09:28,868 --> 01:09:32,820\nYou know, he thing I can't show,\nwell I guess if we go back here, and\n\n1230\n01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:37,651\nwe look at our translation table.\n\n1231\n01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:42,470\nAll right, notice how I don't\nhave a permanent mapping in.\n\n1232\n01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,170\nI don't see any of those with\nthe dash dashes on them.\n\n1233\n01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,890\nBecause I don't have\nexclusive use of the IP.\n\n1234\n01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,900\nI'm sharing it with other people.\n\n1235\n01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,010\nAnd I can see every time that I went out,\nmy internal address here with the port\n\n1236\n01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:57,800\nnumber, and here's my external\naddress with the port number also.\n\n1237\n01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,960\nNow, I don't have any duplicates here.\n\n1238\n01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,360\nNothing is matching up.\n\n1239\n01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,160\nThey all are pretty much unique,\nbecause I'm the only one.\n\n1240\n01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,840\nBut if I bring up another\nmachine behind this system, and\n\n1241\n01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,480\nstart sending data out,\nwe might be able to create a duplicate.\n\n1242\n01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,670\nNow, I'll tell you, I tried this once.\n\n1243\n01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:16,886\nI was like, you know, I'm bringing\nup another machine and doing it.\n\n1244\n01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:19,223\n[LAUGH] You have 20,000\naddresses to choose from,\n\n1245\n01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:20,870\nwell I guess 16,000 addresses.\n\n1246\n01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,820\nIt's a lot, and\nit's pretty hard to get a duplicate.\n\n1247\n01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:29,300\nYou can get close with pings,\nbecause pings don't have a port number.\n\n1248\n01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,510\nBut they do have a instance number.\n\n1249\n01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:35,310\nSo if I start pinging 10.1.10.1,\nfor example, and\n\n1250\n01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,558\nI come back here and look at my\ntranslation table, there's the ping.\n\n1251\n01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:43,320\nSee, icmp 1, and see how it's just\ngot a 1 attached to it right there?\n\n1252\n01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,910\nSo ICMPs will do that.\n\n1253\n01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:48,166\nThey'll just do a number\ntied to what retry this is,\n\n1254\n01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:50,980\none, two, three, four, whatever.\n\n1255\n01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,510\nSo I don't have a duplicate there.\n\n1256\n01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,630\nBut if I hooked a second system up, and\n\n1257\n01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:58,040\nstarted to throw these along\nI might be able to hit that.\n\n1258\n01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,600\nSo, you know we should try that Ronnie we\nshould take like your laptop or something,\n\n1259\n01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,170\nand see if we can generate a duplicate, to\nshow that port translation happening also.\n\n1260\n01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,810\nBut, let's see.\n\n1261\n01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:09,780\nWell you know what?\n\n1262\n01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,300\nWe're pretty close to the break..\n\n1263\n01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,120\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n1264\n01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,820\nAnd during the break,\nwe can throw that second machine on there,\n\n1265\n01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,350\nand see if we can generate some fun stuff.\n\n1266\n01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,660\n>> Sounds good.\n>> All right,\n\n1267\n01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,110\ncan you think of anything else\nto throw in before we stop?\n\n1268\n01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,860\n>> Not really.\n\n1269\n01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,700\nWe're ready to go.\n\n1270\n01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,730\n>> Well ladies and\ngentlemen, let's stop here.\n\n1271\n01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,180\nStay tuned, when we get back,\nwe're gonna try and\n\n1272\n01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,930\nactually create a duplicate port number,\nit may or may not happen.\n\n1273\n01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:32,870\nIf it doesn't happen, it's no big deal,\nwe'll also do a little bit of\n\n1274\n01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,920\ntroubleshooting, we'll show you\nsome of the tools there, and\n\n1275\n01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,020\nthen we'll probably wrap it up,\nthat's almost it for now.\n\n1276\n01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:38,940\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1277\n01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,086\n>> All right, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after these messages.\n\n1278\n01:11:42,086 --> 01:11:45,514\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1279\n01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:51,003\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n1280\n01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:55,050\nSo during the break, [LAUGH] I got Ronnie\nto throw his laptop onto the switch.\n\n1281\n01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:58,650\nAnd we did a test ping, and\nimmediately hit a duplicate.\n\n1282\n01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> I didn't even wanna chance it.\n\n1283\n01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,902\n>> I was, like, don't touch the computer.\n\n1284\n01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:01,670\n>> Yeah, don't.\n\n1285\n01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:02,485\n>> Don't touch it.\n\n1286\n01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,060\n>> [LAUGH] All right so,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n1287\n01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,150\nAll right so,\nhere you can see my machine 192.160.0.222.\n\n1288\n01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:14,741\nAnd I am pinging to 10.1.10.1.\n\n1289\n01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:20,204\nAnd when I did it, ping like it normally\ndoes attaches that one Kind of a port\n\n1290\n01:12:20,204 --> 01:12:27,180\nnumber, right, and so I got translated to\n10.1.230.15 with a part number of one.\n\n1291\n01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:32,739\nRonnie is 192.168 to 0.221, and\nhe did the same ping as me,\n\n1292\n01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:38,040\npinging to 10.1.10.1, and\nit got that part number of one.\n\n1293\n01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,440\nBut look what it did In order\nto tell the difference,\n\n1294\n01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:47,330\nit took what on mine was port one and\non his made a port zero.\n\n1295\n01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,010\nOkay.\n\n1296\n01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,430\nIt changed it in his case\nby decrementing by one.\n\n1297\n01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,450\nIt can go up or down.\n\n1298\n01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,340\nIt can really pick any number it wants.\n\n1299\n01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:58,554\nBut by doing this,\nnow there's two different pings,\n\n1300\n01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:02,963\n10.1.230.15 on port zero, and on port one.\n\n1301\n01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:06,650\nTwo different pings, so when we get the\nreply back, we know where to send them.\n\n1302\n01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:08,340\n>> All right.\n>> All right,\n\n1303\n01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,110\nnow if we were to try something more\nadvanced, like telnet or whatever,\n\n1304\n01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:15,570\nit's gonna end up with these higher port\nnumbers and it probably won't work for us.\n\n1305\n01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,820\nLet's give it a shot though, Ronnie.\n\n1306\n01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,360\nOn your web browser, what are we using?\n\n1307\n01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,505\n'Cause I don't think I have\nTelNet installed on my laptop.\n\n1308\n01:13:23,505 --> 01:13:28,850\nLet's browse to the 10.1.10.1 I might\nbe running the web server on it.\n\n1309\n01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:32,930\nNo, but\nI can turn it on real quick though.\n\n1310\n01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,550\nLet me do that.\n\n1311\n01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,770\nFor security reasons I normally turn\nthe web interface off on these switches.\n\n1312\n01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,463\nAnd so it is off on this one.\n\n1313\n01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,060\nThere, all right.\n\n1314\n01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,671\nSo let's browse to that, and\nsee if we can get to it.\n\n1315\n01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:02,619\nAll right, so I browsed to its webpage,\nyou can go ahead and log in as admin,\n\n1316\n01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:06,671\nand the password is one,two,\nthree, four, not really.\n\n1317\n01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:09,290\n[LAUGH] It's actually four,\nthree, two, one.\n\n1318\n01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,710\n>> And my machine's showing.\n\n1319\n01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:13,280\n>> All right, so we're both looking\nat that webpage but if I go and\n\n1320\n01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,370\nI look at our table,\nwow that's going to be a lot isn't it?\n\n1321\n01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,320\nLet me filter that down.\n\n1322\n01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,180\nThere.\n\n1323\n01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,000\nOkay.\n\n1324\n01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,640\nSo if I come in here and look at the table\nI can find 192.168.222 and I'm just\n\n1325\n01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,035\nlooking for the connections that\nare going to port 80 on that switch.\n\n1326\n01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,213\nAnd I'll see that I've actually\nhave a couple of them here.\n\n1327\n01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:40,220\nSo this is me going to it, and\nsee how I'm in the 50,880 range?\n\n1328\n01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,310\nAnd right above here,\nthis is Ronnie going to that system, and\n\n1329\n01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,740\nhe's in the 54,000 range.\n\n1330\n01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,020\nSo he's in a different range than me.\n\n1331\n01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,100\nAnd since it's a different range,\nwe're not overlapping, right?\n\n1332\n01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,530\nSo that's why I was saying it's so\nhard to create a duplicate.\n\n1333\n01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,150\nRonnie and I could sit here and\ndo retries over and over and over again.\n\n1334\n01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,296\nHe's 4,000 above me.\n\n1335\n01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:06,184\nI would have to create 3,000 more sessions\nto get up there and possibly bump into\n\n1336\n01:15:06,184 --> 01:15:10,020\nhim, assuming that he doesn't do any\nother communications whatsoever.\n\n1337\n01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,350\nSo it's pretty difficult to get a overlap,\nwhich is two computers.\n\n1338\n01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,540\nBut what if you have a thousand computers?\n\n1339\n01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,630\nWhat if you have 5000 computers?\n\n1340\n01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,006\nThe duplicates become a lot more likely.\n\n1341\n01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:20,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n1342\n01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,957\n>> Yeah.\nSo that's when you can really see port\n\n1343\n01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:25,650\naddress translation kick in and\ndo its work.\n\n1344\n01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:28,810\nIn this case we see\na much more limited view.\n\n1345\n01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,990\nAll right, so let's recap.\n\n1346\n01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:36,230\nWe'll have our flashback episode here.\n\n1347\n01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,650\nSo now I need Nate's fade in effect,\nso we can do our flashback.\n\n1348\n01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:42,690\nSo we started off with a one\nto one static mapping,\n\n1349\n01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:47,510\nwe mapped a single internal IP,\nto a single external IP, or\n\n1350\n01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:51,480\nin my case they were both private, but we\nmapped them and that was our translation.\n\n1351\n01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,290\nAnd the second example\nwe did a many to many.\n\n1352\n01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:58,630\nWe mapped a range of IPs defined\nby an access control list.\n\n1353\n01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:03,710\nAnd we mapped that to a pool of\navailable IPs defined by well, a pool.\n\n1354\n01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,230\nAnd we specified that they be translated.\n\n1355\n01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:10,330\nAnd in the last example we mapped\na range of internal IPs defined\n\n1356\n01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:14,640\nby an access control list,\nand we map that to well,\n\n1357\n01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,110\nwhatever IP address was attached to our\noutside interface, and we overloaded it so\n\n1358\n01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:23,240\nwe could have many machines\nsharing a single IP.\n\n1359\n01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:27,220\n>> And don't forget in each instance of\nthis we also have to make sure we define\n\n1360\n01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,730\nthe inside NAT interface and\nthe outside NAT interface, and\n\n1361\n01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:34,280\nthat's an important concept for us too.\n\n1362\n01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:39,463\nIt has two different parts to\nactually making sure that NAT works.\n\n1363\n01:16:39,463 --> 01:16:40,750\n>> All right.\n\n1364\n01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,610\nNow, as far as NAT,\n\n1365\n01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:46,030\nthose are the three configurations\nyou need to know for the exam.\n\n1366\n01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,450\nSo for the exam, know the syntax.\n\n1367\n01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,690\nKnow these three different\nways of configuring it.\n\n1368\n01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,490\nAlso, make sure you can tell\nthe difference between the four terms:\n\n1369\n01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:58,470\ninside local, inside global,\noutside local, outside global, right?\n\n1370\n01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,560\nInside and outside is referring\nto where the machine is.\n\n1371\n01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,170\nInside your network or\noutside your network.\n\n1372\n01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:07,510\nGlobal means its global\nunique across the planet.\n\n1373\n01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,930\nLocal means its local unique\non your local network.\n\n1374\n01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,630\nRight, so that's kind of how we\nknow which address is which.\n\n1375\n01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,150\nThe last thing that I wanna point out,\nall right?\n\n1376\n01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,540\nWhat we've done here is we've showed\nyou how to do NAT we've showed how to\n\n1377\n01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,270\nverify it was working,\nwhat if it doesn't work?\n\n1378\n01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,460\nWhat if something goes wrong, all right?\n\n1379\n01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:32,640\nThere's a debug command you can use to\nsee the NAT translations as they happen.\n\n1380\n01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,820\nHere's the problem.\n\n1381\n01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:39,280\nOn a busy network It can overwhelm you\nwith data, and I don't mean overwhelm\n\n1382\n01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,990\nyour mind, and it will absolutely do that,\nbut it can overwhelm your session.\n\n1383\n01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,500\nYour SSA, your telnet session,\n\n1384\n01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,420\nand disconnect you from your router,\nlocking you out.\n\n1385\n01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,790\nThat would be really bad.\n\n1386\n01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:51,140\nSo if you're going to de-bug NAT.\n\n1387\n01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,040\nFirst off, you wanna be connected\nto the console of the router.\n\n1388\n01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,130\nI can do it here on this router because\nit's just Ronnie and I and that's it.\n\n1389\n01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,760\nBut, in an enterprise network where\nyou might have several machines,\n\n1390\n01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,260\nyou'll get overwhelmed right away.\n\n1391\n01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,430\nYou need to make sure you connect to\nthe console of the router to debug it.\n\n1392\n01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,100\nAll right.\n\n1393\n01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,570\nThe debug itself was pretty simple.\n\n1394\n01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:10,088\nLet me pull it back up here.\n\n1395\n01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:13,840\nAll right.\n\n1396\n01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,690\nYou can run debug IP NAT and\nstop right there and\n\n1397\n01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:21,390\njust press enter and that will start\nto debug your NAT sessions, all right?\n\n1398\n01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:24,240\nYou'll see when a session is created and\nwhen a session is torn down.\n\n1399\n01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:28,230\nBut if you've got long-running sessions or\nwhatever,\n\n1400\n01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,530\nyou might not find information very fast.\n\n1401\n01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:34,600\nSo you can go a step further,\nand say debug IP NAT, and\n\n1402\n01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,240\nthen specify more details, right?\n\n1403\n01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,990\nDetailed information,\nactually seeing packets, frame fragments,\n\n1404\n01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,480\ngeneric, whatever.\n\n1405\n01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,780\nEven these ways, you're still going\nto see a lot of communications, so\n\n1406\n01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,530\nthis is one of the few debug commands\nthat also accepts an access list.\n\n1407\n01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,350\nI can put a rule in.\n\n1408\n01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,930\nJust for a standard ACL,\na source-based address list.\n\n1409\n01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:01,076\nI can specify who I wanna\nsee NAT entries for, right?\n\n1410\n01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:02,540\nIn a busy network,\n\n1411\n01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,110\nyou'll wanna do that to trim down on\nthe amount of data you're gonna see.\n\n1412\n01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,660\nSo, if I just run debug IP NAT.\n\n1413\n01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,200\nI'm gonna run that.\n\n1414\n01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,510\nAnd Ronnie, you're doing your ping in\nthe background and I'm gonna do mine.\n\n1415\n01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,500\nOr, I say, I'm gonna do mine.\n\n1416\n01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,255\nLet me make sure, it's actually going.\n\n1417\n01:19:17,255 --> 01:19:19,220\nThere,okay.\n\n1418\n01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:25,090\nAnd then, I'm gonna do a terminal monitor,\nsince I'm remoted in, and there we go.\n\n1419\n01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,600\nSo, I can start to see\nthose NAT sessions flowing,\n\n1420\n01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,760\nthe source address changing\ninto the destination address.\n\n1421\n01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,760\nIf there was an error, I'd be able to\nsee that and see that communication.\n\n1422\n01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,260\nI can see IDs being translated there and\nstuff.\n\n1423\n01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,340\nSo this is all going on and this is\njust two computers running some pings.\n\n1424\n01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,960\nImagine if this was actually a lot\nof people all doing real work.\n\n1425\n01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,000\nThis could be a ton of stuff.\n\n1426\n01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,350\nSo it could get get\noverwhelming pretty fast.\n\n1427\n01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:58,020\nAll right, and if I do something like\ndo clear IP NAT translations star,\n\n1428\n01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,120\nwe're going to see it.\n\n1429\n01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,500\nOops.\nDo clear IP net translations star.\n\n1430\n01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:06,850\nShoot.\nIt's scrolling by so fast.\n\n1431\n01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hopefully it gave me an error.\n\n1432\n01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,390\nOh.\nYou know, I'm doing\n\n1433\n01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:12,480\nI'm using the do command and I'm not\nin config that's what it's upset about.\n\n1434\n01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,587\nThere we go.\nSo I should see a message as it flushes it\n\n1435\n01:20:16,587 --> 01:20:19,187\nout and\nit starts to build our new sessions and so\n\n1436\n01:20:19,187 --> 01:20:23,746\nit's just churning along there, really\njust overwhelming me with information.\n\n1437\n01:20:23,746 --> 01:20:28,802\nSo I'm gonna undebug all that And\n\n1438\n01:20:28,802 --> 01:20:34,230\nthis is one where there can be so\nmany commands that it can get backed up.\n\n1439\n01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:34,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1440\n01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:39,250\nSo if I scroll back up I'll see where\nI ran that undebug command right here.\n\n1441\n01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:42,690\nAnd see how it told me that debugging was\noff and I still kept getting commands?\n\n1442\n01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> Those were backlogged.\n\n1443\n01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,030\nThey were queued to be\ndisplayed on my screen, but\n\n1444\n01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:48,310\nmy screen was getting overwhelmed.\n\n1445\n01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,670\nSo it had to wait, right?\n\n1446\n01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,760\nThat's what happens when that,\nyou've got to be really careful with that.\n\n1447\n01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,450\nAll right.\n\n1448\n01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,930\nAnd like I said, this is probably\nmore information than we need.\n\n1449\n01:20:56,930 --> 01:21:00,530\nSo we typically want to attach\nan ACL to it to filter that down and\n\n1450\n01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,270\nrestrict what we get.\n\n1451\n01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:07,690\nAll right, so let me just add that\nto our list of related commands.\n\n1452\n01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,310\nSo that was debug IP net.\n\n1453\n01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:18,100\nAnd I'm typing in black on black paper so\nit's harder to see this way.\n\n1454\n01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,850\nLemme change that.\n\n1455\n01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:25,760\nOh, is it gonna lock up one me?\n\n1456\n01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,420\nIt certainly is.\n\n1457\n01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:26,940\n>> It did.\n\n1458\n01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,778\n>> All right,\nwell let's just, there we go.\n\n1459\n01:21:28,778 --> 01:21:29,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> So anyhow,\n\n1460\n01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,980\ndebug IP nets that last command,\nand like I said,\n\n1461\n01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,940\nI'm gonna take all those\nnotes I jotted up and\n\n1462\n01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:38,510\nI'll put them on the video page so\nyou guys can see them and have them.\n\n1463\n01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:40,740\nIt is handy to see these commands.\n\n1464\n01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,690\nYou do need to have them memorized,\nno way around that.\n\n1465\n01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,940\nRight, Ronnie?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1466\n01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:47,280\nMake sure that you practice these\ncommands over and over again.\n\n1467\n01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,490\nThat's the only way.\n\n1468\n01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:52,470\nMake sure that you remember that in terms\nof the NAT, always at least two steps.\n\n1469\n01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,605\nRight?\nYou're gonna configure what is going to\n\n1470\n01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:57,330\nbe NAT'd, And then the interfaces as well.\n\n1471\n01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,730\nRemember that you can get those\ncommands a little bit backward.\n\n1472\n01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:05,360\nIf you put the outside address on\nthe interface that you want to actually be\n\n1473\n01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,210\nNATing through,\nwell you're going to have some issues.\n\n1474\n01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,220\nSo pay attentiont to that.\n\n1475\n01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,310\nA lot of times you'll\nsee diagrams on this so\n\n1476\n01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,740\nit's good that Don drew several diagrams\nfor us to help us out, but remember.\n\n1477\n01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,680\nMake sure you do pay attention\nto specific commands.\n\n1478\n01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:25,410\nThe syntax is very clear,\nis very specific I should say.\n\n1479\n01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,010\nCase sensitivity.\n\n1480\n01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:29,120\nAgain my mind apparently\nisn't working today.\n\n1481\n01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,810\nSo don't forget that there's a lot of\ntime when you create that pool name.\n\n1482\n01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,220\nIt is going to be case\nsensitive as well so\n\n1483\n01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:38,770\ndo pay attention to other things that you\nmay normally just not even think about,\n\n1484\n01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,380\nbut are very important in terms syntax.\n\n1485\n01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:46,142\n>> Alright well Ronnie,\nI think that's probably about it for NAT.\n\n1486\n01:22:46,142 --> 01:22:47,698\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can't really think of anything\n\n1487\n01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:48,240\nelse to cover.\n\n1488\n01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,920\nFor the CCENT exam,\nthey're only concerned about forward NAT,\n\n1489\n01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,480\nall the snares we showed you.\n\n1490\n01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,270\nThere's also something called reverse NAT.\n\n1491\n01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,510\nThey really don't tackle that on\nreally any of the exams because nobody\n\n1492\n01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,250\never does it.\n\n1493\n01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,950\nWhich is where you map external\npeople coming into your network.\n\n1494\n01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:05,030\nMost of the time we don't deal with that.\n\n1495\n01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:08,653\nThere is no real good scenario where\nyou do it, but it is possible.\n\n1496\n01:23:08,653 --> 01:23:10,830\n>> Yes.\n>> But as far as what we need to know for\n\n1497\n01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:13,770\nthe exam, that pretty much covers it and\neven for the real world.\n\n1498\n01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:16,310\nThat's pretty much the three\nscenarios you are going to see.\n\n1499\n01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:19,450\nThe nice thing is Don, I think we're\ncoming pretty close to the end of CCENT.\n\n1500\n01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,040\nEven next episode or so.\n\n1501\n01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,580\nSo this aught to actually be\nout of production soon, and\n\n1502\n01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,250\nwe'll be heading directly into CCNA.\n\n1503\n01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:30,230\n>> Yeah, so we've got one more\nepisode of CCENT on the schedule,\n\n1504\n01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,150\na troubleshooting episode.\n\n1505\n01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,165\nOnce that's done,\nwe start our CCNA journey.\n\n1506\n01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:34,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then from\n\n1507\n01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,630\nthere,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1508\n01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,740\n>> CC and P would continue on with that.\n\n1509\n01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,715\nSee what kind of damage we could do.\n\n1510\n01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:40,560\n[LAUGH].\nAll right.\n\n1511\n01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,260\nWell ladies and\ngentleman I hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1512\n01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,155\nAs always, if you have any questions,\nmake sure you drop

and A.\n\n1519\n01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,180\nYou can jump right over there and\npost your questions We monitor and answer.\n\n1520\n01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,200\nMake sure,\nyou get your questions answered and\n\n1521\n01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,363\nmake sure that you're ready\nwhen you go to take that exam.\n\n1522\n01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:15,842\n>> Right.\n>> So, definitely take advantage

up the lower third.\n\n1529\n01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,070\nI'd just like to point that out.\n\n1530\n01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:30,425\nAnd after a awesome day of production and\ndirectorial

right good morning,\ngood afternoon, good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,978\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,245\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong!\n\n7\n00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:42,380\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,705\n>> I'm actually kinda sad today.\n\n9\n00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:44,410\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n10\n00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,220\n>> Yes.\n\n11\n00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,493\nI realized that I have never been on\nInstagram with Kanye West's wife.\n\n12\n00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,129\n>> No?\n[LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,740\n>> No, so after his public declaration of\n\n14\n00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,490\nhow powerful he was, I feel cheated.\n\n15\n00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,330\n>> So,\nthis is my sad pop culture knowledge,\n\n16\n00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,100\nI am aware that Kanye West is, I believe\nthe greatest rap artist of all time.\n\n17\n00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,871\n>> I think so.\n>> Right, but\n\n18\n00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,422\nI have no idea who his wife is,\nwho's his wife?\n\n19\n00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,305\n>> Me neither, I don't have a clue.\n\n20\n00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,279\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,460\n>> But I do know that she appears on\n\n22\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,376\nInstagram, apparently, and-\n>> All right.\n\n23\n00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,435\n>> And yeah, so, I've just never\nbeen in an Instagram with her, so.\n\n24\n00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:13,814\n>> Never underestimate\nthe power of Instagram.\n\n25\n00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:14,696\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n26\n00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:16,612\n>> So, today-\n>> Yes?\n\n27\n00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:19,734\n>> We are gonna be tackling\nthe wonderful world of Cisco, and\n\n28\n00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,381\nI'm trying to think in my mind how\nI can parlay this into Instagram.\n\n29\n00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,224\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna be taking a look at access\n\n30\n00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,750\ncontrol list, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,290\nWhich is a way for us to filter\ntraffic passing over our network,\n\n32\n00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,420\nwhich means we can do things like\nblock your access to Instagram so\n\n33\n00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,740\nyou can't talk to Kanye West's wife.\n\n34\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,305\n>> That's right.\n>> Look at that, it's a full circle.\n\n35\n00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:41,520\n>> Yeah, the idea of access control list\nfor us is a very important process and\n\n36\n00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,310\nan important concept for\nus, especially as CCENTs.\n\n37\n00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,460\nThe reason why is that when\nyou actually start taking\n\n38\n00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,300\na look at the configurations on\nthe routers and stuff like that,\n\n39\n00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,590\nyou're gonna actually come\nacross this whole list of stuff.\n\n40\n00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,660\nAnd you can go, wait a minute,\nwhat is that about?\n\n41\n00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,082\nWell, that's what we're\ngonna talk about here.\n\n42\n00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,007\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz all of a sudden,\n\n43\n00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:00,990\nyou're gonna look at this, like,\nwhy do I have to know this stuff?\n\n44\n00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,600\nWell it's because of\nthat whole list of things\n\n45\n00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,440\nthat really do help us to filter traffic,\nit helps us to classify traffic as well.\n\n46\n00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,710\nAnd we'll talk about those concepts\na little bit later on as we continue on\n\n47\n00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,845\nthrough our show.\n\n48\n00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,192\n>> Yeah,\na lot of people don't realize it, but\n\n49\n00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,076\nyou can use a Cisco router\nas like a pseudo firewall.\n\n50\n00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:20,836\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, and\n\n51\n00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,100\nit's not the firewall feature set.\n\n52\n00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,990\nThat's something that we\ntalk about in the IINS show,\n\n53\n00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,250\nwhich we haven't started filming yet.\n\n54\n00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,580\nBut, we will one day.\n\n55\n00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,890\nBut, you can use it for\nbasic filtering of your traffic.\n\n56\n00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,840\nAnd we usually see this\nwith inter-VLAN routing.\n\n57\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,960\nWe have more than one VLAN and we want\ntraffic to pass from one VLAN to another.\n\n58\n00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,233\nWe may want to filter it so\nthat only certain traffic is allowed and\n\n59\n00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,611\nother traffic is blocked.\n\n60\n00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:45,307\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n61\n00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:49,500\n>> So access control lists, or ACLs,\nare what allows us to do that.\n\n62\n00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,126\nNow, there's three different ways\nto write ACLs, and so what we're\n\n63\n00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:57,071\ngonna do is we're gonna start off real\ngeneral, with just how an ACL works.\n\n64\n00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,044\nAnd I don't want to focus on\nsyntax here in the beginning,\n\n65\n00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,790\njust basic description of how it works.\n\n66\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,730\nThen we'll dive into the three syntaxes,\nthe standard ACLs, the extended ACLs,\n\n67\n00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,420\nand the named ACLs, and\nsee kinda the pros and cons of each one.\n\n68\n00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,100\n>> Yeah, when we begin the idea of ACLs,\n\n69\n00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,110\nthe primary reason why we do it is\nthe idea of filtering out our traffic.\n\n70\n00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,920\nWe'll go into more advanced\nstuff a little bit later,\n\n71\n00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,530\nwe're gonna talk about classification for\nlater, things like NAV and\n\n72\n00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,350\nstuff like that.\n\n73\n00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,490\nBut for us here,\nit's about the idea of filtering.\n\n74\n00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,080\nNow, why do we need filtering?\n\n75\n00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,100\nBecause there's a lot of traffic out there\nthat we really don't want coming inside\n\n76\n00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,120\nto a particular interface that I\nreally don't them to have access to.\n\n77\n00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,760\nSo if I'm connected to the Internet,\n\n78\n00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,030\nthere's traffic out there that I wanna\nsay hey, I just wanna block this.\n\n79\n00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,120\nWell, I could go out and spend a whole\nbunch of money and actually do that,\n\n80\n00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,750\ndon't get me wrong,\nCisco would love for you to do that.\n\n81\n00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,550\nBut, maybe there's some very simple things\nthat we can do already with the Cisco\n\n82\n00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,550\nequipment that we have that will allow\nus to actually simply do some things,\n\n83\n00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,680\nagain in terms of filtering, that allows\nus just not to have to worry about it.\n\n84\n00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,060\nAnd we're gonna learn about\nthat today as we begin.\n\n85\n00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,521\nSo let's take a look at our standard\ndifferent types or different ones.\n\n86\n00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:10,021\n>> So let's start with just kind\nof the general function, and\n\n87\n00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,060\nthen we'll break into our types.\n\n88\n00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,260\nSo the idea of an access control list\nis kinda like what its name implies,\n\n89\n00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,570\nthat it's a list, and we define who's\nallowed access and who is not, right?\n\n90\n00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,335\nSo it's fairly straightforward.\n\n91\n00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:29,455\nBut there are some key points that we\nneed to make, which is the order of\n\n92\n00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:34,085\nthe list is very important, because\nthe router is applying it as a list.\n\n93\n00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:36,710\nIt starts at the top and\nit works its way down.\n\n94\n00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,840\nSo I'm basically gonna make a list of what\nI want to allow and what I want to deny,\n\n95\n00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,950\nor permit, or whatever,\nthere's different terms you can use.\n\n96\n00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,603\nSo I might want to say something like,\nand, you know, I got it backwards.\n\n97\n00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:55,050\nI want to deny Ronnie\nbrowsing to Instagram, right?\n\n98\n00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,295\nBut I might want to allow me\nto browse to instagram, right?\n\n99\n00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,529\n>> Right.\n\n100\n00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:11,964\n>> And I might want to\nAllow Ronnie to browse to CNN.\n\n101\n00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:15,780\nAnd then I might want to\nBlock everything else, right?\n\n102\n00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,612\nOr whatever.\n>> Right.\n\n103\n00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:20,394\n>> Okay, now, when I create this list,\nnow I'm not using proper syntax,\n\n104\n00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:22,740\nI'm just doing concepts here.\n\n105\n00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,718\nWhen we create this list,\nthe router applies it in order.\n\n106\n00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,415\nAs traffic passes through the router, and\nthis only applies to traffic going from\n\n107\n00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:34,240\none interface to another, in other words,\npassing through the router.\n\n108\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,170\nIt'll run down this list, and\nit'll say, what is going on here?\n\n109\n00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,960\nSo if it's Ronnie going to Instagram,\nit hits line number one.\n\n110\n00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,600\nDeny Ronnie browsing in Instagram.\n\n111\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,744\nHe gets blocked and he can't get there.\n\n112\n00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,662\n>> Yup.\n\n113\n00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,760\n>> If it's me,\nit runs me against the list.\n\n114\n00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,190\nAnd it says all right, is this Ronnie?\n\n115\n00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,340\nNope, it's Don.\n\n116\n00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,650\nMove on to the next line.\n\n117\n00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,930\nIt moves to the next line, yes it's Don,\nallow him to get to Instagram, right?\n\n118\n00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,650\nSo it goes in order,\nthe order is important.\n\n119\n00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,420\n>> Right.\n\n120\n00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,803\nYeah, if we have this thing out of order,\nsuch as if we actually put block\n\n121\n00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:08,463\neverything else at the top of the list,\nit doesn't matter whether it's Don or\n\n122\n00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,738\nRonnie trying to get to\nwherever we wanted to go,\n\n123\n00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:14,860\nwe'll have a problem because it'll\nactually say hey, block everything.\n\n124\n00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,050\nSo I don't care who it is,\nI don't care where you're going.\n\n125\n00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,955\nIt blocks everything.\n\n126\n00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:22,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So for us the processing of the ACLs\n\n127\n00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,810\nthat we're gonna talk about\nalways happen from top to bottom.\n\n128\n00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,500\nSo we'll talk about the importance of that\norder again a little bit later on when we\n\n129\n00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,302\nstart talking about that way\nthat we choose what goes first.\n\n130\n00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:36,946\n>> Yep, and not to mention that, there's\nalso a hidden rule that we don't see.\n\n131\n00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:38,128\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Right?\n\n132\n00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,847\nWhat if you don't match anything?\n\n133\n00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:40,369\n>> Yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,284\n>> So I just deleted that\nblock everything else rule.\n\n135\n00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:46,722\nWhat if, here we've got the rule,\ndeny Ronnie going to Instagram,\n\n136\n00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:50,390\nallow me to get to Instagram,\nallow Ronnie to get to CNN.\n\n137\n00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,690\nWhat if I try and get to CNN?\n\n138\n00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,920\nRight, so it says okay, is this Ronnie?\n\n139\n00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,490\nNope, it's Don, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,950\nIs this Don?\n\n141\n00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,120\nYes, it is.\n\n142\n00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,840\nAnd is Don going to Instagram?\n\n143\n00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,990\nNo, Don's going to CNN, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,280\nSo then it goes to the next line.\n\n145\n00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,895\nIs this Ronnie going to CNN?\n\n146\n00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,545\nNo, it's Don going to CNN.\n\n147\n00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:12,625\nSo, I don't match any\nof these three rules.\n\n148\n00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:17,705\nWell, on a Cisco router,\nthere is a hidden line at the very\n\n149\n00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:23,190\nend that says <Deny Everything>,\nall right?\n\n150\n00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,590\nAnd if you don't match at least one line,\n\n151\n00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,020\nif you don't match any of the lines in\nthe ACL, then you get blocked, all right.\n\n152\n00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,660\nAnd this is called a Implicit Deny All.\n\n153\n00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,840\nImplicit Deny All,\nthat's the official name for it.\n\n154\n00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,703\nWhich is implied that it's there,\nyou don't see it, but it is implied.\n\n155\n00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:47,610\n>> Yeah, the Implicit Deny All really\nhelps us out all in terms of security.\n\n156\n00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,997\nIf we forget something, we still have\nsomething that actually denies that.\n\n157\n00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:52,828\nNow again, it can cause problems.\n\n158\n00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:56,245\n>> Remember that we wanna make sure that\nwe have at least one statement in there\n\n159\n00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,075\nthat actually allows us to go through.\n\n160\n00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we forget to put at least one\n\n161\n00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,160\nstatement that allows us to go through,\nit doesn't matter\n\n162\n00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,600\nhow many packets you send to even test\nthis thing out, you're in trouble,\n\n163\n00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,640\nbecause that implicit deny all statement\nis gonna block you with everything.\n\n164\n00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,060\n>> Yeah, if we, if we rewrote\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,590\n>> this list\n\n166\n00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,360\n>> And, whoops.\n\n167\n00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,903\nIf we, thank you Windows 8.\n\n168\n00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:17,950\n[LAUGH] If we rewrote this list and\nmade it you know,\n\n169\n00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,770\nwhere it was like denying\nRonnie getting Instagram.\n\n170\n00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,920\nDenying me getting to Instagram.\n\n171\n00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680\nWe'll deny Ronnie getting to CNN.\n\n172\n00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,200\n>> Right?\n\n173\n00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,780\n>> If we put the list like this.\n\n174\n00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,490\nWell, if I tried to get to CNN.\n\n175\n00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,720\nI don't match the first one.\n\n176\n00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,770\nI don't match the second one.\n\n177\n00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,070\nI don't match the third one.\n\n178\n00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,410\nI do match deny everything else.\n\n179\n00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,615\nIn fact, everyone's gonna match that.\n\n180\n00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:42,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This access list written this way,\n\n181\n00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,040\nwill not allow anyone to get anywhere.\n\n182\n00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> This will deny everything.\n\n183\n00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,450\nYou gotta have at least one permit\nstatement in there somewhere.\n\n184\n00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n185\n00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,692\n>> So the order of us creating the\nstatements that we need, very important.\n\n186\n00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:59,990\nThe understanding there has to be at\nleast one statement that allows us to be\n\n187\n00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,530\nable to do what we need to do\n>> uh-huh\n\n188\n00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,080\n>> is also going to be important.\n\n189\n00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,246\nAnd then remembering that\nthere's that implicit all, so\n\n190\n00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,180\ndepending on which one that we do.\n\n191\n00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,900\nSo it doesn't matter when we talk\nabout the different types here.\n\n192\n00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,980\nWe have to remember at least those basic\nfacts when we begin to create these\n\n193\n00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,720\nAccess Control Lists.\n\n194\n00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,030\n>> Now all of these lines together\nform the Access Control List, the ACL.\n\n195\n00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870\nRight?\n\n196\n00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,010\nEach individual line is called an ACE or\nan Access Control Entry.\n\n197\n00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,570\nRight?\n>> Yup.\n\n198\n00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,230\n>> So access control entry,\nthat's the individual components.\n\n199\n00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,870\nAnd then ACL, that's the whole thing,\nthe Access Control List.\n\n200\n00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,143\nSo those are two terms you\nvery well may see on the exam,\n\n201\n00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,110\nyou know there are first one.\n\n202\n00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,558\nBut ACE,\nmultiple ACEs add up to become one ACL.\n\n203\n00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,131\nRight?\n\n204\n00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,980\nYou know another thing\nI want to mention is,\n\n205\n00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,260\nas we start to build these ACLs, it's\na good idea to think about them this way.\n\n206\n00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,969\nDon't worry about syntax, right?\n\n207\n00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,640\nWorry about just the concept.\n\n208\n00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,800\nWhat is that exactly\nyou're trying to write?\n\n209\n00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,710\nAnd then once you've got that sorted out,\nthen you can go and\n\n210\n00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,730\nwrite it in the proper syntax.\n\n211\n00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,300\nWhen we write an ACL,\n\n212\n00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,525\nwe're normally going to be writing\nfrom one of two perspectives, right?\n\n213\n00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,600\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> One perspective is,\n\n214\n00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,360\nI wanna block everything and just allow\na couple of things through, right?\n\n215\n00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,410\nOr it might be the opposite.\n\n216\n00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,380\nI want to allow everything, and\nthen just block a couple of things, right?\n\n217\n00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,730\nThe type of ACL, or\n\n218\n00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,559\nthe way you write that ACL is gonna\nvary based on what you're doing, right?\n\n219\n00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,590\nSo let's just kinda come\nup with an example of both.\n\n220\n00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,210\nOkay?\n\n221\n00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,460\nMaybe I wanna do an ACL where I\npretty much wanna allow everything.\n\n222\n00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,870\nI just don't want Ronnie\ngetting to instagram.\n\n223\n00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,378\nIt's really important to me.\n\n224\n00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:40,884\n>> Right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,310\nSo in that particular instance\n\n226\n00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,370\nwe might think about the idea here will\njust wanna cost Standard ACL right?\n\n227\n00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,600\nThe very fact that what we\nwanna do is say hey look,\n\n228\n00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,710\nit depends on whose trying to get him.\n\n229\n00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,770\nI don't care what he's trying to do..\n\n230\n00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,400\nI just don't want Ronnie actually\ngetting access in my network here.\n\n231\n00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,210\nAnd what can we do?\n\n232\n00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,990\nWe can essentially create what we'll call\na Standard ACL, that only really looks at\n\n233\n00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,870\nthe source address here and doesn't care\nwhether I'm trying to get to Instagram.\n\n234\n00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,300\nIt doesn't care whether I'm trying to\ndo anything else on the network here,\n\n235\n00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,540\nwe just block that.\n\n236\n00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,115\nThat's one of the types that we\ncan actually end up putting in.\n\n237\n00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:18,370\n>> Now when you're writing an ACL\nthat is primarily denying things.\n\n238\n00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,980\nThat's denying Ronnie, or you're denying\nspecific activities on your network.\n\n239\n00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,290\nThen what you'll normally do is\nhave a series of deny statements.\n\n240\n00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,186\nAll the things that you're denying,\nyou know.\n\n241\n00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,460\nDeny Ronnie getting to CNN.\n\n242\n00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,560\nDeny Don getting to eBay, you know or\nwhatever it is your trying to do.\n\n243\n00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920\nSo you start doing all\nthese deny statements.\n\n244\n00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,830\nAnd then the very last line that you\ndo will be one like this that says\n\n245\n00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,108\npermit everything else.\n\n246\n00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:44,617\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n247\n00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,167\nBecause you've got this permit everything\n\n248\n00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:50,550\nelse line,\nno one will ever hit the deny everything.\n\n249\n00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,735\nNo one will ever hit\nthat implicit deny all.\n\n250\n00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:55,900\nBecause no matter who you are,\nif you're Pete in Accounting,\n\n251\n00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,920\nwell you don't match these first three\nrules cuz you're not Ronnie or I.\n\n252\n00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,570\nAnd then you hit permit everything else,\nand you're allowed out, right?\n\n253\n00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,670\nSo that last line that permit everything,\n\n254\n00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,650\nthat kind of negates the implicit\ndeny all and it never kicks in.\n\n255\n00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,730\nSo with a predominant deny list,\nthis is what it's gonna look like,\n\n256\n00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,675\nall your denies, followed by an all\nencompassing permit, all right?\n\n257\n00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:17,430\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n258\n00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,250\n>> The opposite though,\nif you're really controlling and\n\n259\n00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,540\nyou just want to specifically\nallow certain things and\n\n260\n00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,910\nblock everything else,\nthose are a little bit easier.\n\n261\n00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,465\nYou know, maybe I want to permit\nRonnie getting to Instagram.\n\n262\n00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,130\nAnd I want to permit\nRonnie getting to CNN.\n\n263\n00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,850\nAnd I wanna permit Don getting to eBay.\n\n264\n00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,510\nAnd then I want to deny everything else.\n\n265\n00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,920\nWell, I can just stop right there.\n\n266\n00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,450\n>> Right.\n>> Because there is the implicit\n\n267\n00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,660\nDeny Everything.\n\n268\n00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,280\nAnd I don't have to write that line,\nit's implied.\n\n269\n00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,140\nSo when we do a really restrictive\none that blocks everything except\n\n270\n00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,410\nspecific things, we'll normally just\nhave these permit statements, right?\n\n271\n00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,386\nBut when we're trying to just deny\nspecific things we have to make sure we\n\n272\n00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:10,443\nput that catch-all in there otherwise\nwe'll deny unintended traffic.\n\n273\n00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:10,943\n>> Yep.\n\n274\n00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800\n>> So, all right, so\nnow let's take a look.\n\n275\n00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,244\nWell, again, from a conceptual standpoint\n>> Right.\n\n276\n00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:23,260\n>> Ronnie,\nI feel like I'm leaving something out.\n\n277\n00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,430\nWith the ACLs, you know we need to\ncome up with what we want to do.\n\n278\n00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,600\nThey are applied in order.\n\n279\n00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,260\nWe have the implicit Deny All.\n\n280\n00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,820\nThe directions?\n\n281\n00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,840\n>> Directions.\n\n282\n00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,122\n>> The directions.\n\n283\n00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,120\nYep so\n\n284\n00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,450\nwhen we craft an ACL, we also need to\nthink about the direction of the traffic.\n\n285\n00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,150\nWe can filter the traffic when\nit's coming into the router, or\n\n286\n00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,140\nwe can filter the traffic when it's\ngoing out of the router, right?\n\n287\n00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,750\nAnd the way we write the list\nis going to be different, right?\n\n288\n00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,890\nIt's the difference between\ndenying Ronnie going to Instagram\n\n289\n00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,672\nversus denying Instagram going to Ronnie.\n\n290\n00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:56,250\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n291\n00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,270\nSo we need to have a thought about\nthat too, as we write our list.\n\n292\n00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,920\nWe need to think what way is\nthis list going to apply.\n\n293\n00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,440\nIf I'm filtering the traffic coming in or\nout, and on what interface.\n\n294\n00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,736\nThat all comes into play.\n\n295\n00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:10,870\n>> Yeah, and I maybe we also have to talk\nabout the interfaces that we put them on\n\n296\n00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,340\ntoo as well.\n\n297\n00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,040\nSo not only are we actually thinking\nabout inbound and outbound.\n\n298\n00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,360\nWe've also got to actually think on\nanother router what interface we're gonna\n\n299\n00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360\nput that on.\n\n300\n00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,896\nWhat direction it's gonna go in as well\nand so we're gonna actually take a look at\n\n301\n00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,777\nthat as Don does some drawings there\n[CROSSTALK] that'll help us out.\n\n302\n00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:28,790\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah let's do one of my sad\n\n303\n00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,352\nlittle pictures here.\n\n304\n00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,539\n>> That's right.\n\n305\n00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,140\n>> Okay?\nSo\n\n306\n00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,870\nwhat I've got in our little\nlab environment I got some\n\n307\n00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,880\nsimple things set up.\n\n308\n00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,020\nI've got,\nwell first off I've got my laptop.\n\n309\n00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,790\nYou know what?\n\n310\n00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,470\nI'm going to do a Mike Roderick.\n\n311\n00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,360\n>> Oh look at that fancy computer.\n\n312\n00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,640\n>> Yeah.\nMike he gets all crazy, draws keys and\n\n313\n00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,000\nstuff and a monitor, there's Don's laptop.\n\n314\n00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,782\nI'm not an artist.\n\n315\n00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:56,487\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I am 192.168.0.222 is my.\n\n316\n00:14:56,487 --> 00:15:02,512\nWell now, that is supposed to\nincrease the font size. There we go.\n\n317\n00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,810\nOk, so that's my laptop sitting out\nthere and I am cabled into a router so\n\n318\n00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,660\nwe've got a router on the network\nwhich is just good old,\n\n319\n00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,375\nRouter 1 from one of the other episodes.\n\n320\n00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,660\n>> Yep.\n>> And so I'm cabled into it, right,\n\n321\n00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,520\nso I've got a connection.\n\n322\n00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,460\nAnd for the router, the router's\ngot two IPs, and on that interface,\n\n323\n00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,640\nthat's the GI0/1 interface.\n\n324\n00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,910\nAnd it is 192.168.0.1.\n\n325\n00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,420\nOkay?\n\n326\n00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,210\nSo that's the router over there.\n\n327\n00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,512\nNow the router is then connected to\nwhat we'll pretend is the Internet.\n\n328\n00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:46,374\nIt's connected to our studio network and\nso we'll just kinda draw that and\n\n329\n00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,853\ncall it the Internet.\n\n330\n00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:52,673\nAll right.\n\n331\n00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:58,703\nAnd, that is its GI0/0\ninterface which is there,\n\n332\n00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:03,520\n10.1.230.15, all right.\n\n333\n00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,250\nSo that's kind of the topology\nthat we've got for right now.\n\n334\n00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,970\n>> Wow!\n\n335\n00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,340\n>> Make it nice and big.\n\n336\n00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,940\n>> Nice.\n\n337\n00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,966\n>> There we go,\nproportional with the router.\n\n338\n00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:11,508\n>> Yes.\n\n339\n00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:14,443\n>> So when my laptop is\ngoing out to the internet,\n\n340\n00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:19,290\nthere are several places that we\ncan filter that traffic, right.\n\n341\n00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,960\nSo my laptop,\nif I'm going out to Instagram,\n\n342\n00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120\nI'm gonna ask a silly question here,\nI'll probably regret it.\n\n343\n00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,450\nWhat even does Instagram do?\n\n344\n00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,920\nI've never used it.\n\n345\n00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,280\n>> It apparently allows you to take\npictures and post them on the internet so\n\n346\n00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,048\nthat other people can comment on them.\n\n347\n00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:35,764\n>> That sounds awesome.\nBoy,\n\n348\n00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:38,960\nI wish there was some other service\nthat allowed us to do that.\n\n349\n00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,370\nIf only Facebook allowed you\nto post pictures or, you know.\n\n350\n00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,470\n>> You're just not with it Don.\n\n351\n00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,034\n>> If Pinterest would do it or\na hundred other services.\n\n352\n00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,480\nAnyhow, I'm sure they are millionaires and\n\n353\n00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,328\nI'm not\n>> That's right.\n\n354\n00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:55,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I really shouldn't say anything.\n\n355\n00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,190\nSo if we take our laptop though, if I go\nout to the internet to get to Instagram or\n\n356\n00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,280\nTwitter or whatever services\nmake more money than I do,\n\n357\n00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,980\nthen I've gotta pass through\nthe router on my way out.\n\n358\n00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,620\nAnd then that service has to reply\nback to me through the router and\n\n359\n00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,140\nback to my system, right.\n\n360\n00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,349\nSo you know,\nit's two ways [SOUND] of communication,\n\n361\n00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,716\ngotta do the sound effect, all right.\n\n362\n00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:23,250\nSo there's really four places\nthat we can filter this traffic.\n\n363\n00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,319\nWe can filter it as the traffic\ncomes in this interface,\n\n364\n00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,380\nright, so here I go in that interface.\n\n365\n00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,330\nOr out this interface,\nas it goes out to the internet.\n\n366\n00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,580\nOr I can filter it on the way back,\nas Instagram comes in this interface,\n\n367\n00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,570\nand then again out this one.\n\n368\n00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,868\nSo we got four different places we can\nfilter the traffic, how do we pick?\n\n369\n00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,751\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n370\n00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:52,690\n>> Well, generally we wanna filter it\n\n371\n00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,740\nat the most optimal place not to\nwaste time and bandwidth, okay.\n\n372\n00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,260\n>> Right.\n>> If I filter it\n\n373\n00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,650\nover here on this interface\nwhen it's coming back this way.\n\n374\n00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,440\nThe traffic went to the router,\nthe router did a routing lookup table, or\n\n375\n00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,980\ntable lookup.\n\n376\n00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,350\nFound the route to follow,\nsent it out over my internet connection,\n\n377\n00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,970\nbothered their server, got the response\nback, ran it against the routing table\n\n378\n00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,770\nagain to flip it over to this interface,\nand then blocked it and dropped it, right.\n\n379\n00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,670\nDid all that work for nothing.\n\n380\n00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,810\nIt would have been better to have filtered\nit right here at the very beginning.\n\n381\n00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,481\nRight when we hit the router,\nbefore we even the routing table,\n\n382\n00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,904\njust take a look at it say,\nnope [SOUND] throw this away, and\n\n383\n00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,050\nthat's the sound the router\nmakes when it does it.\n\n384\n00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,750\n>> Mm-hm, of course.\n\n385\n00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,010\n>> And just filter it out,\nthrow it and that's it.\n\n386\n00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,240\nWe don't do a routing table lookup,\nwe don't waste bandwidth on our WAN link,\n\n387\n00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,530\nwe don't bother Instagram with\ntraffic we're gonna drop anyway.\n\n388\n00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,240\nThat's really the best thing to do.\n\n389\n00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,450\nSo, generally, we're going to\nwant to place these access lists\n\n390\n00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,200\nas close to the source as possible\nto be able to restrict them.\n\n391\n00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,290\nBut we'll see, as we go through our\nexamples, that sometimes that's not\n\n392\n00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,700\nalways possible depending on how\nspecific we're trying to be.\n\n393\n00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,300\nSo, just keep in mind we've got like\nfour choices here just on one router.\n\n394\n00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,530\nIt is something we need to keep in mind.\n\n395\n00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n396\n00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,290\nSo as these things get more complex,\n\n397\n00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,910\nyou'll see where sometimes it's exactly\nthe way that we just talked about.\n\n398\n00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,770\nBlock it before it ever does anything.\n\n399\n00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,330\nSometimes that may actually have\na different adverse effect before\n\n400\n00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,360\nwe realize it.\n\n401\n00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,160\nSo we'll take a look, as we continue\nto go through and become more\n\n402\n00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,960\ncomplicated in these access lists,\nwe may see different instances of that.\n\n403\n00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320\nSo for us here, this is actually\na good place for us to actually again,\n\n404\n00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440\nkinda recap now.\n\n405\n00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,210\nBecause we've now gone through so\nmany different concepts, right?\n\n406\n00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,510\nSo we've talked about now the idea\nof the directions, right.\n\n407\n00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,340\nIt's gonna be very important when we\nstart creating these access lists.\n\n408\n00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,750\nWe need to know what direction\nwe're gonna place them in.\n\n409\n00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,860\nAs well as what particular\ninterface that we actually have.\n\n410\n00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,000\nWe also wanna make sure that\nas we create these lists here,\n\n411\n00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,820\nwe're gonna have at least one\npermit statement in there.\n\n412\n00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,766\nOr, it doesn't matter what we do,\nit's gonna be blocked, okay.\n\n413\n00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,340\nAnd the order that we actually put these\nentries in are also going to matter too.\n\n414\n00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,570\nNow I'm pretty much sure I'm\nforgetting something else, but\n\n415\n00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,040\nI can't remember right\noff the top of my head.\n\n416\n00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,890\n>> Well there's a couple little things,\nbut\n\n417\n00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,550\nwe'll tackle them later with extended ACL.\n\n418\n00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,160\nBut as far as the general concepts,\nthat's basically it.\n\n419\n00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,470\nWe write these ACLs,\nwe attach them to the interfaces.\n\n420\n00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,370\nYour access list can get really\ncomplex because you can only have\n\n421\n00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,010\none ACL per interface, per direction.\n\n422\n00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,050\n>> Yep.\n>> So, if I have an internal interface,\n\n423\n00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,580\nI can have one incoming and\none outgoing ACL and that's it.\n\n424\n00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,720\nSo if I have a bunch of different\nrequirements, I have to merge them\n\n425\n00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,260\ntogether into one ACL, and\nthat's where it gets challenging, right?\n\n426\n00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,350\nAnd we'll have to kinda fenagle\nour lists a bit, I think fenagle,\n\n427\n00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,943\nthat's the official Cisco term?\n\n428\n00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:48,567\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n429\n00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,830\n>> To get the lists placed in the right\norder so it all plays together.\n\n430\n00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,520\nIt is a little bit of an art, and\non the exam they love to test you on it.\n\n431\n00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,471\nThey love to show you ACLs that\nare just out of order or mixed up, and\n\n432\n00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,390\nthen you gotta straighten them\nout to get them working properly.\n\n433\n00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,010\nSo, I think we're about\nready to jump into syntax.\n\n434\n00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,258\nWe're getting kinda close to the break but\nlet's go ahead and do it anyway.\n\n435\n00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:16,220\nActually you know, let's talk a little\nbit about syntax and then, see,\n\n436\n00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,460\nwe're gonna have to talk about wild cards.\n\n437\n00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,450\nAnd I know I can't talk about\nwild cards in five minutes.\n\n438\n00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,310\n>> Well, let's talk about just\na few different things on that.\n\n439\n00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,200\nWe're gonna see that unlike everything\nelse that we've done before,\n\n440\n00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,850\nthis is probably the first big\nopportunity we're gonna see that some of\n\n441\n00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,380\nthe ways that we normally make statements,\nis gonna be a little bit weird\n\n442\n00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,470\nespecially with what they are talking\nabout with the wildcard math.\n\n443\n00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n444\n00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,897\n>> So that may be something that we wanna\ngo over before we even get into that as we\n\n445\n00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:37,300\ngo through that as we go through that.\n\n446\n00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,290\n>> Let's do that Ronnie.\n\n447\n00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,520\n>> Let's do this, let's stop here.\n\n448\n00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,040\n>> Okay.\n>> And we'll take our first break just\n\n449\n00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,870\na little bit early.\n\n450\n00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,640\nAnd when we get back we'll\njump into wildcards.\n\n451\n00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,240\n>> RIght.\n\n452\n00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240\n>> And\nonce we have a good grasp of wildcards\n\n453\n00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,770\nthen we'll start crafting our first\nACLs and get a chance to do that.\n\n454\n00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,590\nI think that'll work out well.\n\n455\n00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,640\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n456\n00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,389\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned for\n\n457\n00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:57,216\nmore access control list\naction after these messages.\n\n458\n00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,756\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n459\n00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:06,420\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n460\n00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,791\nSo before the break,\nwe left off talking about, well,\n\n461\n00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,060\nACLs, but specifically,\nI wanted to talk about wildcards, right.\n\n462\n00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,530\nIn the example that I wrote in\nNotepad on the screen earlier,\n\n463\n00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,160\nI was talking about denying Ronnie\nspecifically, or me specifically.\n\n464\n00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,680\nBut we're not normally denying somebody\non an individual basis, sometimes we are,\n\n465\n00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,610\nbut not always.\n\n466\n00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,660\nWe're normally doing entire networks,\nor ranges of computers, and\n\n467\n00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,830\nin ACLs we have a new way to designate\nthat with what's called a wildcard mask.\n\n468\n00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,640\nAnd if you watched out OSPF\nepisode you got a real\n\n469\n00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,810\nquick introduction into wildcards.\n\n470\n00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,710\nNow we're gonna do the full introduction\nand show you exactly how they work.\n\n471\n00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,660\n>> Yeah, now this is a very\nimportant concept for us.\n\n472\n00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,570\nIf you've been with us through\nthe remainder of the shows,\n\n473\n00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,887\nthe majority of times, every time we've\ntyped an IP address it's usually,\n\n474\n00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,990\nI'm gonna say 90% of the time if not more,\n\n475\n00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,650\nit's always been with the idea\nof using the subnet mask itself.\n\n476\n00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,740\nNow we've gone over the idea of\nwhat the subnet mask is, and\n\n477\n00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,510\nnow we actually have to talk about the\nidea of the wild card mask for us as well.\n\n478\n00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,690\nWe need to make sure you\nunderstand the syntax on it,\n\n479\n00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,370\nthat's gonna be very important, especially\nwhen it comes down to ACLs, it actually\n\n480\n00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,000\nhelps us to zero in, really on a specific\npart of a subnet, if we need to.\n\n481\n00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,930\nAnd that's really why it's key for\nus as we continue on.\n\n482\n00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,920\n>> All right, now, in the OSPF show,\nwe showed if I wanted\n\n483\n00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,530\nto advertise a network in OSPF, I had\nto use a wild card mask to identify it.\n\n484\n00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,170\nSo let me bring out my\ntrusty notepad here.\n\n485\n00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,633\nSo if I wanted to advertise out\nthe 192.168.0.0 network and\n\n486\n00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,551\nit was a class C a /24.\n\n487\n00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:49,896\nIf I wanted to advertise that out,\nwell the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\n\n488\n00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:53,456\nAnd if I wanted to convert that\nsubnet mask to a wildcard mask,\n\n489\n00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:56,740\nwe just reversed the ones and\nthe zeros in binary.\n\n490\n00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,110\nAnd so it ends up being 0.0.0.255,\n\n491\n00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:03,090\nbasically the exact opposite of\nwhat the subnet mask was, right.\n\n492\n00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,910\nAnd we just kinda left it at that.\n\n493\n00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,740\nBut, we do need to have a better\nunderstanding of it here for\n\n494\n00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,780\nour access control list.\n\n495\n00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,690\nAnd the main reason is,\nit's really important to convey\n\n496\n00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,920\nthat the wildcard mask and\nthe subnet mask are not tied together.\n\n497\n00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,080\nThey're actually\nindependent of each other.\n\n498\n00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,590\nAnd a wildcard mask does\nnot obey the same rules.\n\n499\n00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,550\nThe term wildcard, it actually\noriginated from a number of things.\n\n500\n00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,788\nBut we use it in file directory commands\nand stuff, so If I do something like,\n\n501\n00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:38,790\ndir *itpro*, right.\n\n502\n00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,610\nThose asterisks,\nthose serve as a wildcard.\n\n503\n00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,840\nI'm saying give me a list,\n\n504\n00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,220\ngive me the directory listing of any file\nthat has the word itpro in the middle.\n\n505\n00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,390\nIt can have anything at the beginning,\nanything at the end.\n\n506\n00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,290\nBut somewhere in the middle,\nit's got itpro, that's a wildcard, right.\n\n507\n00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,460\nSo we use these in command lines and\nsearches all the time.\n\n508\n00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,350\nBut for networks, it's not like this.\n\n509\n00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,000\nRemember, network addresses are actually\nseen by the computer in binary, right.\n\n510\n00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,512\nSo if I wanna convert\n192.168.0.0 into binary.\n\n511\n00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:16,220\nIt is [SOUND] Ronnie fact\ncheck me on this one.\n\n512\n00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:19,768\n>> Looks good.\n\n513\n00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,969\n>> Looks good?\n\n514\n00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:28,495\nAll right, so\nthat is 192.168.0.0 in binary, all right.\n\n515\n00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:32,099\nAnd when we write that\nsubnet mask like this.\n\n516\n00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:41,260\nThere we go.\n\n517\n00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,270\nWhat we're saying is,\n\n518\n00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,540\nany bit that has a one in the subnet\nmask is part of the network ID.\n\n519\n00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,710\nAnd any bit that has a zero is\npart of the host ID, right.\n\n520\n00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,670\nSo that's what a subnet mask does,\n\n521\n00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,950\nit's identifying what's part of\nthe network and what's part of the host.\n\n522\n00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,450\nBut with a wild card,\nwe're doing something different.\n\n523\n00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,550\nWith a wild card,\na zero says that this number\n\n524\n00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,000\nhas to match and a one says we\ndon't care what the number is.\n\n525\n00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,810\nAnd so if I want to match every address\nthat starts with 192.168.0, but\n\n526\n00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:24,660\nthe last octet can be whatever we want,\n\n527\n00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,020\nI would need to do zeroes for the first\nthree octets saying these have to match.\n\n528\n00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,040\nAnd then, 1s for the last octet saying,\nI don't care what it is.\n\n529\n00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,580\nIt can be whatever,\nit's a wildcard, right.\n\n530\n00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,140\nSo that's what we're meant doing here,\nright.\n\n531\n00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,305\n0, let me just kind of write that out.\n\n532\n00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:49,756\nThere.\n\n533\n00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:53,410\nSo 0, the bit has to match,\n1, the bit can be any value.\n\n534\n00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:53,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n535\n00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,840\nNow, when you look at it, you might think,\noh, that's perfectly fine.\n\n536\n00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,770\nIt's the exact opposite of a subnet mask,\nI'll have no problems with that.\n\n537\n00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,360\nBut remember, that for us the subnet\nmask itself has to follow rules, right.\n\n538\n00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,030\nThere has to be a contiguous strings of\nones, okay, from the left hand side and\n\n539\n00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,480\nthen there has to be\na contiguous string of zeros.\n\n540\n00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,720\nSo for us here, there always has to be\nthat and that's what helps us to identify\n\n541\n00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,230\nthe network portion from the actual\nhost ID when we do this.\n\n542\n00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,820\nIn an wildcard mask though,\nremember what Don just said here.\n\n543\n00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,080\nWe're talking about hey,\nthese bits have to match.\n\n544\n00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,980\nWhen we actually put ones and zeros there.\n\n545\n00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,130\nWe have zeros, they are gonna match,\nif we have ones, they're not gonna match.\n\n546\n00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,740\nAnd that is actually very important\nbecause it doesn't follow the same rules\n\n547\n00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,860\nas what a subnet mask does.\n\n548\n00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,500\nIt's not just the opposite\nwhere we say okay,\n\n549\n00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,540\nall the zeros are my network portion, and\nall the ones are actually my host portion.\n\n550\n00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,180\nIt's about the matching bits\nversus the non-matching bits, and\n\n551\n00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,980\nthat's gotta be a clear concept\nthat you're gonna have.\n\n552\n00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,250\nAt the point that we're doing it right\nnow when we're first introducing you to\n\n553\n00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,800\nthe concepts of ACLs here.\n\n554\n00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,730\nWe're not gonna get super complex but\nlater on as you continue to go through\n\n555\n00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,160\ntoward CCNA and towards your CCNP, you\nmay actually end up seeing that there's\n\n556\n00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,150\ngonna be numbers and you're gonna go,\nhow is that even possible.\n\n557\n00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,220\nAnd that's where it's actually\ngonna come into play.\n\n558\n00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,360\nSo for us here,\nremember it's about the idea.\n\n559\n00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,260\nAnd when we talk about wildcard mask,\n\n560\n00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,690\nwhat has to match versus what doesn't have\nto match, and that is the key for us here.\n\n561\n00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,700\nSo Don right now is actually going ahead\nand creating a list of IP addresses and\n\n562\n00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,560\nalso giving us the /26 here in our\nsubnet mask for us as we continue on.\n\n563\n00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,130\n>> Yeah so,\nI wanna come up with an example, right.\n\n564\n00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,530\nSo let's say that you work for\nsome kind of retail outlet, right.\n\n565\n00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,510\nAnd so, you got retail\nstores all over the country.\n\n566\n00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,410\nAnd at every store,\nyou assign a class c network and\n\n567\n00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,270\nthen you take that network and\nyou divide it up into four subnets, right.\n\n568\n00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,086\nSo if I have a store,\nlet's give this a real number, so\n\n569\n00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,244\nmaybe this is store number 10, right.\n\n570\n00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,903\nOkay, so if I have store number ten, and\nat store number ten I have a network for\n\n571\n00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:11,960\nmy cash registers.\n\n572\n00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,920\nI have another network for\nmy security cameras.\n\n573\n00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,030\nI have another network for\n\n574\n00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,130\nthe computers that are on display, right.\n\n575\n00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,041\nSo I'll call it my retail items.\n\n576\n00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,240\nYou know, if this is like Best Buy, or\nwhatever, they have internet access for\n\n577\n00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,390\nthe machines that are on the shelf.\n\n578\n00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,572\nAnd then maybe I have a fourth network for\nvoice over IP phones, okay.\n\n579\n00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:40,930\nSo store number 10 has one class C,\n\n580\n00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:46,120\nhas 192.168.10.0/24, and then we subnet\nit to carry these other networks,\n\n581\n00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,220\nthat's all store number 10.\n\n582\n00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:58,730\nSo store number ten, the other stores\nwill be configured similarly, right.\n\n583\n00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,540\nSo if I continue my list here for,\n\n584\n00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,130\nstore number 11 and\nstore number 12, and so on, right.\n\n585\n00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,390\nSee how I'm just kinda adding to that\nthird octet there to designate it.\n\n586\n00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,780\nSo when I look at logs and\n\n587\n00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,250\nstuff on my system, I know exactly what\nstore this traffic is coming from.\n\n588\n00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,830\nIf I see traffic from\n192.168.12.something,\n\n589\n00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,160\nI know it came from store number 12,\nright.\n\n590\n00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,490\nAnd then if I look more into the address\nI can figure out is it a cash register,\n\n591\n00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,812\nsecurity cameras, whatever, all right.\n\n592\n00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,570\nWell, the cash registers,\nthe security cameras and\n\n593\n00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,055\nthe VoIP phones, those are all stuff\nthat we use as our employees right?\n\n594\n00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,682\nBut what about those retail items?\n\n595\n00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:41,020\n>> Right.\n>> Your customers,\n\n596\n00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,070\nyou know these people walk in off\nthe street, you have no idea,\n\n597\n00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,610\nare they malicious,\nare they, you know, benign?\n\n598\n00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,510\nWhat are they gonna do when they\ngain access to that computers,\n\n599\n00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,820\npeople can do some bad things.\n\n600\n00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,100\nSo I might wanna create rules\nthat filter that access.\n\n601\n00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,850\nI might wanna filter the traffic for\nmy retail items, all right.\n\n602\n00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,910\nI could write a bunch of\ndifferent ACL entries.\n\n603\n00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,490\nOne blocking the retail\nitems of store number ten.\n\n604\n00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,690\nAnother one blocking retail\nitems of store number 11, and\n\n605\n00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,620\nthe store number 12 and so on.\n\n606\n00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,210\nBut what if I have 500 stores?\n\n607\n00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,100\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] >> That'd be like 500 lines.\n\n608\n00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,170\nThe longer your ACL is,\nthe more burden it creates on the router.\n\n609\n00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,100\nYou're slowing your router down\nwhen you create too many, right.\n\n610\n00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,390\nI always try and\nhold my ACLs to blow at least 100 lines.\n\n611\n00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,670\nIf you get beyond 100, you do start\nto get some performance issues.\n\n612\n00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,610\nSo you wanna make sure,\nyou try and optimize things.\n\n613\n00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,242\nThere's no set in stone number, the\nhigher-end routers can do massive ACLs.\n\n614\n00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:41,157\nBut the low end routers you do do\nwant to keep them kind of small.\n\n615\n00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:44,720\nWell, using wild cards,\nI can match on a few things, right.\n\n616\n00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,274\nLook at the retail items.\n\n617\n00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:51,416\nI know that my retail items,\nthey always start with 192.168, right?\n\n618\n00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,596\nAt all 3 stores, they start with 192.168.\n\n619\n00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:57,930\nThe third octet, though, changes.\n\n620\n00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,690\nStore number 10, store number 11,\nstore number 12.\n\n621\n00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,550\nBut then the fourth octet is always\ngoing to be between 128 and 191, right.\n\n622\n00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,450\nIt's that range of IP's\nthat's in that network.\n\n623\n00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:16,370\nSo, I can write a wildcard mask\nthat matches on the first, second,\n\n624\n00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,040\nand part of the fourth octet, to be able\nto catch all these guys in one line.\n\n625\n00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,010\nThat's the power of a wildcard mask.\n\n626\n00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,400\n>> And it's very important for\nus to actually realize that.\n\n627\n00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,440\nCuz a lot of times like you said,\nas a beginner,\n\n628\n00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,684\nwe always think it's just\nan inverse subnet mask and\n\n629\n00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,340\nthat will catch you especially\nwhen you are looking at these.\n\n630\n00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,290\nAnd you start seeing something where\nyou are going, that can't be right.\n\n631\n00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,680\nIt can be right and\nthat's where it actually has to come in.\n\n632\n00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,110\nSo here in this instance,\nwhat can this actually do for\n\n633\n00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,640\nus in terms of the efficiency\nthat I was talking about?\n\n634\n00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,630\nWe can create one particular entry then,\nthat can actually match all three of\n\n635\n00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:56,400\nthose retail items, machines, that we\nactually are dealing with at that point.\n\n636\n00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,980\nAnd that way, we don't actually create\nthree separate, or four separate, or\n\n637\n00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,680\nhowever many different separate access\nentries that we actually have to do\n\n638\n00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,660\nto do all that.\n\n639\n00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,090\nSo by us eliminating that third octet,\n\n640\n00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,050\nsaying don't match on this third one,\nwe can go ahead and do that as well.\n\n641\n00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,690\nAnd that does actually help out.\n\n642\n00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,670\nSo Don's going ahead and\n\n643\n00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,120\ngiving us the binary preview of what\nwe're talking about here to make sure.\n\n644\n00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,881\n>> So\nhere's these three retail item networks,\n\n645\n00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:25,287\n192.68.10.128, and 11.128, and 12.128.\n\n646\n00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:30,440\nAnd keep in mind, those networks\nrun all the way through like\n\n647\n00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,110\n192.168.10.191 would be\nthe top of that network.\n\n648\n00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,730\nRight?\n\n649\n00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,460\nThe first and the last address.\n\n650\n00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,350\nActually that would be what.\n\n651\n00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,800\nOops no, wrong octet.\n\n652\n00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,050\nLet me get my bearings straight here.\n\n653\n00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,030\nBut it would be.\n\n654\n00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,070\nOh, you know what?\nActually it would be.\n\n655\n00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,815\nI'm not supposed to do 192.\n\n656\n00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,200\nI'm supposed to do 191 is where it stops.\n\n657\n00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,350\n192 is the next network.\n\n658\n00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,600\nSo when I look at these guys,\nI can kind of see that and\n\n659\n00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,280\nI guess I could add the first and\nthe last for each one.\n\n660\n00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,030\nIt wouldn't be that much more of a burden.\n\n661\n00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,950\nAnd so I'm just gonna go and throw those\nin and correct them, so this'll become 11.\n\n662\n00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,185\nAnd this one will become 12.\n\n663\n00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,130\nThere you go, all right.\n\n664\n00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,350\nSo that's the beginning and\nthe end of each of those networks.\n\n665\n00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,500\nSo what I need to do is I say,\n\n666\n00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,310\nhow can I match these,\nwithout getting the other networks?\n\n667\n00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,918\nWell, right off,\nI can see they all start with 192.168.\n\n668\n00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:33,499\nRight?\n\n669\n00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:34,420\nSo that's easy.\n\n670\n00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,940\nSo when I start to build my wildcard mask,\nI say all right, well, the first 2 octets,\n\n671\n00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,970\nI know I need to get those.\n\n672\n00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,930\nRight.\n\n673\n00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,340\nSo I'll just go ahead and do zeroes.\n\n674\n00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,064\nCuz remember, 0's have to match, right?\n\n675\n00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:51,720\nSo I'm saying the first 2\noctets have to be 192.168.\n\n676\n00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,466\nThe third octet's my problem, cuz it's\ngonna be different for every store, right?\n\n677\n00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,904\nStore number 10, store number 100,\nstore number 200.\n\n678\n00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:01,210\nRight, it can be whatever.\n\n679\n00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,630\nSo here I might put all ones okay,\nall ones cuz I don't care,\n\n680\n00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,740\nit can be whatever number it\nwants in that third octet.\n\n681\n00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,750\nFor the fourth octet though,\nin the fourth octet,\n\n682\n00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,029\nthe number has to be between 128 and 191.\n\n683\n00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,070\nAll right.\n\n684\n00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,390\nIt can't be below 128 and\nit can't be above 191.\n\n685\n00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,850\nWell, if you look at these numbers as I\nwrote the lowest and the highest, right?\n\n686\n00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,863\nIf you're above 128 and below 191,\n\n687\n00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:37,661\nyour first two bits will always be 10.\n\n688\n00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:42,200\n10000000 is 128.\n\n689\n00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,940\nAnd then 10 and all 1s, is 191.\n\n690\n00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,960\nIf you wanted to go lower,\nyou would get a 0 here in that first bit.\n\n691\n00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,340\nAnd if you wanted to go higher,\nyou would get a 11 in the first 2 bits.\n\n692\n00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,090\nSo in this case,\nI know they're gonna start with 10.\n\n693\n00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:04,290\nSo I can say, 00,\nthose first two bits have to match,\n\n694\n00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,430\nand then the rest of it can be whatever.\n\n695\n00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,000\nRight?\nSo\n\n696\n00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,470\nthis will cover 128 all\nthe way through 191.\n\n697\n00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,953\nThis is where it gets to what Ronnie said.\n\n698\n00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,230\nIt completely breaks\nthe subnet mask rules.\n\n699\n00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,630\nI'm mixing and matching 1's and 0's.\n\n700\n00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,056\nIt's not that all the 0's are on one side,\nand the 1's are on the other.\n\n701\n00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,362\nThey're mix and match.\n\n702\n00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:25,870\n>> Yeah.\nAnd if we were to convert this then into\n\n703\n00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,507\nthe wild card mask into\nwhat we would know,\n\n704\n00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:34,645\nwe'd see 0.0, and then 255,\nand then this one.\n\n705\n00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:37,608\nOh, now all of a sudden that's gonna be,\n63?\n\n706\n00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:38,140\n63.\n\n707\n00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,328\n[LAUGH].\n\n708\n00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:41,220\n>> Yep.\nSo the way I remember that,\n\n709\n00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,870\nit's just a little mnemonic I have,\n\n710\n00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,700\nis remember these all have place values,\nright?\n\n711\n00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,960\nSo all the way on the right, you got 1,\n\n712\n00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,610\nand then it goes 2, 4,\n8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.\n\n713\n00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,470\nSo I know this first one is 128.\n\n714\n00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,420\nAnd the second one is 64.\n\n715\n00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,130\nWell, if you don't have those two bits,\nyour number has to be beneath 64, and\n\n716\n00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,280\nsince it's all 1's here, it has to be the\nvery next number under 64, which is 63.\n\n717\n00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,860\nSo that's the way I do that in my head.\n\n718\n00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,450\n>> So take a look at how\nwe translated this, right?\n\n719\n00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,534\nIn the decimal number we have 0.0.255.63.\n\n720\n00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:19,844\nIf we were to say no,\nit's just a inverse subnet mask,\n\n721\n00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:23,520\nwe couldn't actually\neven report that here.\n\n722\n00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,660\nThe numbers don't actually help us out and\nwe try and\n\n723\n00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,240\nmake an inverse subnet mask because\nthey don't follow the rules.\n\n724\n00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,330\nVery important to remember.\n\n725\n00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,682\nWildcard mask and subnet mask\nreally are not tied together and\n\n726\n00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:38,140\nit actually helps us to be more granular\nlike we actually showed you here.\n\n727\n00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,820\nNotice that we can actually pick and\nchoose what we want to include\n\n728\n00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,140\nto match the ACL that we're\nactually gonna use this with.\n\n729\n00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,400\nThat's actually the key for us here.\n\n730\n00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,900\nNotice that this actually covers all three\nof those separate individual networks and\n\n731\n00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,270\njust that specific range of those with one\nparticular entry is what we have here.\n\n732\n00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,170\nYeah.\n>> I could write a simple\n\n733\n00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,510\nline that just shows deny 192.168.,\nand really this value doesn't matter.\n\n734\n00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,950\nYou can put whatever you wanted in there\ncuz we don't count that bit anyway.\n\n735\n00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,679\nSo normally we just put 0.\n\n736\n00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:17,049\nSo 192.168.0.128 with a 0.0.255.63\nwildcard going to corporate networks.\n\n737\n00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:21,740\nSo now, anybody on any of these\nnetworks up here that are flagged for\n\n738\n00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,410\nretail items, from back up here.\n\n739\n00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,140\nSo all these guys that\nare retail item networks,\n\n740\n00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,660\nthese guys would no longer be able\nto get to our corporate networks.\n\n741\n00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,490\nAnd our corporate networks might be these\nother ones that are out here, right?\n\n742\n00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,540\nAnd we could even write\na wild card mask for\n\n743\n00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,990\nthat to specifically grab\nthe other ones there, right?\n\n744\n00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,920\nSo if I wanted to grab everything\nexcept the 128 to 191,\n\n745\n00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,860\nI can then craft an ACL to match those two\nto ensure that we get the other values.\n\n746\n00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,350\nSo you can get really specific\nabout that and it's pretty neat.\n\n747\n00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,010\nIt does require a lot of thought and\na lot of math.\n\n748\n00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,130\nOn the CCENT exam,\nthey are not gonna drive this home on you.\n\n749\n00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,580\nMost of the wildcard masks\nare going to be pretty easy.\n\n750\n00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,130\nOn the CCNA exam, you better be\nready to calculate these out.\n\n751\n00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,330\nThey are gonna make you do\nsome interesting ones, or\n\n752\n00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,860\nat least double check ones they've already\nmade to make sure they're accurate.\n\n753\n00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,360\n>> Right.\n\n754\n00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,140\n>> So, wildcard mask is really cool.\n\n755\n00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:26,164\nFor the most part though, if you're\njust trying to block or allow a class A,\n\n756\n00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:30,107\nclass B, or class C,\nyou simply reverse the mask, right?\n\n757\n00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:36,355\nSo you've got 255.255.255.0,\nor 255.255.0.0,\n\n758\n00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:41,086\nor 255.0.0.0,\nif those are your subnet masks and\n\n759\n00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:45,436\nyou wanna do a wildcard mask\nthat catches them, well,\n\n760\n00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:49,051\nthe wild card for a Class C,\nyou just flip it.\n\n761\n00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:52,674\nAnd the wildcard mask for\na Class B, you just flip it.\n\n762\n00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:57,253\nAnd a wild card mask for\na class A again flipping it.\n\n763\n00:39:57,253 --> 00:40:01,651\nSo very very simple, but if you want to\ngrab specific subnets, things get really\n\n764\n00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:06,230\nchallenging and that's when the wild\ncard masks can get all over the place.\n\n765\n00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,220\n>> For us, I'm going to say at this point,\n\n766\n00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,290\nthis is probably the extent that\nyou're going to see on the exam.\n\n767\n00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,320\nBut remember, as you get more and more\ndetailed into the networks that you're\n\n768\n00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,340\ngoing to use, you have to understand\nthat that's not the basis of this.\n\n769\n00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,790\nIt's not the basis of\na inverse subnet mask here.\n\n770\n00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,590\nThe basis of it is bits that match versus\nbits that aren't don't have to match.\n\n771\n00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,500\nAnd that is the key to understanding\nthe wild card mask for us.\n\n772\n00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,330\nIt is different in the very fact that\nit's the zeros that have to match\n\n773\n00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,590\ninstead of the ones.\n\n774\n00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,750\nThe ones are actually\nthe ones we don't match, but\n\n775\n00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,220\nthat's the primary concept that we wanna\nmake sure that we drive home to you.\n\n776\n00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,540\n>> Yep, so just keep that in mind\nit is a part of this process.\n\n777\n00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,070\nThere are some little shortcut words for\nus to be able to use, too,\n\n778\n00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,030\nthat we'll be able to see as we\nstart to write out our syntax.\n\n779\n00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,867\nFor example, I was being CFU here,\n\n780\n00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:56,971\nif I use a wild card mask of 0.0.0.0,\nokay, so a wild card\n\n781\n00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:02,950\nmask of all zeroes means that all four\noctaves have to match specifically.\n\n782\n00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,910\nSo if I do, for example, 10.1 or\n\n783\n00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,032\nhere 192.168.0.15 with\n\n784\n00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:18,158\na 0.0.0 wildcard mask, right.\n\n785\n00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:23,200\nI'm saying that all four bits have to\nmatch, which means this IP specifically.\n\n786\n00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,620\nThat's the way we target\nin the individual machine.\n\n787\n00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,730\n192.168.0.15 that's this machine.\n\n788\n00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,610\nCisco makes it easy a little easy for\nus with those.\n\n789\n00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,130\nInstead of writing it out this way,\n\n790\n00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,424\nyou can just write it host\n192.168.0.15 and when you do that,\n\n791\n00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:45,401\nthat's the same thing as attaching\na 0.0.0.0 subnet mask or wildcard mask.\n\n792\n00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:48,849\nSo it's going to know that you\nmean this individual host.\n\n793\n00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,120\n>> The other side of this,\n\n794\n00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,780\nof course, is when we actually\ndon't care what it matches.\n\n795\n00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,580\nSo we can actually put any IP\naddress with a wildcard mask then of\n\n796\n00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,940\nall of the actual bits actually being\nzeros all 32 bits being zeros here.\n\n797\n00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,910\nSo if we have this,\n\n798\n00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,100\nwe're saying hey, I don't care what\nany of these four octets actually are.\n\n799\n00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,130\n>> Well if they're zeros we do care.\n\n800\n00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,280\n>> Yeah, it's all ones\n>> zeros all ones sorry.\n\n801\n00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,190\nMy fault.\n\n802\n00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,818\nAll ones.\n\n803\n00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:20,340\nSee the subnet mask is\ncreeping back in on me.\n\n804\n00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,350\n>> It is, it's easy to mix them up because\nit's the opposite of what we normally do.\n\n805\n00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,900\n>> So all ones here say hey don't match,\ndon't worry about it and\n\n806\n00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,670\nthe way that Cisco actually translates\nthe is actually into the word any,\n\n807\n00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,740\nwhich is kind of unusual, but\ninstead of us doing this.\n\n808\n00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,150\nSo here Don's actually\nwriting it out here.\n\n809\n00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,144\n>> You know, I was gonna do it in, here.\n\n810\n00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,217\nShoot.\n\n811\n00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,770\nThere we go.\n\n812\n00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,930\n>> And then that just\ntranslates into the word any.\n\n813\n00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,300\nYeah.\n>> Cuz what we're saying,\n\n814\n00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,405\nwe don't care what any of the octets are,\nright?,\n\n815\n00:42:57,405 --> 00:43:00,860\n255.255.255.255 the octets\ncan be whatever they want.\n\n816\n00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,640\nThis will block everybody and so,\nit just makes it nice and easy.\n\n817\n00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,780\nThe simple word, any.\n\n818\n00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,570\nFor us in Cisco,\n\n820\n00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,640\nthose are two special little keywords\nyou're gonna probably see very often.\n\n821\n00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,430\nEspecially in our access control list.\n\n822\n00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,180\n>> Yeah.\nAnd on the exam, you can see either way.\n\n823\n00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,910\nSometimes, they'll write it out\nwith the full wildcard mask.\n\n824\n00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,640\nSometimes they'll use the shortcut names.\n\n825\n00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,660\nSo as you practice and study and\n\n826\n00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,990\nwork on it, make sure you know\nyou see it both ways, right?\n\n827\n00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,150\nAnd you'll see even the routers\nwill reverse it sometimes.\n\n828\n00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,500\nYou might type it in without the shortcut,\nand then you go and look at the configs,\n\n829\n00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,030\nand in the config it's got the shortcut.\n\n830\n00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,620\nYou know sometimes it'll\ntranslate them for you, so.\n\n831\n00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,900\nSo I am sure we will bump into that.\n\n832\n00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:38,870\nAll right.\nSo\n\n833\n00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,180\nnow that we have had some\nexposure to wildcard masks.\n\n834\n00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,080\nWe are running close to our break time so\nthis kind of worked out well.\n\n835\n00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,840\nRonnie, what do you think?\n\n836\n00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,550\nShould we stop here and when we get back,\nwe'll jump into our first actual ACLs.\n\n837\n00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,219\n>> Yep.\nWe will talk about the syntax we have to\n\n838\n00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:54,187\nsetup and\nthen we'll make sure that they work.\n\n839\n00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:58,063\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen stay tuned\nwhen we get back we will actually start to\n\n840\n00:43:58,063 --> 00:43:59,490\njump in and work with our ACLs.\n\n841\n00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,536\nWe'll see you then.\n\n842\n00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:01,418\n>> All right.\n\n843\n00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:05,700\n[MUSIC]\n\n844\n00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,135\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n845\n00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:15,290\nSo now we're ready to jump into a router,\nand start to see this configuration.\n\n846\n00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:15,950\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n847\n00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,390\nwe're gonna start off with what\nare called standard access controls.\n\n848\n00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,940\nThese are the most simple, so\nit's a great place to start.\n\n849\n00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,360\nStandard ACLs allow us to filter traffic\nbased on a source IP address and\n\n850\n00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,130\nthat's it.\n\n851\n00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,830\nOkay.\n\n852\n00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,190\nJust a source IP.\n\n853\n00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,540\nNow IP address is part of layer three and\n\n854\n00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,040\nyour router's already looking\nat layer three information.\n\n855\n00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,610\nSo a standard ACL creates very\nlittle burden on the system.\n\n856\n00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,480\nHardly any at all.\n\n857\n00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,890\nAnd they're very easy to write and\n\n858\n00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,920\nit is all just kind of based\non that source IP address.\n\n859\n00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,690\nAll right.\n\n860\n00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,420\n>> Now for us, when we start making the\nidea of an access control list, especially\n\n861\n00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,140\na standard access control list is probably\nthe easiest one for us to begin with.\n\n862\n00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,500\nWe always wanna start off not necessarily\njust on the router itself, right.\n\n863\n00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,980\nSo always writing out what we want it\nto accomplish first Is going to be key.\n\n864\n00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,670\nGetting into your mind just\nlike we're doing before\n\n865\n00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,790\nis actually one of the easiest things\nthat you can do because people can\n\n866\n00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,850\ntype these things in incorrectly.\n\n867\n00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,930\nAnd they can type them in\nincorrectly on a production router.\n\n868\n00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:14,520\n>> Yes.\n\n869\n00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,020\n>> I know.\n\n870\n00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,960\nI've done it before and\nthey can cause a lot of problems.\n\n871\n00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,070\nSo writing it out first, verifying that\nyes, you go here's the logic that I wanted\n\n872\n00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,330\nto follow, and then putting it in the\nproper syntax is actually the key for us.\n\n873\n00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,260\n>> The other thing is,\n\n874\n00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,120\nyou gotta be careful with ACLs cuz you\ncan lock yourself out of the router.\n\n875\n00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,100\nAnd that can be bad, so I'll show you\nsome tricks to help prevent that but\n\n876\n00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,680\nyou never wanna be working on a router\nthat's a thousand miles away and\n\n877\n00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,870\nlock yourself out, and\nthen you're in real trouble.\n\n878\n00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,900\nAll right, so basically let's\nstart off here real simple.\n\n879\n00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,720\nI'm on my laptop, and\nmy IP address is 192.168.0.2.\n\n880\n00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,980\nAnd so if I try and\nping out to like the Internet, for\n\n881\n00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,900\nexample, I'm passing through\nthe Cisco router over here, so\n\n882\n00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,880\nmy traffic is going through on\nthe way out to the Internet.\n\n883\n00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,150\nI'm going to jump over to this router and\nwe'll be able\n\n884\n00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,270\nto see my pings kind of running in\nthe background so I'll know if they stop.\n\n885\n00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:12,240\nI'm going to craft an ACL\nthat basically says\n\n886\n00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,780\ndon't allow Don's laptop to get\nout on the Internet, all right.\n\n887\n00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,290\nWe start off by saying access -list and\n\n888\n00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,680\nthen we need to provide\na number to identify the list.\n\n889\n00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,470\nNow, there's a lot of numbers to pick\nfrom if you do a question mark here.\n\n890\n00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,830\nAnd you'll see the ranges, right.\n\n891\n00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,450\nA standard ACL,\none that works on source IP,\n\n892\n00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,380\nis going to have a number between 1 and\n99, right.\n\n893\n00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,350\nRight, so you've got 1 and 99 there.\n\n894\n00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,730\nNow, over the years, Cisco recognized\nthat that just wasn't enough, right.\n\n895\n00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,790\nIt's only, well, 99 numbers.\n\n896\n00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,810\nSo they added a second range,\nand you'll see it down here,\n\n897\n00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,200\nstandard ACL expanded range,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n898\n00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,890\n>> And that's where we can jump up from\n\n899\n00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:56,450\n1300 to 1999, that's gonna give us an\nadditional, what is that, 700 addresses?\n\n900\n00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n901\n00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,280\n>> So quite a few more.\n\n902\n00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,110\n>> Now for us, Don,\nyou probably know what this actually is.\n\n903\n00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,310\nI always have the question at some point,\nwhere somebody says,\n\n904\n00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:06,946\nwhy do they go to 1300?\n\n905\n00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:12,540\nAnd what's actually in-between that that\nthey don't actually want us to be doing?\n\n906\n00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,890\n>> They don't really show it I\nguess you can sort of see, so\n\n907\n00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,190\none through 99 is a standard ACL,\n100 to 199 is\n\n908\n00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,850\nan extended ACL and\nthen 200 to 299 is a protocol ACL.\n\n909\n00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,390\nBut then you've got 300 to 399, which if\nI remember right is IP access PX, and\n\n910\n00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,490\nthen you've got other\nprotocols that are out there.\n\n911\n00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,330\nApple Talk has a range and most of us\ndon't run those protocols anymore.\n\n912\n00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,310\nYou know almost everybody\nis exclusively IP.\n\n913\n00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:46,707\nSo the missing numbers in between,\nwell they show all the way to 299 here.\n\n914\n00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:50,957\nSo from 300 to 1299,\nthose are taken up by other protocols.\n\n915\n00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:52,447\nIf you still use.\n\n916\n00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:56,322\nAppletalk, or IPXXPX, or\nDLSW, or things like that.\n\n917\n00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:57,650\nEven has a little number.\n\n918\n00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,840\nThat you could still break that out.\n\n919\n00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,270\nBut you know, if you're still running\nthose, it's not that you need ACLs,\n\n920\n00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,550\nit's that you need to\nupgrade you're network.\n\n921\n00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,730\nDon't run old protocols.\n\n922\n00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,170\n>> So a lot of times,\nyou might just be curious about that, but\n\n923\n00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,950\nremember that those are really those other\nprotocols, that still exist out there.\n\n924\n00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,820\nAs far as we know, once again,\nif you're running them,\n\n925\n00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,230\nyou're probably on land of the lost,\ngone backward in time, or something.\n\n926\n00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,100\nI'm joking.\n\n927\n00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,690\nYou may still like to run those things.\n\n928\n00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,920\nBut that's what's happened there, and so\nthere's always questions about that, and\n\n929\n00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,600\nso usually,\nyou know that's what you have to explain.\n\n930\n00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,990\nAnd that's where they\nadded in that list here.\n\n931\n00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,340\n>> So we're gonna do access- list,\nand then a number.\n\n932\n00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,650\n>> And then because the number\nI picked is between one and 99,\n\n933\n00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,820\nthat means that this is a standard ACL.\n\n934\n00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,470\nThat's how the router knows.\n\n935\n00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,560\nAnd then I'm gonna say,\neither permit or deny.\n\n936\n00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,930\nThose are my two choices, permit and deny.\n\n937\n00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,580\nThere's a third one, remark,\nthat just means put in a comment.\n\n938\n00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,020\nIt doesn't actually do anything.\n\n939\n00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,380\nIt just kinda stores a note in\nthe configs, so you can see what it is.\n\n940\n00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,910\nSo permit and deny,\nare the only two actual actions.\n\n941\n00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,330\nPermit allows it through,\ndeny stops it dead in its tracks.\n\n942\n00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,950\nI wanna deny my laptop,\nand so I'm gonna deny.\n\n943\n00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:09,000\nAnd then I need to specify the IP\naddress of my laptop, and a wildcard.\n\n944\n00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,800\nSo I can say,\n192.168.0.222 with a 0.0.0.0 subnet mask,\n\n945\n00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,490\nmeaning this IP specifically,\nI want to block my laptop.\n\n946\n00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:25,400\n>> And once he presses enter here.\n\n947\n00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,040\n>> Well,\nwhat happens if I stop right here?\n\n948\n00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,760\nOkay?\n\n949\n00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,730\nWell, this list denies me, and\nthen there's the Implicit Denial All.\n\n950\n00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it denies everybody else also.\n\n951\n00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,180\nSo here's a great spot to go in,\nand say access list 1 permits.\n\n952\n00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n953\n00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,390\n>> And then I can put in,\nwhatever IP I want.\n\n954\n00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,530\nYou can make something up, or\nput in all zeros, or whatever.\n\n955\n00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,100\nBut for the wild card mask,\nif we put in all 255s.\n\n956\n00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,160\nThis means anybody, it means anybody else\nthat's out there, it's gonna permit.\n\n957\n00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,500\nSo this will block my laptop specifically,\nand permit everybody else.\n\n958\n00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,481\nNow, let's see how that\nlooks in the configuration.\n\n959\n00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,800\nSo in the configuration, it changed it,\nand look how it wrote it.\n\n960\n00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,270\nSee how it turned that long thing,\ninto access-list 1 permit any?\n\n961\n00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,740\nSo it went ahead, and\nput the any shortcut in there.\n\n962\n00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,920\nAnd for the host,\nsee how I just put the IP?\n\n963\n00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,870\nThis is a little error,\ncommonly overlooked thing.\n\n964\n00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's standard ACLs,\n\n965\n00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,970\nit will automatically assume,\n\n966\n00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,950\nthat you mean a host if you don't include\na wild card mask, and such was doing here.\n\n967\n00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,780\nIt would've also accepted\nthe host key word.\n\n968\n00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,480\n>> Right.\n>> It's kinda\n\n969\n00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,735\nthree different ways to write the same,\nexact thing.\n\n970\n00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:43,995\n>> Now,\njust creating the access list itself, and\n\n971\n00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:46,585\nif you take a look in the lower right\nhand corner of the screen, you'll notice,\n\n972\n00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,575\nthat it's still continuing on here.\n\n973\n00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:53,180\nThat's because, creating the access\nlist is only half the battle.\n\n974\n00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,980\nRemember the other part,\n\n975\n00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,480\nthat we talked about in the first\nsegment of our show here.\n\n976\n00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,590\nIt's also having to put\nit on an interface, and\n\n977\n00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,990\na direction on interface,\nthat helps us out here too.\n\n978\n00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,590\n>> Yeah, and normally I would want\nto put it on the inside interface,\n\n979\n00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,780\nto filter traffic, but if I do that, I'm\ngoing to lock myself out of the router.\n\n980\n00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,360\nBecause I am inside of it.\n\n981\n00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,490\nSo, I could update the ACL to exclude\nthat particular connection, or whatever.\n\n982\n00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,190\nBut, for right now,\nI'll just attach it to the outside.\n\n983\n00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,350\nSo, I'm gonna attach it to the router,\nwhen my traffic is going out of it,\n\n984\n00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,990\non the way out to the Internet,\nor wherever it is that I'm going.\n\n985\n00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:29,890\nSo I'm gonna get into interface gi0/0,\n\n986\n00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:34,190\nwhich is the one that's\nfacing the Internet.\n\n987\n00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,125\nAnd here, I'll just say,\naccess-group, which is kinda weird.\n\n988\n00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,540\nThe terminology changed, but it does.\n\n989\n00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,605\nAccess-group, and then I tell it the list,\nwhich is list number 1,\n\n990\n00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:49,325\nand then I give it a direction, in or out.\n\n991\n00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:54,240\nAnd I'm gonna say, any traffic going out\nthis interface, run it through access list\n\n992\n00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,010\none, and then access list one will deny my\nlaptop, and it will allow everything else.\n\n993\n00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,980\nSo if I put that in place.\n\n994\n00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,524\nOops, did I leave off IP?\n\n995\n00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:05,080\n>> IP, yep.\n>> There we go.\n\n996\n00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,933\nIP access-group,\nI get my syntax, that helps.\n\n997\n00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,020\n>> There it goes.\n\n998\n00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,530\n>> And now in the background, here we go.\n\n999\n00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:18,830\nI can see, that I am being blocked,\ndestination net unreachable.\n\n1000\n00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,360\nI'm not getting through anymore,\nbecause that list is in place.\n\n1001\n00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,130\nAnd I know it's the list,\nbecause if I turn it off again,\n\n1002\n00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,620\nthe instant I turn it off,\nthere's those pings again.\n\n1003\n00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,200\nSo it's the access list,\nthat's doing the filter.\n\n1004\n00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,080\nThat's one of the easiest ways to test,\nis turning the list on and off.\n\n1005\n00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,210\nThere is another way.\n\n1006\n00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:41,900\nYou can use the show access-list command.\n\n1007\n00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,760\nAnd I'm using the do modifier,\nbecause I'm still in config.\n\n1008\n00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,970\nIf you're out of config,\nyou would just run show access-dash list.\n\n1009\n00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:53,570\nAnd that'll show me a summary of the ACL,\nand you can see if you're getting matches.\n\n1010\n00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,680\nMatches are what tells us, that we\nare actually getting caught by that ACL,\n\n1011\n00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,860\nand not being passed through.\n\n1012\n00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,930\n>> Yeah.\nNow, Don,\n\n1013\n00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,610\nlet's do this as well to show\nthe importance of the direction, okay?\n\n1014\n00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,400\nWhat if I change this, and\nI put the idea of access,\n\n1015\n00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,420\nIP access-group one,\ninbound on that outbound interface?\n\n1016\n00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,560\n>> All right, so here I'm gonna change it\nfrom out to in, and so now it's in place,\n\n1017\n00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:24,820\nand when I look over here,\npages are still going through.\n\n1018\n00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,370\nAnd we need to think about,\nwhat that traffic is doing.\n\n1019\n00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,130\nLet's go back to my picture.\n\n1020\n00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,860\nSo here's my ping,\nas I ping out to the Internet.\n\n1021\n00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,420\nSo I'm going in this interface, and\nthen out on the way to the internet.\n\n1022\n00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,130\nAnd then the host that I'm pinging on, I'm\npinging a DNS server, it's gonna reply.\n\n1023\n00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,220\nAnd that traffic is going come in,\nthis interface.\n\n1024\n00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:51,700\nSo when that traffic is a reply, the\nsource is, whoever is out on the Internet.\n\n1025\n00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,220\nThe destination is me.\n\n1026\n00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,760\nBut a standard ACL,\nonly filters on source, not destination.\n\n1027\n00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,130\nSo this ACL, no longer works.\n\n1028\n00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:00,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n1029\n00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,400\nSo it's very important,\nthat we actually understand that.\n\n1030\n00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,930\nThe direction,\nis just as important as anything else,\n\n1031\n00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,680\nthat we actually put here, okay?\n\n1032\n00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,117\nSo we have to make sure,\nthat when we apply the ACL,\n\n1033\n00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:13,520\nthat we apply it in the proper direction,\nand we also want to make sure,\n\n1034\n00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,315\nwe applied in the proper interface.\n\n1035\n00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:18,065\nI know at times, it's easy,\nwhen you're trying to do it quickly.\n\n1036\n00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:22,691\nThe difference between GI0/0,\nGI0/1, it doesn't feel like,\n\n1037\n00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:25,220\nthat it's that much of a difference.\n\n1038\n00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,420\nBut it is a big difference there, when you\ndon't put it on the right interface, and\n\n1039\n00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,450\nyou still wondering why\nthings are happening.\n\n1040\n00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,320\nOr you got it in the wrong direction,\nwhy things are happening.\n\n1041\n00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,970\nSo remember that, for us here.\n\n1042\n00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:39,960\nCreating the access list, again half the\nbattle, putting it on the right interface,\n\n1043\n00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,830\nin the right direction,\nis the other part we have to actually do,\n\n1044\n00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:43,590\nif we want it to apply.\n\n1045\n00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,370\n>> Now, ACLs, or standard ACLs,\nthey're pretty simple.\n\n1046\n00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,398\nThat's the whole syntax of them.\n\n1047\n00:54:50,398 --> 00:54:56,360\nSo we've got access-list,\nfollowed by a number, right?\n\n1048\n00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,380\nAnd then we can permit or deny, and\nthen the IP, and wildcard mask.\n\n1049\n00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,257\nThose are the components that make up\nan entry, and then as you continue to\n\n1050\n00:55:08,257 --> 00:55:13,150\nadd entries, it's building that list,\nand it's got to be put in order.\n\n1051\n00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,970\nSo here is the challenge\nof the standard ACL.\n\n1052\n00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,340\nWhat if you want to insert something\nin the middle of the list, or\n\n1053\n00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,500\nthe beginning of the list?\n\n1054\n00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,490\nYou really can't.\n\n1055\n00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,020\nYou have to remove the list,\nand rebuild it.\n\n1056\n00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,813\nSo what a lot of people will do, and\nwe'll show you a way around this, but\n\n1057\n00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:33,372\nthe old solution, was that,\nif you pull up your running config, and\n\n1058\n00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:37,774\nyou find your access list in here,\nit's usually towards the end,\n\n1059\n00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:42,919\nthere it is, that you can copy it, and\nthrow it into something like notepad.\n\n1060\n00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:46,920\nAnd in notepad, you can paste it in,\nand you can make your modifications.\n\n1061\n00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,332\nSo maybe I want to do a access-list.\n\n1062\n00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:54,480\n1 deny, and maybe there's some\nother host on here I wanna deny.\n\n1063\n00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,920\nSo I can add that in, and if I just add\na little entry here to the beginning, and\n\n1064\n00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,440\nI'll say no access-list 1.\n\n1065\n00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,820\nThat will delete the access list, and\n\n1066\n00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,500\nthen recreate it this way in\nthe order that I want, okay?\n\n1067\n00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,300\nIf I just go and add this one line, right?\n\n1068\n00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,405\nSo, right now let me just do a,\n\n1069\n00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:22,580\nAll right, so\nhere's the access list as it is right now.\n\n1070\n00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:29,027\nIf I issue access-list\n1 deny 192.168.0.100.\n\n1071\n00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:32,040\nWhen I do that,\nsee the error that it gives me?\n\n1072\n00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,710\nAccess rule can't be configured at a\nhigher sequence number since it's part of\n\n1073\n00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,880\nan existing rule.\n\n1074\n00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,989\nAnd it's telling me that\nif I were to do this,\n\n1075\n00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:42,443\nit would have to stick it onto the end,\nand it's not gonna work out right.\n\n1076\n00:56:42,443 --> 00:56:44,810\nOkay, especially since I\ngot that permit any there.\n\n1077\n00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,690\nSo it's gonna complain.\n\n1078\n00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,611\nBut if we remove the ACL first,\nand then reenter it, right,\n\n1079\n00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:54,796\nso I'm just gonna copy and paste that,\n\n1080\n00:56:54,796 --> 00:57:00,860\nnow, Now it's got it in there and\nit's got it in the order that I want.\n\n1081\n00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,440\nActually, oh,\nthis output kinda shuffles it a bit.\n\n1082\n00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,909\nLet me pull it from the config.\n\n1083\n00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:09,460\nIt'll be right in here.\n\n1084\n00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,280\nThere we go.\n\n1085\n00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,630\nAnd so I can see my entries.\n\n1086\n00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:14,237\nActually, did I write it that way?\n\n1087\n00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:17,000\n>> No, it-\n>> No, it has optimized the list.\n\n1088\n00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,208\nSo the router will do optimizations\nto make the list apply faster.\n\n1089\n00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:27,750\nAnd because 192.168.0.100 is lower\nthan 222, it's moving it up.\n\n1090\n00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,621\nIt knows that it doesn't make a difference\nbecause these are both denies.\n\n1091\n00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:33,210\nAnd so it's just optimizing it for\nits own application.\n\n1092\n00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,200\nCisco calls that compilation,\n\n1093\n00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,760\nthat is compiles the access list to\nmake them run as optimal as possible.\n\n1094\n00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,680\nSo that's what's going on there.\n\n1095\n00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,860\nBut basically it's got it in place,\nit's working.\n\n1096\n00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,590\nMy ping still should be getting blocked.\n\n1097\n00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,570\nAnd yep, I'm still getting blocked.\n\n1098\n00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,530\nAnd we're in.\n\n1099\n00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:54,440\nAnd now, for a brief moment, the ACL\nwas gone, when we did no access-list 1.\n\n1100\n00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,696\nSo what happened there?\n\n1101\n00:57:55,696 --> 00:57:56,789\nTechnically I can get out, right?\n\n1102\n00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:59,341\nAnd I wasn't paying attention,\nso I didn't see, but\n\n1103\n00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:02,407\nit's possible that a ping could\nslip through when that happens.\n\n1104\n00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:05,399\nSo we do want to be careful in\na high security environment,\n\n1105\n00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,850\nit's not a good idea to do it this way.\n\n1106\n00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:13,040\nInstead you just create a second access\nlist, and then you attach it there.\n\n1107\n00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,658\nSo for example if I wanted to do\nthis by hand, so I might say no\n\n1108\n00:58:17,658 --> 00:58:23,000\naccess-list 1, and\nthen start to re-enter it.\n\n1109\n00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,761\nAnd look in the background there.\n\n1110\n00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:25,402\n>> There it is.\n\n1111\n00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:27,360\n>> My pings are getting through, right?\n\n1112\n00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,693\nAnd so that's a problem.\n\n1113\n00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:35,380\nThere.\n\n1114\n00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,290\nSo that's a problem.\n\n1115\n00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,780\nA couple of pings got through.\n\n1116\n00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,366\nSo if I wanted to prevent that,\n\n1117\n00:58:39,366 --> 00:58:43,270\ninstead what I could have done is I could\nhave just created a new access list.\n\n1118\n00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:50,120\nI could have said access-list 2, and then\nput in whatever it was I was trying to do.\n\n1119\n00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,740\nRight, and so maybe I got a few\ndifferent IPs that I wanna block\n\n1120\n00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,620\nbefore I permit everything else, right.\n\n1121\n00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,660\nSo I write that access list\nthe way that I want it,\n\n1122\n00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,302\nand then I just go to the interface.\n\n1123\n00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,570\nAnd, on the interface, Remember I said\n\n1124\n00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,750\nyou can only have one\naccess list per direction?\n\n1125\n00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,160\nSo I've all ready got\naccess-list 1 going out.\n\n1126\n00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,830\nWhen I say, access-group 2 out, that\none is going to replace the first one.\n\n1127\n00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,010\nAnd when I do that,\nthe newest takes effect.\n\n1128\n00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,865\nAnd see how no pings got through?\n\n1129\n00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:28,920\nSo in a high security environment,\nthis is what you wanna do.\n\n1130\n00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,980\nCreate a new ACL and\nthen just change it on the interface.\n\n1131\n00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,030\nIn a low security environment, you can\njust blow away the old and put in the new,\n\n1132\n00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:42,630\nand it normally happens so\nfast that it's not even noticed.\n\n1133\n00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,290\nSo if I change this now to be 2,\n\n1134\n00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,650\nso we remove the list, and\nthen we replace it like this.\n\n1135\n00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,490\nWhen I cut and paste it'll happen so\nfast I doubt any pings will get through.\n\n1136\n00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,861\nLet's just test.\n\n1137\n00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:56,480\nThere we go.\n\n1138\n00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,890\nSo yeah, no pings made it through.\n\n1139\n00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,640\nBut if you're dealing with national\nsecurity, if this is a massive ACL or\n\n1140\n01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,390\nwhatever, you don't want\nit to apply partially,\n\n1141\n01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,520\nyou want it to apply fully, right.\n\n1142\n01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,240\nAnd so, don't just delete an existing ACL,\ncreate a new one and\n\n1143\n01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,140\nthen swap them on the interface.\n\n1144\n01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:12,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep.\n\n1145\n01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,190\nAll right, so\nstandard ACL's really cut and dry, right.\n\n1146\n01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:21,330\nLet's summarize that syntax one\nlast time before we move on, right.\n\n1147\n01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,486\nSo the syntax for that for a standard ACL,\n\n1148\n01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:35,165\nWas acces-list followed by a number,\nand that number was what,\n\n1149\n01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:40,116\n1-99, 1300-1799, right?\n\n1150\n01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:41,510\n>> 1699.\n>> 1699, shoot, there we go, all right.\n\n1151\n01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,157\nA number, and\nthen basically permit or deny.\n\n1152\n01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:55,363\nAnd then we have to do our SRC IP and\n\n1153\n01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:59,408\nwildcard Mask, right.\n\n1154\n01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:02,620\n>> Yeah, now remember that\nthe wildcard Mask here is important.\n\n1155\n01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,303\nIf you accidentally type in a subnet mask,\nthinking that it's gonna work,\n\n1156\n01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:09,690\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n1157\n01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,390\nSo make sure you do make sure again.\n\n1158\n01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,485\nVerify that you actually did\nmake the wildcard Mask in there.\n\n1159\n01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:16,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n1160\n01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,706\n>> Yeah, it really does matter.\n\n1161\n01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,962\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you do a subnet mask, right,\n\n1162\n01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:25,440\nso if I were to write this as\naccess-list 1 permit 192.168.0.1,\n\n1163\n01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,600\nmaybe I'm trying to allow\nthat whole network, right.\n\n1164\n01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,610\nAnd, I put in the subnet mask,\nwhat am I actually saying?\n\n1165\n01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,825\nI'm saying the first three octets\ncan be whatever they want, and\n\n1166\n01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:38,239\nthe last octet has to match.\n\n1167\n01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:39,309\nIn this case the last octet-\n>> Zero.\n\n1168\n01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:40,093\n[LAUGH]\n>> Would have to be zero,\n\n1169\n01:01:40,093 --> 01:01:40,909\nwhich it never would be.\n\n1170\n01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:41,413\n>> Right.\n\n1171\n01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:44,715\n>> And so,\nthis would effectively not work.\n\n1172\n01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:46,025\n>> Yeah.\n\n1173\n01:01:46,025 --> 01:01:49,125\nSo make sure you pay attention,\nespecially when you're typing this in.\n\n1174\n01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:52,895\nSo that's why it's always better to\nactually type it out on paper or to write\n\n1175\n01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:58,135\nit out and make sure that the logic makes\nsense, make sure the syntax is correct.\n\n1176\n01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:01,575\nAnd then if you're doing it in\nNotepad you simply copy it, and\n\n1177\n01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:03,950\nthen you can paste it right in and\nsee how it works.\n\n1178\n01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Better way to do it.\n\n1179\n01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,465\n>> Now standard ACLs are cool\nbecause they're extremely efficient.\n\n1180\n01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:11,810\nYour router is already looking\nat the layer 3 addresses.\n\n1181\n01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,120\nAnd so being able to look at that source\ndoesn't really require the router to do\n\n1182\n01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,430\nanything it wasn't doing already.\n\n1183\n01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,530\nSo extremely efficient,\ndoesn't create much burden on your router.\n\n1184\n01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,360\nIt does create a little, but not much.\n\n1185\n01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,810\nOn any Cisco router with four\ndigits in the model number,\n\n1186\n01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:26,300\nit'll be able to handle it just fine.\n\n1187\n01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,510\nSo not a big deal there.\n\n1188\n01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,110\nBut they're not very flexible.\n\n1189\n01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,010\n>> No.\n>> Right?\n\n1190\n01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,102\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm filtering on my whole machine,\n\n1191\n01:02:32,102 --> 01:02:33,405\nright, or this whole IP.\n\n1192\n01:02:33,405 --> 01:02:37,295\nWhen I block my laptop,\nI block the whole dadgummed thing.\n\n1193\n01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,485\nI can't pick particular destinations or\n\n1194\n01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:43,525\nparticular protocols,\nit's just the whole thing, right.\n\n1195\n01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,920\nSo, if that's what you want,\ngreat, standard ACLs are perfect.\n\n1196\n01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,630\nBut if you wanna get very specific, if you\nwanna block based on protocols, Telnet,\n\n1197\n01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,790\nHTTP, HTTPS, whatever,\nif you wanna block based on destination,\n\n1198\n01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:58,880\nblock Don when he goes to Instagram but\nnot when he goes to Google, right?\n\n1199\n01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,210\nIf you wanna do stuff like that, we're\ngonna have to step up to the big leagues,\n\n1200\n01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,740\nand go with extended ACLs.\n\n1201\n01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,730\n>> Yeah, and the extended ACLs are where\nwe get very granule like we said.\n\n1202\n01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,640\nIf we want to,\nwe again are simply saying, hey,\n\n1203\n01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,830\nit's not that we need to block\nDon's computer from everything.\n\n1204\n01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,560\nIt's that we need to block\nspecific things here, and\n\n1205\n01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,180\nthis gives us that control\nthat we actually need.\n\n1206\n01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,480\n>> Now,\nit does add in a layer of complexity,\n\n1207\n01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,060\nbecause we add in much\nmore syntax to this.\n\n1208\n01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,920\nWe still have to pay attention to\nthe order in which those statements\n\n1209\n01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,290\nare actually put in there.\n\n1210\n01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,813\nWe still have to actually remember\nthe standard rules as well,\n\n1211\n01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:37,349\nmaking sure that we have at least\none permit statement as well.\n\n1212\n01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:39,741\nSo we'll actually see that pretty soon.\n\n1213\n01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,743\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, we're running up on break time,\n\n1214\n01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:46,027\nso With great power comes\ngreat responsibility, right.\n\n1215\n01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:46,550\nSo extended ACLs, they're long.\nAnd\n\n1216\n01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,940\nsome of the longest syntax that\nyou'll use in a Cisco router,\n\n1217\n01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,910\nwith the exception of NAT.\n\n1218\n01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,750\nBut yeah, so they can be a little complex.\n\n1219\n01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,010\nMakes them challenging on the exam.\n\n1220\n01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,610\n>> Right.\n>> So we've got to make sure were\n\n1221\n01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,140\nfamiliar with that.\n\n1222\n01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:02,270\nSo, let's do this, let's stop here and\ntake a break, and when we get back we'll\n\n1223\n01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:06,170\njump into extended ACLs and get a chance\nto see the real power of these things.\n\n1224\n01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:06,710\n>> All right.\n\n1225\n01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,470\n>> Sound good?\n\n1226\n01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,280\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1227\n01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,605\n>> All right.\nWe'll see you guys back in a few minutes.\n\n1228\n01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:16,330\n[SOUND]\n\n1229\n01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,410\n[MUSIC]\n\n1230\n01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:19,390\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1231\n01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,750\nSo what we wanna do now,\nis we wanna take a look at a extended ACL,\n\n1232\n01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,440\nwhich as the name implies,\nit extends what we do.\n\n1233\n01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,170\nWith an extended ACL,\nnot only can we look at source IPs but\n\n1234\n01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,815\nwe can also look at destination IPs.\n\n1235\n01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:34,942\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which makes them a lot more powerful.\n\n1236\n01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:38,790\nAnd, again your router's already looking\nat source and destination IP, anyway.\n\n1237\n01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,770\nSo it's got a good idea\nof what's going on.\n\n1238\n01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,645\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n1239\n01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1240\n01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,730\n>> But\nextended ACLs also go a step further, and\n\n1241\n01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,670\nallow us to filter based on protocol.\n\n1242\n01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,205\nAnd that's when things get really crazy.\n\n1243\n01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:49,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1244\n01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,340\nit does start to impact\nthe router a little more.\n\n1245\n01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,720\nSo you wanna use these sparingly,\nif you have to, the device is there,\n\n1246\n01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,470\nyou probably have the resources on your\nrouter to handle it so have at it.\n\n1247\n01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,610\nBut just be aware that\nif you do it too much,\n\n1248\n01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,920\nif you have thousands of these ACLs and\nthey're all very specific and\n\n1249\n01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,030\ncrazily written, then you can end up\nhurting the performance on your router.\n\n1250\n01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,890\nA firewall is better at it.\n\n1251\n01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,320\nThey're specifically designed for\nit, so if you find a need for\n\n1252\n01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,470\nthat, putting in a lot\nof protocol filtering,\n\n1253\n01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:25,130\nyou're better off putting in a firewall\nto do it, but if you just need it to.\n\n1254\n01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:25,830\n>> Just a couple.\n\n1255\n01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,190\n>> Yeah, less than, I don't know,\na hundred entries or so,\n\n1256\n01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,220\nthe feel free to throw it right there in\nyour router, your router can handle it.\n\n1257\n01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,560\n>> Yeah, with the extended ACLs.\n\n1258\n01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,430\nFor us.\n\n1259\n01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,260\nWe are now going into those\nspecific needs again, like we said.\n\n1260\n01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:45,550\nWhere we have to filter traffic\nfrom going one particular place or\n\n1261\n01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,230\njust this particular protocol.\n\n1262\n01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,450\nWe want to make sure that\nwe can do that without\n\n1263\n01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,930\ncutting off everything at one time.\n\n1264\n01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,520\nSo, that's what we\nactually have to get into.\n\n1265\n01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,610\nNow with the extended ACL's\nhere the neat thing is\n\n1266\n01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:03,870\nbecause we already understand the standard\nACL's it really does help us.\n\n1267\n01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,300\nAt least in learning the syntax\nat the beginning here.\n\n1268\n01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,005\nBut we're gonna see that there's\nmore complex syntax in involved, but\n\n1269\n01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:11,585\nthe good thing is, even after that,\n\n1270\n01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:15,295\nthough, we still have to also apply it\nto the interface and the direction.\n\n1271\n01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:17,275\nAnd that shouldn't actually change for us.\n\n1272\n01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:19,595\nSo we only have to change\na part of what we're doing.\n\n1273\n01:06:19,595 --> 01:06:21,745\n>> Yeah.\nSo let's take a look at my laptop,\n\n1274\n01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:25,010\nand I've got two different pings\nrunning right now on my screen.\n\n1275\n01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:29,710\nSo I'm pinging 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2, both\nDNS servers out there on the internet.\n\n1276\n01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:36,940\nMaybe I wanna block my laptop getting\nto one of the IP's but not the other.\n\n1277\n01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,110\nI can't do that with a standard\nACL because standard ACL's only\n\n1278\n01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:40,920\nlook at the source.\n\n1279\n01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,750\nThey would see my laptop.\n\n1280\n01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,510\nThey don't look at the destination.\n\n1281\n01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:47,850\nBut with an extended ACL,\nI can do a destination, right.\n\n1282\n01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,580\nSo now I can say, I just want to\nblock you when you go to 4.2.2.2 but\n\n1283\n01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,940\nnot to .1.1 is okay.\n\n1284\n01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:57,150\nSo now we can get really specific,\nand write that list.\n\n1285\n01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:03,030\nThe way we do it is similar to a standard\nACL, we write access dash list and\n\n1286\n01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:08,150\nthen specify whether we\nare what our number is, and\n\n1287\n01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,990\ninstead of one to 99 we need\nto step up to the next range.\n\n1288\n01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,310\nSo I'll do 100.\n\n1289\n01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:18,780\nSo access list 100 and\n\n1290\n01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,970\nnow we need to say basically whether\nwe're permitting or denying.\n\n1291\n01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:27,430\nI'm going to deny me getting\nto the .2 DNS server.\n\n1292\n01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:31,380\nHere's where things get a little strange,\nwe do have to specify a protocol.\n\n1293\n01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,800\nIf it's TCP or UDP or if you wanna do\nthem all, you can specify IP, right?\n\n1294\n01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,870\nIf I do a question mark there,\nit shows the ones that it supports.\n\n1295\n01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,050\nIP, ICMP, and so on.\n\n1296\n01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,860\nTechnically, these are pings, so\nI could be really specific and\n\n1297\n01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:50,740\ngo into ICMP it's up to me how\nI want to do it, and in fact\n\n1298\n01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:54,600\nsince we are doing things it's probably\nnot a bad idea to go ahead and do it.\n\n1299\n01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,190\nSo then we specify the source and\nthe destination of the traffic.\n\n1300\n01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,690\nNow the source is me and I'm\n192.168.0.222, and there's my wild card\n\n1301\n01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,730\nmask saying all the bits have to match.\n\n1302\n01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,480\nAnd now the destination 4.2.2.2,\n\n1303\n01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,900\nand I want to say that all\nthose bits have to match.\n\n1304\n01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:20,340\nSo I'm saying block any\nICMP traffic coming from\n\n1305\n01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:25,080\nDon's laptop going 24.2.2.2.2.\n\n1306\n01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,000\nAnd then if I want to\npermit everything else\n\n1307\n01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,670\nI can permit ICMP from any\nhost to any destination.\n\n1308\n01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,470\nSo I miss all that traffic.\n\n1309\n01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:39,990\nAnd I probably need to go ahead and\n\n1310\n01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:44,440\npermit IP traffic from any\nhost to any destination.\n\n1311\n01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,760\nAlso if I leave that off,\nit's going get blocked.\n\n1312\n01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,640\nIPU would be the TCP and UDP traffic.\n\n1313\n01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:51,780\nAll right.\n\n1314\n01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:55,800\nYou will notice my pings are still running\ncuz I haven't attached this access list.\n\n1315\n01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,560\nSo I am going to go ahead and\nattach it now.\n\n1316\n01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,350\nBefore I didn't want to attach it the\ninside interface because I didn't want to\n\n1317\n01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,700\nlock myself out.\n\n1318\n01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,590\nNow I don't have to worry about it,\nbecause I'm just blocking specific\n\n1319\n01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,600\ntraffic, so I can attach this\nto the internal interface and\n\n1320\n01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,270\nnot run the risk of locking myself out.\n\n1321\n01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,854\nSo I'm gonna get into interface GI0/1.\n\n1322\n01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,930\nAnd I will attach that as an incoming ACL.\n\n1323\n01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:22,600\nI'm gonna filter that traffic as soon as\nit comes into the router so I don't have\n\n1324\n01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,800\nto waste time routing it and passing\nit over to other interfaces and so on.\n\n1325\n01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,658\nAnd when I run that,\nsure enough I can see my ping to\n\n1326\n01:09:31,658 --> 01:09:37,550\n4.2.2.2 has stopped but\nmy ping to 4.2.2.1 is still going.\n\n1327\n01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,810\nNow I can discriminate\nbetween the traffic.\n\n1328\n01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n1329\n01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,800\nAnd the verification is still the same,\nright?\n\n1330\n01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,170\nWe simply go ahead and\nrun our show, access dash list, so\n\n1331\n01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:50,200\nwe're gonna use the do show,\nand there it is,\n\n1332\n01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,670\nwe start seeing the one at the end there,\nor extended IP access.\n\n1333\n01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:56,170\nAccess list and\nyou start seeing the matches that go on.\n\n1334\n01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,530\nAnd you start seeing it.\n\n1335\n01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:01,239\nIt looks like we're actually\ndoing more than just pings there.\n\n1336\n01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,330\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm running Windows and so\n\n1337\n01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:07,530\nWindows is probably checking for\nupdates or doing all the crazy things that\n\n1338\n01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:11,920\nit does in addition to the pings\n>> I've got matches for\n\n1339\n01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,910\nthe permit line,\nthose are my pings to 4.2.2.1,\n\n1340\n01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,210\nand I've got matches on my deny line,\nthose are 4.2.2.2.\n\n1341\n01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:25,500\nSo how do I actually know that those\nare mine that are triggering it.\n\n1342\n01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,190\nWell it can be hard to tell from here, so\n\n1343\n01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:32,150\nthere's a neat little option we can\nenable that allows us to do logging.\n\n1344\n01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,350\n>> So I'm gonna repeat that same process.\n\n1345\n01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,250\nBut this time, what I'm gonna do\nis I'll create access list 101.\n\n1346\n01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,090\nAnd at the end of the line here for\nmy deny,\n\n1347\n01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:46,900\nI'm gonna add the key word log,\nif I can spell it.\n\n1348\n01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,530\nThere we go, log.\n\n1349\n01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,180\nAll right?\n\n1350\n01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,690\nAnd then the other lines,\nI'll just leave the same.\n\n1351\n01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,040\nLet's see, it was this one.\n\n1352\n01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,020\nAnd the any any, there.\n\n1353\n01:11:06,193 --> 01:11:09,880\nAll right, so here's the access list 100.\n\n1354\n01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,400\nRight here.\n\n1355\n01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,540\nThen, access list 101.\n\n1356\n01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:19,610\nThe only thing I changed was to add the\nlog keyword at the end of that first line.\n\n1357\n01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,510\nSo I've got that log entry.\n\n1358\n01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:28,960\nWhat I can do is I can say\nthe terminal monitor command.\n\n1359\n01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,720\nRemember that'll make it where I\ncan see log messages on my screen.\n\n1360\n01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:40,433\nAnd now I'll just change that out for\naccess list 101.\n\n1361\n01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:43,490\nAnd now it's gonna start\nlogging that traffic.\n\n1362\n01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:47,414\nThe cool thing about the log\nis I can see the source.\n\n1363\n01:11:47,414 --> 01:11:50,549\nAnd the destination I can\nactually see the information.\n\n1364\n01:11:50,549 --> 01:11:55,500\nAccess list 101 kicked in the source\nwas 192.168.0.222 the destination\n\n1365\n01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,398\nwas 4.2.2.2, all right.\n\n1366\n01:11:57,398 --> 01:12:00,655\nNow I'm sending more than\njust one ping down here but\n\n1367\n01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:05,190\nnotice how I'm not getting overwhelmed\nwith log messages, all right?\n\n1368\n01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,231\nThat's because it is doing suppression to\nmake sure your screen doesn't get overrun.\n\n1369\n01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:11,070\nOtherwise, you just have a flood of stuff.\n\n1370\n01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,030\nSometimes that works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n1371\n01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,240\nIf you're gonna be doing\nterminal monitor like this.\n\n1372\n01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,530\nWell, it's turned off with SSH and Telnet.\n\n1373\n01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,810\nBecause they don't want you\nto overload your session.\n\n1374\n01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> With a console cable,\n\n1375\n01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,890\nit's just turned on by default.\n\n1376\n01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:26,370\nEven if you don't turn it on,\nyou can always do a show log, and\n\n1377\n01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,950\nit makes it there into the log\nif you have logging turned on.\n\n1378\n01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:37,900\nWhich apparently we don't,\nLet's see, so when you hit turn on.\n\n1379\n01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:44,100\nLogging buffer 6, and\nwe need to set some memory for it.\n\n1380\n01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:44,731\nThere we go.\n\n1381\n01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:50,820\nAnd now if I just wait.\n\n1382\n01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,540\nIt will start to log some more and\n\n1383\n01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,356\nwe'll be able to see that\ntraffic being generated.\n\n1384\n01:12:55,356 --> 01:12:58,684\nBut anyhow it is going to pop up on the\nscreen, you'll see those getting blocked\n\n1385\n01:12:58,684 --> 01:13:01,731\nand that is how you can verify who it\nis that's generating that traffic.\n\n1386\n01:13:03,524 --> 01:13:05,290\n84 matches now, it's creeping up there.\n\n1387\n01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,570\n>> Yep.\n\n1388\n01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:10,050\nNow, every list that we've created so\nfar has been relatively short,\n\n1389\n01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:13,860\nwhich is perfectly fine, but remember that\nsometimes you're gonna actually have it\n\n1390\n01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,730\nwhere all the sudden one week they're\nsaying, hey, this is what we need to\n\n1391\n01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,800\nblock to this place, and then the\nfollowing, this is what we need to block,\n\n1392\n01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,690\nand other weeks it actually continues\nto add and continues to grow.\n\n1393\n01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:28,060\nWell it's going to be very important\nthen as we start creating these\n\n1394\n01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,720\naccess control lists, whether they're\nstandard or the extended, that we\n\n1395\n01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,820\nunderstand that we have to put things in\na certain order or they may not work.\n\n1396\n01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:40,480\nWe always know, at least so far, we\nhadn't really had that much of a problem.\n\n1397\n01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,090\nBut there's a particular\nprinciple that we talk about here\n\n1398\n01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:48,030\nin terms of the order that we actually\nneed to place these things in, right, Don?\n\n1399\n01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,717\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1400\n01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,385\n>> I can't say it, specificity.\n\n1401\n01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Specificity.\n\n1402\n01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,760\nSo, you know, when you write these rules,\nsome of them are very,\n\n1403\n01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,730\nvery specific like that\nfirst entry that I did.\n\n1404\n01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:03,380\nPing traffic from Don to this one IP,\nthat is very specific.\n\n1405\n01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,130\nThose you generally want\nat the top of the list and\n\n1406\n01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,250\nthen we had some really general ones\nlike the permit everything else.\n\n1407\n01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,660\nThose you generally want at\nthe bottom of the list and\n\n1408\n01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,790\nit's all just about that\norder of precedence.\n\n1409\n01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,610\nIf you have a really broad rule\nat the top, the a lot of people\n\n1410\n01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,530\nare gonna match it and they'll never get\nto the specific rules at the bottom.\n\n1411\n01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:23,470\nSo that's normally how you'll kinda\nshuffle those list entries around.\n\n1412\n01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:28,100\n>> And we just have to remember that\nbecause if we do create a list and\n\n1413\n01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,620\nall of the sudden things aren't\napplying the way you want to check.\n\n1414\n01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,550\nThat's one of the places you might want to\ncheck and verify that a more general rule\n\n1415\n01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,990\nisn't already going ahead and filtering\nout a more specific rule or vice versa.\n\n1416\n01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,450\nIt shouldn't actually\nhappen the other way.\n\n1417\n01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,410\nBut sometimes, you may actually realize\nthat something is getting blocked even\n\n1418\n01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,210\nthough you specifically allowed for\nit to actually come through.\n\n1419\n01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:52,880\nBecause that general rule got placed above\nthat more specific rule that you had.\n\n1420\n01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,639\nThat's actually very important for\nus to actually remember when we do this.\n\n1421\n01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,290\n>> All right so\ntalking about the extended access list.\n\n1422\n01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:05,480\nWhat we have done so\nfar is really filtering based on IP but\n\n1423\n01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,590\nwhere it gets to be fun is when we start\nfiltering with things other than that.\n\n1424\n01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,410\nAnd I'm take our big switch here and\n\n1425\n01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:16,870\nchange it a little bit\nto weaken it's security.\n\n1426\n01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,320\nWhich I probably shouldn't do.\n\n1427\n01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,170\nLing it's a new ling interface.\n\n1428\n01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,830\nI've got it set where we only allow SSH,\nright?\n\n1429\n01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:27,970\nOn our production equipment,\nthat's normally what we want.\n\n1430\n01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:32,000\nI'm gonna enable Telnet on it though and,\nyou almost hate to do that.\n\n1431\n01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,970\nBut I am and I don't have Telnet installed\non this machine, so I'll have to add it.\n\n1432\n01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,310\nBut what I want to show is that I can\n\n1433\n01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:43,420\nfilter based on that\nspecific protocol too.\n\n1434\n01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,540\nSo, that switch that I was just\nmessing with, it's 10.1.10.1, right.\n\n1435\n01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,060\nSo I'm pinging that, right?\n\n1436\n01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:53,000\nI have to go through the router to\nget to it and I am able to ping it.\n\n1437\n01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,550\nIf I open up another PuTTY window here and\nI try and tail net to it.\n\n1438\n01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:02,310\nIf I try and tell net to,\nif I can type 10.1.10.1.\n\n1439\n01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:07,270\nWhen I tell net I now get a log in screen,\nI can try and log into the system.\n\n1440\n01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:10,350\nThe problem here is,\nTelnet is not secure, right?\n\n1441\n01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:14,220\nThat traffic is going in\nplain text over the network.\n\n1442\n01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,590\nSo, what I do is,\nI just disable Telnet on the switch.\n\n1443\n01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,720\nWhy worry about controlling it?\n\n1444\n01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,900\nJust turn it off and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n1445\n01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,110\nBut what if we have a device\nwhere you can't turn it off.\n\n1446\n01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:27,000\nWhat if Telnet is forced on,\nI've had a number of\n\n1447\n01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,280\nprinters that stupid Telnet services and\nyou couldn't turn them off, right?\n\n1448\n01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,960\nInstead, we can use our router to block\nthat so maybe I specifically want to block\n\n1449\n01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,110\nthat Telnet access but\nI want to allow everything else.\n\n1450\n01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:46,390\nSo we can start to craft an ACL\nthat's an extended ACL that\n\n1451\n01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,640\ngoes beyond just IPs and\nalso looks at ports.\n\n1452\n01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,010\nSo let's do another one here.\n\n1453\n01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:56,020\nWe'll say access-list 102, and\n\n1454\n01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:00,910\nI'm gonna start by\ndenying some tcp traffic.\n\n1455\n01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,680\nRemember, it was one of our earlier shows,\nwhen we listed a bunch of protocols and\n\n1456\n01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,790\ntheir port numbers,\nyou were like why do I need to know those?\n\n1457\n01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,800\nWell, here's why we need them.\n\n1458\n01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:17,560\nSo I need to know that telnet uses\nTCP port 23 if I want to filter it.\n\n1459\n01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,256\nSo I'm going to deny TCP 23,\nwell the 23 comes up here in a minute,\n\n1460\n01:17:22,256 --> 01:17:29,200\ndeny TCP from, you know I stopped that\nping and its just now warning me about it.\n\n1461\n01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:34,360\nBut anyhow, so I'm going to deny TCP, and\nI'm going to say that its from my laptop.\n\n1462\n01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:40,360\nSo I'll deny it from host 192.168.0.222,\nand then I need to\n\n1463\n01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,370\nspecify the destination,\nwhich is gonna be host 10.1.10.1.\n\n1464\n01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:52,870\nAll right, now if I stop right here,\nthat's gonna deny all TCP traffic.\n\n1465\n01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:57,210\nBut after each host, there's actually\na little bit more you can specify.\n\n1466\n01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:02,040\nThere's, well there's actually a bunch,\nbut the ones that we care about,\n\n1467\n01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,600\nEQ, LT, GT, and range.\n\n1468\n01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:11,180\nThat's equals, less than, greater than,\nor a range of port numbers.\n\n1469\n01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,700\nAnd I wanna say eq 23.\n\n1470\n01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:19,860\nIf I try and get to that host and\nmy destination port number equals 23.\n\n1471\n01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,850\nSo TCP traffic on port\n23 I wanna deny it but\n\n1472\n01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:31,060\neverything else I want to allow and if it\nwas filtering the traffic on the way back,\n\n1473\n01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:34,130\nthen the response from the server,\nthe source, would be EQ23.\n\n1474\n01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,570\nAnd so, I would put it right in\nthe middle instead of at the end, right?\n\n1475\n01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,800\nSo at the end here,\nthis is our destination.\n\n1476\n01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,900\nHere's our source.\n\n1477\n01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,148\nSo they can have port numbers but your\nsource is normally randomly generated.\n\n1478\n01:18:46,148 --> 01:18:51,183\nA number between 1 and 65,535 or\nit's supposed to be 49,000 and\n\n1479\n01:18:51,183 --> 01:18:54,370\nsomething and higher but\nyou never really know.\n\n1480\n01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,950\nSo we'll go ahead and punch in a permit.\n\n1481\n01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,480\nTo allow that and\n\n1482\n01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,830\nbecause icmp is a different protocol,\nI'll go ahead and add that one, too.\n\n1483\n01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,370\nAll right?\n\n1484\n01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:12,120\nSo this first line, super specific, right?\n\n1485\n01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,140\nThat specificity that Ronnie was talking\nabout, if that's the right word.\n\n1486\n01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,570\n[LAUGH] is at the top and then they get\nmore general down towards the bottom.\n\n1487\n01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:22,340\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's gonna be important for\n\n1488\n01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,800\nus, like we said.\n\n1489\n01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,400\nSometimes, remember, a deny that actually\nis supposed to go on later on here.\n\n1490\n01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,690\nEven though you specifically\nallow that statement,\n\n1491\n01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:34,930\nif it comes after a general deny,\nyou're gonna have a problem.\n\n1492\n01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:36,400\nYep.\n\n1493\n01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,380\n>> And now I can see that I am\nstill able to ping 10.1.10.1.\n\n1494\n01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,519\nI'm pinging it just fine, right?\n\n1495\n01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:45,187\nI can see my little times\nare moving up here,\n\n1496\n01:19:45,187 --> 01:19:47,048\nthat's how I know it's incrementing,\nright?\n\n1497\n01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,748\nBut if I fire up my PuTTY window again And\nI try and telnet,\n\n1498\n01:19:50,748 --> 01:19:54,080\nwhich I was able to do\njust a few moments ago.\n\n1499\n01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,090\nWhen I try and telnet to that, before\n\n1500\n01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:02,640\nI got my prompt asking for a user name,\nnow it's just sitting here.\n\n1501\n01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,270\nI'm trying to connect to that router,\nthat switch and I'm not getting into it.\n\n1502\n01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:09,100\nIt's being filtered, and\nI didn't do a log command.\n\n1503\n01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,210\nI should have, but\nif I do a do show access-list 102,\n\n1504\n01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,630\nI should see some matches.\n\n1505\n01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,310\nAnd there's 3 matches on that Telnet rule.\n\n1506\n01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,140\nRight?\n\n1507\n01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,570\nWhen we do filtering like this,\nour router is acting like a firewall.\n\n1508\n01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:28,500\nIt's filtering certain traffic and\nallowing other traffic through.\n\n1509\n01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:34,240\nNow one word of caution, after watching\nthat you might say you know what?\n\n1510\n01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,860\nThat's pretty cool,\nmaybe I will use a router as a firewall.\n\n1511\n01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,230\nAll right,\nlet me tell you why it's a bad idea.\n\n1512\n01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,330\nMost firewalls are what\nare called stateful firewalls.\n\n1513\n01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,730\nAnd what that means,\nif I go back to my silly diagram,\n\n1514\n01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:53,400\nis that when we see traffic going\nout the router, so my traffic.\n\n1515\n01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,760\nStarts here and it heads out the router.\n\n1516\n01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,710\nI might have an access list that\nallows that traffic or blocks it or\n\n1517\n01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:01,020\nwhatever, right.\n\n1518\n01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,120\nBut what about the return trip?\n\n1519\n01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,050\nThe traffic goes out to the internet and\nit starts to come back in, right.\n\n1520\n01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:12,190\nThat return trip,\nif I have a stateful firewall, it says\n\n1521\n01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:17,130\nhey if I allow the traffic to go out I\nshould allow the response to come back in.\n\n1522\n01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,780\nIt knows that,\n\n1523\n01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:21,820\nit's smart enough to know to allow\nthe return traffic to come back in.\n\n1524\n01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,080\nYour router isn't.\n\n1525\n01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:27,880\nThe access control lists that\nwe write are not stateful.\n\n1526\n01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,360\nJust because you allow something out\n\n1527\n01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,620\ndoesn't mean that it's\nnecessarily allowed back in.\n\n1528\n01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,340\nAnd so,\n\n1529\n01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:38,410\nif you're filtering both directions,\nyou'll have to double your rules.\n\n1530\n01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:40,560\nFor every outgoing rule,\n\n1531\n01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,260\nyou'll have to write an incoming\nrule to allow them to come through.\n\n1532\n01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,580\nIf you're filtering both directions.\n\n1533\n01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,070\nMost people only filter incoming.\n\n1534\n01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,290\nThey never filter outgoing.\n\n1535\n01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,670\nAnd so it's not a big deal.\n\n1536\n01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,320\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> But if you filter both directions,\n\n1537\n01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,010\nyou will have to double up your rules.\n\n1538\n01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,200\nOn a firewall,\na staple firewall, you won't.\n\n1539\n01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,240\nIt's automatic.\n\n1540\n01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,690\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1541\n01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:57,310\n>> All right.\nI know.\n\n1542\n01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,280\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> I've bumped into that before.\n\n1543\n01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,990\nIt is an issue with ACLs.\n\n1544\n01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,860\n>> Yep.\n>> And that's where the Cisco\n\n1545\n01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,240\nfirewall feature set comes in.\n\n1546\n01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:04,890\n>> Right.\n\n1547\n01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,300\n>> You can pay a little extra.\n\n1548\n01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,500\nAnd bump up to a higher\nfeature set on your router and\n\n1549\n01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,260\nit creates the ability to\ndo stateful firewalls.\n\n1550\n01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,510\nReally cool.\n\n1551\n01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:18,610\nAnd we do that in the IINS\nshow not on the CCNA.\n\n1552\n01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:24,120\nBut the thing about the staple filter,\nthe firewall feature set on a router when\n\n1553\n01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:29,200\nyou buy a Cisco ASA, when you buy that\nhardware firewall, it has, I don't know\n\n1554\n01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,160\nhow specific I want to get here, asics,\napplication specific integrated circuits.\n\n1555\n01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:37,300\nIt's got circuitry on the motherboard\nspecifically designed for\n\n1556\n01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,090\nprotocol filtering.\n\n1557\n01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,300\n>> That's it.\n\n1558\n01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,160\n>> On your router, you don't.\n\n1559\n01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,850\nOn your router it's just using\nthe general CPU in the system and\n\n1560\n01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:46,310\nit's not optimized for that.\n\n1561\n01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:49,670\nSo your router cannot do as\ngood a job as a firewall.\n\n1562\n01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:53,250\nSo if this is something you depend on buy\na firewall, don't do it on the router.\n\n1563\n01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,160\n>> Great for a basic.\n\n1564\n01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,990\n>> Security for us, basic filtering,\nand later on we're going to see\n\n1565\n01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:04,400\nmore classification when we get into our\nshow on network address translation.\n\n1566\n01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,330\nBut for us here, standard and\n\n1567\n01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:09,500\nextended access control lists\nare really where the keys go.\n\n1568\n01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,410\nNow everything that we've\ndone to this point,\n\n1569\n01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,430\nwe've talked about the idea of numbers.\n\n1570\n01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,800\nRight, of having those numbers.\n\n1571\n01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,200\nStandard access control lists?\n\n1572\n01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,104\nNumbers from 1 through 99 and\nthen 1,300 through 1,999.\n\n1573\n01:23:22,104 --> 01:23:27,480\nAnd then extended access control\nlists begin at 100 going through 199.\n\n1574\n01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,050\nAnd then the next set actually begins\nat 2,000 through 2,699 as well.\n\n1575\n01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,870\nNow, there is something\nelse we can do though.\n\n1576\n01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:39,900\nDon, I've heard about extended access\ncontrol lists here, I understand that,\n\n1577\n01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,540\nbut is there a reason if I\nknow what those numbers are,\n\n1578\n01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,600\nthat I should use what we call\nnamed access control list?\n\n1579\n01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,490\n>> There is.\n\n1580\n01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,450\nAnd I wanna get into that.\n\n1581\n01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:52,510\nWe will really have enough\ntime before the last break.\n\n1582\n01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:53,240\nLet's do this,\n\n1583\n01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,500\nbecause we got a little more time before\nwe jump into all that good stuff.\n\n1584\n01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:02,560\nLet's see a few more examples of extended\nACLs, and then we'll jump into those.\n\n1585\n01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,830\nSo I showed you guys basically just\none example of an extended ACL.\n\n1586\n01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:09,570\nI wanna show you guys some other\nvariations that we can do, just so\n\n1587\n01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:11,470\nyou have an idea of how these work.\n\n1588\n01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:15,570\nAnd so I'm gonna create a new,\nI'll just do access list 150,\n\n1589\n01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:19,640\nand just show you a few more scenarios.\n\n1590\n01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,270\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n1591\n01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:23,690\n>> So\nat beginning of the show I mentioned.\n\n1592\n01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:27,120\n>> For example that we might wanna\nblock Ronnie from getting to Instagram.\n\n1593\n01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,180\nAnd so Instagram they have a website so\nit's likely on port 80.\n\n1594\n01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:39,080\nAnd so I can come in and\nI can say access-list 150 deny tcp.\n\n1595\n01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:43,870\nBecause http is tcp port 80 And\nthen for the host,\n\n1596\n01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,730\nI could specify Ronnie's machine, right?\n\n1597\n01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:50,387\nWhich, you know,\nmaybe it's 192.169.0.200, right?\n\n1598\n01:24:50,387 --> 01:24:50,907\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n1599\n01:24:50,907 --> 01:24:54,460\n>> And then, for the destination,\nI would put in Instagram.\n\n1600\n01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,850\nNow, I don't really know Instagram's,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1601\n01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,170\n>> IP.\nAnd so we might be able to look it up,\n\n1602\n01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:04,040\noccasionally you can type in\nthe host name like that, and\n\n1603\n01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,630\nthe router will do the look up for\nyou and put it in by IP in the system.\n\n1604\n01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:11,880\nNow the reason I say occasionally,\na service like Instagram,\n\n1605\n01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,940\nwell first off I guess I have to spell\nit right and then the second thing is,\n\n1606\n01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,890\nthey probably have more than one IP,\nand if they have more than one IP,\n\n1607\n01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:20,530\nthen you can't do it this way,\nso it may crap out on me.\n\n1608\n01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,730\nWe'll see.\n\n1609\n01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:26,010\nAnd then we can say,\nwhen that equals port 80.\n\n1610\n01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:30,230\nNow, there are some shortcuts that\nare stored inside of the router.\n\n1611\n01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:32,480\nIf you do a question mark there,\nyou'll see them.\n\n1612\n01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,030\nI don't like to use these, because some\nrouters have the shortcuts, some don't,\n\n1613\n01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,870\nand a lot of them don't make sense.\n\n1614\n01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:42,560\nSo web traffic is actually www,\nnot HTTP, like it should be.\n\n1615\n01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,310\nSo if you remember that, great.\n\n1616\n01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,490\nI never do, so I always end up typing 80.\n\n1617\n01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,010\nIt'll change it in the config anyway.\n\n1618\n01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:52,985\nNow, when I run that,\nsee how it just tried to do a lookup for\n\n1619\n01:25:52,985 --> 01:25:55,010\nwww.instagram.com?\n\n1620\n01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:57,970\nSo it's gonna try and look up and\nfigure out what that IP is.\n\n1621\n01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,480\nAnd let's see if it actually go it.\n\n1622\n01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:04,470\nI'm just gonna pull up\nthat access-list 150.\n\n1623\n01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,230\nAnd, oh, it did.\n\n1624\n01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,110\nAll right, so 50.19.98.18.\n\n1625\n01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:13,460\nWe do just need to be careful,\nthough, cuz there might be more than\n\n1626\n01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:16,390\none IP address for that host, and\nI need to do more than one line.\n\n1627\n01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:17,400\nTo catch them.\n\n1628\n01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:23,260\nAnd then we can keep going and\nsay, access dash list,\n\n1629\n01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:28,890\n150, maybe there's something\nI want to deny, or\n\n1630\n01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,120\nmaybe I want to permit Ronnie\nto get to everything else.\n\n1631\n01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:37,950\nSo I might say permit IP host 182,\n\n1632\n01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,140\n160, 0 to 200, going to any,\ngoing to anybody else.\n\n1633\n01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,580\nRight.\nSo I block one getting to Instagram but\n\n1634\n01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:46,830\nthen I allow him getting\nto anything else right.\n\n1635\n01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,360\nBut then what about\nthe rest of my company.\n\n1636\n01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,080\nSo then I might wanna do some\nother filters that are in here.\n\n1637\n01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,750\nNow, these other filters alright\naren't going to apply to Ronnie\n\n1638\n01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,770\nbecause already he's been cleared for\neverything else.\n\n1639\n01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,740\nSo, it's only other people.\n\n1640\n01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:03,360\nBut people like me that would be\naffected by these other rules.\n\n1641\n01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,130\nAnd here's where we can start to say,\nlike.\n\n1642\n01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,490\nMaybe I got a voiceover\nIP system out somewhere.\n\n1643\n01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,640\nAnd so I'm gonna build SIP connections.\n\n1644\n01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,880\nAnd the SIP connections are gonna\nbe on UDP port 6,000 to 6,010.\n\n1645\n01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1646\n01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:18,700\nOr, yeah I think those are some\nof the ranges they use.\n\n1647\n01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n1648\n01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,779\n>> And so I might say.\n\n1649\n01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:27,711\n>> Permit UDP and maybe we'll do\nour whole network for this one,\n\n1650\n01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:33,331\nso I'll say 192.168.0.0\nwith the appropriate\n\n1651\n01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:38,289\nwild card mask for that, so\na class c wild card mask.\n\n1652\n01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:42,257\nAnd then for the destination,\nI would put whoever my provider was and\n\n1653\n01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:46,852\nmaybe my provider has multiple ID's and\nchanges, so I might just say anybody.\n\n1654\n01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:50,527\nBut then,\nwhere the port is going to be in a range.\n\n1655\n01:27:50,527 --> 01:27:51,250\n6,000 to 6,010.\n\n1656\n01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:55,460\nI can do a range and when you do that,\nyou basically just say 6,000.\n\n1657\n01:27:55,460 --> 01:28:00,000\nAnd then, you specify the ending number,\nwhich is 6,010.\n\n1658\n01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,600\nRight?\n\n1659\n01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,810\nSo when I punch that in, now my\nentire network can do UDP connections\n\n1660\n01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:13,045\nto anybody on the outside from 6000 to\n6010, and then I might block that for.\n\n1661\n01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:16,135\nFor any other network that's\nout there on my internal net.\n\n1662\n01:28:17,165 --> 01:28:18,405\nSo I might wanna to do a deny.\n\n1663\n01:28:22,545 --> 01:28:25,424\nFor any other of my internal networks\nto build out those connection.\n\n1664\n01:28:29,092 --> 01:28:32,540\nAnd remember, you know it might be a good\nidea to throw log statements in there.\n\n1665\n01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,835\nThe log statements,\njust adding that keyword to the end.\n\n1666\n01:28:34,835 --> 01:28:40,130\nNo not that, I guess I need to\nsay access-list, there we go.\n\n1667\n01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:42,680\nWhat have I done here?\n\n1668\n01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,368\nOh, UPD any, and\nthen I have a wildcard mask.\n\n1669\n01:28:45,368 --> 01:28:47,850\nSo that's going to be a problem.\n\n1670\n01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:48,690\nThere.\n\n1671\n01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,970\nThat log command is nice though, because\nI'll be able to see those log entries, and\n\n1672\n01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:53,650\nsee what's going on.\n\n1673\n01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:56,850\nThen from here I can start to\napprove whatever else I need.\n\n1674\n01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,640\nYou know,\nlet me do an example of a source, though.\n\n1675\n01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,060\nMaybe, I have an internal\nserver as my web server.\n\n1676\n01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:07,710\nAnd I want it to be able to reply\nto anybody out on the internet.\n\n1677\n01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:15,021\nSo, if I have a web server\nWhich is 192.168.0.10.\n\n1678\n01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,970\nAnd I want it to be able to communicate\nto anybody, when its responding back for\n\n1679\n01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,350\nweb requests.\n\n1680\n01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:26,810\nWell, the source port would\nequal 80 in that case, and\n\n1681\n01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,190\nthen the destination\nwould just be anybody.\n\n1682\n01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,993\nI don't know what their ports gonna be,\n\n1683\n01:29:30,993 --> 01:29:34,770\nbecause their gonna pick a random\none between 49,000 and 65,000.\n\n1684\n01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,840\nSo it's gonna be all over the place.\n\n1685\n01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,500\nSo by being a little\nmore specific like this,\n\n1686\n01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,470\nbecause it's the server replying,\nI have to specify that source port.\n\n1687\n01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,430\nThat's a pretty uncommon thing, so\nthey like to put it on the test,\n\n1688\n01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:49,360\nbecause that's how they know\nif you've really studied.\n\n1689\n01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,650\nAll right.\n\n1690\n01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,880\nAnd now I can kinda clear\neverything else out.\n\n1691\n01:29:57,262 --> 01:29:59,025\nAnd if I spell permit right\n[LAUGH] that'll help.\n\n1692\n01:30:07,548 --> 01:30:08,780\nThere we go.\n\n1693\n01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,344\nAnd let's take a look at that access list.\n\n1694\n01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:17,470\nThere.\n\n1695\n01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:19,590\nSo now I can start to take a look\nat this list that I've written.\n\n1696\n01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:21,800\nI've got some really specific stuff.\n\n1697\n01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,720\nDenying Ronnie going to that\none particular IP using web,\n\n1698\n01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,090\nusing HTTP, and then permitting\nhim to get to anything else.\n\n1699\n01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:33,880\nAnd then allowing everybody to build those\nzip connections out to whoever our zip\n\n1700\n01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:37,070\nprovider is, and\nthen denying everybody else zip.\n\n1701\n01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:41,670\nAnd then after that, just allowing our\nweb server to respond to people, and\n\n1702\n01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,650\nclearing the rest of the network for\ncommunication.\n\n1703\n01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:47,910\nThis list is starting to grow,\nand it's starting to get bigger.\n\n1704\n01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,560\nAnd the bigger the list, the more\nlikely we're gonna need to edit it.\n\n1705\n01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,800\nAnd that's what leads into\nwhat Ronnie was mentioning.\n\n1706\n01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,250\nBut I wanna make sure that we've\ngot a good amount of time for it.\n\n1707\n01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,280\nSo, Ronnie, can you think of\nanything else to add before we stop?\n\n1708\n01:30:59,280 --> 01:30:59,840\n>> Nope.\n\n1709\n01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,710\nAnd remember the key fundamentals again.\n\n1710\n01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:05,080\nKeep doing the lists over and over again.\n\n1711\n01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,778\nStart off again on paper is the key.\n\n1712\n01:31:06,778 --> 01:31:08,823\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1713\n01:31:08,823 --> 01:31:09,640\nAnd, you know?\n\n1714\n01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> I usually,\n\n1715\n01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,130\nI plan the list ahead of time.\n\n1716\n01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:13,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Without even worry about syntax.\n\n1717\n01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:15,320\n>> Right.\n>> I just think about what I wanna do, and\n\n1718\n01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,330\nthen I write it out.\n\n1719\n01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:18,660\nAnd then you can kinda rearrange and\nimplant in there.\n\n1720\n01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,130\nAll right, well let's stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n1721\n01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:25,590\nWhen we get back, we're gonna jump\ninto named ACL which are fun.\n\n1722\n01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:27,300\nAnd then we'll wind\nthings down from there.\n\n1723\n01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,760\nThat should be out last topic for the day.\n\n1724\n01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,870\nSo stay tuned, when we get back,\nmore ACL action after this.\n\n1725\n01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:40,318\n[MUSIC]\n\n1726\n01:31:40,318 --> 01:31:42,320\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1727\n01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,200\nSo we're gonna talk about\nthe last type of ACL,\n\n1728\n01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,420\nso we did standard ACL's\njust based on source IP.\n\n1729\n01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,090\nWe did extended ACL's which\nwere based on sourced, and\n\n1730\n01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:55,690\ndestination as well as\nif we chose protocol.\n\n1731\n01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,998\nAnd the last one are the named ACL's and\nwhat are they based on?\n\n1732\n01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:00,741\nBoth.\n\n1733\n01:32:00,741 --> 01:32:01,614\nNames.\n\n1734\n01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:08,750\n[LAUGH] A named ACL actually can be\na standard ACL, and it can be an extended.\n\n1735\n01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:13,560\nIt's just a different way of writing\nstandard and extended ACL's.\n\n1736\n01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,720\nNow it came about because\nof this whole number thing.\n\n1737\n01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,170\nWell actually it came out\nbecause of two things.\n\n1738\n01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,570\nBut mainly it was the number thing.\n\n1739\n01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:23,060\nThat if you only have 1 through 99 and\n\n1740\n01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:27,240\n1300 through 1699 or whatever,\nyou can only create so many ACL's.\n\n1741\n01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,830\nNow, you'd never really have more than\ntwo or three ACL's on a router anyway.\n\n1742\n01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:35,655\nBut, in some organizations they don't like\nto reuse ACL numbers across devices, and\n\n1743\n01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:37,678\nso you may need more numbers.\n\n1744\n01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:42,050\nWell named ACL's allow us to\nuse a name instead of a number.\n\n1745\n01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:45,830\nSo I can create an ACL called\nBlock Ronnie's Laptop,\n\n1746\n01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:50,160\nand now I know exactly what that ACL does,\ncuz it's right there in the name.\n\n1747\n01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,450\nBut when you use a name,\nthe router doesn't know.\n\n1748\n01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:55,560\nAre you creating a standard or\nan extended ACL?\n\n1749\n01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,010\nSo we have to tell it.\n\n1750\n01:32:57,010 --> 01:33:00,140\nBut the big advantage of a name is that,\nit's a name.\n\n1751\n01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,270\n>> Yep.\n>> We can kinda put in what that ACL does,\n\n1752\n01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:05,590\nand that just helps out in\nthe general scheme of things.\n\n1753\n01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,090\n>> Yep.\n\n1754\n01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:12,000\nSo for us, usually you'll see this\nquite often because that description\n\n1755\n01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,480\nhelps out so much for us.\n\n1756\n01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,530\nEspecially when you're look at,\n\n1757\n01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:19,182\noh, does that apply to access list 150 or\nis that 152?\n\n1758\n01:33:19,182 --> 01:33:23,030\n[LAUGH] It really does help us\nin that particular description.\n\n1759\n01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:25,670\nMore than that, it gives us a chance to do\nsomething we were talking about a little\n\n1760\n01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:28,690\nbit earlier in terms of editing\nthe ACL's a little bit easier, too.\n\n1761\n01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:31,380\n>> And that's probably the big benefit,\nright?\n\n1762\n01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,320\nIf your mind is a steel trap, and\nyou don't have a problem remembering\n\n1763\n01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,750\nthe numbers, oh yeah, it's ACL 173,\nif you can remember that, that's great.\n\n1764\n01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:42,670\nBut it's so\nmuch easier to edit a named ACL.\n\n1765\n01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,980\nWith a named ACL, as you put your entries\nin, they're assigned line numbers, or\n\n1766\n01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,620\nsequence numbers.\n\n1767\n01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,970\nAnd because they're sequence numbers,\n\n1768\n01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:53,590\nyou can insert entries in\nthe middle of the list.\n\n1769\n01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,414\nAnd we couldn't do that\nwith the old syntax,\n\n1770\n01:33:55,414 --> 01:33:58,013\nwith the syntax we've seen this\nwhole episode you can't do it.\n\n1771\n01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:00,260\nYou have to delete the ACL and\nrecreate it.\n\n1772\n01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,980\nWith a named ACL you can.\n\n1773\n01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,320\nYou can easily edit it.\n\n1774\n01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,400\nAnd in the newer iOS's, you can even go\nback and edit the old ACL styles too.\n\n1775\n01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,409\nSo really cool and really flexible.\n\n1776\n01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,240\nSo let's take an ACL,\n\n1777\n01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:18,590\nlike the one that we wrote before the\nbreak there, this nice big long ACL here.\n\n1778\n01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:22,140\nAnd let's rewrite that as a named ACL,\n\n1779\n01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:26,130\ninstead of just a standard numbered ACL,\nall right.\n\n1780\n01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:28,870\nThe first thing we need to do, well I\nguess I need to get into config mode,\n\n1781\n01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,470\nthat's gonna help.\n\n1782\n01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:33,250\nNow when we created the ACL's\nbefore we always said access-list.\n\n1783\n01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,730\nAnd we, that's nice.\n\n1784\n01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:38,140\n[LAUGH] This is an all new kind of list.\n\n1785\n01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,190\nSo access-list.\n\n1786\n01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:44,150\nWhen we did that, it automatically\nknew that it was an access list, and\n\n1787\n01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:47,000\nthen we picked which protocol\nbased on the number.\n\n1788\n01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,570\nWith a named ACL, it has no idea\nwhat protocol we're gonna do.\n\n1789\n01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:57,110\nSo we actually have to add the word IPto\nthe beginning, and then access-list,\n\n1790\n01:34:57,110 --> 01:35:03,060\nso it knows that we're doing an IP\nnot IPX or AppleTalk or whatever.\n\n1791\n01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:08,440\nAnd then we say IP access- list and\nwhat we want the name to be.\n\n1792\n01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:15,460\nSo I might wanna call this,\nmy inside to outside ACL, right.\n\n1793\n01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:21,810\nSo this is gonna be filtering my inside\ntraffic, on its way out to the internet.\n\n1794\n01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:24,780\nYou can call it whatever you want,\nyou can't have spaces and\n\n1795\n01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:29,030\nyou can't have special characters, but\nyou can do hyphens, so it's not so bad.\n\n1796\n01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:33,070\nSo I'll call this one IP\naccess-list inside to outside.\n\n1797\n01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:39,547\nAnd then you need to tell it,\nwhether it is standard or extended, right?\n\n1798\n01:35:39,547 --> 01:35:41,265\nI wanna do an extended one,\nso I'm gonna punch that in.\n\n1799\n01:35:41,265 --> 01:35:43,911\nAnd did I get that out of order?\n\n1800\n01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:45,259\nI might have gotten it out of order.\n\n1801\n01:35:45,259 --> 01:35:48,075\nYeah, let me just go back here,\nand oh, I did, shoot, So\n\n1802\n01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:51,680\nwe need to say extended first, and\nthen we can say Inside-to-Outside.\n\n1803\n01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,677\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n1804\n01:35:52,677 --> 01:35:55,759\nthe good old question mark\ncomes in pretty handy.\n\n1805\n01:35:55,759 --> 01:35:58,894\nAnd I get this question a lot via email.\n\n1806\n01:35:58,894 --> 01:36:03,591\nOn the exam, you actually can use the\nquestion mark on the simulation question,\n\n1807\n01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,501\nso it is there.\n\n1808\n01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:07,005\nBut, so here we go.\n\n1809\n01:36:07,005 --> 01:36:10,610\nNow I've created this ACL,\nInside-to-Outside.\n\n1810\n01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:13,680\n>> Notice the actual command prompt itself\nand how it actually has changed here.\n\n1811\n01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,078\nYou're now inside the configuration for\nthe extended named ACL, NACL here,\n\n1812\n01:36:18,078 --> 01:36:21,142\nand this is how it knows that\nyou're about to configure\n\n1813\n01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:24,760\na whole bunch of stuff to tie into\nthe name that you just created.\n\n1814\n01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,164\nThat's what we're about to do here.\n\n1815\n01:36:26,164 --> 01:36:29,346\n>> Now the other nice thing here is,\nbecause it already\n\n1816\n01:36:29,346 --> 01:36:33,830\nknows that we're doing IP and\nit already knows that it's extended, I can\n\n1817\n01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:38,490\nleave off some of the other information\nI had to do in the other syntax.\n\n1818\n01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:41,290\nNow, I just go through and\nI say what I want to do.\n\n1819\n01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:45,213\nIf I'm permitting or denying, and\nyou know I lost track of that other ACL.\n\n1820\n01:36:45,213 --> 01:36:49,717\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What was that other ACL, 150?\n\n1821\n01:36:49,717 --> 01:36:52,340\n>> 150, mm-hm.\n\n1822\n01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,820\n>> Oh, ambiguous command.\n\n1823\n01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,710\nLet me go a little more.\n\n1824\n01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:55,220\nThere we go.\n\n1825\n01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,850\nAll right, so\nhere's the old ACL that we did.\n\n1826\n01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:59,190\nSo I'm gonna go through and\nbasically recreate this.\n\n1827\n01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:03,890\nAnd before, on every line,\nI had to do access-list 150.\n\n1828\n01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:07,140\nNow I don't,\nbecause I'm in the named ACL prompt.\n\n1829\n01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,590\nSo I can just skip right to the permit or\ndeny part.\n\n1830\n01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:15,938\nSo I can say,\ndeny tcp host 192.168.0.200 and\n\n1831\n01:37:15,938 --> 01:37:21,042\nthen we did that to host\ninstagram.com eq 80,\n\n1832\n01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:29,200\nright, and so it does that look-up to\nget the right IP address in there.\n\n1833\n01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:33,210\nAnd then permit IP host.\n\n1834\n01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,360\nAnd then we're allowing your laptop,\nright.\n\n1835\n01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,310\nAnd then the rest of these lines\nreally write pretty much the same\n\n1836\n01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,990\nas they did before.\n\n1837\n01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:41,720\nIn fact, you can really copy and\npaste them.\n\n1838\n01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:47,150\nSo I'm gonna do, oh come on,\n\n1839\n01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:51,120\nmy touch pad doesn't like to let me\nget all the way to the end of a line\n\n1840\n01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,140\nsometimes, but basically I'm\njust gonna cut and paste those.\n\n1841\n01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,845\nAnd I'm leaving off the very last part,\nI mean the very beginning part,\n\n1842\n01:37:57,845 --> 01:38:00,300\nbecause I don't need\nthat on every single one.\n\n1843\n01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,852\nAnd so we just go through and\npunch in all of those entries.\n\n1844\n01:38:02,852 --> 01:38:09,664\nNow it's adding them, one after the other,\nand putting them in sequence.\n\n1845\n01:38:09,664 --> 01:38:12,625\nAnd it's giving them\na sequence number in 10s, so\n\n1846\n01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:18,795\nthe very first one is line 10, and\nthen 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and so on.\n\n1847\n01:38:18,795 --> 01:38:20,415\nNow we don't see that here.\n\n1848\n01:38:20,415 --> 01:38:22,643\nIn fact, you don't even see it in\nthe config if you do a show run.\n\n1849\n01:38:27,007 --> 01:38:31,790\nIf I go and find it in the config,\noh shoot, I didn't, dag gummit.\n\n1850\n01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:36,249\nWe called it Inside-to-Outside.\n\n1851\n01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:38,849\n>> Oops you need, yeah.\n\n1852\n01:38:38,849 --> 01:38:42,791\n>> There we go.\nIf we find it in the configuration,\n\n1853\n01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:50,290\nhere it is, where it says IP\naccess-list extended Inside-to-Outside.\n\n1854\n01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:55,200\nAnd then there's each line right there,\nno line numbers, right?\n\n1855\n01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,100\nSo, am I lying to you?\n\n1856\n01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,364\nWell, sometimes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1857\n01:38:58,364 --> 01:38:59,556\n>> [LAUGH] Not right now, so\n\n1858\n01:38:59,556 --> 01:39:03,270\nthe line numbers are there,\nwe just don't see them in the config.\n\n1859\n01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,270\nHere, they're written nice and in order.\n\n1860\n01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:10,430\nBut if you run show access-list\n\n1861\n01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:16,700\nInside-to-Outside, and I'm out of config\nnow, so I'm not doing the do command.\n\n1862\n01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,127\nShow access-list Inside-to-Outside.\n\n1863\n01:39:18,127 --> 01:39:22,983\nWhen you run it this way,\nthere's our sequence numbers, 10,\n\n1864\n01:39:22,983 --> 01:39:26,180\n20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.\n\n1865\n01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:30,230\nNow, let's say I want to\nadd a new entry in here.\n\n1866\n01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:35,035\nI've blocked Ronnie from getting\nto Instagram, 54.221.243.243.\n\n1867\n01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:39,723\nThen I find out that Instagram\nhas more IPs that are out there,\n\n1868\n01:39:39,723 --> 01:39:43,120\nright, let's see, I bet they do.\n\n1869\n01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:46,440\nIf we look it up here, so\n\n1870\n01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:52,430\nlet's do a nslookup for instagram.com.\n\n1871\n01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:55,870\nWell, that's different than\nwhat I got a minute ago.\n\n1872\n01:39:55,870 --> 01:40:00,870\nSo, well either way, so here's another\nIP address that I'm not blocking.\n\n1873\n01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,980\nSo now maybe Ronnie can get to Instagram,\nright,\n\n1874\n01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:06,670\nand that would be bad,\nso I need to block it.\n\n1875\n01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,287\nNow the problem is,\nif I add another line right now,\n\n1876\n01:40:09,287 --> 01:40:12,240\nit's gonna go to the end of the list,\nit'll be line 80.\n\n1877\n01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,760\nWell, line 20 permits Ronnie\nto get out to any host.\n\n1878\n01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,328\nHe'd be able to get to it.\n\n1879\n01:40:17,328 --> 01:40:18,871\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1880\n01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:21,780\n>> So here's where we can go and inject.\n\n1881\n01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,979\nI wanna inject this one in\nbetween lines 10 and 20, so\n\n1882\n01:40:24,979 --> 01:40:29,378\nthat it'll block him from getting there,\nbut I don't wanna have to delete and\n\n1883\n01:40:29,378 --> 01:40:32,590\nre-create the list, which is the old way.\n\n1884\n01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:35,330\n>> This is where those sequence\nnumbers really do help us.\n\n1885\n01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,380\nWhat we can do now is,\nwe can actually create an entry, and\n\n1886\n01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:44,200\nwe can actually put a sequence number in\nthere between line 10 and line 20, and so\n\n1887\n01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:49,852\nas Don actually goes ahead and gets\naccess into the extended named list here.\n\n1888\n01:40:49,852 --> 01:40:51,650\nNotice that he put in the number 15 and\n\n1889\n01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:58,360\nnow he's added in the actual deny\nstatement limiting my particular laptop\n\n1890\n01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:03,330\nhere to one particular IP\naddress on port 80 as well.\n\n1891\n01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:07,200\n>> So I did that by putting\nthat 15 at the beginning.\n\n1892\n01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,360\nSo I manually put the line number in,\nand you can do that,\n\n1893\n01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,650\nyou can manually put in\nwhatever number you want.\n\n1894\n01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:14,230\nIf it already exists,\nit's gonna give you an error.\n\n1895\n01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,960\nIf you're trying to replace a line,\nyou need to remove it and\n\n1896\n01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,270\nthen add the other one.\n\n1897\n01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:20,668\nBut I now have sequence\nnumber 15 in there.\n\n1898\n01:41:20,668 --> 01:41:25,930\nAnd if I do a show access-list\n\n1899\n01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:32,463\nInside-to-Outside, all right?\n\n1900\n01:41:32,463 --> 01:41:36,240\nThen, where did it go?\n\n1901\n01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,073\nSo it did not take effect yet.\n\n1902\n01:41:38,073 --> 01:41:40,987\nDid I screw it up?\n\n1903\n01:41:40,987 --> 01:41:41,590\nLet's see.\n\n1904\n01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,447\n>> Now, I'm kind of confused.\n\n1905\n01:41:44,447 --> 01:41:48,040\n>> I might have done a typo\nwhen I did the name.\n\n1906\n01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,280\nLook what I did.\n\n1907\n01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:53,700\nSo I did IP access-list extended\nOutside-to-Inside, I had it backwards.\n\n1908\n01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:58,220\nSo it actually created an all-new ACL,\nso that's definitely not what I wanted.\n\n1909\n01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,530\nSo let me go back and fix that.\n\n1910\n01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:05,570\nSee, these are, I'll call them\namateur mistakes, but very possible.\n\n1911\n01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:09,893\nSo it's supposed to be Inside-to-Outside\nand then I can go back and\n\n1912\n01:42:09,893 --> 01:42:11,095\nfind my line 15.\n\n1913\n01:42:11,095 --> 01:42:13,168\n>> Oh man, you could have told me\nthat you did that on purpose, and\n\n1914\n01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:13,962\nI would have not known.\n\n1915\n01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:15,181\n>> That's right,\nit was all part of the plan!\n\n1916\n01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:16,273\nI wanted to show you guys.\n\n1917\n01:42:16,273 --> 01:42:18,362\nIt was a test, you guys passed.\n\n1918\n01:42:18,362 --> 01:42:19,415\n>> That's right.\n\n1919\n01:42:19,415 --> 01:42:20,921\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n1920\n01:42:20,921 --> 01:42:26,340\nnow I'm going to do show access-list\nInside-to-Outside, and now.\n\n1921\n01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,220\n>> All better.\n\n1922\n01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:29,690\n>> There's that line 15, right.\n\n1923\n01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:32,450\nSo I've injected a line\nin the middle of it.\n\n1924\n01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:35,002\nI didn't have to delete the ACL and\nrecreate it.\n\n1925\n01:42:35,002 --> 01:42:39,680\nI didn't have to create a second ACL and\nthen replace them, It's just there.\n\n1926\n01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,640\nIt's in place and\nI can continue to inject.\n\n1927\n01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,340\nAll right.\n\n1928\n01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:48,668\n>> Yeah, now, not only can we continue\nto inject, this also makes it easy done,\n\n1929\n01:42:48,668 --> 01:42:52,434\nif Don all of a sudden finds out that\none of those lines is too restricted.\n\n1930\n01:42:52,434 --> 01:42:53,060\nRight?\n\n1931\n01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:55,442\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We don't have to actually go ahead and\n\n1932\n01:42:55,442 --> 01:42:57,630\njust have to retype the whole thing.\n\n1933\n01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:01,850\nWe can actually go back in the same place\nand just type in no, and then the line\n\n1934\n01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:06,260\nnumber that we actually want, and it\nautomatically takes that line out as well.\n\n1935\n01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:09,920\n>> Yeah, so\nI if wanted to get rid of that denied UDP,\n\n1936\n01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,450\nif at the end of the day I say, you know\nwhat I've only got one network in here,\n\n1937\n01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:16,590\nI've got 192 168 0, so\nthis line is really not necessary.\n\n1938\n01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:20,060\nWe can go and yank just that line and\npull it right out of the middle.\n\n1939\n01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,603\nSo I can jump back into config.\n\n1940\n01:43:26,026 --> 01:43:27,942\nAnd I'll type it the right way this time.\n\n1941\n01:43:27,942 --> 01:43:30,870\n>> I'm watching this time.\n\n1942\n01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:34,374\n>> And I'm just gonna type in no 40.\n\n1943\n01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:37,344\nOkay, I'm not even gonna bother to type\nthe rest of the line because no 40,\n\n1944\n01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:39,550\nthat's enough for\nit to know that I wanna get rid of that.\n\n1945\n01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:41,152\nOne entry.\n\n1946\n01:43:43,429 --> 01:43:46,932\nAnd if I.\n\n1947\n01:43:46,932 --> 01:43:50,420\nRun that,\nI can see that line 40 is now gone.\n\n1948\n01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:53,440\nNow, notice how the line numbers\nof the other lines don't change.\n\n1949\n01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,210\nIt's not like they moved\nup to fill that gap.\n\n1950\n01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:59,960\nBe aware of that because,\nwhile we do have some flexibility here,\n\n1951\n01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,560\nwe don't have a ton, right.\n\n1952\n01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,690\nIf I continue to inject filters on Ronnie,\nright,\n\n1953\n01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:09,380\nRonnie's line here at line 20, that's\nthe one that permits everything, right.\n\n1954\n01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,470\nSo I've really got 11 through 19,\n\n1955\n01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:17,160\nyou know that I can inject things in,\nor I could go before ten, I suppose.\n\n1956\n01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,250\nSo you only got so much room.\n\n1957\n01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:24,320\nSo over time, eventually you'll run into\na spot where you run out of line numbers.\n\n1958\n01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,880\nAnd when that happens there's two choices,\nif your device reboots a lot,\n\n1959\n01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,840\nit'll renumber boot time, and then you're\nfinding that they're all ten apart.\n\n1960\n01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,160\nAnd if you don't reboot,\nwhich hopefully you don't,\n\n1961\n01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,490\nin that case you may need to delete and\nrecreate the list.\n\n1962\n01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:41,600\nAnd just do what I said at the beginning\nof the show create a second list and\n\n1963\n01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,888\nthen swap them on the interface.\n\n1964\n01:44:43,888 --> 01:44:46,170\nAnd you know, I never did attach\nthis on the interface, did I?\n\n1965\n01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:48,381\n>> Nope.\n\n1966\n01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:51,780\n>> So, we attach this the same\nway as the other ones.\n\n1967\n01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:57,134\nWe just say IP access-list, and the name.\n\n1968\n01:44:57,134 --> 01:44:58,520\nAnd then the direction, right?\n\n1969\n01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,380\n>> Right.\n>> You don't have to tell it\n\n1970\n01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,380\nif it's standard or, sorry, access-group.\n\n1971\n01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,780\nYou don't have to tell it,\nif it's standard or external.\n\n1972\n01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:08,790\nIt figures that out on its own, but\nit just attaches it based on the name.\n\n1973\n01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:12,030\n>> Don, this last thing that you just\ntalked right here just kind of reminded\n\n1974\n01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:15,770\nme of something else that we didn't\ntalk about that may actually appear too.\n\n1975\n01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:17,870\nWhich is the virtual interface, right?\n\n1976\n01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:19,110\nGetting in using Telnets.\n\n1977\n01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:20,200\nSuch as the line VTY.\n\n1978\n01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:20,840\n>> Oh yes, yes.\n\n1979\n01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,350\n>> And the syntax error.\n\n1980\n01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,788\nThat's a little bit different.\n\n1981\n01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:28,910\n>> All the ACLs, I know I specifically\nsaid in the beginning of the episode,\n\n1982\n01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:32,300\napply when traffic goes from\none interface to another,\n\n1983\n01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,630\nas you pass between interfaces.\n\n1984\n01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:37,550\nBut there is some traffic\nthat doesn't pass between\n\n1985\n01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:39,439\ninterfaces which is what\nRonnie was mentioning, right?\n\n1986\n01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:41,460\n>> Yes.\n>> So if we Telnet or\n\n1987\n01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:44,940\nSSH into the routers,\nI'm SSH into the router right now.\n\n1988\n01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:45,440\nOkay.\n\n1989\n01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:51,100\nWhen you SSH in, you're not passing\nin one interface and out another.\n\n1990\n01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,680\nYou're coming in one interface and\nstopping.\n\n1991\n01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:57,140\nThe ACLs don't apply to\nthat type of traffic.\n\n1992\n01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:01,530\nThe ACLs don't apply to traffic\ndestined for the router itself.\n\n1993\n01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:06,790\nInstead, we need to attach\nthat ACL to our VTY lines.\n\n1994\n01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:10,190\nAnd this is almost always done\nwith just a standard ACL.\n\n1995\n01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:14,960\nWe create a standard ACL that limits\nwho's allowed to connect and who isn't.\n\n1996\n01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,705\nSo I might create an ACL and\nspecifically put in\n\n1997\n01:46:19,705 --> 01:46:23,375\nwho's allowed to connect to the router and\nwho isn't, right?\n\n1998\n01:46:24,485 --> 01:46:26,885\nSo let's say I wanna create one\nof those routes or those rules.\n\n1999\n01:46:26,885 --> 01:46:31,249\nI'll create one that maybe blocks Ronnie\nand allows me, or something like that.\n\n2000\n01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:35,810\nRonnie, can you pull up real quick\non yours, what your actual IP is?\n\n2001\n01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,040\nI was guessing earlier.\n\n2002\n01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:42,320\nSo I'm gonna create an access list here,\nand I'll just say access-list 5.\n\n2003\n01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,715\nAnd I'm gonna permit my machine, so\n\n2004\n01:46:45,715 --> 01:46:51,721\nI'm gonna say host 192.1 192.168.0.222.\n\n2005\n01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:53,139\nThat's me, right?\n\n2006\n01:46:53,139 --> 01:46:55,860\nYou know what actually,\nI'm gonna log that.\n\n2007\n01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:57,820\nSo let me redo that.\n\n2008\n01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:01,490\nI want to log when somebody\nconnects into my system.\n\n2009\n01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:02,640\nI want to have a record of it.\n\n2010\n01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,830\nSo I'm just gonna add\nthat little entry there.\n\n2011\n01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:06,888\nAnd then I'll block Ronnie.\n\n2012\n01:47:10,694 --> 01:47:11,564\nWhat is yours?\n\n2013\n01:47:11,564 --> 01:47:16,304\n>> 10.1.230.101\n>> All right.\n\n2014\n01:47:16,304 --> 01:47:18,346\nAnd I'll log that too.\n\n2015\n01:47:18,346 --> 01:47:21,900\nAnd then, you know, I probably\ncould have saved some time here.\n\n2016\n01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:26,220\nI probably want to deny anybody else who's\nnot allowed, but I might have, like,\n\n2017\n01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,270\na management network.\n\n2018\n01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,990\nOr somebody like that and so\nI might want to permit them.\n\n2019\n01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:37,317\nAnd so maybe that's the rest\nof that 192.160.0 network.\n\n2020\n01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:39,350\nAnd then,\nI might want to deny everybody else.\n\n2021\n01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:42,320\nNow, there's an implicit denial, right, so\n\n2022\n01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,060\nI don't really have to put\nthe statement in here.\n\n2023\n01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,810\nBut the implicit denial doesn't log.\n\n2024\n01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:47,370\n>> Right\n>> By default.\n\n2025\n01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:55,350\nSo If I want to log everybody else, then\nI might wanna put in something like this.\n\n2026\n01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:59,900\nWhich basically says, deny everybody.\n\n2027\n01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:02,820\nDeny anybody who's coming through and\nlogging.\n\n2028\n01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:06,710\nThat's the same thing the implicit rule\nsays, but we add that log statement, so\n\n2029\n01:48:06,710 --> 01:48:07,360\nwe've got a record.\n\n2030\n01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,180\nI guess I could use the keyword, any\nthere, that would have saved some time.\n\n2031\n01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,450\nAll right, now here is the part\nthat Ronnie was talking about.\n\n2032\n01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:14,810\nThe weird part.\n\n2033\n01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:18,500\nBecause this traffic isn't\npassing through the router,\n\n2034\n01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:23,260\nwe actually have to attach it\nto the VTY lines themself.\n\n2035\n01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:28,250\nSo I'm gonna go to line VTY 0 4,\nget into those VTY lines.\n\n2036\n01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:32,348\nAnd here, we say access-, and\nhere's my favorite, why be consistent?\n\n2037\n01:48:32,348 --> 01:48:37,430\nIt's access-class 5,\n\n2038\n01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:41,080\nand then I think we have to do\na direction, don't we, yeah, in.\n\n2039\n01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,370\nAll right,\nnow it's gonna be restricting on that, and\n\n2040\n01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:48,540\nI'm gonna get out of this router\nreal quick and connect back in.\n\n2041\n01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:52,926\nCuz it won't apply to connections\nthat are already in place, so\n\n2042\n01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:55,942\nI'm just gonna get out and\nget back into it.\n\n2043\n01:49:00,676 --> 01:49:01,976\nIf I can.\n\n2044\n01:49:06,466 --> 01:49:09,230\nOh, come on.\n\n2045\n01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:15,820\n192.168.0.1 is it's IP address,\nand I think I was SSH, wasn't I?\n\n2046\n01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,320\nYeah.\n\n2047\n01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:19,010\nOkay.\n\n2048\n01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,860\nSo here I am connecting in.\n\n2049\n01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:23,640\nI'm able to connect in just fine, right?\n\n2050\n01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,080\nAnd I'm gonna do a terminal monitor here.\n\n2051\n01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:29,230\nAnd then Ronnie, why don't you try and\nSSH into the router?\n\n2052\n01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,370\n>> All right, it's .15, right?\n\n2053\n01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:31,750\nIsn't that what we said?\n\n2054\n01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,050\n>> Yes.\n>> On your end.\n\n2055\n01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,160\n>> So\nRonnie's trying to connect in right now.\n\n2056\n01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,240\nIt denied him and what do I see.\n\n2057\n01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,280\nHere's a log message.\n\n2058\n01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:43,040\nI now have a record that on October\n30th at, that clock is wrong.\n\n2059\n01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,393\nOh.\nIt must not have set a timezone.\n\n2060\n01:49:44,393 --> 01:49:47,816\nSo anyhow, at 10 PM,\nI guess we're working late tonight.\n\n2061\n01:49:47,816 --> 01:49:54,580\nAt 10 PM,\n10.1.230.101 tried to access this system.\n\n2062\n01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:59,320\nTried to get in and access this via SSH or\nTelnet or whatever.\n\n2063\n01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,540\nIt doesn't say the protocol\nbecause of the standard ACL, so\n\n2064\n01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:06,820\nit doesn't have a record of that,\nbut I can see that it happened.\n\n2065\n01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:10,870\nAnd did I configure logging in earlier,\nI don't remember, there it is.\n\n2066\n01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:14,030\nSo not only can I see the log entry for\nRonnie, but\n\n2067\n01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:17,230\nI can see the log entry for me,\nI can see that I successfully connected,\n\n2068\n01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:22,220\nand any good security guy is gonna\ntell you, logging denies, that's good.\n\n2069\n01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:25,470\nYou know, you can see when your system\nworked, when somebody was blocked.\n\n2070\n01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:28,750\nBut logging those permits,\nthat's even more important, right?\n\n2071\n01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,400\nBecause if somebody tries to\nhack into your network and\n\n2072\n01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,330\nthey're stopped, that's not a big deal.\n\n2073\n01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:34,550\nEverything worked.\n\n2074\n01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:37,520\nBut if somebody tries to hack into\nyour network and they succeed,\n\n2075\n01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:42,080\nif they're permitted, That's a big deal\nand you definitely want a record of that.\n\n2076\n01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,880\nSo logging those permits,\njust as important, if not more important,\n\n2077\n01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,060\nthan logging those denies.\n\n2078\n01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:48,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n2079\n01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,907\nSo for us, make sure you are clear\nwhen you go to the interface, if they\n\n2080\n01:50:51,907 --> 01:50:57,555\nare talking about configuring it to\nthe path of the traffic passing through.\n\n2081\n01:50:57,555 --> 01:51:02,705\nYou can use access-group to actually\nput it on the interface there.\n\n2082\n01:51:02,705 --> 01:51:07,495\nIf you are controlling traffic going\nto the router or from the router,\n\n2083\n01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:11,315\nyou're gonna go to the VTY lines and\nyou're gonna use access-class.\n\n2084\n01:51:11,315 --> 01:51:12,805\nI mean, why not change it?\n\n2085\n01:51:12,805 --> 01:51:15,180\nYou know, it makes sense.\n\n2086\n01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,740\nBut you have to remember those too,\nbecause they may show you an access list\n\n2087\n01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:22,830\nand say you need to actually stop\ntraffic from getting into the router.\n\n2088\n01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:26,940\nWell, if you choose access-group and that\nnumber, it's not going to work for you.\n\n2089\n01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:29,050\nIt has to be access-class.\n\n2090\n01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:32,237\nMake sure you remember that.\n\n2091\n01:51:32,237 --> 01:51:35,549\n>> So for the exam, as you start\ntrying to buckle down on this,\n\n2092\n01:51:35,549 --> 01:51:40,122\ncouple of key things to focus on, always\nremember the direction of your traffic,\n\n2093\n01:51:40,122 --> 01:51:43,328\nwhether that traffic is coming\nin an interface, or out.\n\n2094\n01:51:43,328 --> 01:51:47,582\nOn the exam, what I recommend you do,\nif you get to any ACL questions,\n\n2095\n01:51:47,582 --> 01:51:48,604\ndraw a picture.\n\n2096\n01:51:48,604 --> 01:51:51,440\nYou'll get a little dry erase board\nthat you can write on during the exam,\n\n2097\n01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,280\njust draw a picture.\n\n2098\n01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:56,370\nCuz then you can draw arrows to say here's\nmy traffic going this way and that way.\n\n2099\n01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:59,490\nAnd you can see where it's going in and\nwhere it's going out, and\n\n2100\n01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:01,560\nbuild your ACLs appropriately.\n\n2101\n01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,000\nThe other thing, syntax, syntax, syntax.\n\n2102\n01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,060\nThese are long commands.\n\n2103\n01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:08,060\nThere's a lot of room for typos.\n\n2104\n01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:12,150\nOn the exam, they may show you a pre-built\naccess list and ask you questions about\n\n2105\n01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:15,320\nit, or to spot errors, or\nthey may give you a simulation and\n\n2106\n01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:20,920\ntell you to write an access list that\nwill filter based on x, y, z criteria.\n\n2107\n01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,200\nSo make sure you know that syntax.\n\n2108\n01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:23,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n2109\n01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:27,990\nAlso remember that creating the access\ncontrol list is only half the battle.\n\n2110\n01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:30,960\nApplying it to the interface\nis the other part.\n\n2111\n01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,670\nApplying it in the proper direction.\n\n2112\n01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:36,280\nApplying that picker access list\nto whatever interface they say.\n\n2113\n01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,630\nNow there's a couple of other,\nwhat we call.\n\n2114\n01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:40,140\nI guess.\nI don't know if they're best practices or\n\n2115\n01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:42,810\nnot, but general rules of thumb\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2116\n01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:45,120\n>> Whatever you wanna call them,\n\n2117\n01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,490\nI can't remember those phrases.\n\n2118\n01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,140\n>> Guidelines, or something?\n\n2119\n01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,370\n>> Guidelines, whatever.\n\n2120\n01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:52,460\nWhenever you create the idea\nof an extended access list,\n\n2121\n01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:55,650\nnormal best practices,\nyou want to actually make sure that you\n\n2122\n01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:59,330\nput it on the interface as close\nto the source as possible.\n\n2123\n01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:03,290\nSo as close as from when you actually\nsending it out, as possible.\n\n2124\n01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:08,010\nOn a standard access list, usually as\nclose to the destination as possible\n\n2125\n01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:11,290\nis what you want to do, because you want\nto allow that traffic to get to wherever\n\n2126\n01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:14,920\nit actually needs to go except for\nblocking that one particular source.\n\n2127\n01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,070\nSo usually that's a two.\n\n2128\n01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:19,620\nSo source as close to destination as\npossible, extended or not extended.\n\n2129\n01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:21,308\nYeah.\nExtended access list as close to\n\n2130\n01:53:21,308 --> 01:53:23,701\nthe source as,\nI'm gonna say that wrong, I know.\n\n2131\n01:53:23,701 --> 01:53:24,642\n>> Yeah.\n\n2132\n01:53:24,642 --> 01:53:26,233\n>> It's gonna happen.\n\n2133\n01:53:26,233 --> 01:53:28,703\n>> The way that I remember it,\nextended ACLs can be very specific,\n\n2134\n01:53:28,703 --> 01:53:29,980\ncan be very granular.\n\n2135\n01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:32,910\nSo you can put them really\nclose to the source and\n\n2136\n01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:35,640\nstill allow the source\nto get to other places.\n\n2137\n01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:39,990\nBut a standard ACL is so broad because\nit's just based on a source IP and\n\n2138\n01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:42,308\nthat's it,\nthat if you put it close to the source,\n\n2139\n01:53:42,308 --> 01:53:44,640\nyou're gonna kill off that source for\neverything.\n\n2140\n01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,270\nSo you put it as close to the destination,\nso\n\n2141\n01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:49,570\nthe source will still be able\nto get wherever it goes.\n\n2142\n01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:50,900\nNow that is just a rule of thumb.\n\n2143\n01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:51,740\n>> Yep.\n>> You will see it\n\n2144\n01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:53,400\nmentioned on the Cisco website.\n\n2145\n01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:56,410\n>> Don't let that taint\nyour decisions on the exam.\n\n2146\n01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:59,160\nOn the exam they're gonna give you\nrequirements you need to look for\n\n2147\n01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,390\nthose regardless of what\nthe guidelines are.\n\n2148\n01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:05,670\nSo keep that in mind, but in the real\nworld you are absolutely right.\n\n2149\n01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:08,641\nStandard ACLs typically\nclose to the destination,\n\n2150\n01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:12,297\nextended ACLs are typically close\nto the source of the traffic.\n\n2151\n01:54:12,297 --> 01:54:17,382\n>> Remember the guidelines\nabout wildcard mask as well.\n\n2152\n01:54:17,382 --> 01:54:22,174\nDon't let the idea of a subnet mask\nfool you into thinking that's what you\n\n2153\n01:54:22,174 --> 01:54:22,955\nhave to do.\n\n2154\n01:54:22,955 --> 01:54:25,081\nUsually that's what you're\ngonna end up seeing,\n\n2155\n01:54:25,081 --> 01:54:28,048\nespecially on the exam because\nthey're not gonna get that technical,\n\n2156\n01:54:28,048 --> 01:54:31,230\nbut it is something that you don't want\nto confuse even at this early stage.\n\n2157\n01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:35,420\n>> Well Ronnie,\nI think that's pretty good coverage.\n\n2158\n01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,760\nWe are gonna have another episode that'll\ntouch on ACLs as we get into like\n\n2159\n01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,800\ntroubleshooting ACLs and stuff.\n\n2160\n01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,390\nBut I think as far as the basics of just\nkinda what they are, how they work and\n\n2161\n01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:48,370\nwhat their syntax is, we've pretty\nmuch covered all our bases haven't we?\n\n2162\n01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:48,910\n>> I believe so.\n\n2163\n01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:51,608\n>> So let's wrap it up here.\n\n2164\n01:54:51,608 --> 01:54:54,930\nI do wanna remind you guys that\nif you ever have any questions\n\n2165\n01:54:54,930

00:00:59,760\nWe're down to the last little bit here,\ntroubleshooting some of the topics,\n\n15\n00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,800\nand you know, I say it's like the last\none, what do we do when this is over?\n\n16\n00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,182\nSee you next time!\n>> Yup!\n\n17\n00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,910\n>> So, yeah!\n\n18\n00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,880\nSo we got some good troubleshooting\ntopics lined up today,\n\n19\n00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,830\nwe're going to troubleshoot\nsome host things,\n\n20\n00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,180\nsome switch things, some outer things,\nsome stuff in general.\n\n21\n00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,130\nAnd we've kind of, already been doing\nthis throughout the entire show.\n\n22\n00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,790\nWe're really just bringing that back and\nwrapping up in one area.\n\n23\n00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,510\n>> It's more of a review for us,\nmaking sure that we, before the exam,\n\n24\n00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,930\nthat we get all the concepts\nin that we need to.\n\n25\n00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,490\nAs we actually go back and review these,\n\n26\n00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,480\nthese are things, once again, and\nyou may have actually gone, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,250\nGone through so much stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,830\nOh yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,632\nLet's remind ourselves of this.\n\n30\n00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:39,240\nAnd so,\nwhat it actually helps us do, again,\n\n31\n00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,910\nis wrap everything back up for\nus and get ready now for CCNA.\n\n32\n00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,340\n>> Yeah, and speaking of troubleshooting,\nI don't know if you've even heard it,\n\n33\n00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,020\nRonnie, but we have a 20 100 series\nrouters and two 3560s behind us, and\n\n34\n00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,180\nI have heard some clicking noise\nlike twice now and so we might\n\n35\n00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,100\nhave some troubleshooting to do here or\nthe equipment might burst into flame.\n\n36\n00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,998\n>> That would be exciting.\n\n37\n00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,106\nIt's very possible.\n\n38\n00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,585\n>> This could be the cliffhanger\nconclusion to CCENT.\n\n39\n00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,660\nThey see the fire out there and\nthey're like, did they make it?\n\n40\n00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,648\nDid they survive?\n\n41\n00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,190\n>> What in the world is going on?\n\n42\n00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,352\n>> Stay tuned next season.\n>> That's right.\n\n43\n00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,888\n>> All right, so\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n44\n00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:17,842\nObjective 7.1 is troubleshooting and\ncorrecting common problems associated with\n\n45\n00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:21,360\nIP addressing and\nhost configurations, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,400\nNow, the first thing we need to realize\nwhen we talk about IP addressing is,\n\n47\n00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,170\nour clients will get addresses,\nTwo different ways.\n\n48\n00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,052\nThey can get it via the DHCP,\ndynamic host configuration protocol or\n\n49\n00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,166\nthey can get it via static IP.\n\n50\n00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,897\nAnd if they do it statically,\nthere's a lot of room for typos and\n\n51\n00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,570\nthat's normally what\nthe problem is going to be.\n\n52\n00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,940\nBut if you get it via DHCP,\n\n53\n00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,504\nthere is a whole different set\nof problems that you can have.\n\n54\n00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:45,050\n>> Yes.\n\n55\n00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,640\nWith IP addressing, for us,\nremember that every device\n\n56\n00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,640\nis gonna be communicating on our network,\nneeds to have an IP address.\n\n57\n00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,090\nOne of the things we want to make sure of,\nof course,\n\n58\n00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,050\nis that they're properly formatted.\n\n59\n00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,950\nAnd on Cisco equipment we generally also\nhave to include in that subnet mask and\n\n60\n00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,190\nmake sure that we also\ntype that out as well.\n\n61\n00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,070\nSo configuration things that\nwe want to make sure we\n\n62\n00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,540\nreally do keep at the forefront.\n\n63\n00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,760\n>> And subnet masks, right, let's\ntalk about subnet masks for a minute.\n\n64\n00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,260\nSo we've got this little set up here,\nlet me bring up my diagram,\n\n65\n00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,218\nwhere did that thing go.\n\n66\n00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,194\nHere we go.\n\n67\n00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,720\nSo my PC is 192.168.0.222, right?\n\n68\n00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,278\nAnd I'm plugged into a switch, and router\none, this router behind me, it's 192.\n\n69\n00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:26,850\n168.0.1.\n\n70\n00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,440\nNow, if we have a class C subnet mask.\n\n71\n00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,910\n255.255.255.0, then both of\nus are on the same network.\n\n72\n00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,150\nWe can communicate to each other and I can\ntalk directly to that router, all right.\n\n73\n00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,185\nBut, let's say I'm typing in here and\nI mess up my subnet mask.\n\n74\n00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,900\nAnd I put in something wrong?\n\n75\n00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,390\nIt's possible that we can\nsplit our network and\n\n76\n00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,570\nmake it where my PC can't\ncontact that router.\n\n77\n00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,120\nSo let me show an example of that.\n\n78\n00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,924\nI'm gonna just open up\na command prompt here, and\n\n79\n00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:02,040\nI'm gonna start a ping to 192.168.0.1.\n\n80\n00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,390\nAnd I can ping it right now.\n\n81\n00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,300\nEverything is happy.\n\n82\n00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,790\nYou know, I do a broadcast and\nthe router here,\n\n83\n00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,250\nit responds back because we did our\nprocess address resolution protocol.\n\n84\n00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,170\nSo we do that look up, I find the router.\n\n85\n00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,910\nI know it's on the same network as me and\nI know I can get to it.\n\n86\n00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,720\nAll right.\n\n87\n00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,927\nBut, if I go in and\npull up my network properties.\n\n88\n00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:28,170\nAnd I go in here and\nmodify my network card.\n\n89\n00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,467\nMy IP address is 192.168.0.222 and\n\n90\n00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:38,330\nthe router 192.168.01 is\non the same network as me.\n\n91\n00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,990\nIf I put in an incorrect subnet mask,\nlike 128 for example.\n\n92\n00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,992\n128 will divide this network in half.\n\n93\n00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:50,730\nSo we'll have 192.168.0.1 through 126.\n\n94\n00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:58,430\nAnd you'll have 192.168.0.129\nall the way through 120, or 254.\n\n95\n00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,300\nSo those are the the two\nranges that would be created.\n\n96\n00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,690\nTechnically, my computer\nwould be in the upper range.\n\n97\n00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,790\nThe router would be in the lower range.\n\n98\n00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,780\nAnd when I say okay to that, see\nthe complaint that Windows is giving me.\n\n99\n00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,800\nIt's saying the default gateway is\nnot on the same network segment,\n\n100\n00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,670\nare you sure you wanna save that.\n\n101\n00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,030\nUsually, you're operating system\nwill warn you, not all of them do.\n\n102\n00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,760\nLike Linux, Linux will let you do it.\n\n103\n00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,220\nWhatever, you're dumb, and\nit's not my problem to fix it for you.\n\n104\n00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,190\nSo if you save that,\nit's technically wrong.\n\n105\n00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,790\nAnd if I look at my output here,\nit'll let me put in that incorrect value.\n\n106\n00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,650\nNow, if I try and ping the router,\nI still get there.\n\n107\n00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,300\nOkay?\n\n108\n00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,670\nNow, why do I get there?\n\n109\n00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,670\nBecause it's ARP cached and\nit is still on my local network, right?\n\n110\n00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,000\nIn fact, let me, I didn't open this\nwith administrative privileges.\n\n111\n00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,112\nWe'll see if I can clear the ARP cache,\nif that'll go away.\n\n112\n00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:05,000\nThat's still making it.\n\n113\n00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,310\nSo I'm doing a broadcast and\nI'm finding that machine locally, but\n\n114\n00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,500\nif this was actually on a separate\nnetwork I wouldn't be able to get there.\n\n115\n00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,320\nI wouldn't be able to\ncontact my default gateway,\n\n116\n00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,340\nmy subnet mask wouldn't be telling\nme that I'm on a different network.\n\n117\n00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,870\n>> And this is very important to us,\nespecially when facing the exam.\n\n118\n00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,680\nDon't put it pass\n\n119\n00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,540\nthem on the exam to actually give\nyou a configuration like this.\n\n120\n00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,520\nAnd say, hey.\n\n121\n00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,020\nWhat is the issue that you cannot reach\nout to Amazon.com or whatever it might be.\n\n122\n00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,120\nAnd it could be something just as simple\nas looking at the default gateway.\n\n123\n00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,480\nSo usually when we start taking.\n\n124\n00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,020\nLook at that.\n\n125\n00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,160\nWe wanna take a look at that idea.\n\n126\n00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,290\nThat you normally start off with\nwhat you know has to be correct.\n\n127\n00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,470\nAnd so go ahead and\nmake sure you spot that.\n\n128\n00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,240\nIt doesn't take much, for\n\n129\n00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,226\nyou to actually accidentally have where\nthe subnet mask is .254 instead of .255.\n\n130\n00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:58,700\nAnd that actually changes\nit very quickly for us.\n\n131\n00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,250\nSo make sure you pay attention,\nespecially to things like the subnet mask.\n\n132\n00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,770\nAs well.\n\n133\n00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,190\n>> And, you know, one that gets me,\n\n134\n00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,100\nyou know, remember that this is\nthe CCENT exam, very first exam,\n\n135\n00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,290\nso it's not like they're going to be\nthrowing super tricky questions at you or\n\n136\n00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,930\nwhatever, it's mostly lowball stuff, and\nso it's not going to be too difficult.\n\n137\n00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,070\nSo simple things like typos\nare very prevalent and common.\n\n138\n00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,890\nSo if we take a look at like,\nyou know they might show us a scenario\n\n139\n00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,210\nwhere they give us a subnet mask and\na default gateway.\n\n140\n00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,270\nAnd they say, this machine, let me just\nget right there, we'll do like mine.\n\n141\n00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,930\nThey'll say like, this machine\ncannot get to Amazon.com, why not?\n\n142\n00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,840\nWhat's wrong here?\n\n143\n00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,200\nAnd as we look at it real quick,\nwe might not notice what's wrong.\n\n144\n00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,681\nAnd here, Ronnie, we'll put you on\nthe spot, do you spot the problem?\n\n145\n00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,881\n>> Oh, see?\n\n146\n00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:58,800\nYou got to take a second look!\n\n147\n00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,250\n>> At first glance, you know,\nit can be hard to spot!\n\n148\n00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,627\nThe pressures on.\n\n149\n00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,601\n>> Not yet.\n>> The sweat, it's starting to bead.\n\n150\n00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,325\n>> 186.\n\n151\n00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,417\n>> There you go, yeah.\n\n152\n00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,322\n>> I had to look at it, yep.\n\n153\n00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:16,079\n>> It's hard to see, but notice in my\ndefault gateway 192.186 instead of 168.\n\n154\n00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:22,030\nWe get so used to seeing those RFC 19,\n18 addresses, right?\n\n155\n00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,574\nThat we can quickly glance over\nthis stuff and not even notice!\n\n156\n00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:26,096\n>> Yep.\n\n157\n00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:32,890\n>> And\nanother common one would be something,\n\n158\n00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,580\nyou have a machine and a sub net mask,\n\n159\n00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,260\nand a default gateway.\n\n160\n00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,430\n>> And\nit's saying this machine can't get out,\n\n161\n00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,980\nwell the addresses are made of 10.1.11,\nlots of ones and zeros.\n\n162\n00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,450\nReally easy to mix and not notice that\nyou've got an 11 here, and a 10 here,\n\n163\n00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,365\nespecially since this\nis the opposite there.\n\n164\n00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We get in the habit of seeing that.\n\n165\n00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,320\nWhen I look at an address and I see\nthat it's a class C address like this,\n\n166\n00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,200\nI immediately start jumping\non that last octet.\n\n167\n00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,670\nAnd I see a 0 here, and\nI see a 0 here and I don't notice it.\n\n168\n00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,860\nReal easy for\nthis stuff to slip by, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,920\nSo, when you have a PC that's not able to\ncontact it's default gateway, or not able\n\n170\n00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,990\nto get out to the internet one of the\nfirst things we check is this right here.\n\n171\n00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,230\nIt's IP address, it's subnet mask,\nand it's default gateway.\n\n172\n00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,220\nAre they set properly?\n\n173\n00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,130\nAnd watch out for\nthose little simple typos.\n\n174\n00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,080\n>> And don't forget that this\nwould be true also if you were\n\n175\n00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,970\ngiven the configuration, let's say\non a switch and they're saying and\n\n176\n00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,150\nthey're saying that you\nneed to remotely manage.\n\n177\n00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,900\nAnd they show you\nthe switch configuration,\n\n178\n00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,310\nbut if you don't set that\ndefault gateway on the switch,\n\n179\n00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,590\nthat means you can't come in through\nthe router to actually remotely manage.\n\n180\n00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,390\nSo again, making sure those proper things\nare set in place are gonna be key for you.\n\n181\n00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,330\n>> Yep.\n\n182\n00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,580\n>> So those are some examples on the host\nside, what about on the router side?\n\n183\n00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,890\nBecause the objective is specifically\nsaying, wait where did it go?\n\n184\n00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,390\nProblems with IP addressing and\nhost configurations.\n\n185\n00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,060\nSo on the router side,\nwe assign our IP addresses to interfaces.\n\n186\n00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,760\nAnd we can have typos there.\n\n187\n00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,620\nTypos in the IP address,\ntypos in the subnet mask.\n\n188\n00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,880\nYou can't have two interfaces\nin the same network.\n\n189\n00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,950\nThey won't allow that.\n\n190\n00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,370\nSo, these are little\nproblems that we can have.\n\n191\n00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,200\nWe just have to go back, and\nverify and double check.\n\n192\n00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,750\n>> Don if you'll bring up your drawing\nagain, let me show you another common one\n\n193\n00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,662\nthat kind of tricks me\nevery once in a while here.\n\n194\n00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,520\n>> All right.\n>> So we take a look at this,\n\n195\n00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,440\nit's very easy to literally switch\nthe IP addresses on the interfaces.\n\n196\n00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,430\nDid not even notice when you actually have\n192.198.0.1 on the outside interface,\n\n197\n00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,510\nand the other one on the inside interface.\n\n198\n00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,440\nIf you're not paying attention to\nthe labeling, that will get you, too.\n\n199\n00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,100\nAnd so, you've got to make sure that you\ntake a look at the diagram that they give\n\n200\n00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,270\nyou, and that you actually do make\nsure that you match those things.\n\n201\n00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,770\nNow, a couple of other things as you\nactually face these things, right?\n\n202\n00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,780\nIn terms of diagrams,\na lot of times you'll see diagrams on\n\n203\n00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,410\nthe exam essentially that you'll get\nthat are highlighted in color, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,010\nAnd then you'll have some\nthat are kind of grayed out.\n\n205\n00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,130\nRemember you're not going to mess with\nany of the stuff that's grayed out.\n\n206\n00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,810\nThey're pretty much saying\nthis is configured perfectly.\n\n207\n00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,230\nSo focus in on what they give,\nyou to focus in on.\n\n208\n00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,810\nAnd remember that,\n\n209\n00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,420\none of the first things that we have\nto remember right, IP addressing,\n\n210\n00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,060\neverything on there has to be configured\ncorrectly, or it's not gonna to work.\n\n211\n00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,550\nSo, make sure you begin with that notion.\n\n212\n00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,600\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n213\n00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,340\nSo it really does just boil\ndown to keeping straight.\n\n214\n00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,150\nAnd sometimes on the exam they\ndon't give you the diagram.\n\n215\n00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,800\nThey give you a description, and\nshow you some config snippets.\n\n216\n00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,370\nSo my recommendation is\nalways to create a diagram.\n\n217\n00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,750\nThey give you dry erase boards,\nyou can draw one out.\n\n218\n00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,518\nReally helpful for\nmapping these interfaces.\n\n219\n00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,860\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nACLs a little bit later, and\n\n220\n00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,830\nyou really do need to draw\na diagram to keep ACLs straight.\n\n221\n00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,860\nThe other thing they mentioned though\nwas the dynamic configuration, or DACP.\n\n222\n00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,980\nAnd that's where we need to verify that\nour DACP servers are set up correctly.\n\n223\n00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,150\nSo remember that in order for\na router to issue out a DACP address,\n\n224\n00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,580\nit's got to have an interface\nthat's also on that network.\n\n225\n00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,970\nSo if we've got a DACP pool\nthat's in one network range.\n\n226\n00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,940\nBut, our router doesn't have\ninterfaces in that network range,\n\n227\n00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,730\nit's not gonna hand all those addresses.\n\n228\n00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,790\nSo we gotta make sure it's\nthe appropriate one, and\n\n229\n00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,040\nif you don't remember how to configure\nDACP, jump back to that episode,\n\n230\n00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,630\nwe covered that in one\nof the earlier episodes.\n\n231\n00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,580\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n232\n00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,340\n>> So, a lot of times when you face\nthese types of questions on the exam,\n\n233\n00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,130\nit usually is about either verifying\nthat everything is correct, or\n\n234\n00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,590\nthey're really pinpointing\na specific issue.\n\n235\n00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,550\nThe key on the exam, and we both\nmentioned this, is that timing is key,\n\n236\n00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,370\nin other words, it's critical.\n\n237\n00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,020\nSo when they say, here's the issue, don't\ntry and troubleshoot everything else.\n\n238\n00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,640\nFocus in on what they give you as well.\n\n239\n00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,530\nAnd make sure that you're answering\nthat particular question.\n\n240\n00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,970\nSo you might seize on things like,\n\n241\n00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,470\nwhere they're asking you\nto correct a configuration.\n\n242\n00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,470\nYou might see them on where you're saying,\nhere's what the configuration is.\n\n243\n00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,410\nWhat's the wrong problem here?\n\n244\n00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,850\nAnd they're making you\nfocus in on that issue, or\n\n245\n00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,045\nit can just be a multiple choice as well.\n\n246\n00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:14,835\n>> Yep, lots of variety on the exam,\nmakes it exciting.\n\n247\n00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:19,110\n>> Yeah, timing though is, so\nthis is where it actually makes sure that,\n\n248\n00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,720\nyou know how everything's\nset up correctly.\n\n249\n00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,110\nThat's gonna be probably your best friend,\nokay, by far.\n\n250\n00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,550\n>> All right.\nSo as far as the host configurations and\n\n251\n00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,120\nIP, it's usually just gonna be typos.\n\n252\n00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,450\nUsually just a matter of\nkeeping those straight.\n\n253\n00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,130\nBut, where the real fun comes in\nare some of the other things we get\n\n254\n00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,660\nto troubleshoot.\n\n255\n00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,820\nAnd that's what objective two is,\ntroubleshooting and\n\n256\n00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,940\nresolving VLAN,\nproblem is virtual local area networks.\n\n257\n00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,280\nNow, we showed you guys\nhow to set up VLANs,\n\n258\n00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,430\nwhere we can take individual\nports on the switch,\n\n259\n00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,040\nand slice them apart to be on different\nnetworks and isolate that out.\n\n260\n00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,700\nOne of the biggest problems that we have,\n\n261\n00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,400\nis just where VLANs are not\nproperly configured.\n\n262\n00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,060\nSo it can happen,\nit's not even a difficult thing to do,\n\n263\n00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,650\nto misconfigure a VLAN.\n\n264\n00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,658\nSo, let's take a look at some of the\nthings that can go wrong on a VLAN, and\n\n265\n00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,678\nI lost my connection to that switch.\n\n266\n00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,130\nAll right.\n\n267\n00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,360\nSo, here I'm in a switch.\n\n268\n00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,520\nAnd if I do a show VLAN,\nI can see that I've got a bunch of VLANs.\n\n269\n00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,780\nHere's some that we created in the show,\nwhere we covered VLAN.\n\n270\n00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,640\nSo there's the SHOW_VLAN and\nthe RONNIE_VLAN.\n\n271\n00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,880\n>> So they're sitting there.\n\n272\n00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,150\nAnd those VLANs as they are,\nthey say that they're active.\n\n273\n00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,630\nBut they're not really active,\nbecause there's no ports attached to them.\n\n274\n00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,790\n>> Right.\n>> For them to truly be active,\n\n275\n00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,870\nI've gotta stick some ports on there,\nright?\n\n276\n00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,570\nSo, I might go in and assign some ports.\n\n277\n00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,970\nAnd we'll usually use our interface\nrange command to do that.\n\n278\n00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,053\nSo, I might assign let's\nsay 12 through 23.\n\n279\n00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,866\nI might stick on VLAN 2,\n\n280\n00:14:56,866 --> 00:15:01,578\nand then I might do 24 through,\n\n281\n00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:05,460\nI don't know, what 35?\n\n282\n00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,757\nI might stick on VLAN 3.\n\n283\n00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:12,810\nAll right.\n\n284\n00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,065\nSo once that's done, now these\nVLANs actually have ports on them.\n\n285\n00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:17,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,910\n>> If I plug a PC into port 12, and\nI plug another PC into port 24,\n\n287\n00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,420\nthey're on two different VLANs and they're\nnot gonna be able to see each other,\n\n288\n00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,490\neven if I give them IP\naddresses in the same subnet.\n\n289\n00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,750\nThey still won't be able to see each\nother, cuz I've partitioned them out.\n\n290\n00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,730\nSo, if you're troubleshooting some kind\nof scenario where two PCs can't talk to\n\n291\n00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,510\neach other, first thing we've gotta\ndo is see what VLAN they're on.\n\n292\n00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,733\nAre they on the same VLAN, if so they can\ntalk, if they aren't then they can't.\n\n293\n00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:50,638\n>> Yeah another misconfiguration issue\nthat tends to happen is we create\n\n294\n00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:54,421\nthe VLANs themselves, and\nwe forget to assign the port to the VLAN.\n\n295\n00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:58,177\nSo, if you run that show VLAN\ncommand like we just showed yo.\n\n296\n00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,887\nAnd you now notice that, hey,\nI've got the VLAN configured,\n\n297\n00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:06,297\nbut it's still not actually communicating,\nmake sure whatever device is\n\n298\n00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:10,480\nsupposed to be in that same VLAN or\nthat port is actually in that VLAN.\n\n299\n00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,270\nThat's a big thing for us.\n\n300\n00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,350\nNow Don, if you scroll back\nup to where you configuring,\n\n301\n00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,710\nthere was something that I was trying\nto remember here that right up there.\n\n302\n00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,840\nA little bit higher.\n\n303\n00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,460\nLet me see.\n\n304\n00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,960\nWas there?\n\n305\n00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,520\nNo, that's it.\n\n306\n00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,126\nThe interface range command.\n\n307\n00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:30,770\nThe interface range command is\ngoing to be very important to you.\n\n308\n00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,150\nSometimes they ask you to configure\nthis as quickly as possible or\n\n309\n00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,000\nusing the least number of statements.\n\n310\n00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,172\nIf the question asks\nDon to configure ports\n\n311\n00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:47,620\nFa0/10 all the way through Fa0/19.\n\n312\n00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,130\nDon has two options, right?\n\n313\n00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,650\nHe can individually configure each port\nat a time and put them in the individual\n\n314\n00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,820\nVLANs, but knowing the interface\nrange command here is by far key.\n\n315\n00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,260\nAnd, this is the one that\ngets me right here, Don,\n\n316\n00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,230\nis the space dash space in\nbetween the actual port numbers.\n\n317\n00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,050\n>> It's very picky.\n\n318\n00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,770\n>> Very picky, because remember,\nsyntax has to be exact.\n\n319\n00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,240\nSo they show you multiple A,\n\n320\n00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,210\nB, Cs here, and you see some\nwithout spaces, some with spaces.\n\n321\n00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,080\nPay attention, and remember, if you here\nthat term, configure this as quickly\n\n322\n00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,940\nas possible, or\nas using the least number of commands.\n\n323\n00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,890\n>> Least administrative effort.\n\n324\n00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,420\n>> Yeah, something like that, yeah.\n\n325\n00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,620\nWhen they start doing that,\n\n326\n00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,160\nremember they're expecting\nyou to configure it that way.\n\n327\n00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,760\nOkay?\n>> All right,\n\n328\n00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,310\nnow let me show you\nsomething kind of neat.\n\n329\n00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,460\n>> Yep.\n>> I doubt this would show up on the CCENT\n\n330\n00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,520\nexam, but\nit could show up on the CCNA exam.\n\n331\n00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,130\n>> Yep.\n>> I just assigned a bunch of\n\n332\n00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,495\nports to VLANs, right?\n\n333\n00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:46,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,580\nAnd so if I look at VLAN 3,\n\n335\n00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,300\nRodney's VLAN, ports 24 through\n35 are now on VLAN 3, right?\n\n336\n00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,595\nWell, I could issue the no vlan 3 command,\nand that's gonna delete that vlan.\n\n337\n00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The vlan is gone.\n\n338\n00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:07,520\nAnd if I do a show vlan I can see that\nRonnie's vlan is gone, all right.\n\n339\n00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,280\nNow we would expect ports 20,\nwhat was it 24 through 35.\n\n340\n00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,910\n>> Yep.\n>> 24 through 35 would return back to\n\n341\n00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,040\nthe default VLAN of VLAN one.\n\n342\n00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,930\nBut if you look, they're not there.\n\n343\n00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,890\nOkay.\n\n344\n00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,010\nI deleted the vlan they\nwere attached to and\n\n345\n00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,380\nso if I take a look at\nthe ports themselves.\n\n346\n00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:32,720\nIf I do a show running dash config and\nI find ports 24 to 35,\n\n347\n00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,950\nsee how they're still set, switchport\naccess vlan3 but the v no longer exists.\n\n348\n00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,530\nSo what happens to these ports?\n\n349\n00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,720\n>> They're kind of out there.\n\n350\n00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,490\n>> They're isolated.\n\n351\n00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,350\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n352\n00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,615\nSo it's possible that if you have a PC\nthat's not communicating, and you look\n\n353\n00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:52,535\nat you say, it's supposed to be on vlan 3,\nit is on vlan 3 why isn't it talking?\n\n354\n00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,125\nThe port looks fine.\n\n355\n00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,665\nWell the port might be fine,\nbut the vlan might be broken.\n\n356\n00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,685\nAnd that's exactly what we're seeing here.\n\n357\n00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,065\nIt's easy to spot when you\nknow what you're looking for.\n\n358\n00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,965\nIf you're just looking at the interfaces,\nthey look fine.\n\n359\n00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:08,030\nSwitch board access vlan 3,\nthat's the command.\n\n360\n00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,407\nAnd if vlan 3 didn’t exist,\n\n361\n00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:14,790\nwhen you assign a port to it\nthat would create the vlan.\n\n362\n00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,960\nSo by all means this should be fine.\n\n363\n00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,090\nBut it isn’t.\n\n364\n00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,600\nInstead it’s now basically\nin a broken state.\n\n365\n00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,140\nNow if we were to reboot\nthe switch it would fix itself.\n\n366\n00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,310\nWhen it re ran these commands it\nwould recreate vlan 3 and be fine.\n\n367\n00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,270\nBut as it stands right now,\nat this moment, ports 25 or\n\n368\n00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,380\n24 thru 35 are basically broken\nuntil I go in and I recreate vlan 3.\n\n369\n00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,600\nNow that is the easy fix\nif I just say vlan 3.\n\n370\n00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,850\nWhat have we called it?\n\n371\n00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,120\nLike RONNIE VLAN or something like that.\n\n372\n00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,720\n>> It should be named.\n\n373\n00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,050\n>> Oh, shoot, not a description.\n\n374\n00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,860\nI'm thinking interfaces.\n\n375\n00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,530\n>> Thank you.\n\n376\n00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,140\nThere we go.\n\n377\n00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,820\nSo we can create that VLAN, and\nnow, when I pull up the VLAN data,\n\n378\n00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,330\nsee how ports 24 through 35\njump right back on that VLAN.\n\n379\n00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,380\nAnd now they're functional and\nhappy again.\n\n380\n00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,400\n>> Yeah, very important for\nus at some point for us here.\n\n381\n00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,500\nBut making sure that our ports are in the\ncorrect VLAN, making sure that the VLANs\n\n382\n00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,370\nexist are pretty much a good part of us\nunderstanding the troubleshooting there.\n\n383\n00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,270\nNow, there's other things\nthat could go wrong, but\n\n384\n00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,370\nthey're not the kind of things\nthat happen accidentally.\n\n385\n00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,260\nSomebody could disable a VLAN, right?\n\n386\n00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,040\nIn the VLAN status, you can disable it.\n\n387\n00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,980\nLet's see, how do you do that?\n\n388\n00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,730\nIt's shut down?\n\n389\n00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,520\nOh no, that shuts down.\n\n390\n00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,270\nI don't remember the actual.\n\n391\n00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,060\nActually that may well be it.\n\n392\n00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,500\nLet's see here.\n\n393\n00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,080\nNo, there's a different command that\nwill actually deactivate the VLAN and\n\n394\n00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,200\nI thought it was deactivate but\nI don't see that command on my list here.\n\n395\n00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,120\nBut you can actually deactivate it,\nstate that's it.\n\n396\n00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,660\nState suspend, there we go.\n\n397\n00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,420\nSee, question mark, that's really helpful.\n\n398\n00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,160\nSo somebody could suspend the VLAN, and\nwhen you do that, oh I have to get out.\n\n399\n00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,700\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,960\nSee how VLAN 3 shows as suspended?\n\n401\n00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,750\nSo, all of these machines that are plugged\ninto these ports are no longer\n\n402\n00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,440\ngonna be active.\n\n403\n00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,880\nBut, that's not something that's gonna\nshow up on the exam because you have to\n\n404\n00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,910\nmanually do that.\n\n405\n00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,630\nI can't think of any way that they\nwould accidentally get flagged and\n\n406\n00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,680\nsuspended, but that is a possibility.\n\n407\n00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,390\nThe tricky part about a problem like that,\nis that you don't see it in the config,\n\n408\n00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,630\nand that's because your\nVLAN configuration,\n\n409\n00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,900\naside from your port assignments,\ndoes not show up in configuration,\n\n410\n00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,950\nit's actually all stored\nin a separate file,\n\n411\n00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,220\nstored in this vlan.dat file and, there's\nno good way to see what's in there.\n\n412\n00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,720\n>> Yep.\n\n413\n00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,410\n>> So, you really are left\nwith the show VLAN command and\n\n414\n00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,260\nyou can see it's suspended right there,\nso I'll just go in and fix that.\n\n415\n00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,160\nAnd put it back.\n\n416\n00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,430\nNow, actually, I did have a problem\na second ago, and let me that out.\n\n417\n00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,470\nA lot of our VLAN commands\ndon't take effect until you get\n\n418\n00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,190\nout of the VLAN prompt.\n\n419\n00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,680\nSo when I disable that VLAN,\nit didn't disable right away,\n\n420\n00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,830\nI had to get out of the prompt first.\n\n421\n00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,910\nSo when you fix the problems,\nyou may need to do that also.\n\n422\n00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,830\nIf you test and it's not working,\n[COUGH] excuse me.\n\n423\n00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,040\nYou gotta get outta that vlan prompt\nfirst and then you should see it fixed.\n\n424\n00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,260\nAll right.\n\n425\n00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,970\nSo, those are some\nexamples of vlan problems.\n\n426\n00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,910\nAnd it could even be simply more\nsimple like you get two pc's that\n\n427\n00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,870\nare supposed to be talking to each other.\n\n428\n00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,620\nOne's on port 23 and one's on port 24,\nand they can't talk to each other.\n\n429\n00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,270\nSo you pull up the running config,\nand we jump down and\n\n430\n00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:54,060\nwe take a look at port 0/23 and 0/24, why\ncan't these two PCs talk to each other?\n\n431\n00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:00,120\nTwo different VLANs, the first one's\non VLAN 2, the second one's on VLAN 3.\n\n432\n00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,840\nAnd, they're not gonna be able to talk.\n\n433\n00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,180\nSo it could be as simple as that.\n\n434\n00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,650\nThis is one where it would be pretty\neasy for us to go in and fix.\n\n435\n00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,800\nWe could move one of them to vlan 3 or\nthe other to vlan 2 or\n\n436\n00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,830\nhowever we wanted to go.\n\n437\n00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,700\nDon't forget that,\n\n438\n00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,680\neven if you do have multiple hosts\non the same VLAN, remember that.\n\n439\n00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,180\nUnless you're using DHCP and\nyou're statically assigning IP addresses.\n\n440\n00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,230\nIf they're not in the same subnet, they're\nalso not gonna be able to communicate.\n\n441\n00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,430\nIf you statically assign one to one\nnetwork and one to another network.\n\n442\n00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,340\nBut, you put them both in vlan 3.\n\n443\n00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,380\nYou're gonna see that you're still\ngonna have some communication\n\n444\n00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,650\nproblems there too.\n\n445\n00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,160\n>> Absolutely.\n\n446\n00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,620\nSo, those are some examples\nof basic VLAN issues.\n\n447\n00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,720\nAnd they call out,\n\n448\n00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,900\nbasically checking your port membership,\nchecking that your VLANs are configured.\n\n449\n00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,410\nChecking that your IP\naddresses are configured.\n\n450\n00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,871\nEach VLAN is typically gonna\nhave its own IP subnet, so\n\n451\n00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,417\nif you have a PC plugged into a VLAN it's\ngotta have the right IP for that range.\n\n452\n00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,247\nSo, these are all things\nthat we need to verify, and\n\n453\n00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,922\nit really does just come\ndown to verification.\n\n454\n00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:03,087\nDouble checking to make sure that we\ndidn't make typos and other crazy, Yeah,\n\n455\n00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:08,327\nand there's no getting around the very\nfact that for both the CCENT and the CCNA,\n\n456\n00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:13,417\nthat knowing the IP addressing schemes,\nknowing the basics of subnetting and\n\n457\n00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:17,850\nactually becoming good at it,\nis a key to you passing the exam.\n\n458\n00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,280\nYou should, again, be able to do some\nof things we talked about earlier,\n\n459\n00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,930\nsuch as being able to identify the\nbroadcast address, as well as network ID.\n\n460\n00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,330\nBeing able to verify whether or\n\n461\n00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,950\nnot a computer is within the range\nthat they show you or not.\n\n462\n00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,860\nAll of those again are very important\nconcepts, especially when it comes to\n\n463\n00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,700\ntroubleshooting, just like we saw in the\nvery beginning here when we actually had\n\n464\n00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,260\nour default gateway on one network and\nour host on another network.\n\n465\n00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n466\n00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,310\n>> So make sure you go over those.\n\n467\n00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,750\n>> All right.\nSo let's see.\n\n468\n00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,505\nFor the next part we're gonna\ntake a look at VLAN trunking.\n\n469\n00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:52,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now there is a lot that\n\n470\n00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,270\ncan go wrong\n>> Right.\n\n471\n00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,040\n>> When it comes to VLAN trunking so\nwe definitely want to tackle that.\n\n472\n00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,770\nBut before we do it we are getting\npretty close to our break time.\n\n473\n00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,080\nSo, let's stop here and take a break.\n\n474\n00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,000\nWhen we get back we're gonna use\nsome more trouble shooting we'll\n\n475\n00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,590\ncreat some problems on these switches and\nget to see some entertaining stuff and\n\n476\n00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,982\nthen we'll continue on to our ACL's and\nsome other stuff.\n\n477\n00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,706\nAll right, so ladies and gentleman\nstay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n478\n00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:17,623\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n479\n00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:23,373\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n480\n00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:26,881\nSo, let's see, so we left off\ntalking about some troubleshooting,\n\n481\n00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:30,480\nwe troubleshoot IP addressing or\nwhatever, and a little bit of VLANS.\n\n482\n00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,550\nWe want to take a look at trunks now,\nso when we're trunking between switches,\n\n483\n00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,660\nthere are a number of different\nproblems that can creep up.\n\n484\n00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,110\nAnd I want to show that.\n\n485\n00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,870\nWhat I've got is,\nI've basically got two switches, and\n\n486\n00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,360\nI've got an uplink cable\nrun in between them.\n\n487\n00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,350\nPort three.\n\n488\n00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,800\nSo, port three on one switch is run\nto port three on the other switch and\n\n489\n00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,020\nI can verify that real quick with\na show CDP neighbors command.\n\n490\n00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,760\nSo I can see that port 3 right there,\nconnected to port 3 on the other side.\n\n491\n00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,980\nSo it's just a crossover cable and\nit's run between them.\n\n492\n00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,290\nNow, these two switches are both\nCisco 3560s, all right?\n\n493\n00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,128\nAnd with Cisco 3560s, when you plug\na crossover cable from one switch into\n\n494\n00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:16,400\nanother switch switch what happens, right?\n\n495\n00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,920\nIt's important to understand the default\nstate of trunking on a Cisco switch.\n\n496\n00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,230\nAlmost every Cisco switch supports DTP,\ndynamic trunking protocol.\n\n497\n00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,450\nAnd that means that even if\nwe don't configure a trunk,\n\n498\n00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,430\nthere are certain scenarios\n>> Where a trunk will be built up,\n\n499\n00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,390\nall right?\n\n500\n00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,640\nBut if I take a look at this,\nif I say show interface trunk, all right?\n\n501\n00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,400\nAnd I look at it, well sure enough\nright there I can see port fa0/3,\n\n502\n00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,990\ntrunking is on and\ncapsulation is 802.1q, I'm trunking.\n\n503\n00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,610\nIf I look at the other switch.\n\n504\n00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,690\nShow interface trunk.\n\n505\n00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,260\nWhat'll I get?\n\n506\n00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,020\nNothing.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,778\n>> Right? No interfaces >> Right.\n\n508\n00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:58,471\n>> Are trunking in the other\n\n509\n00:26:58,471 --> 00:26:59,540\nswitch.\n>> Hmm.\n\n510\n00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,930\nYeah.\n>> Why is there a disparity?\n\n511\n00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,780\nWhy is one side thinking\nthat it's trunking?\n\n512\n00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,670\nWell, let's look at the actual\ninterface configuration, so\n\n513\n00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,430\nI'm gonna do a show\nrunning-config interface fa0/3.\n\n514\n00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,380\nAll right.\n\n515\n00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,300\nThis one is hard set as a trunk.\n\n516\n00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,960\nSwitch board access Vlan 333.\n\n517\n00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,020\nSwitchboard trunk encapsulation .1q,\nand switch board mode trunk,\n\n518\n00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,030\nswitch board no negotiate.\n\n519\n00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,880\nIf I look at this other switch...\n\n520\n00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,831\nIt's got the default config.\n\n521\n00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,748\nInterface, FA 0/3, and that's it.\n\n522\n00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:36,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n523\n00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,140\n>> All right.\n\n524\n00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,060\nSo, what's going on here?\n\n525\n00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,800\nHow does dynamic trunking protocol work.\n\n526\n00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,950\nFirst, that's kind of what\nwe need to understand.\n\n527\n00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,950\nWith dynamic chunking protocol,\nthere's really three states, all right?\n\n528\n00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,990\nAnd one of those states\nis being turned off.\n\n529\n00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,690\nWhen we say switchport nonegotiate,\n\n530\n00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,990\nthat turns off dynamic chunking protocol,\nDTP.\n\n531\n00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,990\nSo DTP is off on the top switch,\nbut DTP is on on the bottom switch.\n\n532\n00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,410\nIt's a default command, so\nit just doesn't show up here.\n\n533\n00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,000\nSo it is on.\n\n534\n00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,380\nSo Dynamic Trunking Protocol says,\n\n535\n00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,560\nwe can automatically create a trunk\neven if it's not configured.\n\n536\n00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,310\nThe top part is configured.\n\n537\n00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,305\nThe bottom part isn't.\n\n538\n00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:21,145\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And the bottom part, the bottom switch,\n\n539\n00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:25,425\nswitch one is set to the default and\non Cisco switches\n\n540\n00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:30,498\nthe default is either going to\nbe DTP set to auto or desirable.\n\n541\n00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:33,000\nThose are our two modes,\nauto or desirable.\n\n542\n00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,880\nWhen you're in auto mode,\nin auto mode it says, if someone else\n\n543\n00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,060\nasks us to become a trunk, we'll become\na trunk, but if nobody asks us, we won't.\n\n544\n00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,770\nWith auto, I'm sorry that was auto,\n\n545\n00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,860\nwith desirable, that says we will\nactively ask somebody to be a trunk.\n\n546\n00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,570\nAnd if they say yes we'll\nbuild up a trunk and\n\n547\n00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,435\nif they say no we'll\njust be an access port.\n\n548\n00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n549\n00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,270\nBut when you've got one\nside with DTP turned off,\n\n550\n00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,635\neven if the trunk is manually defined.\n\n551\n00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n552\n00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,440\n>> The other side is not going to\ntrunk with you unless you manually\n\n553\n00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,228\ndefine it there also.\n\n554\n00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,930\nIf you're gonna manually define it on\none end you've got to do it on the other\n\n555\n00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,220\nwhen you're disabling DTP.\n\n556\n00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,720\nAll right.\n\n557\n00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,280\nNow I personally always disable DTP.\n\n558\n00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,430\nI hate it, I hate dynamic things.\n\n559\n00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,830\nI like to know that it's\ngonna trunk all the time.\n\n560\n00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,960\nSo this top one, that's how I normally\nconfigure my trunks right there.\n\n561\n00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,640\nBut you don't have to, so for\nexample if I go up here into switch 2, and\n\n562\n00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,210\ninto FA0/3, I can say,\n\n563\n00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:44,250\nswitchboard access vLan 1, that's the\ndefault right here, normally on vLan 1,\n\n564\n00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,300\nI can say switch port mode.\n\n565\n00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,570\nAnd then I can just set it to dynamic.\n\n566\n00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,450\nLet's see, on a 3560 the default is auto,\ndynamic auto.\n\n567\n00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,320\nNow that's important because on the 3550,\nthe default was desirable.\n\n568\n00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,010\nSo you get different settings\nbetween different switches.\n\n569\n00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,900\nSo, if you take two 3560s, that are set to\ndefault and you plug it in to each other,\n\n570\n00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,060\nit's not gonna build a trunk because\nthey're both set to auto by default.\n\n571\n00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,700\nBut if you take a 3550, and plug it\nin to a 3560 it will build a trunk.\n\n572\n00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,800\nBecause one is set to auto and\nthe other is set to desirable and\n\n573\n00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,330\nthey'll build up that session.\n\n574\n00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,050\nNow it's complaining here that I tried\nto flip it to dynamic when I have DTP\n\n575\n00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:39,200\ndisabled, so I do need to say\nno switchport nonegotiate,\n\n576\n00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360\nthat will turn DTP back on and\nthen I can put us back in to auto mode.\n\n577\n00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,100\nAnd then I can say switchport\ntrunk encapsulation,\n\n578\n00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,200\nand you'll see that I can set\nthat one to negotiate also.\n\n579\n00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,480\nAll right.\n\n580\n00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,140\nAnd now let's take a look\nat that interface.\n\n581\n00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,081\nAll right.\n\n582\n00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:06,207\nNow, oh minus the let me\nduplex auto there, all right.\n\n583\n00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:10,449\nSo now, fa0 slas three up here\nis configured the default way,\n\n584\n00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:13,230\nfa0/3 down here is the default.\n\n585\n00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,140\nTo make sure I get a good, clean\ntransition, I'm gonna shut the port down.\n\n586\n00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,331\nAnd you know what?\nLet me.\n\n587\n00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:27,350\nLet me turn on logging.\n\n588\n00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,170\nLogging's already on.\n\n589\n00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,869\nI'm turning it on so I can see the logs.\n\n590\n00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,060\nAnd let's see what happens here,\nall right?\n\n591\n00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,640\nThese interfaces are going to come up,\nand there I see fa0/3 changes to up,\n\n592\n00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,920\nspanning tree protocol\nis gonna kick in and\n\n593\n00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,745\ndo its thing, it's gonna recognize\nthe ports are up and negotiate that out.\n\n594\n00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:50,645\nSo looking back here I should\nsee some orange lights and I do.\n\n595\n00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:53,601\nThat'll last for\n30 seconds while it does loop detection.\n\n596\n00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,856\nAfter 30 seconds though,\nthe ports will go active and\n\n597\n00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:59,014\nthat's when the trunking kicks in.\n\n598\n00:31:59,014 --> 00:31:59,711\nAll right.\n\n599\n00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,844\nThey're both set to the default so\nthey're both set to dynamic trunking.\n\n600\n00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:07,130\nAnd they're both set to auto.\n\n601\n00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,350\nAnd that just means if somebody asks,\nwe'll build up a trunk.\n\n602\n00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,106\nBut if both ebbs are set that way,\nnobody's ever gonna ask.\n\n603\n00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:16,431\nRight?\n\n604\n00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:20,690\nNo one's gonna ask and\nthen it just doesn't get there.\n\n605\n00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,340\nSo, let's just give it a second for\n\n606\n00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,530\nthose ports to come up,\nwe should be close, still orange lights.\n\n607\n00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,580\nAnd, you know I could say,\nshow spanning tree here, and\n\n608\n00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,450\nwe can spot, it just flipped it for\nme, all right.\n\n609\n00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,380\nSo, if I look back here, yep,\nwell no, I got a green light on one,\n\n610\n00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,119\nand an orange light on another, so\nit may be unhappy about something.\n\n611\n00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,280\nYou know what,\nI just wasn't giving it time.\n\n612\n00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,630\nOne switch is behind the other.\n\n613\n00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,020\nOne switch has gone green,\nI think we might have created a loop.\n\n614\n00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,520\nLet's see.\n\n615\n00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,820\nDid we create a loop?\n\n616\n00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,450\nNot there.\n\n617\n00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,235\nAnd here we did.\n\n618\n00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:04,620\nYeah, we created a loop.\n\n619\n00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,910\nSo let's see I am connected\nin on this this system so\n\n620\n00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:17,672\nI don't wanna, [LAUGH] let's see how can\nI not create a loop on this one [LAUGH]\n\n621\n00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:25,826\nWell, you know, for right now, with that\nport being down on this switch, let's see,\n\n622\n00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:27,700\nI'm trying to think of the best way.\n\n623\n00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,880\nIt's kind of hard, you know, for you\nguys at home, it's kind of hard to like\n\n624\n00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,980\nbreak a switch on purpose because\nthe system switches have so\n\n625\n00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,140\nmuch in them to protect you from\nthe problems that you create.\n\n626\n00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,000\nSo I've got a little bit of a loop here.\n\n627\n00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,160\nYou know what I'll do?\n\n628\n00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,310\nI will switch to, I'll take switch two and\nconnect to it via a console cable.\n\n629\n00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,690\n>> Yep\n>> There we go, so\n\n630\n00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,700\nthat I can sever it from the network\nwhich will fix the loop.\n\n631\n00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,620\nSo let me get rid of switch two here.\n\n632\n00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:03,110\nAnd I'll jump over to a console port and\nthat'll take care of that.\n\n633\n00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:09,180\nAnd now I can have my nice broken\nnetwork just the way I want it.\n\n634\n00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:22,020\nOkay, so that port is now up.\n\n635\n00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,930\nAlthough this end doesn't\nseem to think so.\n\n636\n00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,410\nIs it still blocking?\n\n637\n00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,210\nNope, there we go.\n\n638\n00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,860\nWe're up.\nOkay, all right.\n\n639\n00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,260\nSo at this point, if I take a look at\n\n640\n00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,460\nMy two interfaces,\nthey're both configured for the defaults.\n\n641\n00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,930\nSo all I see is interface FastInternet0/3,\nand then an end.\n\n642\n00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,960\nThat's it for those interfaces.\n\n643\n00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,140\nIf I do a show interface trunk\n\n644\n00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:03,120\nI can see there's no trunks on switch\none And no trunks on switch two.\n\n645\n00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,020\nAll right?\n\n646\n00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:11,850\nWith Dynamic Trunking Protocol,\nif both ends are set to auto, nobody asks.\n\n647\n00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,000\nThey're both sitting there saying,\nhey, if somebody else asks me,\n\n648\n00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,410\nwe'll become a trunk.\n\n649\n00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,870\nBut if nobody asks,\nwe'll stay an access port.\n\n650\n00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,420\nAnd that's exactly what\nthey're doing right now.\n\n651\n00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,020\nThey're staying access ports.\n\n652\n00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,290\nAll right.\n\n653\n00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:29,220\nThe easiest way to fix this is to simply\nset one end to desirable, or both ends,\n\n654\n00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,990\nif both ends are desirable, they'll\nboth ask and they'll build a trunk.\n\n655\n00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,380\nBut at least one end is\ngonna be set to desirable.\n\n656\n00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,050\nIf you've got a 35 50 switch,\nthey're desirable by default.\n\n657\n00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,720\nOn a 35 60, they're auto by default.\n\n658\n00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,480\nIt changes.\n\n659\n00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,440\nWe need to remember that.\n\n660\n00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,740\nSo on switch two here,\nI can just get into that interface.\n\n661\n00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:53,129\nAnd I can say, switch\n\n662\n00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:59,721\nport trunk mode dynamic.\n\n663\n00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:04,388\nOh, actually, it's switch port mode trunk.\n\n664\n00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:05,597\nNope.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n665\n00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,930\n>> Hang on a second, here.\n\n666\n00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,888\nWhat is going on?\n\n667\n00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:10,138\nDid I turn it off by accident?\n\n668\n00:36:10,138 --> 00:36:16,388\n[SOUND]\nHm.\n\n669\n00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:18,888\nWell, that is fun.\n\n670\n00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:19,638\n>> I don't.\n\n671\n00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:27,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n672\n00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,540\nOh, there it is.\n\n673\n00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,430\n>> I'm just gonna reject.\n\n674\n00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,305\nSo, switchport mode dynamic.\n\n675\n00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:41,944\nSwitchport trunk mode dynamic and\nam I doing the same typo over?\n\n676\n00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:42,961\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I think,\n\n677\n00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,096\nit's just switchport mode dynamic.\n\n678\n00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:46,846\n>> Yeah, that's what I typed it in.\n\n679\n00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,471\n>> No.\nYou just typed in switchport trunk.\n\n680\n00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,055\nMode.\n\n681\n00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:52,240\n>> There you go.\n>> There we go, okay.\n\n682\n00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,764\nI was losing it too.\n\n683\n00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:56,162\n>> I know it's there.\n>> All right, so if I take this end here,\n\n684\n00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:57,888\nif I can remember my commands.\n\n685\n00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:00,380\nAnd I'm gonna set this\none to be desirable.\n\n686\n00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,550\nThere we go.\n\n687\n00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,245\nSo now the top one is desirable,\nthe bottom one is auto.\n\n688\n00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:08,875\nIf they're both desirable,\nor if one is desirable and\n\n689\n00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,795\nthe other is auto,\nthey will build a trunk.\n\n690\n00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:15,275\nAnd in fact I just saw it, the interfaces\nwent down, now they're gonna come back up,\n\n691\n00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,875\nand it should build a trunk.\n\n692\n00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,445\nIf I do a do show interface trunk.\n\n693\n00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:25,070\nI can see that I am\ntrunking on port three.\n\n694\n00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,710\nMy mode is desirable.\n\n695\n00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:32,090\nAnd then, down here,\nif I do a show interface trunk,\n\n696\n00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,750\nI can see fa0/3 mode is auto.\n\n697\n00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,310\n>> Auto.\n\n698\n00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,640\n>> Desirable up here, auto down here.\n\n699\n00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,160\nThey built out a trunk.\n\n700\n00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,428\nIt's up and it's happy.\n\n701\n00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:41,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n702\n00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,630\n>> All right.\n\n703\n00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,600\nNow there is one interesting thing.\n\n704\n00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,767\nNotice under the encapsulation type here,\nthe encapsulation type n-isl.\n\n705\n00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,320\nThe n means it was negotiated.\n\n706\n00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,238\nIt negotiated out to use\nan encapsulation type and it picked ISL.\n\n707\n00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:58,613\nISL is Inter Switch Link, and\n\n708\n00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:04,400\nit's a proprietary trunking\nprotocol from Cisco, all right?\n\n709\n00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,230\nNot every switch supports it, and\nno third party switch support it, right?\n\n710\n00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:15,270\nAlmost everyone on the entire planet\nusing 802.1QV land tagging instead.\n\n711\n00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,710\nBut when you use negotiation like\nthis they will pick ISL by default.\n\n712\n00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,335\nNot if we take one end of the cable.\n\n713\n00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,947\n[SOUND] We can tell it and\n\n714\n00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:33,470\nforce it to use .1q for example.\n\n715\n00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,740\nAll right.\n\n716\n00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,960\nAnd when do that I'm gonna tell it to use\n.1q, and watch what's gonna happen here.\n\n717\n00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,980\nThe interface is gonna go down,\nand it's gonna come back up, and\n\n718\n00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,400\nwhen they go to negotiate out,\n\n719\n00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,230\nthis time they'll negotiate out 802.1Q\nbecause the top one was hard set.\n\n720\n00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,890\nSo we can influence\nthe decisions that it makes,\n\n721\n00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:58,760\nit should come up pretty quick,\nthere we go.\n\n722\n00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,260\n>> Yep.\n\n723\n00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,760\n>> And now I can see that\nI've got an automatic trunk.\n\n724\n00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,347\nUp at the top it is hard set to 802.1q.\n\n725\n00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:12,482\nDown at the bottom,\nit is negotiated 802.1q.\n\n726\n00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,270\n>> Yep.\n\n727\n00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,370\n>> All right.\n\n728\n00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,705\nNow, for me, though.\n\n729\n00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:17,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n730\n00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,740\nI don't like to trust dynamic stuff.\n\n731\n00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,490\n>> Right.\n>> I'm all about the hard set.\n\n732\n00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,280\nSo let me change these so\neverything is hard set.\n\n733\n00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,940\nWe want to manually define everything.\n\n734\n00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,730\nWe say switchboard trunk,\nencapsulation.1Q,\n\n735\n00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:36,460\nso I manually set that,\nswitchboard mode trunk,\n\n736\n00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,378\nthat tells it you will be a trunk,\nnone of this access port stuff.\n\n737\n00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,490\nSwitchboard, no negotiate,\nif I can spell it.\n\n738\n00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah no negotiate.\n\n739\n00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,790\nThat says don't do any kind of\ndynamic trunking protocol stuff.\n\n740\n00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,260\nYou are going to be a trunk.\n\n741\n00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,600\nYou are gonna need your .1q and you don't\ncare what's on the other end of that line.\n\n742\n00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,080\nThis is how it's gonna be, all right?\n\n743\n00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,060\nI like this configuration\nbecause I know I can rely on it.\n\n744\n00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,350\nI know exactly what it is gonna\nbe at the end of the day.\n\n745\n00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,955\nAnd as long as we follow the same set up\non the other end, we'll be in good shape.\n\n746\n00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:10,721\nAll right.\n\n747\n00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:15,680\nSo I'm just gonna take that and\njump down here.\n\n748\n00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,460\nAnd, I guess,\n\n749\n00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,060\nif I get in to the interface that'll\nprobably make a bit of a difference.\n\n750\n00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,000\nThere we go.\n\n751\n00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,250\nAnd I'll do the same thing.\n\n752\n00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,801\nI'm hard setting it to dot1q,\nI'm hard setting it as a trunk, and\n\n753\n00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:27,455\nI'm outright disabling\ndynamic trunking protocol.\n\n754\n00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,625\nAnd I'm just gonna reset the port.\n\n755\n00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,675\nYou don't normally have to reset the port,\nbut it's a good idea.\n\n756\n00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:37,645\nIn fact, in a lot of the Cisco\nmanuals from the big guys,\n\n757\n00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,220\nlike the CCIEs and stuff.\n\n758\n00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,100\nThey'll tell you whenever\nyou're changing trunk settings,\n\n759\n00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,370\nit's a good idea to just shut down one end\nof the trunk, make all of your changes and\n\n760\n00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,890\nthen turn the trunk back on.\n\n761\n00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,010\nOtherwise, it can send partial data\nwhile you're doing the configuration and\n\n762\n00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,050\nyou can get some data\ncorruption on the network.\n\n763\n00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,260\nSo it's better to shut one end down,\nmake your changes and turn it back on.\n\n764\n00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,080\n>> So Don, let's review these commands\nthat we were just talking about again.\n\n765\n00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,700\nSo that we make sure that our viewers\nunderstand what's going on here.\n\n766\n00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,010\nSo remember that by default our\nswitches are normally gonna to set to\n\n767\n00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,010\nauto negotiate or auto.\n\n768\n00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,690\nIn terms of the dynamic trunking protocol.\n\n769\n00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,517\nAnd so when we have the idea\nof auto on one side and\n\n770\n00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,652\nauto on the other side,\ntrunking occurring, Don?\n\n771\n00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:20,440\n>> No.\n\n772\n00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,680\n>> No, yep.\n\n773\n00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,830\nSo trunking is not going to occur there.\n\n774\n00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,660\nBut if we have one side set at auto and\n\n775\n00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,530\nthe other side set as desirable,\nwe should be able to trunk there.\n\n776\n00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,780\nFor us, though,\nwe like the idea of actually doing what?\n\n777\n00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,420\nHard setting it is pretty much the key.\n\n778\n00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,684\nThat's the way that actually helps\nyou to not have to worry about, hey,\n\n779\n00:41:39,684 --> 00:41:40,605\nis that set to auto?\n\n780\n00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:43,650\nIs this a 3550, 3560 here?\n\n781\n00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,260\nBy hard coding it, at least on one side,\nand then on the other side\n\n782\n00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,720\nsetting it to whatever you want to, is\nprobably going to actually help you out.\n\n783\n00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,710\nBut normally we want to take both\nsides and hard set them as well, okay?\n\n784\n00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,330\nThat's the only way we know that\nwe don't have to worry about it,\n\n785\n00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,450\nwe know what we put in it.\n\n786\n00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,190\n>> Yep.\n\n787\n00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,280\nSo now when I look at it I\ncan see my mode is set to on.\n\n788\n00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,227\nIt's not auto,\nit's not desirable, it is on.\n\n789\n00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,690\nAnd there is no n before my encapsulation.\n\n790\n00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,490\nIt's hard set 802.1q,\nit's the same on both ends.\n\n791\n00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,430\nI'm now trunking, it's up,\nit's happy and we're good to go.\n\n792\n00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:22,840\nWe can't over emphasize\nthe show commands here, okay?\n\n793\n00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,670\nDo not rely on just a show\nrunning config commands.\n\n794\n00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,155\nFor you and me, we have to make sure that\nany of these commands that we've been\n\n795\n00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:32,470\ndoing in the CCNT ENT.\n\n796\n00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,071\nThe show commands that we do,\nespecially these very specific ones,\n\n797\n00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,865\nlike show interface trunk,\nand even then using the do\n\n798\n00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:42,488\ncommand at the beginning here,\nis gonna be your friend on this exam.\n\n799\n00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:45,075\nSo that you can get to what\nthe information that you need to see\n\n800\n00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:46,290\nvery quickly.\n\n801\n00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,280\nOkay?\n>> Yep.\n\n802\n00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,370\nNow, in this scenario,\nI hard set what the encapsulation was,\n\n803\n00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,190\nit is possible to have it set incorrectly.\n\n804\n00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:01,003\nWe could say switchboard trunk\nencapsulation, isl, all right?\n\n805\n00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:08,048\nWhen I do that the top one is set to isl,\nthe bottom was set to 802.1q, all right?\n\n806\n00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:12,035\nThey're both hard set as trunks,\nall right?\n\n807\n00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:16,046\nAnd so when I take a look at it,\nit shows that I'm trunking, and\n\n808\n00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:19,706\nit says that I'm up and\ntrunking because it's hard set.\n\n809\n00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:25,412\nAnd when I look down here, it still thinks\nthat it's trunking because it's hard set.\n\n810\n00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:29,132\nIf this were in automatic, they would've\nnegotiated out the right thing.\n\n811\n00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:33,000\nBut when you start hard setting stuff,\nnow, I don't even get a message.\n\n812\n00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,022\n>> Right.\n>> I don't even get a warning,\n\n813\n00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:36,932\nmy VLAN1 interface is flapping,\nfor whatever reason, but-\n\n814\n00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:37,744\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n815\n00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:38,784\n>> But if I were to shut\n\n816\n00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,320\nthis interface down, and\njust let it go down.\n\n817\n00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,500\nAll right.\n\n818\n00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,840\nAnd then bring it back online.\n\n819\n00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,350\nWell, we have to wait our 30 seconds for\nspanning through protocol but\n\n820\n00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,940\nit is going to come back up.\n\n821\n00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,020\nAnd when it does come back up, it's going\nto think that it's trunking, all right?\n\n822\n00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,400\nAnd that's because when it's hard set,\n\n823\n00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,710\nit doesn't do any verification\non the other end.\n\n824\n00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,240\nSo you could have a trunk that\non both ends says its trunking.\n\n825\n00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,200\nIt looks happy, but\ndata is not flowing over it.\n\n826\n00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,070\nIf one end is set to isl and\nthe other end is set to 802.1q,\n\n827\n00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,900\nthey're not going to match up.\n\n828\n00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,860\nSo what I like to do is exactly\nwhat I've done here on the screen.\n\n829\n00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,780\nI like to get my two switches open at\nthe same time so I can do a nice little\n\n830\n00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,260\noutput of the command.\n\n831\n00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,170\nAnd I can pull up\nthe configuration of one end, and\n\n832\n00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,950\npull up the configuration of the other\nend and then just compare them, right?\n\n833\n00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,620\nThey're both set to mode trunk.\n\n834\n00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,440\nThey're both set to no negotiate.\n\n835\n00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,580\nThis one's set to isl.\n\n836\n00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,350\nThis one's set to dot1q.\n\n837\n00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,702\nReal easy to spot when they're\nside by side like this.\n\n838\n00:44:43,702 --> 00:44:45,740\nOr I guess top and bottom.\n\n839\n00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,920\n>> And Don, this is a good\nexample of maybe a simulate or\n\n840\n00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,680\na simulation that we might have.\n\n841\n00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,920\nWhere they show one particular\npoint on the top and\n\n842\n00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,710\nthen they show you the other one and\nthey ask you to fix it.\n\n843\n00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,277\nNot going to be too much that you're gonna\nfix, but at least they'll actually maybe\n\n844\n00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:04,772\nshow you the encapsulation.isl and\nthe encapsulation.1q.\n\n845\n00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,073\nAnd they're asking you to correct it.\n\n846\n00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:10,360\nSo it's very possible that you might get\nsomething very close to that as well.\n\n847\n00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,580\n>> Yeah, this is a hard one to\ntroubleshoot because there's no error\n\n848\n00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,480\nmessage, there's nothing in the logs,\neven CDP isn't warning us about this.\n\n849\n00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,230\nAll we can do is we can go in and\n\n850\n00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,340\nwe can look, compare the configuration\nside by side, and then we'll spot it.\n\n851\n00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,850\nWe'll set that problem where it's set\nto isl, we can reset it to dot1q,\n\n852\n00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,140\nthe interface will go down,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n853\n00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,320\n>> The interface will come back up, and\n\n854\n00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,310\nthen traffic will begin to\nflow across that line again.\n\n855\n00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,540\nAll right, so keep that in mind.\n\n856\n00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,330\nThose are some of the issues that we\ncan have that can cause the entire\n\n857\n00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,739\ntrunk to just fail to come up.\n\n858\n00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,300\nLet's see a couple of other things.\n\n859\n00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,140\nThey don't mention it in the objectives,\nbut you could have a native VLAN mismatch.\n\n860\n00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,030\nNotice when I do the show\ninterface trunk command\n\n861\n00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,670\nthat one of the things that it\noutputs is what the native VLAN is.\n\n862\n00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,040\nAnd now I'm getting word wrap or whatever.\n\n863\n00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,840\nThe native VLAN on\nthe right side is a one.\n\n864\n00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,790\nThe native VLAN on the left\nside is also a one.\n\n865\n00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,570\nThen if the native VLAN were\nwrong on the two sides,\n\n866\n00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,390\nif they were different,\nthat would be problem also.\n\n867\n00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,933\nIt would cause VLAN bleeding, traffic from\none VLAN bleeding over to another VLAN.\n\n868\n00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:25,480\nNow CDP usually discovers this one and\nwarns us about it.\n\n869\n00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,083\nSo for example, if I were to change it,\n\n870\n00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:33,684\nif I were to say switchboard\ntrunk native VLAN 2.\n\n871\n00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:34,541\nOkay.\n\n872\n00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,010\nSo now, on the left side, it's VLAN 1.\n\n873\n00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,320\nOn the right side, it's VLAN 2.\n\n874\n00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,650\nLook what I get, right.\n\n875\n00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,820\nCDP immediately starts warning me saying,\nyou got some issues, right.\n\n876\n00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,950\nActually, this is spanning\ntree warning me here.\n\n877\n00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:51,160\nSo, spanning tree is telling me,\nwe're getting BPDU's on the wrong VLAN and\n\n878\n00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,150\neventually CDP will warn us also.\n\n879\n00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,570\nThere's CDP right there.\n\n880\n00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,030\nSo native VLAN mismatch.\n\n881\n00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,310\nSo I'm actually getting warned\nfrom multiple systems, CDP and\n\n882\n00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,480\nspanning tree all letting us know.\n\n883\n00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,845\nA mismatched native VLAN is a big deal\nwhen you're connecting one VLAN to\n\n884\n00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:07,479\ndifferent VLAN, which you shouldn't do.\n\n885\n00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,450\nIt's pretty hard to make\nthat mistake though, right?\n\n886\n00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,610\nLook at my screen,\nit's just smattered with garbage now.\n\n887\n00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,001\nSo it's pretty easy to\nspot that happening.\n\n888\n00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,933\nAll right.\n\n889\n00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:24,226\nRonnie, looking at the timer,\nwe're starting to run a little low,\n\n890\n00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:26,827\nI know we still have the allowed VLAN's.\n\n891\n00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:29,480\nWhich actually we probably have enough\ntime to tackle that one don't we?\n\n892\n00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,490\n>> Yep.\n>> And then we still have ACLs for\n\n893\n00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,020\nafter the break.\n\n894\n00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,190\nAll right, there we go.\n\n895\n00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,210\nNotice when I fix the problem we actually\nget a message that their saying,\n\n896\n00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,130\nconsistency restored.\n\n897\n00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,260\nLetting us know that that was it's fixed,\nso it's happy again.\n\n898\n00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,350\nAll right, so the last one on the list for\nVLANS is the allowed VLANS.\n\n899\n00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,235\nWhen you configure VLAN\ntrunking by default, and\n\n900\n00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,959\nI'm going to make this full sized again.\n\n901\n00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:57,459\nThere.\n\n902\n00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,523\nBy default it will allow.\n\n903\n00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:07,586\nEvery VLAN, VLANs 1-4,094.\n\n904\n00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:09,259\nBut you might not want that,\n\n905\n00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:13,980\nyou might want only a couple of VLANs\nto be allowed to pass over that trunk.\n\n906\n00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,810\nIf this trunk is running\nto another building, and\n\n907\n00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,570\nover in that other building you\njust have VLANs 1, 2, and 3,\n\n908\n00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,460\nthere's no sense in sending\nthe broadcasts for all these\n\n909\n00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,100\nother VLANs across that other building,\nif those don't exist at the other end.\n\n910\n00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,610\nSo we can prune them off.\n\n911\n00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,620\nThey call it pruning the VLANs.\n\n912\n00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,010\nIt's great for optimizing bandwidth.\n\n913\n00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,150\nBut down the road,\nmaybe we make a change and\n\n914\n00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,350\noriginally just VLANs 1 through\n3 were in the other building.\n\n915\n00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,280\nBut now I need VLANs 10 and\n11 in the other building.\n\n916\n00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,090\nAnd so we might make that\nwhere we add some ports, but\n\n917\n00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,530\nthey're not going to able to communicate\nbecause they've been pruned off.\n\n918\n00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,130\nAll right.\n\n919\n00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,270\nSo how do we prune them off?\n\n920\n00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,320\nWell, let me just show you.\n\n921\n00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,936\nSo if I get into interface fa0/3\n\n922\n00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:02,640\nIf I say switchport trunk allowed and\n\n923\n00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,290\nthen I can specify my VLAN\nranges that we allow.\n\n924\n00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,964\nAnd so I can specify and\nmaybe I'll say vlan 1 through 3.\n\n925\n00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,010\nAll right.\n\n926\n00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,320\nAnd just to be on the safe side,\n\n927\n00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,690\nI'm gonna do that same\nconfiguration on the other side.\n\n928\n00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:24,820\nI'll say switchport\ntrunk allowed vlan 1-3.\n\n929\n00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,650\nSo there we go, I'm allowing those VLANs.\n\n930\n00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,430\nAll right?\n\n931\n00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:34,410\nNow when I look in my config, that\nmakes it into the config, and if I, so\n\n932\n00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:40,170\nif I do like this, I'll see those\nallowed VLAN's right there and\n\n933\n00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,780\nif I do a show interface trunk,\nI'll see VLAN's allowed on the network and\n\n934\n00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,120\nactive and see how all the other\nVLAN's just disappeared.\n\n935\n00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,950\nOkay.\n\n936\n00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,960\nAnd down here I should be\nable to see the same thing.\n\n937\n00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,827\nAll the other VLAN's disappeared.\n\n938\n00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:54,327\nAll right.\n\n939\n00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,300\nBut now I changed my mind and I say,\nyou know what, I need VLAN 10 and\n\n940\n00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,210\n11 to make it over to the other side.\n\n941\n00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:08,940\nWell, up here I can say, switchport trunk\nallowed vlan and then I can say add 10-11.\n\n942\n00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,110\nOkay?\nThat means keep the existing list and\n\n943\n00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,740\njust add 10 through 11 to it.\n\n944\n00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,460\nAll right?\n\n945\n00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:21,260\nSo now I can look at it and\nthere it is, 1 through 3, and\n\n946\n00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,320\n10 through 11 all right there and\nthey're allowed.\n\n947\n00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,890\nI'm done.\n\n948\n00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,220\n>> Now on to the side problem.\n\n949\n00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,850\n>> Side problem.\n\n950\n00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,470\nIf I look at if from the other side,\nI just have one, two, three.\n\n951\n00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n952\n00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,610\n>> So I'm allowing 10 through\n11 to go to the other side, but\n\n953\n00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,090\nI'm not allowing ten to 11 to come back.\n\n954\n00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:42,470\nI've just created uni-directional traffic.\n\n955\n00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can send traffic out to that\n\n956\n00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,648\nremote building.\n\n957\n00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:48,140\nI'm not gonna receive it\nback on VLANs ten and 11.\n\n958\n00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,860\nAlright, so it's really hard to pick up\nuni-directional routing, because it really\n\n959\n00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,610\njust looks like it times out, you know,\nyour traffic never gets there.\n\n960\n00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,270\nBut, it's always important to\ncheck the two ends of the VLAN.\n\n961\n00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,689\nAnd this is another one where if,\nwe just do it side-by-side.\n\n962\n00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:10,893\n[SOUND] If we just do a side by side,\nit's easy to spot.\n\n963\n00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:13,210\nThere's the difference.\n\n964\n00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,260\nI've got a ,ten or 11 there.\n\n965\n00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,160\nI don't have it there.\n\n966\n00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,990\nI just need to fix it, right?\n\n967\n00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,640\nBut this is where I've seen\npeople where they do switchport\n\n968\n00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,000\ntrunk allowed vlan 10-11, like that.\n\n969\n00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,090\nAll right, and\nthen we'll take a look at it.\n\n970\n00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,560\n>> Oops.\n>> See what it did?\n\n971\n00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,070\nIt replaced the list, and so if we look at\nit now, I've, whoops, where's the, there.\n\n972\n00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,102\nI've killed off one through three\nwith that simple command, so\n\n973\n00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:42,328\nwe gotta make sure when we go to fix it,\n\n974\n00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:46,855\nthat we do the add, and now for\nme I've gotta add one through three.\n\n975\n00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:53,030\nAnd funny little side note here,\n\n976\n00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,775\ntechnically I excluded\nthe native VLAN there in\n\n977\n00:51:57,775 --> 00:52:02,210\n802.1q VLAN tagging on a Cisco switch,\nit actually won't let you prune VLAN one.\n\n978\n00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,350\nIt won't let you prune the native VLAN.\n\n979\n00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,910\nI shouldn't say VLAN one.\n\n980\n00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,890\nBecause you can change your\nnative VLAN to whatever.\n\n981\n00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,031\nSo whatever is your native VLAN\nwill always pass over the line,\n\n982\n00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:15,601\nthere is a special command you can run,\nlet's see if I can remember it.\n\n983\n00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,152\nIt is actually I don't even\nthink it's in the interface,\n\n984\n00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:25,270\nI think it's a global command.\n\n985\n00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:31,732\nLet's see if I can find it here, not.1x.\n\n986\n00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:36,782\nYou know what, I can't remember it off\nhand, but there is a special command that\n\n987\n00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:41,685\nallows you to prune off the native VLAN,\nand boy I don't remember what it was,\n\n988\n00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:45,270\nbut it's not something that\nmany people would ever do.\n\n989\n00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:50,869\nYou don't normally prune off your native\nVLAN, but there is a way to do it.\n\n990\n00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,190\nIt's gonna eat at me too, cause I know\nI've seen the command before, but\n\n991\n00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,510\nby default even if you tell it\nto exclude the native VLAN,\n\n992\n00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,680\nit's still going to pass it along.\n\n993\n00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,100\nBecause the native VLAN's untagged,\nit's really gotta be set across the line.\n\n994\n00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,640\nAll right, so\ndefinitely keep an eye out for\n\n995\n00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,070\nthat, any time you deal with\nallow VLANs or disallow VLANs or\n\n996\n00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,380\nwhatever you've got to make sure you match\nthe two sides and everything lines up.\n\n997\n00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,630\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, Ronnie,\n\n998\n00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,940\ncan you think of anything else to\nthrow in before we stop for break?\n\n999\n00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,340\n>> No.\nI think this a good point for\n\n1000\n00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,720\nus to stop before we get into ACLs.\n\n1001\n00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,420\n>> All right.\n\n1002\n00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,750\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1003\n00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,126\nWhen we get back, Access Control Lists.\n\n1004\n00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:25,798\nMore after this.\n\n1005\n00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:28,769\n[MUSIC]\n\n1006\n00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:35,050\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody!\n\n1007\n00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:38,546\nSo we left off talking about\ntroubleshooting trunks, and\n\n1008\n00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:43,530\nnow we're gonna switch gears and\ntake a look at ACLs, Access Control Lists.\n\n1009\n00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,370\nThere's a lot of stuff that can go\nwrong with access control lists.\n\n1010\n00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,970\nSo we got to really pay\nattention to them and\n\n1011\n00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,875\nmake sure that they are defined properly.\n\n1012\n00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,105\n>> Yeah, well there's many\ndifferent types of access control.\n\n1013\n00:53:55,105 --> 00:53:58,370\nIt's really just two but\nsome of the different configurations,\n\n1014\n00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,800\nstandard verses extended,\nwant to make sure that we\n\n1015\n00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,140\nhave a good understanding of that since\nwe actually did cover that in class but\n\n1016\n00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,590\nremember that means you do have a lot\nof trouble shooting to do here.\n\n1017\n00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,740\nSo for us, we're gonna pay attention and\nmake sure we do take a look\n\n1018\n00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,340\nat some of the different access control\nlist problems that we're gonna face here.\n\n1019\n00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,800\n>> So let's talk about a few things.\n\n1020\n00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,710\nLike first off how to spot that even we\nhave an ACL problem in the first place.\n\n1021\n00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,210\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Okay?\n\n1022\n00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:21,970\n>> That's true.\n\n1023\n00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,210\n>> One of the first things they call it\nin the objectives are these statistics.\n\n1024\n00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,130\nEvery access control list\nhas a set of statistics so\n\n1025\n00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,450\nyou can see if it's even working.\n\n1026\n00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:33,320\nLet's say for\nexample I want to create an ACL.\n\n1027\n00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,426\nLet me get out of these switches here.\n\n1028\n00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:37,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I got too much junk open on my laptop.\n\n1029\n00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,350\nLet me get connected to the router.\n\n1030\n00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:43,470\nSo, my laptop right now is run into a\nswitch which connects to this router, and\n\n1031\n00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,040\nthen I get internet access\nthrough that router.\n\n1032\n00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,299\nSo, I'm going to just pull that one up.\n\n1033\n00:54:54,955 --> 00:54:59,100\n[SOUND] All right.\nSo my laptop is 192.168.0.222.\n\n1034\n00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,300\nAnd maybe I've decided that my\nlaptop should not be able to get\n\n1035\n00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,310\nto a particular host, right.\n\n1036\n00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:12,630\nSo maybe I should not be\nallowed to ping 4.2.2.1,\n\n1037\n00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,820\nbut I should be allowed to ping 4.2.2.2,\nall right?\n\n1038\n00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,160\nSo that's what I decide.\n\n1039\n00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,700\nSo, I go in and I write an access list.\n\n1040\n00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:32,650\nAnd I say access list 101 permit,\nlet's see.\n\n1041\n00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,150\nI guess ICMP.\n\n1042\n00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,460\nAnd then, let's change this.\n\n1043\n00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,260\nThen, I'll do a deny.\n\n1044\n00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:54,875\nAnd then, maybe, I just do a.\n\n1045\n00:55:57,498 --> 00:56:00,540\nI guess, if I spell it right, that\nwill help a little bit with this list.\n\n1046\n00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1047\n00:56:10,672 --> 00:56:11,760\nThere.\n\n1048\n00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,460\nOkay.\n\n1049\n00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,060\nSo there's my access list that I made,\nall right?\n\n1050\n00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:20,530\nI'm permitting me to ping 4.2.2.2,\nI'm denying me pinging 4.2.2.1,\n\n1051\n00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:24,120\nand I'm permitting everything else, right?\n\n1052\n00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,220\nIP which is TZP and UDP as well as ICMP.\n\n1053\n00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,110\nSo allowing all that to go through.\n\n1054\n00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:29,910\nAll right.\n\n1055\n00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,860\nSo then,\nI go on a test on my work station.\n\n1056\n00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:37,990\nAnd I say, all right well, let me ping,\n4.2.2.2, I should be able to ping, right?\n\n1057\n00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,638\nAnd I can.\n\n1058\n00:56:38,638 --> 00:56:41,850\nAnd then 4.2.2.1,\nI shouldn't be able to ping.\n\n1059\n00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,110\nAnd I can't.\nI mean and I can, shoot.\n\n1060\n00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:50,980\nSo I have to ask myself,\ndid that access list even work?\n\n1061\n00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,880\n>> Right.\n\n1062\n00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,390\n>> And this is where the access list\nstatistics come in really handy.\n\n1063\n00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:58,701\nYou can run show Access-list.\n\n1064\n00:56:58,701 --> 00:57:02,710\nThat command right there, show access\ndash list will give you a list of all\n\n1065\n00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,740\nyour access lists and you will see\nwhat's called a hit count, right?\n\n1066\n00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,355\n>> Yep.\n>> How many matches your traffic has?\n\n1067\n00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:15,951\nSo I have an ACL up here for doing network\naddress translation, and I can see on it,\n\n1068\n00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:21,875\nit's got 25,000 matches, I know that it\nis working and running and doing its job.\n\n1069\n00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:26,235\nLook at how many matches I\nhave on the ACL I just wrote.\n\n1070\n00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:28,015\n>> Yes.\nNone.\n\n1071\n00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:28,705\n>> Why not?\n\n1072\n00:57:28,705 --> 00:57:31,555\nWhy don't I have any matches on this list?\n\n1073\n00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:34,130\nWell, I made the list.\n\n1074\n00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,020\nI never attached it to an interface,\ndid I?\n\n1075\n00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,758\n>> Nope.\n>> I just kind of left it out there.\n\n1076\n00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:42,092\nSo it's hard for an access list for work\nwhen it's not attached to an interface.\n\n1077\n00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,338\n>> Yep.\n\n1078\n00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,987\nAnd this is where it goes back to that\nsame troubleshooting skill we were talking\n\n1079\n00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:47,020\nabout, right?\n\n1080\n00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,310\nMaking sure that we know how\nthese things basically work.\n\n1081\n00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,880\nProper configuration of\nthe access list itself.\n\n1082\n00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,750\nBut also that we have to\nattach it to the interface.\n\n1083\n00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,960\nSo that is also key for\nus as we come back here.\n\n1084\n00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,520\nSo Don is actually\nshowing us now a drawing.\n\n1085\n00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,070\n>> Yeah, let's go to my drawing here.\n\n1086\n00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,590\nSo when I am on PC1, and\n\n1087\n00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,780\nI'm going out to the internet\nlike to ping 4.2.2.1 or\n\n1088\n00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,140\n4.2.2.2, I'm passing through Router 1,\nand I need to attach that access list.\n\n1089\n00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,344\nOn either gigabit 0/1 or\n\n1090\n00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:23,420\ngigabit 0/0 to be able to stop\nthat traffic from passing through.\n\n1091\n00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,870\nSo I just need to attach it.\n\n1092\n00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,105\nAnd I can attach it to either interface.\n\n1093\n00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:26,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n1094\n00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,440\nAnd attach it, get it in place,\nand off we go.\n\n1095\n00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:29,940\nRight?\n>> Yep.\n\n1096\n00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,592\n>> So let me go and do that.\n\n1097\n00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,223\nI'm gonna get into interface gi0/0,\n\n1098\n00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:41,213\nwhere I will say IP access-group,\nwhat number did I do?\n\n1099\n00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:42,080\n101?\n\n1100\n00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,291\n>> 101.\n>> 101 in.\n\n1101\n00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,750\nOkay.\nAll right.\n\n1102\n00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,790\nSo now the access list is attached,\n\n1103\n00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,690\nI'm filtering that traffic\nnow we should be blocked.\n\n1104\n00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,910\nRight?\n\n1105\n00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,840\nWell, let's do a test.\n\n1106\n00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,414\nSo I should be able to\nping forward at 2.2.2, and\n\n1107\n00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:03,998\nI can and\nI should not be able to ping 4.2.2.1.\n\n1108\n00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,170\nBut I can.\n>> Oh.\n\n1109\n00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,295\nOh dear.\n\n1110\n00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:08,645\n>> What the heck is going on here?\n\n1111\n00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,575\n>> Yeah.\nNow, when we take a look at it, remember.\n\n1112\n00:59:10,575 --> 00:59:14,495\nIt's not only that we have to attach\nthe access list to the interface.\n\n1113\n00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:17,955\nWe also have to pick the proper\ndirection as we take a look.\n\n1114\n00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:24,480\nSo Don showed us that he did attach it to\ngigabit 0/0 here, which is perfectly fine.\n\n1115\n00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,690\nBut notice the last word there that\nwe have, which is the word in.\n\n1116\n00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,930\nNow, this is where I would actually run in\nfrom I have to go check to take a look at\n\n1117\n00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:36,030\nmy diagram again, but I would actually\ndo here is actually take a look.\n\n1118\n00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,220\nWhen I take a look at that\nparticular direction,\n\n1119\n00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:44,170\nI'm saying coming back into the interface\nitself, is the way that I attached it.\n\n1120\n00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,930\nNow notice that the way that\nDon drew the arrow though,\n\n1121\n00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,490\nit's actually leaving the interface.\n\n1122\n00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:55,299\nInstead, and so when it's leaving\nthe interface it's not gonna block it,\n\n1123\n00:59:55,299 --> 01:00:00,019\nit's actually blocking the idea\nof the data going the other,\n\n1124\n01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:02,591\nor coming in the other side here.\n\n1125\n01:00:02,591 --> 01:00:09,600\n>> So when we attach this interface,\nit should have been IN GI 01 or OUT GI 00.\n\n1126\n01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,180\nSince I did it IN GI 00,\nwhat's happening is my\n\n1127\n01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,830\ntraffic is going out to the internet,\nand then I get my reply back,\n\n1128\n01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:25,040\nand here is where it's\ngoing in that interface.\n\n1129\n01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,839\nThe reply back.\n\n1130\n01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,207\nThe reply that's coming from,\nin my example it was 4.2.2.1, right?\n\n1131\n01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:34,053\nIt's coming from there and it's not gonna\nmatch my ACL, and I've got that permit any\n\n1132\n01:00:34,053 --> 01:00:37,250\nin there so it's gonna clear it and\ncome right through, right?\n\n1133\n01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,880\nSo, it's the wrong direction.\n\n1134\n01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,200\nIt's easy to spot if you draw a diagram.\n\n1135\n01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,310\nIf you draw a picture you can see\nthat you did the wrong direction.\n\n1136\n01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,910\nThe other thing is, if I go back and\n\n1137\n01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:52,450\nI look at my statistics,\nI'll see my statistics hitting,\n\n1138\n01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:57,280\nhere on this permit IP any any,\nsee how I've got 1213 matches.\n\n1139\n01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,080\nI'm getting hits on this ACL, but\n\n1140\n01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:06,350\nI'm not getting any hits on these\nother entries, and I should be, right?\n\n1141\n01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:08,410\nSo that's my first hint\nthat I've got a problem.\n\n1142\n01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,800\nThese statistics are really helpful for\nkind of figuring that out and\n\n1143\n01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,220\ngetting it tagged.\n\n1144\n01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:19,450\nSo if I go and fix that,\nif I say, no to turn that off,\n\n1145\n01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,856\nand I change it to an outbound list,\nright?\n\n1146\n01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:25,421\n>> Yeah.\n\n1147\n01:01:25,421 --> 01:01:29,666\n>> Now going back here to\nmy super messy diagram now.\n\n1148\n01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me clean this up a bit.\n\n1149\n01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,062\nNow when we take a look at this.\n\n1150\n01:01:34,062 --> 01:01:39,620\nMy traffic is passing into GI0/1\nout of GI0/0, and when we pass out,\n\n1151\n01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:44,649\nthat's when that ACL is going to apply and\nI'm gonna get filtered,\n\n1152\n01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:49,879\neven before I make it out to the internet,\nwhich is definitely ideal.\n\n1153\n01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:53,085\nWe'll see if it works.\n\n1154\n01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:58,633\nSo, 4.2.2.2 I should be able to ping and\n\n1155\n01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:02,612\nI can and 4.2.2.1.\n\n1156\n01:02:02,612 --> 01:02:04,180\nOh.\n\n1157\n01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,570\nI shouldn't be able to ping that one but\nI sure did.\n\n1158\n01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,160\nSo let's go double check our ACL and\nmake sure that's right.\n\n1159\n01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,250\nLet me just jump back here and\nwe'll take a look at our statistics.\n\n1160\n01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,499\nI thought we had it fixed that time but\nmaybe we missed something else.\n\n1161\n01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,540\nAll right, so taking a look at\nit here on these ICM statements,\n\n1162\n01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,480\nI still don't have any matches.\n\n1163\n01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,960\nYou know what,\nI have seen something like this before.\n\n1164\n01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,436\nLet me just verify one thing, GI0/0,\n\n1165\n01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:37,720\nthat is our outside we got IP access\ngroup 101 out, that is the right ACL.\n\n1166\n01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,700\nIt is applying to outside, so\nwe should be good there and,\n\n1167\n01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:49,530\nlet me just double check\none more time our syntax.\n\n1168\n01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:55,210\nSo I've got permit ICNP coming from\nhost 192.168.0.222, so that's me.\n\n1169\n01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,530\nOr, you know what, let me verify that,\nthat should be me.\n\n1170\n01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,840\nThat would be funny if\nI had my address wrong.\n\n1171\n01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,820\nNope that is!\n\n1172\n01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,990\nAnd then my default gateway is the router,\nthat's the way that I'm getting there.\n\n1173\n01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,970\nWe'll let that run in the background.\n\n1174\n01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,070\nAnd so I should have hit on one of those.\n\n1175\n01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,650\nI was doing ICMP traffic\nto one of those hosts.\n\n1176\n01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:23,249\nSo I'm gonna do the old trusty and\nwe'll shut down that interface for\n\n1177\n01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:26,257\na second, and\nthen we'll do a no shut down.\n\n1178\n01:03:28,674 --> 01:03:29,300\nAnd there we go.\n\n1179\n01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,510\nI have seen before where you\nmake a change to an interface.\n\n1180\n01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,230\nAnd the ACL doesn't apply\nuntil you exit the interface.\n\n1181\n01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:37,730\nSo that may actually be\nwhat's going on here.\n\n1182\n01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,030\nNot exactly what Cisco is calling out of\ntheir objectives, but it can happen so\n\n1183\n01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:42,870\nlet's try this again.\n\n1184\n01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,464\nOh, gee it's always complaining.\n\n1185\n01:03:47,464 --> 01:03:51,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good old Windows protecting me from\n\n1186\n01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,570\nmyself there.\n\n1187\n01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,540\nSo I was doing a trace route real quick,\n\n1188\n01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,150\njust to verify that I am\npassing through that router.\n\n1189\n01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,443\nIf I'm passing through a different router,\n\n1190\n01:03:59,443 --> 01:04:01,393\nif I have a different default gateway,\nthen it's not gonna apply.\n\n1191\n01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,795\nBut I can see right there,\nI am passing through that router.\n\n1192\n01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:08,886\nAnd if I ping 4.2.2.2, I should get there.\n\n1193\n01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:12,073\nAnd if I ping 4.2.2.1,\nI should be getting blocked.\n\n1194\n01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:15,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm not, so that's pretty interesting.\n\n1195\n01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,330\nNow when we have a communication like\nthis, where it's getting through and\n\n1196\n01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:23,020\nit's not matching, that means we've\ngot a bit of a problem, okay?\n\n1197\n01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,630\nAnd we can take a look at our config to\ntry and find out what that problem is.\n\n1198\n01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,425\nNow, I'm doing pings.\n\n1199\n01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:32,399\nAnd pings are ICMP echo requests.\n\n1200\n01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:38,080\nI send an echo request out to\nthe Internet, and they send back to me.\n\n1201\n01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:38,820\n>> Echo reply.\n\n1202\n01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,880\n>> An echo reply, yeah.\n\n1203\n01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,360\nSo when we do a protocol suite like this,\nICMP, that's\n\n1204\n01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,130\nsupposed to get the whole thing, but\nit is possible that in this case it's not.\n\n1205\n01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:51,060\nThat it's not including what I want.\n\n1206\n01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:54,250\nI can't imagine it is, but\nthat could be our case.\n\n1207\n01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:58,150\nSo, the other problem is I'm not\nhandling this very efficiently.\n\n1208\n01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:02,760\nIf I look at the router,\nmy traffic is going in this interface and\n\n1209\n01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,620\nthen out the other.\n\n1210\n01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,488\nAnd so I'm filtering it on the way out,\nafter I've done the routing table look\n\n1211\n01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,417\nups and after I'm ready to send\nit along on that interface,\n\n1212\n01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:13,428\nwhich is not really the best way to do it.\n\n1213\n01:05:13,428 --> 01:05:16,860\nYou usually you wanna do it closer to\nthe source if you're doing an extended ACL\n\n1214\n01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,080\nlike this, it's very specific.\n\n1215\n01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,660\nSo we can move it over\nto this other interface,\n\n1216\n01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,121\nthat shouldn't make a difference though.\n\n1217\n01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:27,152\nIt's the same ACL, shouldn't influence it.\n\n1218\n01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:29,810\nAnd then the other thing is we can\nkinda tweak the way that ACL is written\n\n1219\n01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,230\nto try and be a little more\nspecific to find out our problem,\n\n1220\n01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,667\nto find out why this ACL isn't applying,\nright?\n\n1221\n01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:40,974\nI didn't intend for\nthis example to be a difficult one, but\n\n1222\n01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:43,247\nit actually turned out\nto be a pretty good one.\n\n1223\n01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:44,179\nSo let's move the ACL first.\n\n1224\n01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:45,827\nSo I'll get into gi0/0.\n\n1225\n01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,456\nAnd I'm just gonna remove that ACL, and\n\n1226\n01:05:54,456 --> 01:05:59,450\nI'm just gonna make sure that there's\nno access control list applied to it.\n\n1227\n01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,360\nOh, shoot, there's my problem.\n\n1228\n01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,420\nI'm doing NAT.\n\n1229\n01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,510\nI'm doing Network Address Translation.\n\n1230\n01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:11,900\nBy the time my traffic makes it to that\nsecond port, I've already been translated.\n\n1231\n01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,910\nMy source address is no\nlonger 192.168.0222.\n\n1232\n01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,630\nMy source address is now\nwhat I've been NATed to.\n\n1233\n01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,927\nNow that's a good thing,\nI'm glad that came up,\n\n1234\n01:06:21,927 --> 01:06:24,947\nis that when you don't understand\nthe order that things happen.\n\n1235\n01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:31,907\nYour incoming ACL is applied first, then\nNAT is applied, then you're outgoing ACL.\n\n1236\n01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:35,294\nSo it's the outgoing ACL is applied\nafter NAT you've got to plan for\n\n1237\n01:06:35,294 --> 01:06:36,611\nthat in your access list.\n\n1238\n01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:38,639\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I didn't do that so\n\n1239\n01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,340\nthat's why that ACLdidn't apply.\n\n1240\n01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,980\nSo if I wanted to filter here I could\nfilter based on the NAT address.\n\n1241\n01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,700\n>> Right.\n>> Which is pretty hard to do.\n\n1242\n01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,380\nIn this case, I'm gonna have to\napply it on the incoming interface.\n\n1243\n01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,996\nSo I'll get into interface gi0/1 and\napply it.\n\n1244\n01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:57,440\nThere we go.\n\n1245\n01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,060\nAnd so now it's attached there.\n\n1246\n01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,910\nAnd I will jump back over.\n\n1247\n01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:07,749\nAnd I'm gonna try and ping 4.2.2.2,\nwhich I should be able to do,\n\n1248\n01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:13,270\nthere we go, and I'll try and\nping 4.2.2.1, and we don't, right?\n\n1249\n01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:17,840\nSo, did I use a crazy show command or\nwhatever to solve that problem?\n\n1250\n01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,690\nNo, I used show running-config, right?\n\n1251\n01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,670\nI looked at the running config\nof that interface, and saw\n\n1252\n01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:28,200\nthe IP NAT outside command and that was my\nwarning, to say oh, shoot that's right!\n\n1253\n01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,200\nWe're doing NST, my address is changing,\nthere's my problem.\n\n1254\n01:07:32,692 --> 01:07:36,530\nAll right,\nnow if I go back here I can do a show\n\n1255\n01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:45,120\naccess- list, and now I can see that\nI'm getting matches on those two lines,\n\n1256\n01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,170\nright, so I've got matches here\non the one that permits, and\n\n1257\n01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,370\nI've got matches on the one that denies.\n\n1258\n01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:56,350\nThose are the pings you know Microsoft\nsends four with each ping attempt and so\n\n1259\n01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,210\nwe can see that they're going through and\nthey're hitting.\n\n1260\n01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:58,710\n>> Yep.\n\n1261\n01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,600\nYeah.\nA good example for us.\n\n1262\n01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Actually see what's going on here.\n\n1263\n01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:07,710\nAnd the other thing, let's do that show\nrun on that interface again, and let's\n\n1264\n01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:15,920\ntalk about the idea of the way that we\napply that command there on the interface.\n\n1265\n01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,220\nSo notice that the way that we have\nit is access-group if you type\n\n1266\n01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:26,170\nin IP access-list,\nIi's not gonna be correct here, but\n\n1267\n01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,530\nremember that there's also two\nreally tricky ones here too.\n\n1268\n01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:33,090\nOn the physical interface,\nit's always access-group, but\n\n1269\n01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:37,310\nwhat if you were doing this\ngoing into the router itself?\n\n1270\n01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:40,980\nIn other words, on the VTY lines, you\ngotta remember that if you take a look at\n\n1271\n01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:47,100\nthat, that should be access-class and\nthat's something important to remember.\n\n1272\n01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,120\nSo if you're saying that, hey,\n\n1273\n01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,330\nit's still not blocking traffic going into\nthe interface or into the router itself,\n\n1274\n01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,760\nand you see access-group,\nit's probably not gonna work.\n\n1275\n01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,720\nIf you see access-class, that's your key.\n\n1276\n01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,420\n>> Yep.\nYeah,\n\n1277\n01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,930\nI don't know why they didn't maintain\nconsistency there, but it is different.\n\n1278\n01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,850\nNow, what i we hadn't figured\nout what our problem was?\n\n1279\n01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,170\nWhat if it still wasn't blocking it?\n\n1280\n01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:13,430\nOne of the neat things that you can do\nis you can redefine your access list\n\n1281\n01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,850\nwith the log option turned on.\n\n1282\n01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,200\nSo you can do some logging and\n\n1283\n01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,640\nfind out a little bit better about\nwhy that traffic didn't match up.\n\n1284\n01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:27,290\nAnd so one of the things that I like to do\nis if we do like a do show access-list,\n\n1285\n01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:31,650\nyou've got your sequence numbers\non the ACL and so we can try and\n\n1286\n01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,600\nedit the ACL and inject a line in there.\n\n1287\n01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,000\nSo, if I still wasn't hitting on those\nfirst two entries and I was still just\n\n1288\n01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,820\nreally super mega confused, we could\nget really specific about this ACL.\n\n1289\n01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,700\nLet's break it again, I'm gonna move it.\n\n1290\n01:09:52,742 --> 01:09:56,800\nAnd I'm gonna get into GI 0/0 and\nI'm gonna put it back here.\n\n1291\n01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,460\nSo that's how it was before,\n\n1292\n01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,020\nwhen it should have been blocking me but\nit wasn't.\n\n1293\n01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,575\nRight?\nI was still able to ping\n\n1294\n01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:09,360\n4.2.2.1 even though I shouldn't\nhave been able to, right?\n\n1295\n01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,680\nSo if I start troubleshooting this,\n\n1296\n01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,120\nI'm just scratching my head going\ngood gosh, why isn't this working?\n\n1297\n01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,740\nAll right, one of the things we can do is\nwe can write a very general ACL entry and\n\n1298\n01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,630\nturn logging on for\nit to be able to troubleshoot.\n\n1299\n01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:28,770\nSo, I might say, ip access-list 101,\n\n1300\n01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,280\ndo I have to say extended after that?\n\n1301\n01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,090\nOh, it's not gonna let me do a number,\nshoot.\n\n1302\n01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:38,650\nIf it was a named ACL we\ncould edit it since it's\n\n1303\n01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,730\nnot a named ACL I gotta do\nit the old fashioned way.\n\n1304\n01:10:46,186 --> 01:10:47,880\nHang on let me pull out this ACL.\n\n1305\n01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,070\nAll right so here's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna take ACL 101 that we wrote\n\n1306\n01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:57,460\nat the beginning of the show, and\nwe'll throw it into notepad here.\n\n1307\n01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,020\nOkay, and I'm gonna add,\nno access-list 101.\n\n1308\n01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,370\nThat's gonna delete it and\nthen we're gonna recreate it and for\n\n1309\n01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,200\nthe very first line\n\n1310\n01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:19,024\nI'm going to say access-list\n101 permit IP any,\n\n1311\n01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:26,345\nso any IP traffic going to host 4.2.2.1,\nand I want to we'll log it.\n\n1312\n01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:29,416\nAnd that actually includes ICMP like\nI didn't have to do this line here\n\n1313\n01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:29,945\nat the end.\n\n1314\n01:11:29,945 --> 01:11:31,585\nWe can leave that off.\n\n1315\n01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:35,975\nPermit IP any just pretty much lets any\nIP traffic go through, including ICMP.\n\n1316\n01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:41,415\nSo, by putting this log up here I'm\ngoing to say if anybody tries to send\n\n1317\n01:11:41,415 --> 01:11:45,250\nanything to 4.2.2.1 I want you to log it.\n\n1318\n01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:48,980\nThis will let me look at the traffic and\nidentify what the problem is.\n\n1319\n01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:54,988\nSo my problem was that my source was no\nlonger 192.168.0.222 and we can see that.\n\n1320\n01:11:54,988 --> 01:11:58,284\nI'm gonna go put this back into\nplace I need that first line.\n\n1321\n01:11:58,284 --> 01:12:02,928\nSo the first line is gonna delete\nthe ACL if I didn't do that Yeah.\n\n1322\n01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:06,147\n>> These lines would just get added to the\nend of it, and they wouldn't do any good.\n\n1323\n01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:10,030\nSo I'm gonna go back to the router and\nI'll just paste that in there.\n\n1324\n01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:12,600\nSo it deleted access list 101, and\n\n1325\n01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,000\nthen it recreated it, putting my log\nline right there at the beginning, okay?\n\n1326\n01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,910\nNow I could go back to my client,\nand I could say all right,\n\n1327\n01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:23,720\nI shouldn't be able to ping 4.2.2.1.\n\n1328\n01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,620\nLet me try it.\n\n1329\n01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,140\nSee there, I'm trying it.\n\n1330\n01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,660\nAnd back here, here's the message.\n\n1331\n01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:35,110\nAnd look what it says, access list 101\npermitted a ping going to 4.2.2.1.\n\n1332\n01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:42,500\nAnd the source, 10.1.230.15, that would\nhave been my indicator right there.\n\n1333\n01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,470\nOh, shoot, I'm getting NAT-ed, right?\n\n1334\n01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:48,830\nAnd I could say show IP net translations,\nand\n\n1335\n01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:51,949\nright there I would see-\n>> Yep, there it is.\n\n1336\n01:12:51,949 --> 01:12:57,045\n>> 192.168.222 getting\ntranslated to 10.1.230.15.\n\n1337\n01:12:57,045 --> 01:13:00,358\nSo even if we didn't spot\nit in the running config,\n\n1338\n01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:03,680\nwe still could have seen\nit with our show commands.\n\n1339\n01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,230\n>> Now, Don, if we take a look\nat that show access list again,\n\n1340\n01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:11,840\nhere's another troubleshooting thing\nthat can kinda get us as well.\n\n1341\n01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,400\nLet's see if we can bring it back up.\n\n1342\n01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:17,380\nBecause Don has added in\nthat first entry in there,\n\n1343\n01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:21,990\nin the permit ip any to this host, right?\n\n1344\n01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:25,630\nRemember that when we build access\ncontrol list, we normally wanna start at\n\n1345\n01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,770\nthe most specific statements that we\ncan and end with the most general here.\n\n1346\n01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:35,560\nWhat is actually happening here is that\nDon has put inside of that list here that,\n\n1347\n01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,160\nhey, allow anything to go through.\n\n1348\n01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,920\nBut notice now what Don's highlighted,\nwhich is that the deny here,\n\n1349\n01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,390\nthis statement will never get a match\n\n1350\n01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:47,180\nbecause that very first one is\nalready allowing it to go through.\n\n1351\n01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,660\nNot uncommon for\nyou to be able to spot this or\n\n1352\n01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,460\nto be given this scenario\nhere that says hey,\n\n1353\n01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:57,380\nwhy is this still not working,\njust like in the situation that we had.\n\n1354\n01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,600\nAnd one of the key aspects, of course\nis understanding that very concept.\n\n1355\n01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,670\nMost specific up at top, to the more\ngeneral statements down at the bottom.\n\n1356\n01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,640\n>> So we would either need to rearrange\nthis or now that I'm done testing,\n\n1357\n01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,090\nI can remove that line up there.\n\n1358\n01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:17,760\nSo I can go back to this, and I can say\nall right, we figured out our problem\n\n1359\n01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,670\nI can remove that log line and\nthen go back to this way here.\n\n1360\n01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,200\nWhich would put everything back\nto the way it's supposed to be.\n\n1361\n01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,732\nNow the only thing is I need to go and\nre-attach it to the right place.\n\n1362\n01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,804\nSo instead of doing a one on one out here,\n\n1363\n01:14:39,804 --> 01:14:45,520\nI would get in here and\ndo a one on one in, like that.\n\n1364\n01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,425\nAnd now we should be back in business, the\nlogging is turned off, and there we go.\n\n1365\n01:14:50,425 --> 01:14:53,525\nYou do want to turn logging off\nwhen you're not using it because\n\n1366\n01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:58,365\nif you're logging like a high traffic line\nit's going to generate a ton of messages.\n\n1367\n01:14:58,365 --> 01:15:02,375\nAnd you definitely don't want that, it\ndoes get messy fast, your log files will\n\n1368\n01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:05,635\nfill out, they'll start overwriting\nthemselves and it's a mess.\n\n1369\n01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,110\nAll right.\n\n1370\n01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:11,350\nNow Ronnie mentioned access\nclasses on the VTY lines.\n\n1371\n01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,520\nThat's another important one.\n\n1372\n01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,150\nIt might turn up on the exam.\n\n1373\n01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:18,940\nLet's say you wanna control who's\nallowed to Telnet into your router.\n\n1374\n01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,480\nAll right?\n\n1375\n01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:24,615\nSo right now if I fire up a PuTTY session,\nI can Telnet into\n\n1376\n01:15:24,615 --> 01:15:29,910\n192.168.0.1 that's that router.\n\n1377\n01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:33,642\nI can Telnet in, and\nI can log in, here we go.\n\n1378\n01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:37,419\nOkay?.\nIf I want to control that, I might come in\n\n1379\n01:15:37,419 --> 01:15:42,465\nhere and write an access\nlist that says access-list,\n\n1380\n01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:46,220\nwe'll just say it's access-list 5.\n\n1381\n01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:51,004\nAnd I'll say permit 192.16,\n\n1382\n01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:55,631\nwell, let's do this, let's deny\n\n1383\n01:15:55,631 --> 01:16:00,416\n192.168.0.222, and\n\n1384\n01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:06,910\nthen permit 192.168.00, like that.\n\n1385\n01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:07,490\nOkay?\n\n1386\n01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:12,310\nSo I'm denying my laptop and\nI'm permitting everybody else.\n\n1387\n01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:19,299\nAnd I get into interface gi0/1 and\n\n1388\n01:16:19,299 --> 01:16:24,020\nI say access-group 5 in.\n\n1389\n01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:31,440\nSo going back over to my window here, my\nPC, if I try and Telnet into the router.\n\n1390\n01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,491\nI'm passing in gi0/1, right?\n\n1391\n01:16:34,491 --> 01:16:38,952\nAnd that's the ACL that I just wrote here,\ngoing in gi0/1,\n\n1392\n01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:44,439\n192.168.0.222 is specifically\nin the list to not be allowed.\n\n1393\n01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:47,650\nI should have done a log on there,\nshouldn't I?\n\n1394\n01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:51,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyhow, we'll leave it be.\n\n1395\n01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,670\nI should not be able to\nTelnet into that router.\n\n1396\n01:16:54,670 --> 01:17:01,080\nSo, if I fire up A Telnet\nsession to that router.\n\n1397\n01:17:03,106 --> 01:17:07,550\n>> I can try and connect and oh shoot.\n\n1398\n01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,266\nYou know I'm forgetting\nsomething dag gummit.\n\n1399\n01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:12,805\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] we've updated this router.\n\n1400\n01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:13,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1401\n01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:18,380\nthis router is running the latest iOS and\nCisco finally fixed this.\n\n1402\n01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,900\nOn the exam, it's not this way.\n\n1403\n01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,430\nThis is our pain for\nrunning the latest iOS.\n\n1404\n01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:28,030\nSo they finally fixed this in the newer\niOS's, but in the iOS's from like 12.4 and\n\n1405\n01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:33,040\nearlier, if you attempted to do this,\nyou would actually get in just fine.\n\n1406\n01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,930\nAnd that's because ACLs\nreally only apply to traffic\n\n1407\n01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,390\nthat passes from one interface to another.\n\n1408\n01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,050\nWe're not passing from\none interface to another,\n\n1409\n01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,560\nwe're passing into one interface,\nand going into a VTY.\n\n1410\n01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,050\nAnd so on system running the older iOS's,\n\n1411\n01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:53,510\nyou had to take this older ACL and\napply directly to the VTY lines.\n\n1412\n01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:57,110\nAnd even today, that's still a better\npractice than attaching it the interface.\n\n1413\n01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,590\nSo here it actually worked as expected.\n\n1414\n01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,131\nI am now locked out, so let me\nswitch over to a console connection.\n\n1415\n01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:03,907\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then I'll be able to kind of\n\n1416\n01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:08,870\nstraighten that out, but\nwhere is the console port, there we go.\n\n1417\n01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,530\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna just plug into that one.\n\n1418\n01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,670\nThat's funny.\n\n1419\n01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,860\nI thought about that after I turned it on,\nI was like oh shoot,\n\n1420\n01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,250\nI updated this router.\n\n1421\n01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:20,260\nBut that's the price we pay for\nhaving the latest and greatest.\n\n1422\n01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:27,810\nSo in real life land, it's not so much of\na problem but the exam is still based on.\n\n1423\n01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:28,570\nYou know what?\n\n1424\n01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,070\nActually the exam they've\nupdated to 15 now, haven't they?\n\n1425\n01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,130\nThey've updated to the 15 iOSs.\n\n1426\n01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:39,650\nSo, on the exam, the problem will\nbe fixed there too, but it is\n\n1427\n01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:45,150\nstill the best practice to attach the ACL\nto the VTY lines and not the interface.\n\n1428\n01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:51,737\nSo I need to get into gi0/1\n\n1429\n01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:56,260\nand say, I need to remove it from there.\n\n1430\n01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,300\nAnd instead go into my VTY lines and\n\n1431\n01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:05,230\nhere's where just like Ronnie said we do\naccess-class 5 in and attach it there now.\n\n1432\n01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:11,630\nAnd here's another little trick, notice\nhow up here there was IP access-group,\n\n1433\n01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:17,150\nhere it's just straight up\naccess-class no IP before it.\n\n1434\n01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:21,780\nThe other thing is,\nit only supports a standard ACL,\n\n1435\n01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,590\nno extended ACLs,\nit's gotta be a standard.\n\n1436\n01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,990\nSo those are kinda what we're seeing,\nand what might creep up there.\n\n1437\n01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,930\nSo in the newer iOS's,\nthat little problem is fixed, but\n\n1438\n01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:37,930\nit's still the best practice\nto attach the VTY lines.\n\n1439\n01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,240\nA lot of people don't even realize\nthat you can attach the VTY lines.\n\n1440\n01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:44,330\nThe nice thing about attaching it here,\nregardless of whether somebody comes in\n\n1441\n01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:47,380\nyour LAN interface your WAN\ninterface your other interfaces,\n\n1442\n01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,220\nthis ACL will always apply.\n\n1443\n01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,219\nOtherwise you have to apply,\n\n1444\n01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,125\na different ACL to each\ninterface to secure the router.\n\n1445\n01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,445\nThis takes care of it all in one place.\n\n1446\n01:19:54,445 --> 01:19:57,504\nAnd I guess, I could have shown that.\n\n1447\n01:19:57,504 --> 01:20:00,964\nLet me kinda, repeat this example here.\n\n1448\n01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:08,400\nIf I do So I'm gonna remove it there.\n\n1449\n01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:15,871\nAnd I'll get into, let me write a new one.\n\n1450\n01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:17,659\nSo I'm gonna create an access list,\n\n1451\n01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:26,891\nThat's gonna specifically block my host\n\n1452\n01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:31,883\ngoing to 192.168.0.1,\n\n1453\n01:20:31,883 --> 01:20:35,752\nwhere the port equals 23.\n\n1454\n01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:40,857\nSo I'm gonna deny my laptop\ntelnetting into this router and\n\n1455\n01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:44,031\nthen I'll permit everything else.\n\n1456\n01:20:48,369 --> 01:20:51,173\nAnd what did I do?\n\n1457\n01:20:51,173 --> 01:20:53,038\nAccess-list 15.\n\n1458\n01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:55,620\n>> Oh!\n>> 15 instead of 105, shoot.\n\n1459\n01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:59,704\nThere we go.\n\n1460\n01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:04,621\nSo I'm specifically denying my laptop\nthe ability to telnet into this router.\n\n1461\n01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:06,490\nI'm permitting everything else.\n\n1462\n01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:12,744\nAnd then I'm gonna get into interface\nGI0/1 and attach this access list.\n\n1463\n01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:17,549\nI'll say ipaccess-group 105 in.\n\n1464\n01:21:17,549 --> 01:21:21,369\nSo now I will not be able\nto Telnet into this system.\n\n1465\n01:21:21,369 --> 01:21:22,493\nIn theory.\n\n1466\n01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:27,548\nIf I fire up my PuTTY window,\nand I try in Telnet into\n\n1467\n01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:33,789\n192.168.0.1, I'm gonna Telnet,\nand I can't.\n\n1468\n01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:34,740\nGood.\n\n1469\n01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:40,093\nBut if I know the IP address of\nanother interface if I try and\n\n1470\n01:21:40,093 --> 01:21:44,690\nTelnet into the outside\ninterface of the router.\n\n1471\n01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,640\nThere I am.\n\n1472\n01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,420\nAnd I can get right in.\n\n1473\n01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,610\nThat's why we don't wanna write these\nACLs and attach them to interfaces.\n\n1474\n01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:56,690\nWhen you're securing the router itself,\nif you were to do it that way,\n\n1475\n01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:00,950\nyou'd have to write one ACL for\neach of your interface IPs to secure it.\n\n1476\n01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:05,450\nIf you just attach it to the VTYs,\nit's not a problem, you can't get in.\n\n1477\n01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,370\nSo let's recap, Ronnie.\n\n1478\n01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:12,640\nSo when we troubleshoot the ACLs,\nwhat are the things we need to look at?\n\n1479\n01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,275\n>> Yeah.\n\n1480\n01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:17,555\nWe take a look at the ACLs themselves,\nmake sure that we begin with understanding\n\n1481\n01:22:17,555 --> 01:22:20,185\nthe proper configuration\nof the ACL itself.\n\n1482\n01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,725\nStandard versus the idea of\nthe extended access control list.\n\n1483\n01:22:23,725 --> 01:22:26,555\nWe start off with the most\nspecific statements up top and\n\n1484\n01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:29,795\nwork to the most general\nstatements down at the bottom.\n\n1485\n01:22:29,795 --> 01:22:35,130\nRemember that every ACL has to have at\nleast one permit statement is the key.\n\n1486\n01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:39,750\nNow, when creating ACLs remember that we\nhave to also attach them to interfaces,\n\n1487\n01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,400\nwe also have to think about the direction\n\n1488\n01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,940\nto also point those access\ncontrol lists in as well.\n\n1489\n01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:51,790\nWe can help ourselves here by taking\na looking at the statistics by\n\n1490\n01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:57,350\nusing the show access-list, and\nseeing where we were getting a hit count,\n\n1491\n01:22:57,350 --> 01:23:02,260\nand seeing whether or not we're actually\nseeing any hits on any of our statements.\n\n1492\n01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,620\nIf there are, we start knowing that\nour ACLs are properly configured and\n\n1493\n01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,810\napplied, if we're not, we have to begin\ntroubleshooting in some other ways here.\n\n1494\n01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:15,720\n>> So those are some of the things\nthat basically come into play,\n\n1495\n01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,326\nI'm answering some chat room questions,\nbut\n\n1496\n01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,340\n[LAUGH] those are some of the things\nthat are going to come into play.\n\n1497\n01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,500\nThe easiest thing in my opinion,\nalways draw a diagram because that helps\n\n1498\n01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:30,466\nyou to see your directions and stuff like\nthat and second, pull up your configs.\n\n1499\n01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:34,415\nRead the config and take a look at it,\npay attention to that order and so on.\n\n1500\n01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,755\nJust have a good look at it.\n\n1501\n01:23:36,755 --> 01:23:38,455\n>> And,\nyou can't over emphasize that again,\n\n1502\n01:23:38,455 --> 01:23:42,755\neven though time is very critical in\nterms of the exam and each question.\n\n1503\n01:23:42,755 --> 01:23:46,145\nOne of the things that you might wanna\ntake time in here is drawing a quick\n\n1504\n01:23:46,145 --> 01:23:49,095\ndiagram, make the arrows, and\n\n1505\n01:23:49,095 --> 01:23:53,310\nmake sure you actually see the direction\nthat the traffic is going through.\n\n1506\n01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:57,040\nAnd don't forget once you actually create\nthe ACL, make sure you talk it out and\n\n1507\n01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,685\nthen apply it to the interface.\n\n1508\n01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:00,430\nIt's gonna be key for you.\n\n1509\n01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:04,310\nYou might think you can do it in your\nhead, but under time, crunch and pressure,\n\n1510\n01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,970\nthis is gonna save you more time that you\nrealize by being able to draw it out.\n\n1511\n01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:08,580\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1512\n01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:11,520\n>> And then any time you make\na change to an ACL, test it.\n\n1513\n01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,070\nEven in the simulator questions\nyou'll have that ability to test\n\n1514\n01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:17,010\nthe communication,\nsend a ping across, whatever,\n\n1515\n01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,320\nmake sure it's actually\nworking before you move on.\n\n1516\n01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,410\nCuz once you move passed a question,\nyou can't go back to it.\n\n1517\n01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:28,220\n>> Yeah, that's key [LAUGH] to never\nforget, especially on our Cisco exams.\n\n1518\n01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,570\n>> Well Ronnie,\nI think that pretty much wraps it up.\n\n1519\n01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:34,320\nAs far as troubleshooting, those\nare the key things we need to look for.\n\n1520\n01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,960\nObviously, there's a lot more that\nwe're gonna get into in the CCNA show.\n\n1521\n01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,650\nWhich will be launching next week.\n\n1522\n01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:42,320\nAs we kind of dive into\nall that's involved there.\n\n1523\n01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,680\nA lot more complex.\n\n1524\n01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,500\nA lot more things that\nwe need to worry about.\n\n1525\n01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,590\nOn the CCENT side though,\n\n1526\n01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:50,680\nthey're definitely hitting more on\nthe fundamentals and the theory and\n\n1527\n01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,820\nmaking sure you have that basic\nconfiguration skill down pat.\n\n1528\n01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:54,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1529\n01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:57,720\nFor CCENT as we continue through that.\n\n1530\n01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:04,260\nRemember, for\nus knowing how everything is set up is key\n\n1531\n01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,510\nby far in terms of anything that\nwe're doing with troubleshooting.\n\n1532\n01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:11,700\nBut remember that the syntax\nhas to be exact on everything.\n\n1533\n01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,600\nSo go back through the actual\nshows that we've been doing,\n\n1534\n01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,840\ntake a look at those show and\nmake sure you pay attention to the syntax.\n\n1535\n01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,030\nAnd where we emphasize the configurations\nhere, everything is actually key for us.\n\n1536\n01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:25,710\nHave good skills in terms of subnetting,\n\n1537\n01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:29,310\nbeing able to convert binary to decimal,\ndecimal to binary.\n\n1538\n01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:34,240\nThese are the kind of big, big concepts\nthat you get heavily tested on,\n\n1539\n01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,070\non this exam too.\n\n1540\n01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:40,990\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think\nthat pretty much wraps everything up.\n\n1541\n01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,240\nAnd one of the things I say at\nthe end of every show is, as always,\n\n1542\n01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,020\nif you have questions, jump into the live\nchatroom and post them during the show.\n\n1543\n01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:51,460\nBut since this is the last\nof the CCENT show,\n\n1544\n01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:55,010\nyou can always jump into the CCNA show and\nthrow your questions in there.\n\n1545\n01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:57,140\nOr you can always take\nadvantage of that Q and\n\n1546\n01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,710\nA section on the website at the top of\nthe page there’s a link that says Q and A.\n\n1547\n01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:01,590\nPost your questions.\n\n1548\n01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:02,940\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n1549\n01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,390\nSo anything that you got.\n\n1550\n01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,850\nIf it’s a really good question\nwe'll turn it into an episode and\n\n1551\n01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,210\nwe'll record something on it.\n\n1552\n01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,620\nBut, usually they're\npretty straightforward.\n\n1553\n01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,910\nWe just post them in there,\nyou get your answers, and\n\n1554\n01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:16,310\nit makes sure that you're ready by\nthe time you go to sit in that test booth.\n\n1555\n01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:19,490\nYou got the confidence that you need,\nyour questions have been answered, and\n\n1556\n01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,879\nyou're ready to go, so definitely make\nsure you take advantage of that resource.\n\n1557\n01:26:22,879 -->
