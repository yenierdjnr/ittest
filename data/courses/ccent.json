first\n\n3\n00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:17,493\nstep on your journey into\nCisco certifications.\n\n4\n00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,910\nIn particular, their routing and\nswitching certifications.\n\n5\n00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,350\nThe CCENT covers a wide\nrange of foundational\n\n6\n00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,550\ntopics that are very important\nto understand if you're gonna\n\n7\n00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,265\nbuild upon them in the more advanced\ncertifications down the road.\n\n8\n00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,040\nNot learning the base material\nreally does create that challenge.\n\n9\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,543\nYou can't learn advanced functionality\nif you don't understand basic\n\n10\n00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:38,100\nfunctionality first.\n\n11\n00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,670\nNow the CCENT, well that E stands for\nentry, and that describes the type of job\n\n12\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,120\nthat this employee, or someone certified\nwith the CCENT would be designed to fill.\n\n13\n00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,960\nEntry level, typically help desk,\ntechnical support type roles.\n\n14\n00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,600\nThese are small office,\nhome office type deployments.\n\n15\n00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,290\nEnvironments that might have one router,\nor one switch, or\n\n16\n00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,070\njust a couple of devices.\n\n17\n00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,785\nNot large or enterprise networks.\n\n18\n00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,800\nThat's where they start stepping\nup into the higher certifications.\n\n19\n00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,325\nIn fact,\nif you look at the certification path,\n\n20\n00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,850\nit's really just increasing the amount\nof devices that you're working with.\n\n21\n00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,190\nLet's take a look at that path real\nquick to get an idea of what I mean.\n\n22\n00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,665\nThis is CISCO's website for the CCENT page\nand they show the different certifications\n\n23\n00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:21,108\nand how they line up, and\nsee how they've arranged it as a pyramid.\n\n24\n00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:26,156\nEach one builds on the ones from before\nit, and the entry certification, that's\n\n25\n00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:31,150\nthat foundation, that's the base level\nthat everything else builds on top of.\n\n26\n00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,958\nSo very important and definitely something\nthat we need to make sure we grasp.\n\n27\n00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:35,740\nAll right.\n\n28\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,360\nAfter that, you progress to that CCNA,\nthe Cisco Certified Network Associate, and\n\n29\n00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,500\nthat's one of the most\nwell-known certifications, and\n\n30\n00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500\nthat's what most people\nare seeking to achieve.\n\n31\n00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,205\nNow you can skip over the CCENT, and\n\n32\n00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:53,215\ngo straight to the CCNA if you've already\nbeen working with Cisco equipment,\n\n33\n00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,025\nif you've already got some\nof the requisite knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,875\nYou'll see a lot of people do that if\nthey already have the network plus\n\n35\n00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,695\ncertification from CompTIA.\n\n36\n00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:05,200\nThe CompTIA network plus actually covers\na lot of the same stuff in the CCENT.\n\n37\n00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,830\nThe big difference is with CompTIA,\nit's vendor neutral training\n\n38\n00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,230\nversus the CCENT which is all from\nCisco and Cisco does have a slightly\n\n39\n00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,460\ndifferent perspective on some of the\ndifferent technologies you'll learn about.\n\n40\n00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,475\nSo, they're very close,\nbut they're not identical.\n\n41\n00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:24,775\nAnd if you do choose to skip the CCENT and\njump right to the CCNA,\n\n42\n00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:28,585\nyou'll have to take a composite exam\nthat's actually made up of both.\n\n43\n00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,197\nSo it's pulling questions from both pools.\n\n44\n00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:34,576\nSo, it's not like you get to skip that\none and not know the information.\n\n45\n00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,350\nYou do have to know the information.\n\n46\n00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,560\nNow for most people just\ngetting started with Cisco,\n\n47\n00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,610\nI do recommend that you start with the\nCCENT and do it separate from the CCNA and\n\n48\n00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,050\nwe'll see why when we get to the exam\nnumbers here in just a moment.\n\n49\n00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,440\nAll right now, the exam covers a wide\nrange of topics and most of them center\n\n50\n00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,900\naround the idea of taking a Cisco router\nor a Cisco switch out of the box,\n\n51\n00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,270\nbrand new, getting it configured and\nput in place in a small network.\n\n52\n00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,970\nAs you move up to the higher\nend certifications like\n\n53\n00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,900\nthe CCNA which is next, it starts to\nget to a slightly larger network,\n\n54\n00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,500\nmaybe 5 to 10 routers and 10 to 20\nswitches or something of that nature.\n\n55\n00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,850\nThen you move up to the CCNP.\n\n56\n00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,350\nAt the CCNP level, the professional level,\n\n57\n00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,890\nthat's where we're talking about hundreds\nor even thousands of routers and\n\n58\n00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,430\nswitches routing across the internet,\nmassive networks.\n\n59\n00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,250\nThis is where we get large,\nenterprise-scale networking knowledge.\n\n60\n00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,688\nAfter that,\nyou move into the expert level, the CCIE.\n\n61\n00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:38,590\nAnd the CCIE is one of those\nreally coveted, highly respected,\n\n62\n00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,630\nvery difficult certifications\nthat are out there, and\n\n63\n00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,180\nit is a level of experience that\nmost people aren't going to need.\n\n64\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,930\nIt's for enterprises.\n\n65\n00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,400\nPeople that have massive networks and\n\n66\n00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,540\nthey need somebody to not just design\na stable network, but maintain and\n\n67\n00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,810\nkeep it going, upgrades and all of that,\nand it's an expert level of knowledge.\n\n68\n00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,638\nIt's really in depth understanding of\nall the different technologies that\n\n69\n00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,980\nare involved.\n\n70\n00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,480\nEach of these certifications is building\noff of the knowledge from the previous\n\n71\n00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,960\none, so\nit forms together in one nice chain.\n\n72\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,400\nNow, the CCENT is one exam.\n\n73\n00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,690\nOne certification.\n\n74\n00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,570\nSo the exam for this one if we\njump over to it's exam page,\n\n75\n00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,540\nis the 100-101, or ICND1 exam.\n\n76\n00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,800\nNow that name, ICND1,\n\n77\n00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,060\nInterconnecting Cisco Network Devices,\nthat's the official Cisco course name.\n\n78\n00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,050\nIf you were to take the official\ncourse through Cisco,\n\n79\n00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,050\nyou'd actually be taking the ICND course.\n\n80\n00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,760\nYou'd then take the 100-101 exam, and\nyou'd receive the CCENT certification.\n\n81\n00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,220\nWith the ITProTV show, we cover all of\nthe exam objectives for the 100-101, so\n\n82\n00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,040\nwe're covering the same content, but\nwe don't call it ICND because, well,\n\n83\n00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,745\nit's not the official Cisco course, right?\n\n84\n00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:51,945\nThey have their own set of training\nthat they use, and we do it differently.\n\n85\n00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,245\nThe certification that you'll get though,\n\n86\n00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,835\nis the same CCENT that\neveryone else gets and\n\n87\n00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:00,635\nthen you progress up to the more advanced\nCCNA level certifications if you want.\n\n88\n00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,355\nNow, notice CCENT is\nkind of by itself here,\n\n89\n00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,975\nversus CCNA has all these specializations,\nrouting and switching,\n\n90\n00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,030\nsecurity, service provider,\nvoice, wireless.\n\n91\n00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,550\nWell CCENT is a prerequisite\nof all of those.\n\n92\n00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,567\nSo, regardless of which\nspecialization you're going for,\n\n93\n00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,081\nCCENT is that starting point.\n\n94\n00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:24,230\nThat's why this is the first\ncertification you'll pursue for Cisco.\n\n95\n00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,680\nNow, when you're ready to take that exam,\nyou can sign up for it.\n\n96\n00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,640\nCisco administers their exams through\na company called Pearson Vue.\n\n97\n00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,340\nYou can go to their website,\nit's www.pearsonvue, that's v-u-e, .com,\n\n98\n00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,600\nforward slash Cisco, that will take you\nto there page and you can go and sign up.\n\n99\n00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880\nIf you're not familiar with Pearson Vue,\nthey have testing centers\n\n100\n00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,990\nall over the world and on their website\nyou can find one that's near to you, so\n\n101\n00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,610\nit's easy to jump on over and\ntake the exam at your leisure, right?\n\n102\n00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,640\nSo it's definitely\na convenient thing to do.\n\n103\n00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,190\nOnce you pass that exam,\nyou get the CCENT certification and\n\n104\n00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,250\nyou're ready to progress beyond that.\n\n105\n00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,190\nLet's take a look at\nthose exam objectives.\n\n106\n00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,216\nThe exam is actually\nmade up of between 40 and\n\n107\n00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:09,120\n45 questions and\nyou have 90 minutes to do it in.\n\n108\n00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,530\nNow that sounds like you have about two\nminutes per question which is really\n\n109\n00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,560\nplenty of time, but the exam is not\njust multiple choice questions.\n\n110\n00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,505\nIt's made up of multiple choice, drag and\ndrop, choose all that apply, right?\n\n111\n00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:25,820\nMulti-answer type questions,\nand simulations.\n\n112\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,920\nSome questions will have\na simulated router or switch and\n\n113\n00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,230\nyou'll have to configure or\ntroubleshoot something.\n\n114\n00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,400\nThose questions take a lot longer\nthan a normal question and\n\n115\n00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,770\nyou'll find that 90 minutes is barely\nenough time to get through all of it.\n\n116\n00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,200\nCisco has done that on purpose.\n\n117\n00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,140\nThey want to make sure that\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n118\n00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,750\nThat you're not just\nsitting there guessing and\n\n119\n00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,140\ntrying to figure your way through it.\n\n120\n00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,070\nThat you know the right thing to do,\nand you move on.\n\n121\n00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,500\nThat does make it a pretty challenging\nexam, but it's pretty rewarding, too.\n\n122\n00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,720\nI definitely enjoy it.\n\n123\n00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,000\nFor the exam topics, the CCENT is\nspread over a large area of topics,\n\n124\n00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,550\nbecause it's all foundational knowledge.\n\n125\n00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,190\nYou're not expected to be an expert\non all of these things, but\n\n126\n00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,010\nyou are expected to have a basic\nunderstanding of the concepts in each.\n\n127\n00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,760\nWe start with just operation\nof IP data networks.\n\n128\n00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280\nHow do IP base networks function?\n\n129\n00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,580\nHow do IP addresses work?\n\n130\n00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,250\nHow do we have basic communications?\n\n131\n00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,520\nWhat is Ethernet?\n\n132\n00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380\nWhat is CSMA/CD?\n\n133\n00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,940\nThese are all things that\nyou need to understand\n\n134\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,390\njust to understand how\na basic network functions.\n\n135\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,670\nAfter that, we take a look at\nLAN switching technologies and\n\n136\n00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,000\nthat's the chance for the viewer to\nlearn how to configure a Cisco switch.\n\n137\n00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320\nWe take a blank brand new Cisco switch and\n\n138\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,940\nwe go through all the different\nconfiguration values that you can place on\n\n139\n00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,470\nit to get it operational\nin a small environment.\n\n140\n00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,280\nThen we tackle IP addressing specifically.\n\n141\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,970\nYou'll find that IP addresses are a lot\nmore complex than most people think, and\n\n142\n00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,970\nthere's a lot of neat stuff\nyou can do with them.\n\n143\n00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,615\nSo we spend a lot of\ntime discussing that and\n\n144\n00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:55,585\nnot just IPv4 but IPv6 also because that's\nthe way the networks are moving today.\n\n145\n00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,045\nThen we jump into routing.\n\n146\n00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:02,045\nIP routing technologies is where we take\na look at configuring a Cisco router and\n\n147\n00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:06,065\ngetting it in place to allow\ncommunication between networks.\n\n148\n00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,235\nWe also look at some dynamic routing\nprotocols and how the routers can\n\n149\n00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:13,030\ntalk to each other to learn the best\nroute between two different locations.\n\n150\n00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,050\nIP services is the next one and\n\n151\n00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,600\nthat expands upon the routing\nservices that we talked about before.\n\n152\n00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,820\nWe'll get a chance to see some of\nthe other things that our routers can do.\n\n153\n00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,370\nThey can do a lot of stuff.\n\n154\n00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,980\nYou'll find that routers can\nactually be used as firewalls, or\n\n155\n00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,300\nas VPN tunnel endpoints.\n\n156\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,480\nThere's all kinds of cool things\nthat a Cisco router can do,\n\n157\n00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640\nif you just know to turn it on.\n\n158\n00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,910\nNext we've got security and this is\nNetwork Device Security specifically,\n\n159\n00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,430\nwhich is saying if an attacker compromises\nyour router or if they compromise your\n\n160\n00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,470\nswitch, there's a lot of stuff they\ncould do to access your data and\n\n161\n00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,970\nyou won't even know it.\n\n162\n00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,510\nSo we need to secure our routers and\nswitches to ensure that\n\n163\n00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,180\nunauthorized access isn't allowed, and so\nwe focus on that in that sixth session.\n\n164\n00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,070\nAnd then the last section\nis troubleshooting.\n\n165\n00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,790\nOne of the basic troubleshooting steps for\nlocating issues in your network and\n\n166\n00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,890\nresolving them as quickly and\nefficiently as possible.\n\n167\n00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,920\nAll of this is great knowledge and\nyou'll see each topic has a certain\n\n168\n00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,370\npercentage value of the exam and\nit's pretty evenly spread.\n\n169\n00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,810\nSome were as small as 6% or as large\nas 26%, but every one of them weighs in\n\n170\n00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,370\na good bit, and it's all good\nfoundational knowledge to have.\n\n171\n00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,890\nAll right, now the ICND1 is\nthe first exam that you'll do,\n\n172\n00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,300\nand when you pass that,\nyou get your CCENT.\n\n173\n00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,590\nIf you move onto the CCNA,\nthe next level, well it has its own exam.\n\n174\n00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,960\nAnd if I jump back here, I'll just\nswitch over to the CCNA real quick so\n\n175\n00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,520\nwe can see it.\n\n176\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,616\nNotice on the CCNA it has two exams.\n\n177\n00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,414\nThe 100-101 and 200-101.\n\n178\n00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,481\nThat's ICND1 and ICND2.\n\n179\n00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:53,000\nBasically you have to have your\nCCENT in order to get your CCNA.\n\n180\n00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,520\nSo the first one is that same CCENT exam,\nand\n\n181\n00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,110\nthe second one is specifically for\nthe CCNA.\n\n182\n00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,910\nYou've gotta do both.\n\n183\n00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,114\nNow I said you could skip\nthe CCENT if you wanted.\n\n184\n00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:08,198\nIf you wanna skip it, if you've already\ngot the base knowledge, if you've already\n\n185\n00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:11,879\ngot a network plus certification for\nexample, you might choose to skip past\n\n186\n00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,870\nthe CCENT, and if you do, you can take\nthis exam right here, the composite exam.\n\n187\n00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,645\nThe 200-120.\n\n188\n00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:22,640\nIt's one exam and\nit covers both sets of knowledge.\n\n189\n00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,220\nAll of the ICND1 and 2, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,920\nThat's how you would go about\nskipping the CCENT, but\n\n191\n00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,590\nI'll tell you, it's not really worth it.\n\n192\n00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,210\nAnd the reason is,\nyou don't save any money,\n\n193\n00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,050\nthe composite exam actually costs as much\nas the two individual exams combined.\n\n194\n00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,630\nSo, you don't save any money by doing\nit and you open yourself up to risk.\n\n195\n00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,100\nWe always hope that we pass the exam\non the first time, but if for\n\n196\n00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,230\nsome reason you don't pass, well,\nif you took them separately,\n\n197\n00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,980\nyou may have passed the first one and\nnot the second, you get your CCEMT, right?\n\n198\n00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,670\nBut not your CCNA.\n\n199\n00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,280\nIf you don't pass the composite exam,\nyou get nothing, right?\n\n200\n00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,740\nYou get no certification.\n\n201\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,610\nSo it's almost like a safety net to\ngo ahead and take them separately.\n\n202\n00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,450\nIt just costs you time, right?\n\n203\n00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,280\nAn additional 90 minutes to go and\nsit the other exam, but\n\n204\n00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,900\nthat is how I recommend you do it.\n\n205\n00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,620\nSo CCENT, even if you already have\nthe knowledge, it's good to go ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,210\nget it cuz you'll get that certification\non your resume, and you've got\n\n207\n00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,900\na little bit less risk and a smaller area\nof data to focus in for that second exam.\n\n208\n00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,935\nAll right well, that's what the CCENT\nis designed for entry-level people\n\n209\n00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:34,160\ngetting ready for help desk and support\ntype positions, small networks, right?\n\n210\n00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,730\nAnd it's a good certification,\n\n211\n00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,100\ndefinitely a great way to get\nyour feet wet with Cisco.\n\n212\n00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,010\nIf that sounds exciting to you and\nit sounds like what you need to learn,\n\n213\n00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,600\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n214\n00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,820\nStay tuned because we've got CCENT\nepisodes coming up after this.\n\n215\n00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,770\nIf that doesn't sound right for you, for\nexample if you wanna skip past this and\n\n216\n00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,270\njump to CCNA, well, be sure to do that.\n\n217\n00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,570\nIt's all part of the ITProTV library and\nit's part of your subscription, so\n\n218\n00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,820\nyou can start wherever\nyou feel is appropriate.\n\n219\n00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,145\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n220\n00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,330\nThat's one of the nice\nthings about our service.\n\n221\n00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,098\nAll right well for those of you that\nare sticking with me, let's go ahead and\n\n222\n00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:05,627\nget started.\n\n223\n00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:09,784\n[SOUND]\n\n",
