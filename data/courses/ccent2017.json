          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:08.763\n[SOUND].\n\n2\n00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:12.547\nIn this video we're gonna take a look\nat the Cisco certified entry network\n\n3\n00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:16.330\ntechnician certification\nshow right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.860\nFirst off, let's talk a little\nbit about the certification.\n\n5\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.760\nThe CCENT is designed\nto be your first step\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.640\non the path to becoming a Cisco\ncertified network administrator.\n\n7\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.130\nThat this is designed for people who had\nno work with Cisco who came up before.\n\n8\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.770\nYou may have never touched\na Cisco router or switch.\n\n9\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.890\nMaybe you never even seen them.\n\n10\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.820\nWe start from the very basics and walk you\nthrough, getting that first device set up.\n\n11\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.780\nHow do you get it out of the box, get\nit turned on, and get it doing its job?\n\n12\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.590\nAnd then what are some of\nthe advanced features?\n\n13\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.405\nCCENT is absolutely\nstarting with the basics.\n\n14\n00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:52.765\nWe focus on one router, or one switch,\nversus things like the CCNA,\n\n15\n00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:54.885\nthat's more like ten routers and\nten switches.\n\n16\n00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:58.385\nOr the CCNP where it's hundreds of\nrouters or hundreds of switches.\n\n17\n00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:00.815\nIt gets progressively more complex.\n\n18\n00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.760\nSo, CCENT is that beginning part.\n\n19\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.045\nThis certification is designed for\n\n20\n00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:09.485\npeople who are, maybe you want to\nbecome a network administrator, right?\n\n21\n00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:13.880\nCisco is the most Common network\nmanufacturer out there in the enterprise\n\n22\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.720\nmarketplace, you're gonna see\nit in a lot of job requirements.\n\n23\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.450\nSo if you're wanting to get started,\nmaybe you're already an IT and\n\n24\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.960\nyou're supporting servers and you wanna\nstart moving over to the network side.\n\n25\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.902\nOr maybe you're one of those\njack of all trades and\n\n26\n00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:27.725\nyou've been tasked with supporting\nservers and switches and routers,\n\n27\n00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:29.402\nyou've got the whole thing on your plate.\n\n28\n00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:31.740\nWell, Cisco's a great one to learn.\n\n29\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.040\nThere's other vendors that are out\nthere like HP and Juniper and\n\n30\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.970\nthey make great equipment but Cisco\nreally is the market leader in this area.\n\n31\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.538\nSo if you learn their equipment,\n\n32\n00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:43.344\nthe odds are you'll be able\nto support most environments.\n\n33\n00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:47.355\nAnd the technologies are really kind of\ncommon between a lot of the vendors so\n\n34\n00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.502\nwe see that here too.\n\n35\n00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.891\nNow CCENT does overlap a bit\nwith CompTIA's Network+, so\n\n36\n00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:54.547\nif you've already done that certification.\n\n37\n00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.240\nSome of it will be overlapped because we\ndo cover some fundamentals in theories.\n\n38\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.900\nLet's take a look at\nthe exam itself real quick.\n\n39\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.131\nSo like I mentioned, CCNT is that\nstarting point on your Cisco Careers.\n\n40\n00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:09.046\nSo CCNA being the next step, that's\nthe Cisco Certified Network Associate and\n\n41\n00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:12.530\nthen Cisco Certified Network Professional\nbeyond that.\n\n42\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.819\nThe exam itself, it is one exam and\none certification.\n\n43\n00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.736\nSo you'll take the 100-105 which\nis the version 3.0 of the CCENT.\n\n44\n00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:25.525\nThe exam itself is actually\ncalled the interconnecting\n\n45\n00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:27.312\nCisco Network Devices Part I exam.\n\n46\n00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:31.320\nThe CCNA exam is the interconnecting\nCisco Network Devices Part 2 exam.\n\n47\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.380\nYou have to pass both to get your CCNA.\n\n48\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.194\nYou just to have pass this\none to get your CCENT.\n\n49\n00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:41.220\nThe exam itself covers\nnetwork fundamentals.\n\n50\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.970\nRight, that's that overlap with Network+.\n\n51\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.610\nWe're gonna talk about IP addressing,\nand Ethernet networks, and\n\n52\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.270\nwireless networks, and\nhow these networks function.\n\n53\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.380\nThen we get into LAN\nswitching fundamentals,\n\n54\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.330\nwhich is really Cisco switches.\n\n55\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.820\nSo how does Cisco switches work?\n\n56\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.810\nHow do we configure them?\n\n57\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.050\nHow do we use technologies like VLANs?\n\n58\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.700\nHow do we implement them?\n\n59\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.150\nThen we get into routing fundamentals.\n\n60\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.010\nHow do routers work?\n\n61\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.580\nHow do you set up a router, initially?\n\n62\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.060\nHow do you use dynamic routing protocols,\nand static routing protocols.\n\n63\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.350\nHow do they make the decisions they make?\n\n64\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.710\nThen we get into infrastructure service.\n\n65\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.700\nThis is probably the one\nI have the most fun with.\n\n66\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.990\nBecause Cisco routers and switches can\ndo way more than just route and switch.\n\n67\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.490\nAnd so we look at the advanced\nfunctionality that's built into them.\n\n68\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.410\nThe stuff that's turned off by default.\n\n69\n00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.565\nAnd we learn how to turn it on and\n\n70\n00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:26.332\nactually make use of all that hardware\nthat we just paid so much money for.\n\n71\n00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:29.080\nAnd then lastly we talked about\ninfrastructure maintenance.\n\n72\n00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.780\nOnce you've got your routers and\nswitches configured,\n\n73\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.140\nyou can't just forget about them.\n\n74\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.850\nThere's routine maintenance that we need\nto do to keep them up and running and\n\n75\n00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.500\nhealthy, make sure they're patched for\nsecurity purposes and\n\n76\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.050\ntroubleshoot any issues that come up.\n\n77\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.970\nThat's all covered right there in the end.\n\n78\n00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.995\nNow, one of the really cool parts\nabout the CCENT is, it is a great\n\n79\n00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:50.650\nstepping-stone, it's that first step to\ngetting into Cisco Certification Network.\n\n80\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.330\nAnd, it's also a multi-purpose cert.\n\n81\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.288\nIt used to be that CCENT matched up\nwith the CCNA for routing and switching,\n\n82\n00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:02.947\nbut now CCENT is actually a requirement\nfor several different CCNAs.\n\n83\n00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:05.590\nYou might continue on with\nCCNA routing and switching.\n\n84\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.440\nOr you might do CCNA security or\nCCNA wireless.\n\n85\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.700\nThe CCENT exam is the same for\nall of them.\n\n86\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.202\nSo, once you've passed your CCNA,\nyou're ready to move into any.\n\n87\n00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:18.450\nI'm sorry, once you've passed your CCENT,\n\n88\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.970\nyou are ready to move into any of\nthe CCNA's that are out there.\n\n89\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.880\nAnd you'll see there's CCNA Cloud,\nCollaboration, Cyber Ops, Data Center,\n\n90\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.630\nIndustrial, Routing and Switching,\nSecurity, Wireless, Service Provider.\n\n91\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.310\nAll these different ones,\nCCENT is a requirement for them.\n\n92\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.640\nSo definitely a great place to get\nstarted on your certification career.\n\n93\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.180\nNow when you're ready to take the exam,\n\n94\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.140\nthe exam is actually administered\nthrough Pearson Vue.\n\n95\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.550\nYou can go to the website,\n\n96\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.570\nit's vue.com and\nyou can locate a testing center near you.\n\n97\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.790\nThey're located all over the world.\n\n98\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.930\nAnd so you can sign up through Vue,\ngo and take the exam, pass it and\n\n99\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.190\nget your CCENT certification.\n\n100\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.060\nNow throughout our series, we're gonna\nbe covering all the exam objectives for\n\n101\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.240\nthat exam.\n\n102\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.750\nOnce you get in there, you start working\nwith the system, you get used to it.\n\n103\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.560\nYou jump in, you pass the test,\nyou get the certification and\n\n104\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.390\nit's on your resume and you just started\nyour journey in the networking world.\n\n105\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.878\nAnother thing that I wanna mention here\nreal quick in the overview is that\n\n106\n00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:16.776\nif you're just getting started, you might\nnot have access to Cisco equipment.\n\n107\n00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:18.600\nI'm gonna show you all sorts\nof things in this show.\n\n108\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.440\nWe'll see how to configure,\nhow the commands work,\n\n109\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.752\nbut there's no substitute for actually\ngetting exposure to real equipment.\n\n110\n00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:27.760\nWell, on the ITPro.TV website,\nif you take a look,\n\n111\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.850\nwe have what are called our advanced labs.\n\n112\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.950\nThey're not our regular labs.\n\n113\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.210\nThey are advanced labs.\n\n114\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.880\nInstead of having a virtual\nenvironment like our normal labs,\n\n115\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.090\nour advanced labs give you access\nto real physical equipment.\n\n116\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.630\nWe have a data center that's over in\nLondon, you'll be able to connect in and\n\n117\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.450\nremotely access those devices.\n\n118\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.220\nIt's priced at, I believe,\nsomewhere around $50 a year, so\n\n119\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.850\nit's extremely inexpensive.\n\n120\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.440\nAnd that gives you access to multiple\nrouters and multiple switches,\n\n121\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.530\nnot simulated ones, actual real\nrouters that you can work with any\n\n122\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.670\ntime you want throughout the day, 7 days\na week, 365 days a year, it's available.\n\n123\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.740\nThere's step by step labs you can go\nthrough to try the technologies out and\n\n124\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.720\nlearn, and really see that.\n\n125\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.200\nAs you watch the show, you'll see\nwhere even I use the advanced labs.\n\n126\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.930\nIn some of the episodes,\nI use real equipment too.\n\n127\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.640\nReal equipment is nice to just go on\neBay and buy some used equipment, and\n\n128\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.588\nyou can test and experiment and use it.\n\n129\n00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:19.430\nYou wouldn't wanna use it in production,\nbut for\n\n130\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.370\na home lab you can really learn\neverything you need to know.\n\n131\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.030\nSo definitely get some hands on exposure.\n\n132\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.820\nWatch our shows,\nwe cover the technologies there.\n\n133\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.660\nAnd when you do both, you're ready.\n\n134\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.560\nYou're gonna pass the exam, get that\nCCENT, and launch your certification.\n\n135\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.770\nSo if that sounds exciting to you,\nyou're definitely in the right place.\n\n136\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.670\nStay tuned,\nwe got CCENT episodes coming up.\n\n137\n00:06:37.670 -->

The guys discuss how a router builds its routing table through directly connected routes, static assignments and routing protocols.  Routing protocols are the preferred method when you have multiple routers and there are many advantages to using them, they explain.   Don and Ronnie also take a few moments to describe the difference between Distance Vector and Link State Protocols too.   Lastly, they mention how a cisco router deals with the possibility of multiple routes to the same destination from multiple protocols by using Administrative Distance—the trustworthiness of a route protocol and the load balancing that can occur if  multiple routes have the same metric.",
