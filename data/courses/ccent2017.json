Routing protocols are the preferred method when you have multiple routers and there are many advantages to using them, they explain.   Don and Ronnie also take a few moments to describe the difference between Distance Vector and Link State Protocols too.   Lastly, they mention how a cisco router deals with the possibility of multiple routes to the same destination from multiple protocols by using Administrative Distance—the trustworthiness of a route protocol and the load balancing that can occur if  multiple routes have the same metric.",
