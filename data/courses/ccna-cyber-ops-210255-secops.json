show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:12.705\nYou'll see that during this show,\n\n4\n00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.959\nwe'll probably end up referring\nto it as CCNA SECOPS very often.\n\n5\n00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.132\nAnd that is because this particular\nshow matches up to the exam for,\n\n6\n00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:25.950\nof course,\nyour CCNA Cyber Ops certification as well.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.260\nNow, let's talk about a few details on\nthe exam as we actually get started this\n\n8\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.992\ntoo, okay?\n\n9\n00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:34.193\nIf you are getting ready for the exam,\nwe want to know a little bit about,\n\n10\n00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:37.230\nof course, preparing and\ngetting access to the exam as well.\n\n11\n00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.790\nLet's take a look at my screen,\nthat will help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.929\nMake sure you go to the Pearson VUE\nwebsite, and when you do so,\n\n13\n00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.077\nyou, of course, can select the program.\n\n14\n00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:49.680\nFor us, it's gonna be Cisco, and\nthat should pop up Cisco Systems.\n\n15\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.780\nAnd once we do this, you, if you have\nnot yet actually created an account,\n\n16\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.920\nmake sure you create an account\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n17\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.490\nOnce you do so, of course,\nyou'll log back in, come to the same site.\n\n18\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.498\nFrom this point, you will go down\nto where it says View exams, so\n\n19\n00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.523\nthat you can find the correct exam number.\n\n20\n00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:12.644\nAnd once we do so, we're gonna actually be\nunderneath these Proctored Exams, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.998\nSo Cisco does offer some\nof the other ones, but\n\n22\n00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:22.021\nwe're underneath the Proctored Exams,\nand we're looking for 210-255,\n\n23\n00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:27.029\n210-255, Implementing Cisco\nCybersecurity Operations.\n\n24\n00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:33.256\nAnd once you do that, notice that there's\nactually a couple of different languages,\n\n25\n00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.403\nEnglish and Japanese.\n\n26\n00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:38.504\nLet's select English at this point and\nclick Next.\n\n27\n00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:42.910\nFrom that point, of course, you'll\nschedule the exam, which will be near you.\n\n28\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.430\nThere's a button over on the lower\nright-hand corner that will allow you to\n\n29\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.520\npick a center near you, and\nthat's what you'll have to do.\n\n30\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.770\nMake sure that you arrive about 15 minutes\nearly, and that way you also bring,\n\n31\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.040\nof course, a photo ID, and\nthat you are ready for the exam as well.\n\n32\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.833\nNow when we start taking a look\nat the details of the exam,\n\n33\n00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.372\nthat is what we're also here for too.\n\n34\n00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:07.652\nThe entire, of course, CCNA\nCybersecurity Operations show is based\n\n35\n00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:10.191\naround the exam objectives themselves,\n\n36\n00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:14.310\nthat you can download directly\nfrom Cisco Learning website.\n\n37\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.800\nSo make sure you do that first, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600\nNotice that the exam is a 90 minute exam,\nand\n\n39\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.290\nthere's between 60 to 70 questions\nin this assessment, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.950\nNow, to achieve the overall certification\nitself, you must take two exams.\n\n41\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.220\nThe first one, of course,\nis the Security Fundamentals exam, and\n\n42\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.300\nthen this one on the Implementing\nCisco Cybersecurity Operations.\n\n43\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.598\nBoth of those will lead you to your\nCCNA Cyber Ops certification, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:46.379\nNow the whole goal, of course, as we\nactually take a look at this particular\n\n45\n00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.654\nshow is, not only for you to be\nable to achieve your certification.\n\n46\n00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:55.652\nBut also to help prepare you as an entry\nlevel analyst in working in a security\n\n47\n00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:56.992\noperation center.\n\n48\n00:02:56.992 --> 00:03:01.656\nAnd so, the goal and the show,\nof course, is designed around that, and\n\n49\n00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:05.120\nit's also designed around\nthese exam topics.\n\n50\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo throughout the show, we will be\ncovering every exam topic as well.\n\n51\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.959\nWe talk about endpoint threat and\ncomputer forensics analysis,\n\n52\n00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.806\nas we break it down through using these\ndifferent terms using the CVSS 3.0.\n\n53\n00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.359\nAnd we'll make sure that we\ncover all the details in that.\n\n54\n00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.239\nWe, of course, will take a look at some\nof the different items that pertain to\n\n55\n00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.240\nthe Windows file system,\nas well as the Linux file system.\n\n56\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.110\nWe'll also talk, of course,\nabout evidence, and\n\n57\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.240\nthe different image types that\nwe may also be using, in terms\n\n58\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.530\nof making sure that we're ready to work\nin that security operations center.\n\n59\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.940\nAnd then, of course, describe the idea\nof an investigation, and the threats,\n\n60\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.122\nand the threat actors that are in place.\n\n61\n00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:50.230\nUnder the Network Intrusion Analysis,\nwe, of course, will go through each and\n\n62\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.098\nevery one of these topics as well,\nincluding the protocol headers,\n\n63\n00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:56.240\nin which we'll take a look at in depth.\n\n64\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.340\nWe'll also see, of course, different\nelements using NetFlow Version 5.\n\n65\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.240\nWe, of course, will work with Wireshark\nand using PCAP files as well.\n\n66\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.300\nAnd we, of course, will talk about the\nfive tuples of data as we go through this.\n\n67\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.370\nWe'll show you how to extract a file from\na TCP stream given a PCAP file as well.\n\n68\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.020\nAnd then, of course, different\nelements that are involved there,\n\n69\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.491\nmaking sure we can identify them too.\n\n70\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.076\nAs we move into the third section,\nwe'll now move into incident responses.\n\n71\n00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:32.025\nAnd we will heavily focus in upon\nthe NIST documentation here on\n\n72\n00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:37.088\nSP800-61, or excuse me, 800-61 r2.\n\n73\n00:04:37.088 --> 00:04:41.221\nAnd this will help us to go ahead and\nprepare, as you see, it's referred to in\n\n74\n00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.375\nmultiple sections throughout, of course,\nthis third domain objectives.\n\n75\n00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.736\nWe, of course,\nwill describe the idea of using CSIRT\n\n76\n00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:53.230\nin our particular centers as well,\nand then, the network profiling.\n\n77\n00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.830\nAnd then we'll look at, of course,\ndata and event analysis.\n\n78\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.420\nAnd we'll take a look at all the elements\nthat are described right here,\n\n79\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.900\ngoing from data normalization,\n\n80\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.290\nof course, to actually comparing different\nanalytic methods that we have in hand.\n\n81\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.220\nAnd lastly, we'll also end up focusing on\na couple of other NIST documents too, or\n\n82\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.270\nat least one other one, okay?\n\n83\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.300\nSo we'll take a look at the kill\nchain right here in 5.1,\n\n84\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.760\nas well as the same NIST document\nwe referred to earlier, and\n\n85\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.700\nthen later on,\nanother NIST document as well.\n\n86\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.100\nAnd lastly, we'll talk about other\nschemas that are also involved\n\n87\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.210\nin what you may find very common,\ninside of your security operations center.\n\n88\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.644\nSo if you are now in this process\nof preparing for this second exam,\n\n89\n00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:44.496\nor for the CCNA Cyber Ops overall,\nI do have to actually make\n\n90\n00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:50.532\na particularly good recommendation\nto you before you proceed on, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:55.000\nYou can choose to take either one of\nthe exams in whatever order you choose to.\n\n92\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.257\nThe recommendation, of course, is that you\ntake the Security Fundamentals first and\n\n93\n00:05:59.257 --> 00:06:02.600\nthen take, of course,\nthe SECOPS exam second, okay?\n\n94\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.980\nDo not be surprised to find that you'll\nsee a lot of the elements that are in\n\n95\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.210\nthe Security Fundamentals exam also\nappear in the SECOPS exam as well.\n\n96\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.710\nSo just be prepared for\nthat as you continue to go ahead and\n\n97\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.200\nstudy, as well as watch the shows that\nwe've created right here to help you too.\n\n98\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.951\nDon't forget to take advantage of\nthe forums that are also at the ITProTV\n\n99\n00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:27.511\nwebsite.\n\n100\n00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:32.361\nBut if you're ready to get started, all\nyou have to do is actually go ahead and\n\n101\n00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.121\nget forwarded into\nthe very first video on,\n\n102\n00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.572\nof course,\nour CCNA Cybersecurity Operations show.\n\n103\n00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:39.435\nThank you for

00:00:16.694\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:18.732\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:23.611\nin today's episode we are kicking off our\nnew Cisco Cybersecurity Operations series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.235\nWhich henceforth will be known as SecOps-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:26.235 -->

00:00:35.175\nJoining us in the studio to help us\nwith that endeavor, our good friend,\n\n13\n00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.345\nthe master blaster himself.\n\n14\n00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:37.510\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.400\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n16\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.290\nHow is it going today?\n\n17\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.610\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n18\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.877\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we start this particular series in\n\n19\n00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.466\nlearning about some of\nthe different tools.\n\n20\n00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:51.395\nAnd of course the ideal security\noperations and what we need to do.\n\n21\n00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:52.597\nAnd so today, Daniel,\n\n22\n00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:56.970\nwe're actually looking into reading\nreports is what we're talking about.\n\n23\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.745\nAnd this is a big important part of\nsome of the things that we have to be\n\n24\n00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:01.416\nable to do.\n\n25\n00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.692\nAnd the reason for it,\nright, is that security,\n\n26\n00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:08.988\nas far as most beginners go,\nwe tend to take a look at it in one way.\n\n27\n00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:10.748\nWhich is always about the idea of,\n\n28\n00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:13.610\nlet's sit down those security\nfundamentals, right?\n\n29\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840\nWe take a look at our iron triangle,\nwe make sure that we follow those rules.\n\n30\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.220\nAnd it really comes down to\nsaying my system is hardened.\n\n31\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.420\nWe're protected,\nthat's all that I need to do.\n\n32\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.680\nBut, Daniel, you and I have worked\nin the industry long enough to\n\n33\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.810\nknow something that even if we\ndo all that have you, Daniel,\n\n34\n00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.440\nin your work experience found an enduser's\nworkstation infected by something?\n\n35\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe like a bazillion times,\n\n36\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.520\nlike it was a part of my everyday job,\nfor quite some time.\n\n37\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.810\nEspecially back a few years ago,\nbefore we really had some\n\n38\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.970\nreally good advanced threat management,\nwhen it came to the end user workstation.\n\n39\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.710\nAnd God love those users out there,\n\n40\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.100\nthey find a way to get some\nbaddies onto their computers.\n\n41\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.793\nSo, part of my day was\nalways give taking a call,\n\n42\n00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:05.040\nmy computer seems to be running slowly.\n\n43\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.626\nOr I just it seems you're acting weird\ndoing something on don't expect that I'll\n\n44\n00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:10.299\nlook at it.\n\n45\n00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.028\nIt was against malware on it maybe we\nwould run an anti-virus solutions of\n\n46\n00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:15.160\nan hour by sure.\n\n47\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.720\nIf it was just to host the premises.\n\n48\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.823\n&gt;&gt; And now Daniel see anything you want\nat least one step further away, and\n\n49\n00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:23.111\nI actually ever with as I\nstarted thinking about it.\n\n50\n00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.639\nAnd the more that I started\nto do too kind of two things,\n\n51\n00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.703\nI would go that extra step and go,\nall right, let's run some anti-malware,\n\n52\n00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:35.410\nanti-spyware, antivirus,\nwhatever system is on it.\n\n53\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.942\nAnd even if it caught it,\nDaniel, it took time.\n\n54\n00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:39.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.920\n&gt;&gt; All the sudden, that user's\njust standing there, like, okay,\n\n56\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.310\nwell, I guess I'm going to lunch\nwhile Ronnie works on this system.\n\n57\n00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.770\nAnd if it found something,\nit found something, but\n\n58\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.790\nwhat I would normally end up finding,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.710\nIf it found nothing I would\nkind of still be frustrated.\n\n60\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.210\nAnd after awhile you'd kinda just go,\n\n61\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.900\nright, here's what our solution\nis gonna end up being.\n\n62\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.870\nAnd a lot of companies end up doing this,\nwhich is simple.\n\n63\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.940\nIf we suspect that there's a virus and\nwe just check and go,\n\n64\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.820\nyou haven't been saving anything\non the computer system, right?\n\n65\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.990\nNo, I didn't say that for\ncentral share, right?\n\n66\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.500\nYes, great,\nbecause what can I do immediately then,\n\n67\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.330\ninstead of having to go through that?\n\n68\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.910\n&gt;&gt; You just blow the thing away,\nand start all over from scratch.\n\n69\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But that's a lie,\n\n70\n00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:21.841\ncuz they save stuff on their computers.\n\n71\n00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a lie, yeah,\nthey don't, where did this go?\n\n72\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.640\nWell, you told me you saved everything.\n\n73\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.300\nToo bad, it's gone,\nbecause I have now started over\n\n74\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.500\nit should work like a brand new machine\nand we are and we're ready to go.\n\n75\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.686\n&gt;&gt; And that's why the prevalence of using\nvirtualized environments to do things like\n\n76\n00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:41.216\nthin clients is very, very, it's becoming\nmore prevalent anyway cuz it's so easy.\n\n77\n00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:42.640\nYou're having trouble with your computer?\n\n78\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.150\nNo problem restart it.\n\n79\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.890\nAnd a brand new virtual environment it's\npumped down into that little system and\n\n80\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.650\nthey have all their tools that they need.\n\n81\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.410\nLike Ronnie said, everything\nshould be up on the central share,\n\n82\n00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.980\nyou don't have to worry about it anymore,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seemed like that that should\nbe the ideal and the way that it goes.\n\n84\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.240\nBut we find out something, right,\n\n85\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.880\nbecause we've now entered into this age\nof cyber attacks happening so often now.\n\n86\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.320\nAnd so many different things going on,\nDaniel.\n\n87\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.200\nThat we're no longer keeping up with\nit as easy as just reimaging machine.\n\n88\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.231\nIf I had to do that now, I'd probably\nbe reimaging everybody’s machine\n\n89\n00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:17.232\nat least once a week if\nnot more often than that.\n\n90\n00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:18.329\n&gt;&gt; Here comes the weekly rollout, right?\n\n91\n00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so we have to be begin to take\n\n92\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.530\na little bit more time in doing\nthe analysis of these things.\n\n93\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.150\nBut really, when it comes down\nto right in our analysis and\n\n94\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.750\nwhat we would actually discover is,\nall right.\n\n95\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.834\nThere's malware, we just fix it and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n96\n00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:36.800\n&gt;&gt; That's not really-- you're just kinda\nputting a band-aid on the problem instead\n\n97\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.010\nof finding what's causing the problem and\nfixing that, right?\n\n98\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the problem,\nright, is that we do.\n\n99\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.520\nWe tend to put a band-aid on it, why?\n\n100\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.470\nDo to productivity.\n\n101\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We want things to be productive.\n\n102\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.425\n&gt;&gt; It's quicker.\n&gt;&gt; So it's quicker and\n\n103\n00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:49.209\nso we can get everybody back to work.\n\n104\n00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:51.665\nBut it really doesn't help\nanybody else out, and\n\n105\n00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:54.150\nit doesn't help your organization out.\n\n106\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.236\nIf that's what end up\nhappening is that you only go.\n\n107\n00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.914\nAll right,\nhere is the solution that we gonna try,\n\n108\n00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:02.730\nbecause we know as faster to trying and\nput a dum on it.\n\n109\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.998\nAnd fix what the problem is and\nseal off were there is happening here.\n\n110\n00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:09.678\nBut now that we are actually\nin this age where\n\n111\n00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:14.321\nwe are starting to fight of course\nthe idea cybersecurity types of attacks.\n\n112\n00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:16.850\nIt means we need to take\na little bit more time.\n\n113\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.380\nSo the whole kind of theme behind SecOps,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.873\nIt's not the idea of okay\nsystems are just harden.\n\n115\n00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:27.163\nWe're now taking a look at the entire\nlife cycle of what the idea of\n\n116\n00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:29.120\nthe attacks go like, right?\n\n117\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.420\nSo that your business is fighting\nthe attacks before they come in, okay.\n\n118\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.641\nIt's actually mitigating\nthem as they're happening.\n\n119\n00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:40.640\nBut also,\nit's learning about them after the fact.\n\n120\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.730\nSo you get a machine that's compromised.\n\n121\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.190\nWell, for me the only solution I dealt\nwith in the last couple of years that I\n\n122\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.090\nwas dealing with was simple.\n\n123\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.400\nReimage, off to go cuz it was easy.\n\n124\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400\nBut it used to be where it's like we\nneed to figure out what's going on,\n\n125\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.560\nwhat's happening?\n\n126\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.430\nAnd now we're getting back to that, okay?\n\n127\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.330\nAnd so one of the places that\nwe're going to begin to start, and\n\n128\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.040\nthis is true whether we're actually a tier\none support or whether we're tier three,\n\n129\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.800\nor whatever level that you're at.\n\n130\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.820\nThat we need to do a little\nbit more of understanding and\n\n131\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.660\nreading the analysis of things that\ncome in to what's actually before us.\n\n132\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.246\nSo as a SecOps, a person, right,\n\n133\n00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:22.096\nas an analyst that comes in\nto take a look at things.\n\n134\n00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:27.041\nYou have to spend some time in some of\nthese utilities to understand what it\n\n135\n00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:30.790\nis you're looking at as\nthings are happening.\n\n136\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.659\nThe great thing is\nthe detection can happen.\n\n137\n00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.900\nEven if it happens after\na fact like we go okay,\n\n138\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.130\nwe know that that machine is\ninfected we can still learn from it.\n\n139\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.420\nAnd that way the next attack that comes\non, we go ahead and protect it or\n\n140\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.857\nwe learn from it and\nwe add to that community knowledge.\n\n141\n00:06:46.857 --> 00:06:51.040\nAnd then we actually learn how to spot\nit quicker the next time as it comes in.\n\n142\n00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.760\nSo, this is feeding into\nitself in terms of us\n\n143\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.670\ntaking a look in gaining more knowledge\nfrom it and taking advantage at.\n\n144\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.990\nAnd so, in at least this episode at\nmaybe the next couple of episodes,\n\n145\n00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.010\nwe'll gonna be taking a look at that\naspect of some of the things that\n\n146\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.170\nwe can do to help us out, okay.\n\n147\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.830\nSo, the way that we do\nthat of course is by well,\n\n148\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.070\none learning about malware itself, right?\n\n149\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.262\nSo the great thing is, if you watch\nthe security fundamentals show,\n\n150\n00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:24.390\nokay, for\nthe CCNA Cyber Ops certification, we did.\n\n151\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.373\nWe talked about malware pretty extensively\nto understanding what they do?\n\n152\n00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:34.280\nAnd what's the basis of these things\nis actually kind of a key aspect.\n\n153\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.761\nSo we're not gonna rehash that, okay?\n\n154\n00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:38.235\nIs what we're not going to do.\n\n155\n00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:42.731\nBut the other thing about it, of course,\nis then learning about it after\n\n156\n00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:46.206\nthe attack happens and\nunderstanding what has gone on.\n\n157\n00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:50.440\nAnd then how do we identify and\nwhat tools are available to help us out?\n\n158\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.474\nSo it's not just about\neither my eyes Daniel, or\n\n159\n00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:56.140\nyour eyes spotting the, that's this.\n\n160\n00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.240\nIs now taking what tools\nare available now,\n\n161\n00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.095\nwhich there's a rich assortment\nof tools out there today.\n\n162\n00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:04.173\nThey're incredibly available for\neverybody, depending of course,\n\n163\n00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:05.360\non how much money you have.\n\n164\n00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.350\nThat you can actually find a lot\nmore information on this, and\n\n165\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.080\nthen be able to make action and\nbe able to take a look at that.\n\n166\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.000\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat two in particular.\n\n167\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.500\nNow this goes from extremes, Daniel here.\n\n168\n00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.940\nOne of course,\nis proprietary and is high-end.\n\n169\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.030\nAnd it cost a ton of money and,\nCisco would love for you and\n\n170\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.900\nyour company to take advantage of it.\n\n171\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you're a Cisco shop,\n\n172\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.650\nthis is probably the way you're\ngonna go most likely, right?\n\n173\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well it's gonna be your\nbest bank for the bot that you have.\n\n174\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.900\nIs it expensive?\n\n175\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.270\nYou better believe it, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.820\nBut does it work?\n&gt;&gt; It does say Cisco on it.\n\n177\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does say Cisco on it\n&gt;&gt; But does it work effectively?\n\n178\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.270\nYes, it actually is working\nincredibly effectively, but\n\n179\n00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.239\nat the same time you\ncan take advantage of.\n\n180\n00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:58.845\nAnother type of system that we may also\nconsider along with that type of system,\n\n181\n00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:00.770\nwe're gonna talk about the AMP,\n\n182\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.180\nFirePOWER here is what we're\ngoing to take a look at.\n\n183\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.020\n&gt;&gt; Specifically,\nThreat Grid in particular and\n\n184\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.121\nthen we'll gonna talk about Sandboxing,\nokay.\n\n185\n00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:14.340\nAnd even though we might have heard\nthe term before, we're gonna actually,\n\n186\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.960\nat least make sure that you\nunderstand what Sandboxing really is.\n\n187\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.470\nAnd then,\nwhat's a utility that you can set up and\n\n188\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.940\nthe nice thing about this one Daniel,\nthough.\n\n189\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.760\nIs that, it's open source and\nthat means, for us it's free, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.110\nAnd the incredible problem with a lot of\nthe issues that we're dealing with, right.\n\n191\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.060\nIs every company comes out, and you know\nthey have different utilities that say,\n\n192\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.580\nwe can stop this,\nwe can do this, we can do that.\n\n193\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.260\nBut they don't communicate\nwith each other.\n\n194\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.160\nSo, until you actually have\na system that can take all that and\n\n195\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.470\npull it all together, okay?\n\n196\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.730\nThat is, you know, and\n\n197\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.500\nthen give you a nice report that\ntells you all of that stuff.\n\n198\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.350\nThat's why it actually\nis fairly expensive.\n\n199\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.340\nYou don't have a lot of systems lying out.\n\n200\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.820\nBut, what we're about to take a look at,\n\n201\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.470\nis something that we call the Cisco AMP,\nright, the Advanced Malware Protection.\n\n202\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.510\nAnd in that,\nthey bought a company called Threat Grid.\n\n203\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.580\nSo it's now, of course called\nAMP Threat Grid, is what it's called, or\n\n204\n00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.010\nactually is part of\nthe Advanced Firewall Protection\n\n205\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.030\ngroup of tools that you can license and\ndo all that stuff with.\n\n206\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.180\nAnd the reason why this is important is,\nThreat Grid does a couple of different\n\n207\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.840\nthings for us and why should be able\nto see this when I actually get to it.\n\n208\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.111\nBut I say, why don't you just show me?\n\n209\n00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:29.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me kinda explain this a little but,\n\n210\n00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:33.125\ncuz it actually does help you to\nunderstand this, right, is the big promise\n\n211\n00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:36.981\nbehind Threat Grid is that, it bases\nitself on what's called the RESTful API.\n\n212\n00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:39.820\nSo anything that does\nRESTful API could say.\n\n213\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.620\n&gt;&gt; I can talk to it and\nI can gain analysis information from it.\n\n214\n00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.330\nSo, if you have something on your\nnetwork that is another security\n\n215\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.440\nmonitoring tool that can do that.\n\n216\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.180\nUsually, it can talk to it and\nit can gain much more information.\n\n217\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.860\nThe ultimate idea of course,\n\n218\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.970\nis to generate a report that\nis meaningful to you and me.\n\n219\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.660\nWhether we're tier one,\nwe need the information at tier one.\n\n220\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.100\nOr whether we're tier three,\nwe need the information there,\n\n221\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.770\nthat shows us what might\nneed to be done next.\n\n222\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.070\nSo that's what we're going to\ntake a look at here, all right.\n\n223\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.490\nSo let's take a look at my system for\na moment and\n\n224\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.470\nI'll talk about what\nI've actually done here.\n\n225\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.960\nAll right, Daniel, on my system there's\na lab that I've actually set up\n\n226\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.960\nthrough here on this cloud\nservice that I'm hooked into.\n\n227\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.758\nWhere I've compromised the machine, okay.\n\n228\n00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:31.887\nI've actually got a compromise going on,\nand now I'm connected into my\n\n229\n00:11:31.887 --> 00:11:38.390\nCisco Firepower Management Center, to try\nand actually identify this information,\n\n230\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.430\nand I wanna take a look at some of the\nreports that are actually generated here.\n\n231\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.080\nTo help us out, okay.\n\n232\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.820\nSo the great thing is,\n\n233\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.970\nit's taking advantage of all the other\ncomponents that it's hooked into, and\n\n234\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.070\nthere's different ones, right, cuz it\nactually is hooked into a CISCO Firewall.\n\n235\n00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.340\nIt's hooked into so many other things that\nare actually out there, but this is kinda,\n\n236\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.900\nthe management center of it all, okay,\n\n237\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.220\nwhen it comes down to what\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n238\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.980\nAnd when we started to look at this\nidea of detection and analysis and\n\n239\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.140\nreading the reports here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n240\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.470\njust make sure that we're familiar\nwith it just a little bit.\n\n241\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.060\nNow, most of y'all are preparing for\nthe exam, Ronnie,\n\n242\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.080\nI don't have that much\nmoney to get into that.\n\n243\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.040\nYou don't have to, right?\n\n244\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.770\nThere's sometimes, where you can look at\nit, but we wanted to show you because we\n\n245\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.110\nhave the opportunity to show you what\nit looks like, so that you can see it.\n\n246\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.160\nYou don't have to kind of go,\nI need to know every single thing here.\n\n247\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.630\nBut you do need to at least understand\nwhat you'll be able to see, okay?\n\n248\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.780\nAnd why people choose tools like this.\n\n249\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.725\nNow there's a free solution\nout here that you can do.\n\n250\n00:12:41.725 --> 00:12:42.380\n[LAUGH] Daniel and\n\n251\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.890\nI have tried a couple of free solutions\nbefore on the Linux side of things.\n\n252\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.570\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes that-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n253\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.405\nyou just want to gauge\nyourself in the eyeball.\n\n254\n00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:49.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes it\n\n255\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.970\nworks out to your benefit.\n\n256\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.830\nThere are those times when you're like,\nthis is hard.\n\n257\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.478\n[LAUGH] No wonder it's free.\n\n258\n00:12:54.478 --> 00:12:58.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so you know, trying to\nfigure out what, otherwise, they said,\n\n259\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.977\nit should work just fine and\nthen you're trying to connect it\n\n260\n00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:03.600\ntogether and\n&gt;&gt; It is funny, is a lot of times when you\n\n261\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.210\nare working with a pay product versus\nan open source or free type product are.\n\n262\n00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.020\nYou tend to, in many ways,\nnot all the time, but in many ways or\n\n263\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.180\nmany times, you're paying for\nconvenience than you are features.\n\n264\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.420\nBecause they typically have\nthe same set of features, but\n\n265\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.050\nthe convenience of using said features\ncan be a whole lot easier for\n\n266\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.380\nthe pay version than a lot of\ntimes with the non-pay versions.\n\n267\n00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's got a nicer system to it.\n\n268\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.720\nThey've kind of figured out\nall the kinks and bugs and so\n\n269\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.595\nyou're going to pay for that.\n\n270\n00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:34.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's got a nice coat of paint on it,\n\n271\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.870\nreally nice coat of paint.\n\n272\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.450\nIt's pretty.\n\n273\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.620\n&gt;&gt; It really does help us out here.\n\n274\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.980\nSo, let's take a look at how we\nnavigate around in this, to get us\n\n275\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.510\nto that reporting section that we really\nwant to get to and take a look here.\n\n276\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.270\nSo right at the beginning, what I want\nto do is I want to find out about, well.\n\n277\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.680\nIntrusions, and some of\nthe different things that we can do.\n\n278\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.190\nWell, the great thing is, if you take\na look right across the center here.\n\n279\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.740\nYou can see that there's a few different\ntabs that I'm pointing to right here.\n\n280\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.830\nNetwork, Threats, Intrusion Events,\nStatus, Geolocation, QoS.\n\n281\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.330\nSo this thing can actually connect and\n\n282\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.650\ndo tons of different things\nthat we want to be able to do.\n\n283\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.560\nBut we wanna take a look at a little\nbit more in depth than that.\n\n284\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.960\nSo notice at the top you also have\nanother list of menu items up here too.\n\n285\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.430\nAnd they change according\nto what you want.\n\n286\n00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.460\nSo there's Analysis,\nthere's Policies, Devices, Objects.\n\n287\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.380\nI'm gonna select Analysis and then, let's\n\n288\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.042\njust take a look at essentially another\nsummary that we call the Context Explorer.\n\n289\n00:14:30.042 --> 00:14:32.820\nSo I'm going to click on\nthe Context Explorer,\n\n290\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.150\nthe reason why I want this particular\nview is kind of the very first overall\n\n291\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.110\ngeneral report, that might be useful to\nsomeone like at the tier one level, okay?\n\n292\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.820\nNow, you might go,\n\n293\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.520\nwell, why is something like this\nfairly useful at the tier one level?\n\n294\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.910\nBecause, first and foremost,\nyou have something like this going on,\n\n295\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.960\nwhere you can see that here, it's\ntraffic intrusion and events over time.\n\n296\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.410\nNotice that as it points out,\na particular point in time here,\n\n297\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.120\nwe just start to say, wait a minute here.\n\n298\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.190\nThat's a lot more traffic\nthan I was expecting on\n\n299\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.300\npossible intrusion events\nthat we're having.\n\n300\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.310\nAnd it looks like it occurred,\nif I hover over it.\n\n301\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.610\nLet me see if I can hover over it again,\noop.\n\n302\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.930\n&gt;&gt; It's impossible.\n\n303\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.500\n&gt;&gt; It does seem likely.\n\n304\n00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:22.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On October 21st of- that's\n\n305\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.760\nactually today.\n\n306\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.488\n&gt;&gt; August 21st.\n\n307\n00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:28.498\n&gt;&gt; October runs fast [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm really on the future here.\n\n308\n00:15:28.498 --> 00:15:32.488\nSo, this one is at 3:15, and\nit's not exactly 3:15 here,\n\n309\n00:15:32.488 --> 00:15:37.249\nbut you can see where there's been quite\na bit of traffic that now, the firepower\n\n310\n00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:42.960\nmanagement center saying it's, what is\nan intrusion that we believe is happening.\n\n311\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:49.210\nThe other thing on this summary\nis right here if I can get it up.\n\n312\n00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.051\nLet me go ahead and\nfull screen that just for a moment,\n\n313\n00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:54.275\nI don't know if that's actually going.\n\n314\n00:15:54.275 --> 00:16:00.942\nLet me, there's something with this,\nthere it goes.\n\n315\n00:16:00.942 --> 00:16:04.340\nJust have to be patient,\nbecause I am going across the-\n\n316\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.894\n&gt;&gt; Not Ronnie's strong suit.\n\n317\n00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nindications of compromise here, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.580\nRight here, you can see where\na threat has been detected.\n\n319\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.760\nThere's the security intelligence, and\nhere's some terminology that you should\n\n320\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.840\nhave, if you haven't seen\nthe Security Fundamentals,\n\n321\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.410\nmake sure you take a look at it here.\n\n322\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.340\nCNC, now Daniel,\nthat's an abbreviation term,\n\n323\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.310\ndo you know what that one stands for?\n\n324\n00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.765\n&gt;&gt; Something to do with milling out metal,\nisn't it?\n\n325\n00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:28.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty close, yeah, yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.870\nThis is command and control, right?\n\n327\n00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.860\nCommand and control.\n\n328\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.550\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people call it C2?\n\n329\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, C2C, yeah, C2, or yeah.\n\n330\n00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:40.310\nSo notice this, it's red, so\nthat can't be anything good, and\n\n331\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.160\nthen the impact over here as well.\n\n332\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.390\nSo it's a great little summary,\n\n333\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.090\nand when you see something like\nthis on your network, CNC?\n\n334\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.790\n&gt;&gt; That's no bueno.\n\n335\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.448\n&gt;&gt; That's no bueno.\n\n336\n00:16:48.448 --> 00:16:50.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not good.\n\n337\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now,\n\n338\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.690\nlet's get a little bit more specific.\n\n339\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.040\nNow, Daniel, why would this,\nI know I'm being obvious, but\n\n340\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.595\nwhy would that actually help us out?\n\n341\n00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:01.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Indications my host,\n\n342\n00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.460\nI'm assuming it's something\nlike who has the problem.\n\n343\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.430\n&gt;&gt; Who has the problem and issue.\n\n344\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.845\nSo Daniel, I hate to say this, but if I\nhad 500 computers I was troubleshooting,\n\n345\n00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:18.420\nit'd be nice right away to go,\nlet me see, Joe just called in.\n\n346\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.731\nI wonder if this is his computer,\nlet me check out his IP address.\n\n347\n00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:27.175\nIf that's his IP address, we're not done\nyet, this is why this is so good, right?\n\n348\n00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.618\n&gt;&gt; Well you're really just\nhammering away at what is so\n\n349\n00:17:29.618 --> 00:17:31.400\nimportant about reporting, right?\n\n350\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.831\nThis is something you're gonna\ndo as a security professional\n\n351\n00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.080\nin an enterprise environment.\n\n352\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.135\nYou're gonna need these types of\ntools to what Ronnie been alluding,\n\n353\n00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:46.190\nto quickly see who has issues, where do I,\ntriage basically at a really quick glance.\n\n354\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.970\nBecause you wanna get those things\ntaken care of, get them mitigated,\n\n355\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.560\nget back into just regular production.\n\n356\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.273\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes Daniel,\nthat's absolutely correct,\n\n357\n00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:56.650\nthe idea of triaging from\na reports really does help us out.\n\n358\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.200\nThis helps at least pinpoint where\nwe want to go, remember I said,\n\n359\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.110\nwe're not done yet.\n\n360\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.920\nThe very fact is, now that this\nreport kind of shows us where to go,\n\n361\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.950\nlet's take a look at my screen again,\nand that will help us out here too.\n\n362\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.613\nSo once I select this,\nI can just click on that box there, and\n\n363\n00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:16.100\nthen I can view the actual\nhost information.\n\n364\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.541\nAnd in a moment, it takes a little bit of\ntime to generate, because it's pulling so\n\n365\n00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:23.820\nmuch data and so\nmuch information, and here we go.\n\n366\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.661\nSo it's right here that I\nwant to take a look and\n\n367\n00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:32.695\nsee just some of the information and\nI'm gonna scroll down.\n\n368\n00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:37.890\nAll right, so Daniel,\nhow important indications of compromise?\n\n369\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are pretty good.\n\n370\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.910\nThat's a real problem, especially when\nyou see that CNC connected kind of thing.\n\n371\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.480\nThat's not good, that means\nsomebody outside of your control\n\n372\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.750\nis in control of one of your assets.\n\n373\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.873\nYou've gotta take care of\nthat as soon as possible.\n\n374\n00:18:51.873 --> 00:18:52.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great thing, right?\n\n375\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.202\nFirst seen, last seen, description,\nthe category that we have.\n\n376\n00:18:57.202 --> 00:19:01.320\nBut notice right here,\nthreat detected in file transfer.\n\n377\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.480\nIt even detected the malware\nthat came across.\n\n378\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:11.168\nAnd what about this one, Daniel, attempted\nadmin, what do you think's happening here?\n\n379\n00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Probably either attempting to do\nsomething that requires administrator\n\n380\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.560\nprivileges, or they are attempting\nto escalate their privileges.\n\n381\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and on this one,\n\n382\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.250\nI actually successfully escalated\nthe privileges here, okay?\n\n383\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.634\nSo I was able to run a particular script.\n\n384\n00:19:25.634 --> 00:19:26.220\n&gt;&gt; You dirty dog you.\n\n385\n00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:26.735\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n386\n00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:28.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually I escalated privileges.\n\n387\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.550\nGetting around the UAC, just when we\nthought, UAC really does protect us.\n\n388\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.310\nThere are scripts out there that will\nactually say, let's go ahead and\n\n389\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.270\nbypass the UAC.\n\n390\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.390\nAnd it is scary when you start\nto think about stuff like this.\n\n391\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:48.090\nBut here it is, we do have where it's\na fairly decent report that we're seeing.\n\n392\n00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.830\nAnd if I scroll down\njust a little bit more,\n\n393\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.120\nnow I can actually see a couple of\nother things happening as well.\n\n394\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.250\nNotice, Daniel, I have two different\nservers rolling here, too.\n\n395\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.423\nSo remember that for us, right,\nif we're new to this concept of servers,\n\n396\n00:20:04.423 --> 00:20:08.751\nat the beginning of, I always think of\nhardware and machines, two servers.\n\n397\n00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:12.997\nThat's not what we're talking about here,\nthis is actually software servers that\n\n398\n00:20:12.997 --> 00:20:15.930\nare running some type of attack,\nand they are active.\n\n399\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.195\nHow do I know that this is one of them?\n\n400\n00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:19.610\nIt's that indication right here, okay?\n\n401\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.300\nSo notice that when I hover over it,\n\n402\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.490\nit says violates client traffic,\nis what it actually says.\n\n403\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.800\nSo we can see that, and\nthen we scroll down to the applications,\n\n404\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.270\nlook at all this, Daniel, down here, okay?\n\n405\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.690\nI may not know what it's about right now,\nbut notice that as I hover over those,\n\n406\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.890\nit's an indication that malware has\nreally gotten to this computer, okay?\n\n407\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.820\n&gt;&gt; Now what's interesting to me\nis you have HTTPS and SSH there.\n\n408\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.640\nHow does it know whether that's\nviolating any kind of a policy,\n\n409\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.940\nbecause it's encrypted traffic?\n\n410\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's because now,\n\n411\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.990\nyou do have certain systems that\nare reporting, this is not regular, right?\n\n412\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.590\nIt's doing the hashing that it's doing,\nand saying hey,\n\n413\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.850\nthere's some information here that I can't\ntell you it's sent from the other side.\n\n414\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.410\nIt does say it's encrypted, but\nI don't know where it's actually going to.\n\n415\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.930\nSo it lets you know that there\nis something else happening, and\n\n416\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.460\nthe great thing is now it's\nactually starting to point me.\n\n417\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.890\nLook at that, Office Mobile, okay?\n\n418\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.510\nAnd then that secure FTP,\nyou're starting to see, and web browsing.\n\n419\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.692\nThere's a lot of things starting to\nhappen here on just that one machine.\n\n420\n00:21:23.692 --> 00:21:26.588\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's your problem,\nInternet Explorer, is that version 6.1?\n\n421\n00:21:26.588 --> 00:21:28.236\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes.\n&gt;&gt; And 8.0.\n\n422\n00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:29.943\n&gt;&gt; There has to be some-\n&gt;&gt; That will be an issue.\n\n423\n00:21:29.943 --> 00:21:32.271\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There has to be some compromise on\n\n424\n00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:33.004\nthe system.\n\n425\n00:21:35.933 --> 00:21:40.402\nIn security, right, in everything we\ndo in labs, right, it's like, it'd be\n\n426\n00:21:40.402 --> 00:21:45.060\nawesome if I could say, I can violate\nthe latest browser and do all that.\n\n427\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.343\nBut Daniel, if you and I can do that, we'd\nbe making a lot more money [LAUGH] right\n\n428\n00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:50.010\nnow by going to those different events.\n\n429\n00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:50.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, yeah.\n\n430\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.230\n&gt;&gt; And submitting those hacks.\n\n431\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.248\nBut we wouldn't take advantage of that,\nright?\n\n432\n00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:56.748\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never, never.\n\n433\n00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.940\n&gt;&gt; So right here in just\nthat that little summary,\n\n434\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.950\nso right up here at the kind of the\nopening, that's what I like to call it.\n\n435\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:11.880\nAt the very beginning of just getting\ninto a Cisco Firepower Management Center,\n\n436\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.400\nyou can see some of the different things.\n\n437\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.920\nHere, of course, is network information,\nand then as we scroll on through there,\n\n438\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.731\nyou can continue to see\nthat there's other one.\n\n439\n00:22:19.731 --> 00:22:23.030\nI wanna scroll down here\na little bit further, and\n\n440\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.460\nthere's even protocol information\ndown here that we can see.\n\n441\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.320\nAnd you can see the risks\nthat are over here, too.\n\n442\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.880\nClient and web applications that are\navailable out there, and what's at risk.\n\n443\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.996\nYou can even see some of the details,\n\n444\n00:22:36.996 --> 00:22:41.296\nand this is not something that I wanna\nkind of hide away at the last here, but\n\n445\n00:22:41.296 --> 00:22:44.680\nthis is where they put it,\njust about in the middle.\n\n446\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.920\nSecurity intelligence, okay, by category,\nby source IP, by destination.\n\n447\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.240\nYou can actually spot,\nthere's that CNC again.\n\n448\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.220\nAnd the number of connections, and some of\nthe different things that are happening.\n\n449\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.650\nHere are those two hosts that\nwe're actually seeing that\n\n450\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.800\nwere running the information.\n\n451\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.060\nAnd then there are some other things\nthat I've not connected to, so\n\n452\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.480\nthere's no real data for it right now.\n\n453\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.335\nBut that's just kind of a sampling, right?\n\n454\n00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:16.975\nSo you can see why this might be at\nleast interesting information someone at\n\n455\n00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:18.240\ntier one.\n\n456\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.610\nHere it is, and\neven if they don’t know what to do next,\n\n457\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.020\nthey can pass that\ninformation up the chain.\n\n458\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.310\nAnd go, here's what I found, here's\nwhat the report, at least at the very\n\n459\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.980\nbeginning, is generating for us to be\nable to take a look at and do, okay?\n\n460\n00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.250\nSo there is a lot of\navailable information for us.\n\n461\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.660\nWe can find out the operating\nsystem that was attacked.\n\n462\n00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.190\nWe can find out the IP address,\nwe can find out the MAC address.\n\n463\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.230\nWe can find out a whole bunch of\ninformation that we really need.\n\n464\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.444\nSource ports, even the application\nthat might have actually attacked it.\n\n465\n00:23:47.444 --> 00:23:52.159\nYou name it, there is a tremendous\namount of information that we're\n\n466\n00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:54.772\ntaking a look at as we start to do this.\n\n467\n00:23:54.772 --> 00:23:58.527\nNow, the others, of course,\nas we go on, let's go ahead and\n\n468\n00:23:58.527 --> 00:24:02.933\ntake a look one more time at a couple\nof other things here, too, is that,\n\n469\n00:24:02.933 --> 00:24:04.988\nas we scroll on through, right?\n\n470\n00:24:04.988 --> 00:24:09.022\nSo even though this is kind of\nthe summary overview of things,\n\n471\n00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:14.451\nif I want to start taking a look at, well,\nlet's say right here on the intrusions or\n\n472\n00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:18.739\nthe host events that we have,\nthis is where we dig deeper into it.\n\n473\n00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:21.550\nWe drill down and\nwe can start seeing nothing.\n\n474\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.380\nSo let's take, for an example, Events.\n\n475\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.310\nSo if I go and select Events, and\n\n476\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.040\nit's because I'm connecting to\nthe cloud service here, and\n\n477\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.310\nunless it disconnects me, okay, then I\ncan start to see some of the things.\n\n478\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.187\nSo intrusion events,\nthat's what we're taking a look in.\n\n479\n00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:43.456\nLet me kind of zoom in so\nthat we can take a look,\n\n480\n00:24:43.456 --> 00:24:47.615\noperating system other\ndash cgi environment\n\n481\n00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:52.441\nvariable injection attempt\nis what we're seeing.\n\n482\n00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:56.990\nAnd not only that though,\nnotice it says high and there it is.\n\n483\n00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.300\nYou can see Daniel what I tried to do.\n\n484\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.975\nIt says,\nAttempted Administrator Privilege Gain.\n\n485\n00:25:01.975 --> 00:25:03.705\nAnd I will tell you, I not only attempted-\n\n486\n00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:04.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.010\n&gt;&gt; I got it,\n\n488\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.220\nI was able to get access in\nto being able to do this.\n\n489\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.150\nOops, well, I just lost connection\nwith my trackpad there.\n\n490\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.600\nFor one reason or another.\n\n491\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.960\nSo we can at least see the events\nof some of this information.\n\n492\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.440\nIf I select the high,\nright-click, excuse me.\n\n493\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.594\nSelect high, I can even go in and\nfind some other information.\n\n494\n00:25:25.594 --> 00:25:26.960\nLet me see if I can, there it goes.\n\n495\n00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.780\nIt's just me not being patient,\nthat's what I have to do.\n\n496\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.070\nFrom this point on,\nyou can now see where there's a priority,\n\n497\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.560\nthe impact level that it has,\nbut notice the end line result.\n\n498\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.830\nThis actually indicates to me that\nit says I was not successful and\n\n499\n00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.890\nI'm trying to remember\nwhy I wasn't successful.\n\n500\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:51.600\nI think the first time I had a typo\non the IP address or something, and\n\n501\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.600\nit didn't see that.\n\n502\n00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.420\nBut it didn't see cuz I was able to\nactually run what I wanted to here.\n\n503\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.910\nSo, I know I was actually successful but\n\n504\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.590\nhere it says at least that this result,\nit did dropped it.\n\n505\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:08.050\nAnd there's a source IP address and\nthe destination IP address again.\n\n506\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:13.133\nSource port destination ports too and\neven what Daniel, let me see\n\n507\n00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:18.513\nif I can full screen that little bit\nmore I can't get over to the right.\n\n508\n00:26:18.513 --> 00:26:19.937\nThere you go.\n\n509\n00:26:19.937 --> 00:26:23.555\nI wanted to show Daniel, there is\na lot of information back over here.\n\n510\n00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:28.922\nNotice the ssl status,\nUnknown is actually still there.\n\n511\n00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:32.631\nIt says I can't even detect stuff\nlike that and you can see where,\n\n512\n00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:36.760\nlook at that, there is just so\nmuch information that it's generating.\n\n513\n00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.450\nAnd all of this is not from one device,\nright?\n\n514\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:44.150\nIt absolutely is pulling it in from\nmultiple devices that are going on.\n\n515\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.690\nAnd we can even see that there\nwas a network-analysis policy\n\n516\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.990\nthat it also ran across as well.\n\n517\n00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:56.560\nSo there is a lot of information that we\ncan generate from something like this too.\n\n518\n00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.270\nIf I wanna take a look at the files\nas well, we can do that too.\n\n519\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.445\nNow when we start to take\na look at something like this,\n\n520\n00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:06.524\nlet me select file Events, first.\n\n521\n00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:09.400\nI wanna make sure that we can see this.\n\n522\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.788\nWell, maybe, I may be impatient.\n\n523\n00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:13.336\nThat's me, yep, there it goes.\n\n524\n00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:14.085\nSee I tell you,\n\n525\n00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:17.735\nwhen I am impatient I just wanna click\neverywhere as what I would want to do.\n\n526\n00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:18.908\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie is not a doctor.\n\n527\n00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:20.048\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He has no patience.\n\n528\n00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:22.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's right here.\n\n529\n00:27:22.905 --> 00:27:24.595\n&gt;&gt; Yes right there, right in the side.\n\n530\n00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:25.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n531\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.980\nSo you can see right here on the summary\nof the information that we have available\n\n532\n00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.590\nthat here's what it saw.\n\n533\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:39.910\nWe saw some executables, well that makes\nsense, when you see that MS.exe here.\n\n534\n00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.900\nNow we're cloud lookup.\n\n535\n00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.980\nOkay, that makes sense, just going out,\nit's comparing malware, and\n\n536\n00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.200\nhey we found something.\n\n537\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.500\nOffice documents,\n\n538\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.790\nbut notice what it talks about right\nhere Daniel, is the idea of disposition.\n\n539\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.537\nAnd then, you'll also have the type MSOLE.\n\n540\n00:27:56.537 --> 00:27:57.777\nObject, what is that?\n\n541\n00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:03.920\nLinking and embedding to here,\nand the action on it was block.\n\n542\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.545\nYeah, block this thing that was on.\n\n543\n00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:07.190\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a good action for that.\n\n544\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.760\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n545\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.920\nIt's a great action that we want to take.\n\n546\n00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.610\nBut Daniel, we actually need to take\na look at that a little bit more in depth.\n\n547\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.586\nI am noticing something here is\nthat I'm running out of time.\n\n548\n00:28:18.586 --> 00:28:20.263\n&gt;&gt; The clock dwindles.\n\n549\n00:28:20.263 --> 00:28:21.607\n&gt;&gt; It is dwindling, and\n\n550\n00:28:21.607 --> 00:28:26.000\nI can't do everything in the last\ncouple of minutes that I have.\n\n551\n00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.655\nSo Daniel, this is probably a great place\nfor us to pick up in the next episode.\n\n552\n00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:30.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n553\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.457\nLike the sands in the hourglass,\nthese are the malware of our times.\n\n554\n00:28:34.457 --> 00:28:34.985\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n555\n00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:36.525\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Ronny, thanks for\n\n556\n00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:37.275\ngetting us this far.\n\n557\n00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:39.575\nWe look forward to part two to see\nwhat else you have in store for\n\n558\n00:28:39.575 --> 00:28:43.870\nus when it comes to Jumping into\nour suckups here for old Cisco.\n\n559\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.980\nLooking forward to that.\n\n560\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.440\nLooking forward to seeing you guys,\nas well.\n\n561\n00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.840\nWe're so glad you joined us.\n\n562\n00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.790\nDefinitely come on back for that part two.\n\n563\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.970\nAs for this one, as Ronnie said,\nwe are out of time.\n\n564\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.770\nSo we're signing off for ITProTV.\n\n565\n00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.570\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n566\n00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.453\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n567\n00:28:56.453 -->

[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem like it's going to be\n\n23\n00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:56.102\nExpendables 5 or 6 or\nwhatever one that they're doing.\n\n24\n00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:57.613\nBut there is a lot of information here.\n\n25\n00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:02.200\nWe've already seen at least in part one\nthat there is some cool things that we can\n\n26\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.880\nfind out.\n\n27\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.487\nWhether you're a tier one, analyst working\nat a security operations center or\n\n28\n00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:09.423\nyou where going up to tier three.\n\n29\n00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:13.328\nOr showing you some of the features\nthat you're normally end up,\n\n30\n00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:18.085\nfind out the unique tool that were using\nat this point forces Cisco's feature to\n\n31\n00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:21.577\nwin since you're preparing for\nthe Cisco cyber ops exam.\n\n32\n00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:25.721\nYou should have some familiarity\nwith at least what it does.\n\n33\n00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.991\nNow, I said this is in the last\nepisode and let me say it again.\n\n34\n00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.332\nYou go man,\nwe'll never get access to this.\n\n35\n00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:33.802\nHow am I supposed to prepare for\nthis for the exam?\n\n36\n00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.741\nDon't worry about it,\nwe'll show you kinda best way to prepare.\n\n37\n00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:40.556\nI just wanted to show you since\nwe have this opportunity,\n\n38\n00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:44.860\nand this chance to really do a live\nshow you on what we're doing.\n\n39\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.194\nThat we had that opportunity,\n\n40\n00:01:46.194 --> 00:01:49.370\njust wanna make that we got\nthat in front of you, as well.\n\n41\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.688\nSo where we picked up from last time,\n\n42\n00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:52.821\nwe're gonna right in the middle\nof looking at a few things.\n\n43\n00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:57.081\nAnd then of course, me running and\njabbering, [LAUGH] like I normally do,\n\n44\n00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:58.055\nran out of time.\n\n45\n00:01:58.055 --> 00:01:59.978\nSo we're picking up where we left off.\n\n46\n00:01:59.978 --> 00:02:02.543\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n47\n00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:04.992\nput everything back into perspective here.\n\n48\n00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:08.320\nSo right before the first\nepisode in this series,\n\n49\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.101\nI went ahead and I compromised a machine.\n\n50\n00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.903\nAnd I told you that, that here it is,\nhere's the compromise.\n\n51\n00:02:13.903 --> 00:02:18.578\nThis is actually a Cisco Firepower\nManagement Center that hooks everything\n\n52\n00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:22.447\ntogether and allows it to take\nall those security devices, and\n\n53\n00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:24.943\nthe different tools that are out there.\n\n54\n00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:28.138\nAnd brings it all together for\nus to be able to manage,\n\n55\n00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.552\nas well as seeing some of the reporting.\n\n56\n00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:36.322\nSo we went through some of the summary\ntypes of reports that we see.\n\n57\n00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:40.612\nBut here, I selected Files,\nand now File Events.\n\n58\n00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:45.996\nAnd the reason why I wanna do that\nis we saw where we looked at where\n\n59\n00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:52.394\nwe found that there were files that\nwere infected, and it came across here.\n\n60\n00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:55.400\nSo I went down to the ideal files and\nwent to file events.\n\n61\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.967\nAnd now I can see a couple\nof different categories and\n\n62\n00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.902\nthat's pretty much where we left off.\n\n63\n00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:02.341\nSo from here you see Executables, normal.\n\n64\n00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:05.413\nYou can see where the action was\ntaken was a malware cloud lookup.\n\n65\n00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:09.247\nAnd then under office\ndocuments it's disposition,\n\n66\n00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:13.431\nthe system has already marked\nit as being Malware, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:17.492\nAnd this is just a category,\nit's not even the details of what we have,\n\n68\n00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:21.829\nit's just saying right now I'm actually\nseeing this entire category, and\n\n69\n00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.980\nit went ahead and blocked it.\n\n70\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.890\nNow just when we can actually\ndrill down some more information\n\n71\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.870\nthere's actually a lot of other\ninformation that we can see from here.\n\n72\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.372\nAll I have to do is click on Office\nDocuments over on the left hand side here.\n\n73\n00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:40.232\nMake sure I'm not being impatient,\nand there it is.\n\n74\n00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:41.962\nOkay, see it's spinning.\n\n75\n00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:45.842\nSo Ronnie just has to breathe and\ntake its time.\n\n76\n00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:50.600\nRemember this, if you end up working in an\nenvironment in whichitt is you're relying\n\n77\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.392\non Cloud appliances and stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:53.868\nDon't be like Ronnie.\n\n79\n00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:55.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just get frustrated and\n\n80\n00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:56.711\njust keep clicking.\n\n81\n00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.741\nYou've got to give it\na little bit of time.\n\n82\n00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.543\nYou're connecting up to wherever\nthat Cloud infrastructure is.\n\n83\n00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:07.092\nAnd for me I just get impatient,\ncuz I'm used to working on local systems.\n\n84\n00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:09.603\nI'm not so\nused to Cloud environment a lot of times.\n\n85\n00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.834\nBut I'm getting more used to it but\nI just have to know,\n\n86\n00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.242\nRonnie, slow down, it will get there.\n\n87\n00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:17.962\nIt will return that information\nback to you when it's ready.\n\n88\n00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:19.038\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not when I'm ready.\n\n89\n00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:21.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz you're on it's clock\nnot the way around, that's not.\n\n90\n00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:26.342\n&gt;&gt; And that's we all to actually kind of\nthink about that and take a look, right.\n\n91\n00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:31.740\nThe reason why I want to emphasize that\nbecause you'll be expecting a report\n\n92\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.646\ninstantaneously when it just takes\na little bit of time to generate.\n\n93\n00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:39.540\nThe more security devices,\nit's gotta pull that information.\n\n94\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.652\nIt's gotta kind of do a little\nbit of analysis behind it, and\n\n95\n00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:45.962\nthen report it into a readable\nformat that you and I understand.\n\n96\n00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:51.313\nSo it's not that it's being lazy, [LAUGH]\nI know that, that is what we think it is.\n\n97\n00:04:51.313 --> 00:04:56.151\nIt takes a lot, there's a lot of pieces\nof information that's actually getting\n\n98\n00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:58.082\npulled into one location here.\n\n99\n00:04:58.082 --> 00:05:00.601\nSo I'll just be a little bit\nmore patient and understand it.\n\n100\n00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.383\nAll right, so,\nnow that I have said all that and\n\n101\n00:05:03.383 --> 00:05:07.712\nwe now got the information notice that\nI'm showing at least three files.\n\n102\n00:05:07.712 --> 00:05:11.610\nThis one shows you a ton more information.\n\n103\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.098\nNotice Daniel that I actually even\nspot the sending IP address now,\n\n104\n00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:22.214\nas well as the country of origin\nthat showing up as well, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:22.214 --> 00:05:28.742\nI can also see the fourth numbers, and\nreceiving ports that's coming in on.\n\n106\n00:05:28.742 --> 00:05:32.435\nSource or descending ports and\nreceiving ports, and\n\n107\n00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:34.742\nI continue to scroll on through.\n\n108\n00:05:34.742 --> 00:05:38.873\nWhat I'm really looking for\nis, what files did it detect?\n\n109\n00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:39.765\nNotice right here,\n\n110\n00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:43.394\nyou can see where here's a couple of the\ndifferent files that were there, right.\n\n111\n00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:48.312\nHere's one called a catjob3,\nand Job-Obscene-Salary.\n\n112\n00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:49.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n\n113\n00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:53.931\nSo someone's trying to download\nsomebody's HR information,\n\n114\n00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:54.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.842\n&gt;&gt; That's there.\n\n116\n00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:59.892\nAnd look at this,\nhere we have the hashes of those files.\n\n117\n00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:03.254\nAnd Daniel,\nI can see by these two hashes right here,\n\n118\n00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:08.790\nright next to this it looks like someone\ntried to download this a couple of times.\n\n119\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.310\nAnd the reason might be that, because\neverything was already working, and\n\n120\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.670\nthey might have been denied\naccess to that file, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.117\nBut the first time it actually did run,\nhow do I know?\n\n122\n00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:20.653\nCuz I successfully ran it.\n\n123\n00:06:20.653 --> 00:06:21.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n124\n00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:26.032\n&gt;&gt; I did, but the other two times I wanted\nto verify that the Cisco firepower was\n\n125\n00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:27.563\nactually catching it.\n\n126\n00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:31.555\nAnd it really did catch the other two\ntimes, and knows there's a threat score\n\n127\n00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:34.642\nwe'll come right back that\nthreat scored in just a moment.\n\n128\n00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:36.672\nTake a look and\nnoticed this symbol right here.\n\n129\n00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:41.129\nThis is of course the malware and\nyou can see something where it\n\n130\n00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.942\nactually says click to view hold or\nnetwork formal introductory.\n\n131\n00:06:45.942 --> 00:06:49.664\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel from your\nunderstanding of just trajectory,\n\n132\n00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:54.713\nwhat do you think that means Network\nfile trajectory when you think about it?\n\n133\n00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.907\n&gt;&gt; Network file trajectory,\nwhere it's going?\n\n134\n00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:57.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n135\n00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.762\nwhere this file is being transferred to?\n\n136\n00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:02.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where it actually kinda went\nfrom where it is actually going.\n\n137\n00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n138\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.070\n&gt;&gt; So\nit says that I could possibly click here.\n\n139\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.558\nIf I select that, let me zoom out and\nmake sure it's actually rolling and\n\n140\n00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:12.893\ndoing what I want to.\n\n141\n00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:18.082\nAnd now we can see network\nfile trajectory information.\n\n142\n00:07:18.082 --> 00:07:21.705\nOn this one particular file,\nI have this access,\n\n143\n00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:26.294\nand I can actually see this idea\nof its trajectory and its path.\n\n144\n00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:30.496\n&gt;&gt; So right here at the very beginning\nif I take a look at this symbol, I can\n\n145\n00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:35.432\nactually take a look and see that it looks\nlike it transferred or got blocked here.\n\n146\n00:07:35.432 --> 00:07:37.454\nLet's see,\nthis one actually got transferred.\n\n147\n00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:41.035\nSo you can see immediately here\nthat this one got transferred and\n\n148\n00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:43.232\nthen at some point here it got blocked.\n\n149\n00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:45.380\nIt stopped going at some point.\n\n150\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.002\nAnd this one over here ended up\nwhere it was blocked and malware.\n\n151\n00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.925\nThis was disposed of in that way or\ndisposition.\n\n152\n00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:56.841\nNow, I hover over each one of these\nI could see that this was some HTTP\n\n153\n00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:57.536\nprotocol.\n\n154\n00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:01.782\nI can even see the client that\nit used to transfer Firefox.\n\n155\n00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:06.023\nYou name it, it looks like it\nactually happened right through here.\n\n156\n00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:09.604\nSo, I can actually follow\nits particular path and\n\n157\n00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:12.852\nlocation and where it's actually going to.\n\n158\n00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:17.115\nThe other thing, of course,\nis its category of information, and\n\n159\n00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:20.085\nbecause this has already been rated and\nseen,\n\n160\n00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:24.210\nnotice it has a threat score\nthat is ready right here.\n\n161\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.680\nIf I select these four dots\nin front of Very High,\n\n162\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.472\nnow this is where it gets\na little bit more hefty here.\n\n163\n00:08:31.472 --> 00:08:33.490\nLet me make sure that you can see that.\n\n164\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.130\nNotice, I know it's hard because\nthere is no other way for\n\n165\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.960\nme to kind of pull this in,\nthere we go, we'll do that.\n\n166\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.232\nAll right, let's take a look.\n\n167\n00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:46.717\nIf you click on Very High here,\nit says view Very High in Analysis, right?\n\n168\n00:08:46.717 --> 00:08:47.491\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:51.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would think that view Very\nHigh is actually the very words, right?\n\n170\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.685\nThe verbage that describes\nwhat these four dots, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:59.452\nBut notice, if I hover over those\nfour dots, look at what I get though,\n\n172\n00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:02.250\nNew Dynamic Analysis Summary.\n\n173\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.145\nSo those four dots are actually\nanother category of information that I\n\n174\n00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:11.550\ncan see that's actually different from\nthis verbiage that it has attached to it.\n\n175\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Which begs the question,\nwhy do they put them together?\n\n176\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.380\n&gt;&gt; That is a very good question,\nI cannot answer that.\n\n177\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.368\n&gt;&gt; It seems like they would want you\nto think that there was some sort of\n\n178\n00:09:20.368 --> 00:09:25.000\ncorrelation between the two, since they\nare sitting side by side, and other\n\n179\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.934\ncategories are flushed out [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I agree,\n\n180\n00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.550\nI am absolutely in agreement with you.\n\n181\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.145\nBut if I select those four dots,\nnow you can see, here it is,\n\n182\n00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:41.477\nhere is the generated dynamic analysis\nsummary, which I apparently can't read.\n\n183\n00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:45.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is where you start to see\n\n184\n00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:49.851\nthese levels of threats,\nthat we can see that's going on.\n\n185\n00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:54.271\nSo here you actually do see some other\ninformation that is generating for\n\n186\n00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.380\nright now, and it's a report to.\n\n187\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.818\nThis one doesn't actually\nseem to get very high,\n\n188\n00:09:58.818 --> 00:10:02.560\nbut you start seeing other things\nthat are available right here.\n\n189\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.320\nSo from this point, of course, you can\nthen go ahead and click and continue\n\n190\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.040\nfurther on down and drill down to some of\nthe threats that you are actually seeing.\n\n191\n00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.398\nShowing this report for the highest,\n\n192\n00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:16.501\nbecause no report with\nmatching score was found.\n\n193\n00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:22.790\nSo looks like I broke the idea\nof that particular report.\n\n194\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.973\nUltimately though, where do we really want\nto get to for getting ready for the exam?\n\n195\n00:10:29.973 --> 00:10:33.193\nSo the great thing is, you don't have\nto know where to get to it, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:37.195\nI'm showing you where to get to it because\npeople will find this to be a little bit\n\n197\n00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:39.903\nincredible on the exam,\non the objectives, right?\n\n198\n00:10:39.903 --> 00:10:44.752\nThey're saying, hey,\nread an analysis from ThreatGRID, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:48.274\nWell, you can search all over,\neverything in here and try and look for\n\n200\n00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:52.860\nThreatGRID and you'll probably find\nit's not gonna be where you think it is.\n\n201\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.360\nIf I now click on this button,\n\n202\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.800\nlet me move that over so that you\ncan see it a little bit more, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.549\nIf I click on this,\nView Full Report button, I select that.\n\n204\n00:11:05.452 --> 00:11:08.100\nNow, due to the magic of television.\n\n205\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now notice the word ThreatGRID finally\n\n206\n00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.771\nappears right there.\n\n207\n00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:14.178\n&gt;&gt; Probably branded something.\n\n208\n00:11:14.178 --> 00:11:17.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's weird because this\nis an entire company that now has gotten\n\n209\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.350\nbranded as one report.\n\n210\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.870\nNo, not really.\n\n211\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.360\nThere's a ton of things that\nare going on in the background and\n\n212\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.180\nthe behavior here, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.540\nSo it's right here where you're\nstarting to get information that you're\n\n214\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.430\nreally supposed to take a look at.\n\n215\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.230\nSo I'm showing you this because this\nis something that you want to at least\n\n216\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.510\nunderstand and be familiar with in\nterms of visual representation.\n\n217\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.993\nI can't tell you what's on the exam, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:46.468\nBecause that's illegal for\nme to do, but I can say,\n\n219\n00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:51.880\ndon't, Daniel,\nexpect to see something similar.\n\n220\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.980\nI think it's okay.\n\n221\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.954\n&gt;&gt; See, we are going here?\n\n222\n00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:55.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:57.420\n&gt;&gt; I think that if you might see something\n\n224\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.661\nlike this, and they might ask you about\nsome information in this view that you're\n\n225\n00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.514\nseeing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n226\n00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:06.400\nthere's a lot of different\ninformation in this particular view.\n\n227\n00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.880\nRonnie is probably alluding to\nthe fact that you want to be aware of\n\n228\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.765\nsaid information.\n\n229\n00:12:09.765 --> 00:12:12.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least the types of information,\n\n230\n00:12:12.156 --> 00:12:13.735\nif not the specific ones.\n\n231\n00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you can see a couple\nof different things here, right?\n\n232\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.575\nThe operating, I know that's a little bit\nharder for you to actually be able to see.\n\n233\n00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:21.414\n[CROSSTALK] I can actually tell you.\n\n234\n00:12:21.414 --> 00:12:23.350\nThere you go, it's right there.\n\n235\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.110\nYou might be able to find\nthat information like that.\n\n236\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.770\nThe file name?\n\n237\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.220\nProbably not so much but you can at least\nfind out what type of file might have\n\n238\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:38.340\nactually gone ahead and gotten something\non to your system at some point in time.\n\n239\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.480\nI don't know and once again,\n\n240\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.810\nthis Analyzed part right here,\nthose are some of the things.\n\n241\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.210\nAnd then as we scroll\non down through here,\n\n242\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.880\nnotice that there are more\nbehavioral indicators\n\n243\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.930\nthat are available to us to also\nbe able to take a look and see.\n\n244\n00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:01.390\nSeverity level and confidence, these\ndo indicate a couple of things, right?\n\n245\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.067\nHow confident is ThreatGRID\nthat this is a threat?\n\n246\n00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:05.084\n&gt;&gt; Pretty confident.\n&gt;&gt; 100%.\n\n247\n00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:05.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n248\n00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:07.072\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pretty confident, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:07.072 --> 00:13:10.240\nSeverity means how much damage does it do.\n\n250\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.050\nHow much does it eat through?\n\n251\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.090\nWell, here, we start to see 95%.\n\n252\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.568\nAnd as we scroll on through, you can start\nseeing a document file embedded with\n\n253\n00:13:19.568 --> 00:13:23.250\nminimal content,\nestablished network communications.\n\n254\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.620\nThis is the type of file I\nactually was able to get\n\n255\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.180\non to this system as well, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.800\nSo this one right here is 100% severity.\n\n257\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.773\nAnd it says confidence, it says 90%.\n\n258\n00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:40.087\nAnd the reason why is because it's saying,\nthat was an Excel file you downloaded, but\n\n259\n00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:41.801\nthere was, probably a macro, and\n\n260\n00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:45.120\nthat's why it actually put\nit up right here at the top.\n\n261\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.220\nSo it has all of these behavioral\nindicators that something is pretty\n\n262\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.680\nfishy about the file that was here.\n\n263\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.854\nYou can even, of course,\nsee DNS traffic as well.\n\n264\n00:13:55.854 --> 00:14:00.589\nAnd later on we're gonna take a look at\nthis idea of TCP/IP streams a little bit\n\n265\n00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:05.492\nmore in depth, understanding some of\nthe information that we're seeing here.\n\n266\n00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:09.656\nSource port, source IP address,\ndestination port, destination IP address,\n\n267\n00:14:09.656 --> 00:14:12.310\nthe type of protocol that we're doing.\n\n268\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.741\nAnd you might see information that we\ncall like the 5-tuples or tuples or\n\n269\n00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:18.893\nhowever the heck you pronounce it.\n\n270\n00:14:18.893 --> 00:14:21.341\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH\n&gt;&gt; We'll go to that much more in detail\n\n271\n00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:25.626\nlater on but that's what you're seeing\nright here that really does indicate a lot\n\n272\n00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:28.815\nof great information for\nyou that you might not think about.\n\n273\n00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:33.598\nBut remember, when you start seeing\nthe same port numbers all the time and\n\n274\n00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:35.190\nthe same IP addresses.\n\n275\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.889\nIt normally is relaying that this is one\nstream of traffic that we're seeing, and\n\n276\n00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:41.000\nit's not multiple streams that's going on.\n\n277\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.900\nProcesses that are running, okay,\nthat should probably not be.\n\n278\n00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.910\nArtifacts, things that are actually there.\n\n279\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.980\nWe'll take a look at that once\nagain little bit later on but for\n\n280\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.730\nright now, at least understand\nthat when you start to see and\n\n281\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.240\nthey give you something of a screenshot or\n\n282\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.240\nsomething like this, understand what\nit is that they're showing you.\n\n283\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.930\nIf you're going, Ronnie,\n\n284\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.320\nI'm not gonna have this screenshot\nforever, that's correct.\n\n285\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.860\nBut the great thing is if you go to\nyour favorite search engine, hm, okay,\n\n286\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.700\nand you type in ThreatGRID analysis\nreports, I'm pretty sure you can\n\n287\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.430\ntake a look at different screenshots and\ndo a little bit of analysis on that.\n\n288\n00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:22.129\nThat shows you some of the information\nthat may be valuable for you to identify\n\n289\n00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:26.155\nwhat type of file, or what's going on for-\n&gt;&gt; If you're watching this show,\n\n290\n00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:29.000\nthere's a button, looks like two\nlittle sticks going up and down.\n\n291\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.854\nYou hit that [LAUGH] and\nthen you get your information [INAUDIBLE].\n\n292\n00:15:31.854 --> 00:15:32.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n293\n00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:34.660\nI mean, just something like that.\n\n294\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.372\nLike I said, I can't really tell you\nexactly what are they looking for, right?\n\n295\n00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:40.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I can tell you that it's not out\n\n296\n00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:44.037\nof the realm that if they say,\nhey, do an analysis based on this,\n\n297\n00:15:44.037 --> 00:15:48.334\nwell, they're gonna show you that,\nthere's kinda the objectives there.\n\n298\n00:15:48.334 --> 00:15:52.048\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna give you the information\nnecessary to answer the question that\n\n299\n00:15:52.048 --> 00:15:52.955\nthey're posing.\n\n300\n00:15:52.955 --> 00:15:56.016\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you go, I'll never\nsee a ThreatGRID analysis report,\n\n301\n00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:57.790\nwell, now you've seen one.\n\n302\n00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.064\nAnd that gives you that ability\nto be able to think about that.\n\n303\n00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:01.881\nCuz it really is.\n\n304\n00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:05.660\nIt helps you to think about\nthe idea of the analysis here.\n\n305\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.890\nBecause it's very important\nwhen we start to take a look\n\n306\n00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.880\nat something that does this for us.\n\n307\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.930\nWithout something like this,\nit now becomes challenging and we can,\n\n308\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:21.200\nwe can wait for\nthe idea of a file to infect our system.\n\n309\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.930\nBut then, at that point somebody that's\nactually right there helping the person,\n\n310\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.890\nhe doesn't have the analysis tool\navailable to him right there, maybe.\n\n311\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.760\nHe might be able to, but if he doesn't, he\nhas to come back, and he has to wait, and\n\n312\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.670\nhe has to generate from that point.\n\n313\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.880\nAnd this is what it allows us to do,\n\n314\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.710\nto learn from that attack\nafter it's happened.\n\n315\n00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.340\nAnd that's really kind of some of the\nmissing elements that we probably don't\n\n316\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.482\nteach well enough in security\nfundamentals a lot of times, right?\n\n317\n00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:49.680\nIs that, we not only have to protect\nour systems from the attack, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.614\nBut we actually have to think about\nthe idea that once a system is attacked,\n\n319\n00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:53.601\nwhat do we learn from it?\n\n320\n00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:55.100\nWhat are lessons learned from it?\n\n321\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.330\nThe report is what helps us to do that.\n\n322\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.290\nSo being able to slow your mind down,\nand on the exam you're not gonna have\n\n323\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.222\ntime to do that, that's why we're kind of\npointing some of these things out, right?\n\n324\n00:17:06.222 --> 00:17:09.414\nYou have about a minute per question,\nokay?\n\n325\n00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:12.468\nAnd on any practice exam that you do,\n\n326\n00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:14.820\nI'm just kind of throwing\nout a few things, right?\n\n327\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.500\nIf you happen to get a practice\nexam from whatever X, Y, Z company,\n\n328\n00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.060\nI don't care what done this.\n\n329\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.940\nIn all reality, for a Cisco exam,\nanswer it confidently within a minute.\n\n330\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.010\nIf you're guessing at it and\nyou get it right, count it wrong.\n\n331\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.100\nEven on a practice test,\nI know I got it right but\n\n332\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.390\nI'm still going to count\nthat one as wrong.\n\n333\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.530\nBecause it means you didn't\nabsorb the material,\n\n334\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.770\nin the way you're going to need to,\nwhen getting ready for the exam.\n\n335\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.590\nYou need to be able to look at\nit confidently and go, hey,\n\n336\n00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.170\nthat's an analysis report,they're asking\nme to find out some information on it.\n\n337\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.710\nWhat types of information\ncan I take a look at?\n\n338\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.560\nEither you're using screenshots that\nyou could find right there on Google,\n\n339\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.800\nor you're using something like\nwhat I'm showing you here.\n\n340\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.280\nAnd we didn't go in-depth into\neverything that's out there.\n\n341\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.590\nBut you can actually see and\nkind of be able to understand and\n\n342\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.775\nknow what you're actually seeing there.\n\n343\n00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:04.420\nThe great thing is whether you're\nusing something like Thread Grid,\n\n344\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.140\nor other analysis tools\nthat are out there,\n\n345\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.310\nthey basically show you\nthe same types of information.\n\n346\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:15.110\nSo even if you don't see the term Threat\nGrid at the top of the page, make sure you\n\n347\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.930\nunderstand some of the other information\nthat you may be looking for as well.\n\n348\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.500\nAnd take advantage of what you do\nhave available to you out there,\n\n349\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.540\nwithout having to spend a ton of money, or\na ton of time getting access to it too.\n\n350\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.120\nSo, it is one of those nice\nthings that you have available.\n\n351\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.995\nBut that's kind of one of the abilities\nthat we have right here on this show,\n\n352\n00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:37.217\nto show you some of that analysis.\n\n353\n00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:38.585\nAll right, let's go ahead and\n\n354\n00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:42.190\ntake a look at just a few more things\nright back here where we were, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:48.069\nSo, now that I have, at least that Threat\nGrid summary, or report that we can do.\n\n356\n00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:50.706\nWe already took a look,\nof course, at the file.\n\n357\n00:18:50.706 --> 00:18:53.460\nAnd that's what we're ultimately\nhoping to get to, right?\n\n358\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.784\nSo there has to be some logical\nprogression in your mind when you\n\n359\n00:18:56.784 --> 00:18:57.544\nfollow this.\n\n360\n00:18:57.544 --> 00:19:01.790\nYou wanna define the path of where it\nwas going, so you know what host to hit.\n\n361\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.632\nBut we were looking for that, where that\nfile actually ended up and where that file\n\n362\n00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:10.854\nis, but notice that I can continue to\ngo on, on to the very host itself.\n\n363\n00:19:10.854 --> 00:19:15.342\nSo if I select, let's say\nindications of compromise here and\n\n364\n00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:20.886\ngive it a moment, since I have to just\nkind of breathe and let it do its thing.\n\n365\n00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:24.668\nI can now see on Indication of Compromise,\n\n366\n00:19:24.668 --> 00:19:30.873\nthere are the different categories\nthat we also have available to us.\n\n367\n00:19:30.873 --> 00:19:35.417\nMalware detected, I understood something\nfrom what I saw, a malware was blocked,\n\n368\n00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:36.706\nwhich is great, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:41.600\nBut I can also see an impact attack try\nto happen a couple of times here too.\n\n370\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.850\nBut this is probably the one that I'm more\nworried about, is this CnC Connected.\n\n371\n00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:52.704\nThat's a little bit more kind of\n[CROSSTALK] sounds like it's working.\n\n372\n00:19:52.704 --> 00:19:54.780\nEven now as I'm looking at it.\n\n373\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.760\nSo I may not have actually\nstopped this yet-\n\n374\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.080\n&gt;&gt; Or does it just mean that\n\n375\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.980\nthere was a CnC connected\nat some point in time?\n\n376\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so how do we find that out?\n\n377\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.230\nWell we have to take a look little\nbit more in detail here, and\n\n378\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.380\nthere's actually a couple of\ndifferent ways we can do that.\n\n379\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.270\nI went through the host here, but\nyou can also go back to, let me see if I'm\n\n380\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.830\ntelling you right, yeah, analysis and\nconnections and security events too.\n\n381\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.690\nSo like everything else Cisco gives\nyou nine ways to cut yourself.\n\n382\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:25.100\nSo you might as well pick one of them, and\nlearn about it and continue to go here.\n\n383\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.935\nSo once I select CNC connected,\n\n384\n00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:32.192\nlet's take a look at what some of\nthe other information it gives me, and\n\n385\n00:20:32.192 --> 00:20:35.620\nit is right here that I can see\na little but more information.\n\n386\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.470\nThe IP address and the CNC,\nthat's actually right there on that one.\n\n387\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.250\nThis host maybe under remote control.\n\n388\n00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.479\nNotice this information right here, okay?\n\n389\n00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:52.553\nFirst seen and\nthen the last time it was also seen.\n\n390\n00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:54.728\nSo it is saying, wait a minute,\n\n391\n00:20:54.728 --> 00:21:00.140\nit was operating right about an hour after\nthe first time it actually appeared.\n\n392\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.100\nSo at this point, you can go, wait,\nsomething is still you know operating and\n\n393\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.530\ndoing whatever it's actually doing.\n\n394\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.628\nSo if I take a look here,\nlet's see, it says 3:09,\n\n395\n00:21:10.628 --> 00:21:16.488\naccording to what I see here, and\nthen my clock actually says, 3:0- wait.\n\n396\n00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:19.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure I'm telling you, yeah.\n\n397\n00:21:19.431 --> 00:21:19.975\n&gt;&gt; 3:09.\n\n398\n00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:20.750\n&gt;&gt; So 3:09, yeah.\n\n399\n00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.270\nOkay, so this is actually doing that\nthing that we're taking a look at.\n\n400\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.070\nSo you can see some of\nthe other information.\n\n401\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.250\nIf I select intelligence,\nsecurity intelligence events.\n\n402\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.800\nAnd you're also gonna hear another\nterm that I don't know why,\n\n403\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.880\nbut we tend to love this in the term tools\nhere, which is what they call pivoting.\n\n404\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.680\nSo if I, let me see if I\ncan select that once again.\n\n405\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.224\nPivoting means that from that one place\nyou can go and access other things,\n\n406\n00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:53.460\nif it gives me that ability to do so\nand decided not to, I don't know why.\n\n407\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.218\nSo, normally that should actually\nlead to security intelligence events.\n\n408\n00:21:57.218 --> 00:22:03.473\n[CROSSTALK] But\nit looked like it finished its thing.\n\n409\n00:22:03.473 --> 00:22:04.346\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n410\n00:22:04.346 --> 00:22:07.219\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was hoping to get to,\nand now,\n\n411\n00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:12.000\nwe can start seeing some of the other\nintelligent security events.\n\n412\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.380\nAnd you can see a lot of blocking has\nbeen going on, on our network so far.\n\n413\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.740\nSo there's some information\nresponder IPs that are coming in.\n\n414\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.500\nOutside zone access.\n\n415\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.880\nThere is a ton of\ninformation we can learn.\n\n416\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.927\nFrom just taking a look at\nwhat we can find right here,\n\n417\n00:22:30.927 --> 00:22:33.990\nunderneath the Cisco\nFirepower Management Center.\n\n418\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.564\nWe'll be taking a look at this a little\nbit later on, as well, as we start to see,\n\n419\n00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:40.402\ncuz there's a lot more analysis\nthat we have to be able to do, and\n\n420\n00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:43.100\na lot of other tools that\nwe have to take a look at.\n\n421\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.070\nBut this is kind of the very first tool\nthat we're actually taking advantage of,\n\n422\n00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.170\nat least in this particular show,\n\n423\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.500\nis reading these different\ntypes of analysis reports.\n\n424\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.829\nDon't over look them, it's going to\nbecome an important part of your job.\n\n425\n00:22:56.829 --> 00:23:01.435\nIf you are work at a tier one\nsecurity operation center,\n\n426\n00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:06.200\nreport analysis is gonna\nbe a big part of your job.\n\n427\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.140\nBeing able to glean the right information\nis the first step in the success\n\n428\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.340\nto us tracking down what we need to.\n\n429\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.640\nSo take a look and take advantage of\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.043\nSo you know, it's a good tool.\n\n431\n00:23:19.043 --> 00:23:21.245\nIf you have the access to it,\ntake a look at from there.\n\n432\n00:23:21.245 --> 00:23:23.007\nBut if you don't, once again,\n\n433\n00:23:23.007 --> 00:23:27.320\nthe understanding the report is kind\nof the key thing here, all right.\n\n434\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.170\nNow Daniel even though this is good, okay?\n\n435\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.590\nThat after the fact we were able\nto take the information and\n\n436\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.890\nwe are able to see this going on.\n\n437\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.190\nThe great thing is,\nit'd do a live time and it will track it.\n\n438\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.680\nIt will tell us when\nthings like that go on.\n\n439\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.460\nAnd in the background, Cisco and\n\n440\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.475\nit's TALOS, T-A-L-O-S,\nI can't say it, TALOS.\n\n441\n00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:49.980\n&gt;&gt; TALOS?\n&gt;&gt; TALOS intelligence.\n\n442\n00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.143\nIt is doing monitoring and\nit's doing prevention.\n\n443\n00:23:52.143 --> 00:23:55.801\nSo have prevention at the beginning\ntrying to stop things from happening.\n\n444\n00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:58.948\nIt will try to actively mitigate\nattacks that are going on And\n\n445\n00:23:58.948 --> 00:24:03.020\nwe can of course use something like this\nto help us to do the analysis afterwards\n\n446\n00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.050\nand to learn from it in our fields and\nour intelligence circle that we need to.\n\n447\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.520\nBut sometimes though, we don't know,\n\n448\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.695\nbecause we ended with what we\ncall zero data tax, right?\n\n449\n00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:17.025\nNow, Daniel,\nwhat do you know about zero data tax?\n\n450\n00:24:17.025 --> 00:24:20.125\nJust give us a general description, cuz\nyou probably know more about it than I do.\n\n451\n00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.585\n&gt;&gt; Well, they're fantastic for\n\n452\n00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:26.127\nthe red team because the blue\nteam cannot prepare for it.\n\n453\n00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:32.147\nThere are unknown attacks or they are just\nbecome now known by thread actors, right?\n\n454\n00:24:32.147 --> 00:24:36.697\nThey're able to take something\nthat is brand new to the world,\n\n455\n00:24:36.697 --> 00:24:39.622\nlet's take a server, let's say CISCO.\n\n456\n00:24:39.622 --> 00:24:44.557\nInside their iOS, all of a sudden some\nhacker somewhere realizes there's a flaw\n\n457\n00:24:44.557 --> 00:24:47.010\ninside of the iOS, the current iOS.\n\n458\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.810\nWell, they exploit the flaw,\nthey put up proof of concept code\n\n459\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.870\non multiple exploit databases,\nand people start attacking.\n\n460\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:55.640\nWell, now what Cisco have to do?\n\n461\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.250\nThey have to try to mitigate that,\nthey're behind the 8-ball.\n\n462\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.890\nThey're having to figure out,\nhow do we stop this and release a patch?\n\n463\n00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.270\nBut until that patch cycle comes through,\n\n464\n00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.520\nuntil that patch is available, we have\nwhat's call a zero to exploit until,\n\n465\n00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.200\nI can take advantage of it\nuntil they patch it up.\n\n466\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.650\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of interesting so\nas advanced as what we just saw, right?\n\n467\n00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.310\nThe advanced of the Cisco app,\n\n468\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.610\nthe advanced malware protection\nis this whole system and\n\n469\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.880\nincludes that threat grid and includes so\nmany other things that are there.\n\n470\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.520\nZero day attacks?\n\n471\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.060\nIt can kind of walk by because it's\nnot ready for anything like that.\n\n472\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.540\nAnd that's because not knowing yet we\ndon't have a clue what's going on there.\n\n473\n00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.135\nSo if we find something like this\non our network, Daniel, okay,\n\n474\n00:25:42.135 --> 00:25:46.500\nthere's a possibility right,\nthat it can just be benign.\n\n475\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.490\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n476\n00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.170\nNothing happens or let's say that the\nworst thing that it does is it turns your\n\n477\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.990\nbackground blue or something like that.\n\n478\n00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.970\nDon't get me wrong, that's bad.\n\n479\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.710\nBut let's just say that it does that.\n\n480\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.590\nOr it just says Happy Birthday even though\nit's not your birthday every single day.\n\n481\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.820\n&gt;&gt; It's an annoying malware.\n\n482\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.800\n&gt;&gt; It's something annoying.\n\n483\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.370\nSomething like that, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:09.470\nBut the worst that can happen, it can\ndo a lot of damage onto our systems.\n\n485\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.990\nBut when we catch something like that,\nwell,\n\n486\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.900\nI catch it, what do I do with it Daniel?\n\n487\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.240\nI just I look at it, I go okay\nI've now got this on the USB key,\n\n488\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.310\nI give it to Daniel, and say, what I do?\n\n489\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.110\n&gt;&gt; Actually, in some ways,\nyou're actually right.\n\n490\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.330\nThat's exactly what we do,\nwe grab it, we say, okay,\n\n491\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:32.040\nthis is the portions of this exploit\nthat have infected my computer,\n\n492\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.710\nthe files that were there and\nthe things that were generated by it.\n\n493\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.433\nAnd then we give them to people that\ndo security analysis for a living,\n\n494\n00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:41.680\npeople like Cisco Symantec\nantivirus companies.\n\n495\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.290\nSo that they can create a signature\nbased off of that event and\n\n496\n00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.976\nthen release it to you as\na security consumer and\n\n497\n00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:54.400\nthe threat grid will now be able\nto spot it and take care of it.\n\n498\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat is what we should do, right?\n\n499\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.033\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, but\n\n500\n00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:01.617\nthe problem is how do I know if it's\nactually a zero day attack or not?\n\n501\n00:27:01.617 --> 00:27:03.620\nThat's the only way I\ncan really tell right?\n\n502\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.240\nPretty much.\n\n503\n00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif your threat grid did not pick up on it,\n\n504\n00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:13.240\nand you know you are up to date\nwith the latest signatures and\n\n505\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.900\nheuristics that they have available,\nand it didn't grab it, and\n\n506\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.680\nyou know this thing is bad and has caused\na problem at a computer or at an end\n\n507\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.070\nstation somewhere, I'm pretty sure I'm\nworking with that zero day at that point.\n\n508\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.340\n&gt;&gt; And once you have that, right?\n\n509\n00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.930\nSo, let us say we're a small shop Daniel.\n\n510\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.810\nWe'll kind of do, give our scenario here.\n\n511\n00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:35.008\nWe're in a small shop and\nnow I believe that I have a suspect zero\n\n512\n00:27:35.008 --> 00:27:39.928\nday file that'st here and\nI don't know exactly what to do.\n\n513\n00:27:39.928 --> 00:27:43.802\nWell, you've given me some good tips,\nof something that can be done, and\n\n514\n00:27:43.802 --> 00:27:47.492\nthat's probably the best thing that\nwe can do because we're relying on\n\n515\n00:27:47.492 --> 00:27:51.427\nthe intelligence of those ticker\norganizations that are huge, all right,\n\n516\n00:27:51.427 --> 00:27:54.675\ngigantic organizations to help\nus in our security analysis.\n\n517\n00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:58.780\nThere's time's out where we want to also\nbe able to do is actually learn from it,\n\n518\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.800\nbecause there is things maybe\nin our environment that actually\n\n519\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.770\ninvited the thing in and wanna be able\nto do something about it as well.\n\n520\n00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:11.120\nWell, that's when we wanna start talking\nabout the issue of sandboxing too.\n\n521\n00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.310\nNow, we're actually going to talk about\nthat, we're also gonna take a look at some\n\n522\n00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:19.040\nof those different places that you also\ntalked about as well to help us and\n\n523\n00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.650\nunderstand that idea of submitting\nour files to some organization.\n\n524\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.460\nBut, we definitely wanna talk about this\nidea of sandboxing and what it does for\n\n525\n00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.170\nus to help us, in terms of zero attack or\n\n526\n00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.120\neven attacks that we go,\nwhat did this thing really do?\n\n527\n00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.840\nWe know anti malware,\nI don't know what the heck I'm saying,\n\n528\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.785\nanti-virus or anti- whatever the term is.\n\n529\n00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:45.681\n&gt;&gt; What they call them now is malware.\n\n530\n00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:50.605\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\nanti-malware thing catches it and okay,\n\n531\n00:28:50.605 --> 00:28:53.460\nbut what does it do,\nand we wanna find out.\n\n532\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.120\nWell, we wanna talk about that issue\nof Sandboxing in a little bit and\n\n533\n00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.460\ntalk about what it does for us and\nits purpose behind that and\n\n534\n00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.990\nwe're gonna talk about how you\ncan set up one of your own.\n\n535\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.855\nNow, we're gonna set up one of our own.\n\n536\n00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:05.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's insanely complex at the time.\n\n537\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.930\nIt doesn't sound like it's complex but-\n&gt;&gt; Sure enough it's\n\n538\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:08.690\na little bit up and running.\n\n539\n00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.670\n&gt;&gt; It can be of an entire\nshow onto itself,\n\n540\n00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.250\nbut we do wanna take a look at that.\n\n541\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.197\nBut once again, Daniel,\nI have talked a lot,\n\n542\n00:29:15.197 --> 00:29:17.777\nwhich means I run out of time once again.\n\n543\n00:29:17.777 --> 00:29:20.006\nSo Daniel, we may need to save that for\nanother show.\n\n544\n00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:22.619\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nshe's a brutal mistress the clock, and\n\n545\n00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:25.175\ndoes not let us off\nthe hook in one little bit.\n\n546\n00:29:25.175 --> 00:29:29.127\nSo we will definitely have to come\nback for another show, part three, and\n\n547\n00:29:29.127 --> 00:29:33.423\nlook at Sandboxing, a very interesting\ntopic, very fun topic as well though.\n\n548\n00:29:33.423 --> 00:29:36.788\nBecause we do, we wanna see, okay,\nnow that we have this crazy little\n\n549\n00:29:36.788 --> 00:29:40.212\ncreature that we found, let's see\nwhat it does in a safe environment,\n\n550\n00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:42.150\nso that it can't hurt anything.\n\n551\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.850\nVery cool stuff, Ronnie,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n552\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.060\nWe do thank our studio audience out\nthere for watching, but it is time for\n\n553\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.100\nus to sign off.\n\n554\n00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.170\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n555\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n556\n00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.415\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n557\n00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:59.566\n[MUSIC]\n\n558\n00:29:59.566 -->

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Reading reports\nhere is kind of one of those situations.\n\n22\n00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.085\nWhen somebody begins with security,\nmost of the time,\n\n23\n00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.150\nreports are kind of the last thing.\n\n24\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.750\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n25\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.770\nWe wanna hunt down.\n\n26\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And destroy the enemy.\n\n27\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.530\n&gt;&gt; We, big strong man.\n\n28\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.124\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n29\n00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:56.987\n&gt;&gt; And we will kill enemy, right?\n\n30\n00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:57.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then-\n\n31\n00:00:57.822 --> 00:00:59.334\n&gt;&gt; Now, it's read reports.\n\n32\n00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:00.135\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:01.543\n&gt;&gt; But the weird thing is we learned more\n\n34\n00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:02.729\nand we advanced more, right?\n\n35\n00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.601\nAnd we actually are figuring out how\nattackers work more when we learn from\n\n36\n00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.975\nthem and what they do, and\n\n37\n00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:11.420\nthen, we're actually prepared\na little bit more the next time.\n\n38\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.041\n&gt;&gt; What do they say,\nthe devil's in the details, right?\n\n39\n00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.996\n&gt;&gt; And that's the truth,\n\n40\n00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:19.090\nespecially in something like this because\nthey're overwhelming so much today, right?\n\n41\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.354\nBut you end up figuring out\nsomething after analyzing a lot of\n\n42\n00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:24.922\nthese attacks is that it\ntake the same pattern.\n\n43\n00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:28.694\nSo once you learn their pattern and once\nyou understand that a little bit more,\n\n44\n00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:32.066\nit means that they have to actually\nkind of one up and you kind of learn,\n\n45\n00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.370\nunderstand, and\nyou're trying to keep even.\n\n46\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.890\nThere's no way you're ever\ngonna get ahead of them, and\n\n47\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.920\nthe reason why is that they are an army.\n\n48\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.780\nRegardless of how big your security\ncompany gets or my security companies,\n\n49\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.180\nyou and I are facing an army just\nin the Asian Pacific area, right?\n\n50\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.762\nMillions, I mean, millions of attackers\nthat are between 14 and 25, probably,\n\n51\n00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:53.658\n40 now [LAUGH].\n\n52\n00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:57.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just look at one\nof those live attack maps or\n\n53\n00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.810\nwhatever, it's super cool to watch.\n\n54\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.180\nBut then, you're like,\nthis is happening in real time.\n\n55\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:03.781\n&gt;&gt; This is a little crazy.\n\n57\n00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it does, it kinda frightens you,\n\n58\n00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:10.260\nbut it doesn't matter how big your own\nsecurity company gets for your network.\n\n59\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.200\nCisco is right.\n\n60\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.900\nTheir CEO said something, and there's only\ntwo types of companies that exist, right?\n\n61\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.931\nOne, those that have been attacked, and\ntwo, those that don't know that they're\n\n62\n00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:19.777\nactually gonna be attacked or\nhave been attacked.\n\n63\n00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:21.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gonna be attacked.\n\n64\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.610\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much the reality.\n\n65\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.182\nSo what can we do now that we understand\nthat we are gonna be facing attacks,\n\n66\n00:02:27.182 --> 00:02:30.943\nnow that we understand that attacks are\ngonna occur and what can we do about it?\n\n67\n00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:34.068\nBut learning from those attacks\nis pretty much the key.\n\n68\n00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:35.194\nThat's kinda been the theme, right?\n\n69\n00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:38.749\nThe idea of understanding report\nanalysis and what we get back is about\n\n70\n00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.310\nlearning from those types of attacks and\nthe information that we get from them.\n\n71\n00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.207\nSo that we are better prepared and\n\n72\n00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:48.743\nour utilities are better able\nto serve the cause that we have.\n\n73\n00:02:48.743 --> 00:02:52.500\nAnd everything else that we\nwanna set up Is ready to go.\n\n74\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500\nAnd we took a look, of course,\nat the idea of using\n\n75\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.077\na ThreatGRID to help us to understand the\nreporting analysis that goes on there and\n\n76\n00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:03.650\n[INAUDIBLE] an example of few different\nthings that you'll learn from there.\n\n77\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.648\nBut don't let that limit you.\n\n78\n00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:09.248\nWe're gonna be taking more of that stuff\nas we go throughout the entirety of this\n\n79\n00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:09.805\nseries.\n\n80\n00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.174\nBut we wanted to jump back in and\n\n81\n00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:16.820\ntalk about sandboxing just briefly for\nthis episode.\n\n82\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.820\nAnd the reason why we want to\ndo that is because we do face,\n\n83\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.600\nespecially on smaller shops to medium-size\nshops, where even if we discover\n\n84\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.840\nmalware that's available,\nwe don't know what the malware does.\n\n85\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.620\nWe know it's malicious because, what?\n\n86\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.933\nThe antimalware says, it's bad.\n\n87\n00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:34.781\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then,\n\n89\n00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.140\nyou go, okay, it's bad.\n\n90\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.740\nAnd then, you go out and you research it.\n\n91\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.710\nWell, then, about, man,\n\n92\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.320\nthat really could've messed us\nup if it had gone any farther.\n\n93\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.016\nWe're glad that it did get stopped.\n\n94\n00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.110\nBut there are times when\nit doesn't get stopped.\n\n95\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.953\nAnd the reason why is that there maybe\nwhat we call zero day attacks out there\n\n96\n00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:54.918\ntoo, which do come in the guise of other\nmalware that gets onto our systems and\n\n97\n00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:56.262\nthat nobody knows about.\n\n98\n00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:59.586\nAnd it is those type of\nthings where you really want\n\n99\n00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:02.850\nto figure out what is going\non in the background.\n\n100\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.383\nMost of us are never going to\ntake it to that extreme and\n\n101\n00:04:06.383 --> 00:04:09.457\ngo, just let it attack,\nand let's watch it.\n\n102\n00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.076\n&gt;&gt; On our network, yeah,\nlet's just see what happens, right?\n\n103\n00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:11.692\nRoll the dice.\n\n104\n00:04:11.692 --> 00:04:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's just see what happens.\n\n105\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's okay.\n\n106\n00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:15.445\nI mean, how far can it\nreally get in a few seconds?\n\n107\n00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:17.071\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, did everything just shut down?\n\n108\n00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:18.705\nI don't think that's good, Bob.\n\n109\n00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:20.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yeah,\n\n110\n00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.858\nnone of us would want to do that, okay?\n\n111\n00:04:21.858 --> 00:04:23.470\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the truth.\n\n112\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.030\nAnd most of us are not\nexperienced enough to go,\n\n113\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.468\nlet's see if I can run\nthis just within my VM.\n\n114\n00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.380\nWell, you already exposed\nit to the Internet.\n\n115\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.312\nWhat are the chances that it can now\nget on the rest of your network?\n\n116\n00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:34.202\nPretty good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n117\n00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:37.700\n&gt;&gt; So you want to have a more\nsecured environment to do so.\n\n118\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd that's when we head into that\nrealm of sandboxing a little bit more.\n\n119\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.940\nNow, Daniel, have you dealt with\nthe sandboxing in production?\n\n120\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.057\n&gt;&gt; Not to the extent of what\nwe're probably gonna dive into.\n\n121\n00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just basic stuff.\n\n122\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.340\nOkay, what is this and what is it doing?\n\n123\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.373\nBuild the VMC, how it operates so\nthat we know what to look for\n\n124\n00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:54.931\nthe next time it rolls around.\n\n125\n00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much the way\nthat I kind of came across it too.\n\n126\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.570\nIt was like, we don't wanna run this,\nbut we really wanna see what happens.\n\n127\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.460\nWhat if we go ahead and\nbuild the sandbox, put the VM on it,\n\n128\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.190\nturn the network connections off,\nand let's see what it does.\n\n129\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Let's see what happens here.\n\n130\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.769\nAnd it's really surprising\nabout how quickly.\n\n131\n00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:15.340\nSometimes, it doesn't look\nlike anything else happens.\n\n132\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.810\nSometimes, it really is out\nto damage the entire machine.\n\n133\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.540\nAnd I had it where we ran one, and\nthe machine just continued to reboot.\n\n134\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.841\nIt didn't matter what you did,\nyou logged in, it would reboot.\n\n135\n00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:25.450\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; You shut down,\n\n136\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.699\nit would just go into reboot loop.\n\n137\n00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.640\nI mean, it was amazing,\nthat is pretty hefty, right?\n\n138\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.490\n&gt;&gt; That's a nasty little bug right there,\nno wants that.\n\n139\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was insanely nasty, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n140\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.850\nSo there was nothing that\nyou are gonna be able to do.\n\n141\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.619\nBut we want to actually see what\nsome of the stuff actually does,\n\n142\n00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:44.150\nespecially those zero day\nones that are out there.\n\n143\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.020\nDoesn't mean you should mess around\nwith them on your production network, so\n\n144\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.090\nthat's where sandboxing comes in.\n\n145\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.688\nSandboxing, essentially,\ngives us an isolated ability, right,\n\n146\n00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:56.810\nor an isolated always network or VLAN,\n\n147\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.340\nwhatever you wanna call it,\nto be able to allow that stuff to run.\n\n148\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.530\nNow, once we do that, Daniel,\nthough, okay, now that I go, okay,\n\n149\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.780\nI've got this isolated network that\nwe're gonna allow for stuff to happen.\n\n150\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.280\nWhat do I do with it,\nnow that it's actually?\n\n151\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.242\nSo Daniel, there it is.\n\n152\n00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:15.178\nHere, you set up the sandbox,\nisolated network here.\n\n153\n00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:17.000\nIt's now infected one of your machines.\n\n154\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.176\nYou're getting the reboot.\n\n155\n00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:20.140\nWell, what do you do with it then, Daniel?\n\n156\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n157\n00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:24.566\nMe, I do nothing with it.\n\n158\n00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:25.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I probably\n\n159\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.970\nput thermite on that machine so that it\nnever gets anyway other than my sandbox.\n\n160\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And now,\n\n161\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.060\nI'm gonna hand it over to\nsome more expert people.\n\n162\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.021\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so hopefully, somebody else is\nmonitoring that has a little bit more\n\n163\n00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.660\nthat's gonna go, ooh, yeah, I can see.\n\n164\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.880\nHere's what we actually found\non this type of system.\n\n165\n00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.612\nWell, inside of a sandbox environment,\nyou also need what?\n\n166\n00:06:45.612 --> 00:06:50.551\nSome type of analysis machine that\nmay help you out a little bit more.\n\n167\n00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:53.730\nAnd of course,\nthat means it requires software.\n\n168\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.023\nA lot of times,\nthe software is, expensive.\n\n169\n00:06:56.023 --> 00:06:57.577\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how else to describe\n\n170\n00:06:57.577 --> 00:06:58.630\nit, right?\n\n171\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.154\nAre there free versions out there?\n\n172\n00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:04.678\nYes, and that's one that we wanna\ntalk about right here is that there\n\n173\n00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:07.570\nis a server out there that we call.\n\n174\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.168\nI don't know, I should learn about the\nhistory of the name behind this thing, but\n\n175\n00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:13.978\nit's actually called Cuckoo.\n\n176\n00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:16.358\nSo let's see if I can get to it here.\n\n177\n00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:17.220\nGo on my machine, Cuckoo.\n\n178\n00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:22.261\nMaybe yeah, I can.\n\n179\n00:07:22.261 --> 00:07:26.123\nLet me just do a quick search on it,\nCuckoo.\n\n180\n00:07:26.123 --> 00:07:28.260\nKoo, I can't spell koo.\n\n181\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.773\nThere it goes.\n\n182\n00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:30.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; cuckoosandbox.org.\n\n183\n00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:31.466\nI know, I've actually done this before.\n\n184\n00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:33.400\nSo now, here it is.\n\n185\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.480\nNotice that when you go to the screen,\nMalware?, Tear it apart,\n\n186\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.610\ndiscover it's ins and outs,\ncollect actionable threat data, okay?\n\n187\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.330\nCuckoo is the leading open source\nautomated malware analysis in this system.\n\n188\n00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.310\nOf all the words right here, well, it's\nthese two that we, most people like, okay?\n\n189\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.234\nOpen source because normally,\nthat means, hey,\n\n190\n00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:59.229\nWe can probably use it on our network and\nmake it run.\n\n191\n00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.060\nThe great thing is it's fairly portable.\n\n192\n00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.840\nYou can run it on a Windows machine if\nyou want to, you can run it on Mac,\n\n193\n00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.280\nyou can run it on Linux.\n\n194\n00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.403\nIt runs everywhere that you do.\n\n195\n00:08:08.403 --> 00:08:12.655\nNow, setting it up is a little\nbit more of a challenging nature.\n\n196\n00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:15.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To actually try and get to start\n\n197\n00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:20.933\nworking here, but you can download it and\nyou can install it from a file.\n\n198\n00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.491\nAnd you name it, it can be done.\n\n199\n00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:25.855\nNow this is not that easy, it's not\njust like the way that I normally think,\n\n200\n00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:28.012\nall right, cool,\nI've got a Windows machine,\n\n201\n00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:30.620\nlet me just double click on the file and\nlet install.\n\n202\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.185\nThere's a lot more that goes in to it\nespecially if you wanna set it up the way\n\n203\n00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.101\nthat they have it.\n\n204\n00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:37.610\nBut they do have documentation.\n\n205\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.520\nAnd if you select that documentation,\n\n206\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.600\nyou'll see it does take a little bit\nof information before you get started.\n\n207\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.530\nSo if I select, and\nnotice that right there, it says,\n\n208\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.330\nusing the new Cuckoo package, here's some\nof the stuff you have to know about.\n\n209\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.290\nBut right away,\nlook at their FAQ on troubleshooting.\n\n210\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:02.303\nIt kind of starts right, I mean,\nsmack dab right in your face here.\n\n211\n00:09:02.303 --> 00:09:05.435\nHere's all the stuff that you\nmay actually encounter, and\n\n212\n00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:09.315\nI'm gonna tell you something,\nI think I encountered 80% of this stuff\n\n213\n00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.900\nin just setting it up when\nI was trying to do this.\n\n214\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.467\nBut in terms of installing it,\nthere's some history and\n\n215\n00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:19.257\nyou can read about that and\nthe idea of using the sandbox, but\n\n216\n00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:24.334\nI want to get to this point and show you,\ndude, you have to prepare your machine.\n\n217\n00:09:24.334 --> 00:09:27.739\nAnd it's recommended on a Ubuntu or\nDebian-based distro that you\n\n218\n00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:30.718\nwant to install and\nprobably the smallest footprint, but\n\n219\n00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:33.980\nactually gives them the most\naccess that they want.\n\n220\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.215\nNow, once you actually\nfinish installing that,\n\n221\n00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:41.228\nyou then of course, you can run\nit inside a VM if you choose to.\n\n222\n00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:43.115\nAnd you have to install a tcpdump,\n\n223\n00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:47.070\nmake sure it runs without\nadministrative privileges right away.\n\n224\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.930\nInstall Volatility if you\nhappen to need that package.\n\n225\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.350\nM2Crypto, so\nit's not anything that's built up.\n\n226\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.270\nYou have to add in all these components,\nand they did that on purpose to make it\n\n227\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.108\nmodular depending on what you're\nreally looking for, okay?\n\n228\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.128\nThen making sure you have users created,\nyou can install it directly from\n\n229\n00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:10.364\nthose packages or, of course, you can\ndo this from the file if you choose to.\n\n230\n00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:15.270\nAll that still comes with kinda headaches\nif you choose to change defaults.\n\n231\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.830\nYou change defaults,\nit's gonna mess around with you.\n\n232\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.215\nHow does Ronnie know that?\n\n233\n00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:22.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because Ronnie\nchanged the defaults.\n\n234\n00:10:22.698 --> 00:10:23.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz Ronnie changed defaults.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:24.190\n&gt;&gt; So at the beginning,\n\n236\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.940\nif you choose to run this, follow the\ninstructions but don't change defaults,\n\n237\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.640\nkinda leave it as it is\nwhen you're guessing what.\n\n238\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.340\nShould I do this?\n\n239\n00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.730\nAnd it says, here's a default entry.\n\n240\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.370\nI would leave it is what I'm saying.\n\n241\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.260\nSo because this show is\nnot about installing in\n\n242\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.477\nthe sandbox-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n243\n00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:40.880\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're talking about it.\n\n244\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.550\nNotice that this\nPer-Analysis Network Routing.\n\n245\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.480\nYes, you still have to actually\ninstall network routes on it\n\n246\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.450\nto make sure everything works.\n\n247\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.480\nYou have to get a proper\nworking directory,\n\n248\n00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.210\nthen you have configurations\nfiles to go through.\n\n249\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.508\n&gt;&gt; So this isn't for\nthe beginner network admin, this is for\n\n250\n00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:02.155\nsomebody that knows networking pretty\nsolidly, is familiar with working inside\n\n251\n00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:06.219\nof operating systems as well, and\ninstalling more complex packages.\n\n252\n00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:08.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To say the least.\n\n253\n00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:08.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:09.983\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would say that\n\n255\n00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:12.252\nyou did an understatement there\nsomewhere down along the way.\n\n256\n00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:16.065\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to like summarize\nthis as nicely as possible.\n\n257\n00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:17.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just trying to let them feel\n\n258\n00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:18.480\nthe impact.\n\n259\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like Ronnie you're burying\n\n261\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.300\nme here man, come on.\n\n262\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.260\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's why we are not doing it so much.\n\n263\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.308\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But overall,\n\n264\n00:11:25.308 --> 00:11:28.514\njust realize this is one of those\nutilities, it's great to have, right?\n\n265\n00:11:28.514 --> 00:11:32.029\nBut it does take some setup,\nand when you do set it up,\n\n266\n00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:36.210\nhere's what you're really\nultimately looking for, right?\n\n267\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.792\nBecause Cuckoo itself,\neven though you can run it inside a VM,\n\n268\n00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:44.692\nit really says look, hey,\nif you choose to, right?\n\n269\n00:11:44.692 --> 00:11:47.232\nNotice that it says let this connect.\n\n270\n00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:51.656\nSo it essentially acts like a proxy,\nlet all the information flow through it,\n\n271\n00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:53.900\nis what you're seeing here.\n\n272\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.259\nSo you start off on the outside with\na DNS Sinkhole to make sure that all\n\n273\n00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:02.786\nyour malware on your network really\ngets through the Cuckoo Host here.\n\n274\n00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:06.121\nAnd when everything else is running,\nthen you have everything isolated.\n\n275\n00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:09.305\nYou wanna make sure that you don't have\nany other machines that are possibly\n\n276\n00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:10.480\nattached here.\n\n277\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.570\nDepending on your environment, you can run\njust a Windows end machine if you want to\n\n278\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.020\nor you can actually run\na combination of all three, and\n\n279\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.750\nif you have all three on your network.\n\n280\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.350\nYou want to get as close to the\nenvironment as what you're really working\n\n281\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.130\nwith to see how to interact\nwith your environment.\n\n282\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.620\nSo once you have something\nlike this set up here, okay?\n\n283\n00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.700\nYou run Cuckoo and you run it on this\nhost and that way as all the information\n\n284\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:40.670\nhappens as you allow for a sample file to\nkind of propagate throughout this network.\n\n285\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.681\nYou'll see which one it actually goes to.\n\n286\n00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:46.177\nMost of the time most people\nare probably gonna setup\n\n287\n00:12:46.177 --> 00:12:49.115\ntheir Windows Lab PC as a guest to say,\nhey,\n\n288\n00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:54.298\nhere's the essentially the target machine\nthat we actually want to look at.\n\n289\n00:12:54.298 --> 00:13:00.186\nFrom that point, Cuckoo or any other type\nof sand boxing type of software that's\n\n290\n00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:05.922\nreally gonna give you any type of analysis\nwill send out reports again, okay?\n\n291\n00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:10.315\nBased on what it did, and the timing, and\nall the other information that you're\n\n292\n00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:13.380\ngenerally looking for\nright at the beginning.\n\n293\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.670\nBut what you're also gonna do\nof course is observe your logs,\n\n294\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.620\nyou're gonna observe what activity\nhappened right here on Lab PC,\n\n295\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.150\nhow fast did it propagate,\nwhat did it end up doing.\n\n296\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.340\nThat's what you're looking for\nis you're looking for\n\n297\n00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.900\nthe overall nature of what's going on and\nthen, of course, the isolation\n\n298\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.160\nof that file or files or whatever it\nis that you've got on that system.\n\n299\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.560\nWhether it's HTTP or\nwhether it's an executable,\n\n300\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.169\nat that point you need to do a little\nbit more analysis of files like this.\n\n301\n00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:46.761\nAnd you can do that in many ways.\n\n302\n00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:48.240\nWe can actually go ahead and\n\n303\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.108\neven possibly install on the same\nmachine that we're running Cuckoo.\n\n304\n00:13:52.108 --> 00:13:54.362\nSomething like Wireshark if we need to,\nright?\n\n305\n00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:58.422\nAnd do a full packet capture\non data as it goes through.\n\n306\n00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:02.310\nOr we might have actually done it here\nat the end that just say, all right,\n\n307\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.949\nnow that I know that we're about to\nrelease this, let's go ahead and\n\n308\n00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:10.277\njust run Wireshark on this thing, and see\nhow far it gets before it kinda hoses us,\n\n309\n00:14:10.277 --> 00:14:12.772\nand try and\ndo the packet capture as we need to.\n\n310\n00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:17.003\nBut that's what we're trying to do is\nactually watch everything happen, okay?\n\n311\n00:14:17.003 --> 00:14:22.435\nAnd we are to get this so\nthat we can understand what is going on,\n\n312\n00:14:22.435 --> 00:14:26.022\nand ultimately, what the thread is, and\n\n313\n00:14:26.022 --> 00:14:30.760\nwhat the ultimate endgame or\nend result is going to be.\n\n314\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.420\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good point to bring up,\nbecause you talked about the machine that\n\n315\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.010\nyou had infected, and it was doing the\nconstant nasty little reboot cycle it had\n\n316\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.930\ngoing on, uncommon endgame for\nsome type of malicious software.\n\n317\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.880\nNot that it can't be, but typically,\nthey want it to stay running.\n\n318\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.020\nThey want to have access.\n\n319\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.610\nThat's what they're looking for.\n\n320\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.787\nSo it's not gonna stop Cuckoo from working\nbecause it's constantly rebooting.\n\n321\n00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:56.934\nOr are totally hosed,\nwe have no access whatsoever.\n\n322\n00:14:56.934 --> 00:15:01.060\nThe end person, the hacker that did\nthis probably wants to gain access to\n\n323\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.960\nwhatever machine it compromised, and\nnow Cuckoo can watch that traffic and\n\n324\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.400\nsee what's happening to\nbetter assess that situation.\n\n325\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.930\n&gt;&gt; And so you might end up saying,\nwhy Cuckoo?\n\n326\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.700\nBecause well, one,\nthe advantage is free, right?\n\n327\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.575\nThat's the big one but\n\n328\n00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:17.485\nall the other stuff it can do, I've\nwrote down some of the things it can do.\n\n329\n00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:22.830\nIt can trace API calls performed by all\nprocesses spawned by malware, okay?\n\n330\n00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.860\nSo it can do stuff like that.\n\n331\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.590\nFiles that are created or\ndeleted or downloaded, okay?\n\n332\n00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.000\nIt can detect even information\nlike that from those machines\n\n333\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.140\nas long as everything is\nrunning the way they want to.\n\n334\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.900\nTrue memory dots,\n\n335\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.470\nthe one that I'm really impressed with is\nthe idea of actually doing a pcap file.\n\n336\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.874\nIt's actually doing a Wireshark\nin the background here.\n\n337\n00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:43.985\nAnd giving a pcap file,\nthen you can take that to a machine and\n\n338\n00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.648\nactually do an analysis of it without\nbeing on that infected network and\n\n339\n00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:48.944\nthat same stuff as well.\n\n340\n00:15:48.944 --> 00:15:53.100\nScreenshots of the desktop are taken\nduring the execution of the malware.\n\n341\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.756\nFull memory dumps of the machine.\n\n342\n00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:56.770\nAll that can be done.\n\n343\n00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.497\nAll for free.\nI mean, that's-\n\n344\n00:15:57.497 --> 00:15:58.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty powerful.\n\n345\n00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:58.993\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful.\n\n346\n00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:01.892\nAnd so information like this,\nwhen you get it and\n\n347\n00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:06.170\nwhen you have that information set up,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n348\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.800\nIt does take a bit of set up to do.\n\n349\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.710\nYou cannot run this as\nyour target machine and\n\n350\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.872\nthe host machine monitoring\nat the same time.\n\n351\n00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:17.333\nThat's something that I would go,\nabsolutely you could do that.\n\n352\n00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:18.918\nThat's not the way to go, right?\n\n353\n00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:23.175\nSo you need a target over here and\nthen you need the Cuckoo over here,\n\n354\n00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:25.798\nbetween this and of course that network.\n\n355\n00:16:25.798 --> 00:16:28.640\nAnd if you're not exactly sure\nif Cuckoo has, of course,\n\n356\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.483\nthe documentation to help you\nget that up and running, but\n\n357\n00:16:31.483 --> 00:16:35.230\ndon't expect it to be a click and\nrun, and everything will be good.\n\n358\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.898\nYou have a lot of setup that\nyou have to go through.\n\n359\n00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:40.375\nAll right, so Daniel,\nonce we understand that and\n\n360\n00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:45.320\nwe get to that point where we're saying,\nall right, we've isolated, now, that file.\n\n361\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.640\nThe great thing is, if everything else is\ndown, when I say that we can't get back\n\n362\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.410\ninto our Windows Lab or\nour Windows PC machine over here.\n\n363\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.990\nBut we know that that's\nthe PC that was affected.\n\n364\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.591\nThe great thing is with Cuckoo,\nI can actually go ahead and\n\n365\n00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:04.364\ntake that P CAP file, okay, and when I\ntake that P CAP file, I can go to File and\n\n366\n00:17:04.364 --> 00:17:09.460\nthen look for extracted objects, or\ndownloaded objects, something like that.\n\n367\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.804\nAnd then I can tell it I want\nto pull out the files that were\n\n368\n00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:17.290\nactually sent using that P CAP file.\n\n369\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.210\nAnd when I do that,\nI can now submit it to an authority,\n\n370\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.890\nlike what Daniel and I had talked\nabout at the end of the last episode.\n\n371\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.720\nSo now that we have this particular\nexample of a file that, hey,\n\n372\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.290\nnothing caught on our network.\n\n373\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.830\nWe know that a machine\nkind of got taken down.\n\n374\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.151\nBut now that we're running\nin our own Sandbox here,\n\n375\n00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:41.298\nwe're able to see the results, but I still\ndon't know what this thing is doing.\n\n376\n00:17:41.298 --> 00:17:44.694\nI mean, I know what it's\nactually ultimately doing, but\n\n377\n00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:47.120\nwho can actually verify and help me out?\n\n378\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.406\nDid I close out of my, there it is, okay.\n\n379\n00:17:49.406 --> 00:17:52.774\nI was gonna say I know I had,\nI was trying to look and see, I was like,\n\n380\n00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:54.684\nwhere the heck did I close that out to?\n\n381\n00:17:54.684 --> 00:17:57.490\nBut there is a service out there,\nand there's many of them, okay?\n\n382\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.692\nSo here,\nthis one is called payload security.\n\n383\n00:18:00.692 --> 00:18:04.525\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, are we actually going\nto be able to upload a file to this?\n\n384\n00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:06.038\n&gt;&gt; We definitely are gonna be able to.\n\n385\n00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:11.110\nI had already previously extracted\na file that may have potential\n\n386\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.920\nto trigger something here.\n\n387\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Maliciousness.\n\n388\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.676\n&gt;&gt; Some maliciousness\nmay be going on here, so\n\n389\n00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:17.479\nremember that you can\nactually submit this.\n\n390\n00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:19.940\nNow you go,\ndo I have to submit it from Cuckoo?\n\n391\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.688\nNot necessarily, okay,\nif you take a look, if you do have this.\n\n392\n00:18:23.688 --> 00:18:28.933\nAnd I was just staring at it, as Daniel\nwas talking here, right at the bottom, it\n\n393\n00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:35.360\nsays this free malware analysis service is\nrunning VxStream Sandbox on the backend.\n\n394\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.520\nSo, it is actually going to do what?\n\n395\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.124\nIf I don't have one,\nit says I'll explode it.\n\n396\n00:18:40.124 --> 00:18:41.395\nLet me explode this\nthing in the background,\n\n397\n00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:42.339\nis what it's telling you there.\n\n398\n00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:42.969\n&gt;&gt; Is this a paid service,\n\n399\n00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:43.960\nor we just get to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n400\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.969\nthis is absolutely free at this\nparticular point, sure enough.\n\n401\n00:18:47.969 --> 00:18:48.924\n&gt;&gt; My favorite price.\n\n402\n00:18:48.924 --> 00:18:52.410\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually pretty darn\ncool that this is out there.\n\n403\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.080\nSo earlier, before the show,\nlet me show you what I have here.\n\n404\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.391\nSo I went ahead and\n\n405\n00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:02.905\nI pulled this off from a VM that I was\nrunning that had a possible infection.\n\n406\n00:19:02.905 --> 00:19:04.630\nAnd what do you think, Daniel?\n\n407\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.899\nDo you think that name\nis naturally generated,\n\n408\n00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:09.128\nthat human kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n409\n00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:11.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, that looks like-\n&gt;&gt; By human,\n\n410\n00:19:11.176 --> 00:19:16.177\nI mean that they set up the system that\ngenerated this random string [CROSSTALK]\n\n411\n00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:16.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n412\n00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.432\nwho wouldn't remember\na file name like this?\n\n413\n00:19:19.432 --> 00:19:24.273\n[LAUGH] So\nthere's a potential here that something\n\n414\n00:19:24.273 --> 00:19:28.210\ncould possibly be wrong with that file.\n\n415\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.990\nSo let's say that we encountered\nthat in our capture.\n\n416\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.330\nSo we say, hey, I wanna select that file,\nso I can go to my File and\n\n417\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.580\nthen select Desktop,\nif I can find Desktop.\n\n418\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.480\nExtract it, pull that file up there.\n\n419\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.955\nThen from this point,\nI have to type in the CAPTCHA.\n\n420\n00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:56.310\nI hope this is not someone's name [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.380\nAnd then it says the analysis\nenvironment says it was a .exe.\n\n422\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.620\nI'm pretty sure that that means it\nwas a Windows environment as well.\n\n423\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.990\nAnd it says hey,\ndo you wanna actually do anything?\n\n424\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.580\nLet's see, don't share, yeah,\n\n425\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.602\ncuz this file is probably not\nsomething that we have to worry about.\n\n426\n00:20:13.602 --> 00:20:17.110\nAnd then I'm gonna\ngenerate a public report.\n\n427\n00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.000\nSo it says that there's 11\nwaiting to be captured there, but\n\n428\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.466\nyou can now see there it is.\n\n429\n00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:28.704\nNow even though we came out\nwith a weird name, this one,\n\n430\n00:20:28.704 --> 00:20:33.726\nDaniel, if you take a look and\nnotice, it is zarali?\n\n431\n00:20:33.726 --> 00:20:35.475\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] zararli.\n\n432\n00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:39.135\n&gt;&gt; Zararli, and\nit's running in Kermelmode monitor, and\n\n433\n00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:42.960\nnow we can see that here it is,\nit went ahead and it did that.\n\n434\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.740\nWhat is this assessment?\n\n435\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.600\nIt injects it into Explorer,\n\n436\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.440\nmodifies auto-execute functionality\nby creating a value in the registry.\n\n437\n00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.945\nNow, Daniel, if I actually run a file on\nsomebody else's machine, and I have access\n\n438\n00:20:57.945 --> 00:21:01.330\nto the registry, I'm pretty much-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're in.\n\n439\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.433\n&gt;&gt; In good control here, okay?\n\n440\n00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:04.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Reads the active computer name.\n\n441\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.960\nIndicators, not all malicious and\nsuspicious indicators are displayed here.\n\n442\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.840\nIf you want to,\nyou of course can go a little bit deeper.\n\n443\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.260\nNotice it says reads the ID product or\nthe Windows product ID.\n\n444\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.721\nSample is identified as malicious by\na large number of anti-virus engines.\n\n445\n00:21:21.721 --> 00:21:27.540\nThat's probably a good [LAUGH]\nindication here to be able to do that.\n\n446\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.526\nAnd you can see it injects in Explorer,\nit injects itself into other processes,\n\n447\n00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:35.624\nwrites a pre-execution\nfile header to the disc.\n\n448\n00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:40.411\nThat's a little bit more unusual,\nsuspicious, and again, it possibly tries\n\n449\n00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:45.260\nto hide a process of launching it\nusing different user credentials.\n\n450\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.251\nThat might actually be something\nelse that we don't want it to do.\n\n451\n00:21:49.251 --> 00:21:50.979\nWe can see different aspects of this,\n\n452\n00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:53.710\nother information that's\navailable on there.\n\n453\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.630\nEnvironment awareness, you name it.\n\n454\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.590\nAnd then at the bottom, file details and\n\n455\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.370\nwhat it did, and\nthere's the hash file to it.\n\n456\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.890\nSo it essentially has\nmatched up something else.\n\n457\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.220\nDifferent sessions and files and\n\n458\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.660\nthe other imports that it had\ninside the .exe, you name it.\n\n459\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:17.432\nThere's even the certificates,\nscreenshot of it working,\n\n460\n00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:20.989\nand what it did on this analysis here.\n\n461\n00:22:20.989 --> 00:22:25.640\nSo you name it, there is a lot\nof information that we can get.\n\n462\n00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.399\nAnd that's something like Cuckoo would\nultimately end up getting and doing for\n\n463\n00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:33.590\nyou if you wanted to set this up for\nyour network.\n\n464\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, the obvious question that\njumps into my head is, why would I set up\n\n465\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.940\nCuckoo when this is already freely\navailable and seems to work very well?\n\n466\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.824\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou pretty much don't have to, okay?\n\n467\n00:22:44.824 --> 00:22:46.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, save yourself some time and\nheadache.\n\n468\n00:22:46.413 --> 00:22:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Save yourself some time and headache\nin terms of a production environment.\n\n469\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.560\nBut setting up a sandbox, though,\nis actually a great learning environment.\n\n470\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.217\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n471\n00:22:56.217 --> 00:23:01.072\nthat's pretty much the key idea here,\nis to learn from what you have access to.\n\n472\n00:23:01.072 --> 00:23:03.360\nAnd to be able to run and\ngenerate reports like this.\n\n473\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.340\nAnd to see the end result of this is\nwhat you really want to get to, because\n\n474\n00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.090\nwe can't just say, I know it's a bad file,\nso that's why I reimaged the machine.\n\n475\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.930\nWe want to be able to get into this and\nsay, hey, this is\n\n476\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.410\nsomething that we should be guarding\nagainst, but how did it get through?\n\n477\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.370\nAnd being able to\nactually learn from that.\n\n478\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.635\nSo setting one up is actually\na great experience for you to do.\n\n479\n00:23:24.635 --> 00:23:29.104\nIt's gonna cause you some headaches,\nbut it'll get you deeper into working\n\n480\n00:23:29.104 --> 00:23:32.001\nwith Linux if you haven't\nworked with it before.\n\n481\n00:23:32.001 --> 00:23:36.085\nAnd not only that though, more experience\nand understanding what it does and getting\n\n482\n00:23:36.085 --> 00:23:39.826\nthat system where you can start taking a\nlook at the analysis of it on your own and\n\n483\n00:23:39.826 --> 00:23:41.350\nnot depending on this.\n\n484\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.247\nWhat if your Internet connection is down?\n\n485\n00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:46.182\nI mean, those are some of the things that\nwe still have to actually be able to do.\n\n486\n00:23:46.182 --> 00:23:48.760\nSo right here is a great one.\n\n487\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.383\nBut yes, there's probably in\na production environment in a hurry,\n\n488\n00:23:52.383 --> 00:23:55.771\nyou're probably not going let\nme now just set up a sandbox.\n\n489\n00:23:55.771 --> 00:24:00.741\nYeah, let me spin up Cuckoo in about\n42 hours, and once we do that,\n\n490\n00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:02.039\nno, not really.\n\n491\n00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:05.489\nIt's not that bad if you're used to\nworking with this, probably fairly easy,\n\n492\n00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:06.003\nbut for me,\n\n493\n00:24:06.003 --> 00:24:09.466\nit was a bit more challenging because\nI'm really not used to that environment.\n\n494\n00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:13.759\nAs much as I'd like to think that I'm\nfairly decent at doing some of this stuff,\n\n495\n00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:16.386\nsome of it was a bit challenging and\nsaying okay,\n\n496\n00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:18.770\nwhy is this having to do that first?\n\n497\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.690\nBut once you get used to it,\nit's probably up and running and great.\n\n498\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.372\nBut here's an example of some of the\ninformation you'll also get from a report,\n\n499\n00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:27.900\nCuckoos will generate something similar.\n\n500\n00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.070\nIt won't look the same,\n\n501\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.850\nbut the same types of instances is\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n502\n00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.442\nSo a great learning environment for us to\nactually think about, and a great tool for\n\n503\n00:24:36.442 --> 00:24:39.230\nus to think about,\nespecially when generating these reports.\n\n504\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.392\nWhich are very important for\nus to understand, so we can actually take\n\n505\n00:24:42.392 --> 00:24:45.670\nthat next step in doing more of\nthe network security monitoring.\n\n506\n00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Ronnie, great stuff.\n\n507\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.294\nWe do appreciate your time on this,\nvery cool.\n\n508\n00:24:49.294 --> 00:24:54.292\nAnd like you said, it just starts to\nincrease our depth of knowledge and\n\n509\n00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:56.580\nour foundational vocabulary.\n\n510\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.558\nThat's the word I'm looking for,\nvocabulary,\n\n511\n00:24:58.558 --> 00:24:59.934\nas we move forward in this series.\n\n512\n00:24:59.934 --> 00:25:02.890\nBut we do look forward\nto upcoming episodes.\n\n513\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.340\nBut as for this one,\nit looks like we are out of time.\n\n514\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.650\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n515\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.220\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n516\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.394\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n518\n00:25:12.394 --> 00:25:18.478\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:25:18.478 --> 00:25:21.815\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:16.430\n&gt;&gt; All right greeting everyone welcome\nback to another great episode of ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.997\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie\nin today's episode\n\n8\n00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.574\nwe are back with more in\nour Cisco sack up series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:25.000\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr. Ronny Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.114\nRonny welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:27.150\nGlad to have you again, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.070\n&gt;&gt; Well hello again,\nthank you for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.209\nI'm doing well and we are continuing on\nto take a look at a very exciting and\n\n14\n00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:41.366\nmonumental portion of, of course\nthe SECOPS exam here, which is CVSS.\n\n15\n00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.702\n&gt;&gt; Man, I love my rewards card.\n\n16\n00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:46.190\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I know yeah, the actual pharmacy store\n\n17\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.595\nthere [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:49.991\n&gt;&gt; We'll talk about all of that entire.\n\n19\n00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:50.501\nNope.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.950\n&gt;&gt; And we're actually going to some\n\n21\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.590\nplace a little bit different here.\n\n22\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.545\n&gt;&gt; CVSS.\n\n23\n00:00:54.545 --> 00:01:00.380\n&gt;&gt; CVSS, and if you're saying,\nhey, what is CVSS?\n\n24\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.298\nWell, let's start off\nwith another question and\n\n25\n00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:05.321\nmaybe this will help after those.\n\n26\n00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n27\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.230\n&gt;&gt; As well audit, so let's take\na look at my computer screen here for\n\n28\n00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.410\na moment and here it is.\n\n29\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.570\nIt is the trivia question of the day for\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n30\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.126\nDaniel, what does this actually,\ndoes this mean anything to you?\n\n31\n00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:19.461\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah?\n\n32\n00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It means stuff to me obviously,\n\n33\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400\nI know exactly what this is.\n\n34\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.763\nAnd I don't wanna steal it from you,\nI don't wanna take your thunder away-\n\n35\n00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:29.480\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n36\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.515\n&gt;&gt; I'll allow you to explain it.\n\n37\n00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:31.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.968\n&gt;&gt; Well I appreciate your graciousness,\n\n39\n00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.937\nand you know, your humility there.\n\n40\n00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:37.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:37.941\n&gt;&gt; In allowing me\n\n42\n00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.562\nto kind of describe this and\ntalk about this a little bit more.\n\n43\n00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm way humbler than\nmore people than you know.\n\n44\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.198\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure, I understand that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:46.729\n&gt;&gt; At least that's what you've\n\n46\n00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.267\ntold me in the past, before.\n\n47\n00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n48\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.710\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to take a look at\nsomething like this, you're probably\n\n49\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.186\nscratching your head, like [SOUND],\nI still don't know what we're getting at.\n\n50\n00:01:55.186 --> 00:02:01.220\nThat CVSS stands for\nour common vulnerability scoring system.\n\n51\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.522\nAnd, this is something that we're\nstarting to see more and more in terms of\n\n52\n00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:11.590\nsome type of self or vendor stand up,\nit's not government regulated.\n\n53\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.250\nWhat do we call that?\n\n54\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.260\nIndustry-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, community.\n\n55\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, community wide\nstandardization of some sort, right?\n\n56\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.480\nSo when we talk about\ncommon vulnerability, well,\n\n57\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.880\nlet's start with those two terms right\nthere and that will help us out overall.\n\n58\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.680\nIn the world of cybersecurity today,\nright, there are so\n\n59\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.880\nmany vulnerabilities that go on.\n\n60\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.430\nAnd so many different ways\nthat attacks can happen, so\n\n61\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.140\nmany different vectors that are out there,\nyou name it.\n\n62\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.540\nThere are vulnerabilities just about for\neverything.\n\n63\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.340\nWell, if Daniel learns\nabout something like that,\n\n64\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.900\nhe can keep that information to himself.\n\n65\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.200\nAnd if he keeps that information\nto himself it helps him.\n\n66\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.323\nBut it doesn't help anybody else and\nwhat Daniel hopefully will actually start\n\n67\n00:02:54.323 --> 00:02:58.137\nunderstanding is he might go, no I have\nthe most secure system in the world\n\n68\n00:02:58.137 --> 00:03:02.286\nbecause I've learned everything about\nall the vulnerabilities of my system.\n\n69\n00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.910\nBut it doesn't help me out,\nit doesn't help anybody else out.\n\n70\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.750\nAnd Daniel still goes but I'm secure and\nthat's all that really matters.\n\n71\n00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.530\nWhen we start finding out though is that\nthere is actually not only the idea of\n\n72\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.210\nsecuring ourselves but to help to\nbenefit the entire community and\n\n73\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.050\nhelp to actually provide\na better security for vendors,\n\n74\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.740\nhardware vendors that are there,\nsoftware vendors, you name it.\n\n75\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.482\nWhoever is actually making this\ncode that's out there for us.\n\n76\n00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:30.267\nIf we can pull that knowledge and\nthat information together,\n\n77\n00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:34.633\nwell now we have more people,\nmore resources working on this exploit or\n\n78\n00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:37.138\nwhatever it is to actually identify it.\n\n79\n00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:41.532\nAnd then to be able to actually put it\ninto a system, so that we can go hey,\n\n80\n00:03:41.532 --> 00:03:44.342\nhere's what we learned about this so\nfar, and\n\n81\n00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:47.532\nit's not me having discover over and\nover again..\n\n82\n00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:49.104\nSo it's like,\nI'm not rebuilding the wheel,\n\n83\n00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.450\nI'm actually learning from the entire\ncommunity that's put there.\n\n84\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.750\n&gt;&gt; It is a bit of an ecosystem when you\nthink of it that way Ronnie, where you\n\n85\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.545\nhave, yeah, I might be the stand alone\ncompany, maybe I'm small businessman,\n\n86\n00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:01.640\nmaybe I'm an enterprise level,\nmaybe I'm a government entity.\n\n87\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.377\nBut at the end of the day we're all\nconnected to the internet so that,\n\n88\n00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:08.986\noutside entities might have access\nto something on our systems and\n\n89\n00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:13.306\nif they're weak and then we have to allow\nthat weakness to contact us then we're\n\n90\n00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:15.260\nonly as strong as our weakest link.\n\n91\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.350\nSo it benefits us all to get to a level\nof security that's equal, correct?\n\n92\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.100\n&gt;&gt; And yeah that's actually smack\n\n93\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.820\nright dab on the point that\nwe need to make, right?\n\n94\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.710\nThe very fact that even though Daniel\nmay be secure at his end, if he can then\n\n95\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.560\nspread that information where it affects\nthe vendor or the hardware vendor\n\n96\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.660\nthat he is working with, and then the\nhardware vendor can share that information\n\n97\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.780\nwith the people that are writing\nsoftware for his hardware.\n\n98\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.407\nThen the software companies can begin to\nhelp and to learn and share that with\n\n99\n00:04:43.407 --> 00:04:46.989\nother people that are also out there\nthat are making the code, you name it.\n\n100\n00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:51.508\nAll of these are actually possible in\nterms of actually making sure that\n\n101\n00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:54.165\neverybody's working at the same level.\n\n102\n00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.768\nAnd working on you know, and understanding\nthe vulnerabilities that are out there.\n\n103\n00:04:57.768 --> 00:05:01.333\nSo we're going to actually take a look\nat how this actually all rolls out for\n\n104\n00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:02.165\nus as well.\n\n105\n00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.398\nI think my computer just dinged\nlet me turn that down here.\n\n106\n00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n107\n00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:09.945\nlet's take a look at what we\nneed to understand here, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:14.154\nSo that common vulnerability scoring\nsystem is going to be important for\n\n109\n00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:15.400\nwhat we actually do.\n\n110\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.460\nBecause it does help us to kind\nof ask the very common and\n\n111\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.360\ngeneric questions that we need as we get\nstarted working with a system like this.\n\n112\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.010\nNow we're on version 3.0, which means\nversions 1 and 2 have already passed.\n\n113\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.190\nAnd the problem that we had\nwith the earlier versions.\n\n114\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.270\nIt's not that it was a problem,\nthey were starting off, right?\n\n115\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.810\nBut they've continued to get better.\n\n116\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.170\nAnd more than likely, there's gonna\nbe a version 4 or version 5, and\n\n117\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.760\nit's gonna continue onward.\n\n118\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.570\nBecause these types of vulnerabilities\nare gonna continue to get exploited.\n\n119\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.280\nAnd even more vulnerabilities\nare gonna be found, and\n\n120\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.340\nthey wanna continue to improve this.\n\n121\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.530\nThis latest version is supposed to make\nit easier for, well, everybody, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.770\nSo the first two versions\nwere relatively technical.\n\n123\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.310\nAnd the way that they scored\nthe thing is a little bit convoluted.\n\n124\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.210\nNow, you're about to see when we\nstart to talk about this idea and\n\n125\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.680\nhow this works out.\n\n126\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.340\nIt's still is a little bit convoluted,\nat least to my thought, but\n\n127\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.990\napparently it is a lot easier.\n\n128\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.310\nBefore, we actually had kind\nof the earlier versions that\n\n129\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.720\nsome of the metrics that\nthey ended up using,\n\n130\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.980\ndidn't work out the way that they\nthought that they would as well.\n\n131\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.870\nSo this is the kind of latest system\nthat's actually out there for us.\n\n132\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.100\nAnd it's still a bit complex,\nbecause of what it relies on.\n\n133\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.360\nSo let me go ahead and take a look here.\n\n134\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.290\nAnd talk about what we have, normally we\ncome up with an overall composite score.\n\n135\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.310\nNow Daniel when you and\n\n136\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.640\nI think about the scoring system,\nwe think about numbers, right?\n\n137\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually.\n\n138\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a scale of 1-10, 1-50, 1-100,\nyou know something like that, right?\n\n139\n00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the scoring system.\n\n140\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.705\nWell believe it or not Daniel,\nthis it the score, okay?\n\n141\n00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:53.850\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n142\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.929\n&gt;&gt; And\nthere is no numbers in it whatsoever.\n\n143\n00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:58.434\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there is no numbers in\n\n144\n00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:01.938\nit whatsoever, now there are numbers\nthat we can associate with this and\n\n145\n00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:06.018\nwe'll get to that a little bit later on in\nwhat we'll call severity rating score, is\n\n146\n00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:10.330\nwhat this actually turns out to be, where\nthey actually link it to some numbers.\n\n147\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.990\nBut that's actually an optional\ncomponent of the CVSS right now.\n\n148\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.400\nBut we'll get to that\nwhen we start to do this.\n\n149\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.097\nBut it's goal is to provide what we call a\ncomposite score, that gives a severity and\n\n150\n00:07:24.097 --> 00:07:28.994\nrisk rating of a particular vulnerability\nthat we're facing okay, and\n\n151\n00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:30.296\nthat is very good.\n\n152\n00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:34.393\nNow you might be going like why the heck\ndo I need that if I have a vulnerability\n\n153\n00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:37.721\nI've just got to fix it,\nwho care about the severity level and\n\n154\n00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:39.399\nthe risk rating of this thing.\n\n155\n00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.525\nWhy do I actually need\nsomething like this?\n\n156\n00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:44.870\nAlright, so Daniel, let me put you\nback into your days of working for\n\n157\n00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.515\na large unnamed insurance company here,\nokay?\n\n158\n00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:48.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n159\n00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.118\nas you were doing that\nin the IT department,\n\n160\n00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:55.891\nyou might have actually found out at some\npoints in time, like everybody else did.\n\n161\n00:07:55.891 --> 00:08:00.350\nThat hey, we're starting to get a huge\nnumber of these vulnerabilities that\n\n162\n00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.616\nare coming in from my- From my hardware\nvendors and my software vendors.\n\n163\n00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:09.313\nCrap, Microsoft just sent me this list\nof things that I now gotta go back and\n\n164\n00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:11.118\ntrace all these things out.\n\n165\n00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:15.440\nAnd they all happened, let's say,\nwithin a week or maybe just one day.\n\n166\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.180\nAll of a sudden, you had 20 or\n30 vulnerabilities.\n\n167\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.030\nAnything like that happen?\n\n168\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.790\n&gt;&gt; We did have some fires that\nbusted loose from time to time,\n\n169\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.460\ntypically not from our hardware vendor so\nmuch.\n\n170\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.260\nDefinitely Microsoft would say, hey,\n\n171\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.210\nyou guys need to go patch this ASAP,\nright now,\n\n172\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.280\nbecause there is a problem, and you're\ngonna be here zero days is happening.\n\n173\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.730\nSo yeah, there were those times.\n\n174\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start thinking about\nsomething like that, now, Daniel,\n\n175\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.120\ndid you have a system in place?\n\n176\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.540\nThat said, all right, here's a list,\nI'm just making these numbers up.\n\n177\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.310\nHere's a list of 30 different\nvulnerabilities that Microsoft says,\n\n178\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.460\nhere you go, Daniel.\n\n179\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.745\nAnd now you're looking at a list and\ngo, neat.\n\n180\n00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.593\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So did you have a list that says\n\n181\n00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:57.170\nwe need to work on these first or\nthese last?\n\n182\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.050\nWe're not so worried about these.\n\n183\n00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.560\nDid you have something in place like that?\n\n184\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.650\n&gt;&gt; The best I came close to with something\nlike that was when updates came or patches\n\n185\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.558\ncame in for Microsoft, any critical or\nsecurity patches would go out immediately.\n\n186\n00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:13.790\nRight, we would hit test with them for\nX amount of time,\n\n187\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.750\nvery short amount of time, and then\ndeploy the production almost immediately.\n\n188\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's actually a rating\nsystem, right, critical and urgent or\n\n189\n00:09:21.684 --> 00:09:22.612\nwhatever it was.\n\n190\n00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.929\n[CROSSTALK] Security, yeah, so\nwhen you have something like that,\n\n191\n00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:29.027\nthat is a form of rating that says,\nthese should be pushed out.\n\n192\n00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:33.713\nThe idea of optional or should be updated,\ncould be updated, but not really,\n\n193\n00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:35.570\nyou kind of leave those alone.\n\n194\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.840\nSo you had some system in place\nwith something like that.\n\n195\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.880\nWell, now, let's say we add in that\nother level, and now hypothetically,\n\n196\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.130\nthere's a hardware vendor that says this,\nhey, we found out something.\n\n197\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.410\nThis particular type of machine\nrunning this Windows product,\n\n198\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.020\nit has this vulnerability on it.\n\n199\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.890\nAnd they go, do not patch.\n\n200\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.710\nNow you have something from\nMicrosoft that says what?\n\n201\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.649\nPatch it, now you have the vulnerability.\n\n202\n00:09:58.649 --> 00:09:59.527\n&gt;&gt; Now what do you do?\n\n203\n00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now what do you do?\n\n204\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.224\nWhat is the actual physicality there?\n\n205\n00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:07.100\nIt is a dilemma in stuff that\nyou actually end up doing.\n\n206\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.210\nWell, the common vulnerability\nscoring system, it's not perfect.\n\n207\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.120\nBut it gives you this\nability then to try and\n\n208\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.990\nput some type of rating system on\nsomething like that that may occur.\n\n209\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.580\n&gt;&gt; So when you got two equally\ndangerous things happening,\n\n210\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.100\nMicrosoft saying patch this immediately,\nand the hardware vendor going,\n\n211\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.520\ndo not patch this or\nyou'll open this vulnerability.\n\n212\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.761\nAnd now you need a tie breaker, right?\n\n213\n00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:32.727\nWhat do I do?\n\n214\n00:10:32.727 --> 00:10:37.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where that common\nvulnerability scoring system helps us out,\n\n215\n00:10:37.313 --> 00:10:41.633\nand we'll see that it actually does work\nbased on this idea of three different\n\n216\n00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:43.060\ntypes of metrics.\n\n217\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.924\nNow of course within each of these\nthree metrics that we have here,\n\n218\n00:10:46.924 --> 00:10:51.340\nwe'll kind of drill down into those\ndifferent metrics, the base metrics,\n\n219\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.666\nthe temporal metrics, and\nthe environmental metrics.\n\n220\n00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:58.660\nAnd we'll do that over a couple or maybe\neven three shows as we go on through here.\n\n221\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.540\nBut it does actually have\nto give us some tiebreaker.\n\n222\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.590\nThere's sometimes where we have to\nactually learn a little bit more about\n\n223\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.150\nthe systems that we have.\n\n224\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.450\nBut that's what can happen, right?\n\n225\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.880\nNow, what if we actually not only had\nthat one vulnerability in place, but\n\n226\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.820\nnow we had two or\nthree that's actually right there?\n\n227\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.280\nFor a small shop, two or three, five,\n\n228\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.900\nlet's say a handful of vulnerabilities,\nwell, we might have to kind of pick and\n\n229\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.530\nchoose which ones we may\nactually have to prioritize.\n\n230\n00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.340\nIn other words, work on which ones\nin the orders that we want to.\n\n231\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:28.940\nIn a big shop,\n\n232\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.600\nperhaps like Daniel is working in,\nDaniel just goes, I'm the boss,\n\n233\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.078\nand you two, you can work on this one-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:36.560\n&gt;&gt; You two, you can work on these three,\n\n235\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.410\nand whatever it might be.\n\n236\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.220\nYou have the resources,\nand nobody regrets that,\n\n237\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.320\nwe're glad that some\npeople have the resources.\n\n238\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.039\nBut in small shops,\nyou may just have to go, well,\n\n239\n00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.646\nhere's the order that\nwe're working these in.\n\n240\n00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.674\nAnd how do we do that if we don't\nreally have all the experience that\n\n241\n00:11:51.674 --> 00:11:54.594\nwe think that we need to judge which\nones are actually the best and\n\n242\n00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:56.660\nwhich ones that we need to work on?\n\n243\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.860\nWell, the Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem essentially gives you this\n\n244\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.290\nvoluntary rating system that you can do.\n\n245\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.570\nAnd the vendors participate in\nit in terms of what we call,\n\n246\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.090\nwe'll see here on the base metrics.\n\n247\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.089\nAnd then, you'll also learn\nafter some experience and time,\n\n248\n00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:17.325\nwe'll take a look at how the temporal\nmetrics kind of affect that.\n\n249\n00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:21.587\nAnd that ultimately where you can\naffect it is right here in what we call\n\n250\n00:12:21.587 --> 00:12:24.380\nthe environmental metrics instead.\n\n251\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.797\nSo when we take a look at\nthe descriptions of these,\n\n252\n00:12:26.797 --> 00:12:29.272\nI've kind of not made\nthe official definition, but\n\n253\n00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:32.268\nthis is kind of Ronnie's wordings\nof these definitions here.\n\n254\n00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:36.676\nBase metrics, vulnerability qualities\nthat do not change over time or\n\n255\n00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:38.151\nacross environments.\n\n256\n00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:41.500\nNow normally, what this means is,\nthe vendor, okay,\n\n257\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.442\nthe vendor is saying here\nis what I made this for.\n\n258\n00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:46.447\nAnd when we have something like this and\n\n259\n00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:50.642\nthey calculate out what they call their\nbase metrics, the vulnerability score on\n\n260\n00:12:50.642 --> 00:12:53.900\nthis base metric size is\nprobably not going to change.\n\n261\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.419\nSo you and\n\n262\n00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:59.450\nI are not gonna change the base metric\nitself when we start to calculating thing.\n\n263\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.666\nBut as we start adding on\nlayers of complexity to things,\n\n264\n00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:05.152\nwe're gonna see something else change it.\n\n265\n00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:09.406\nSo then we're gonna dive into what we call\nthe temporal metrics here for a moment.\n\n266\n00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:12.013\nNow in the idea of the temporal metrics,\n\n267\n00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:15.164\nvulnerabilities that change over time,\nokay?\n\n268\n00:13:15.164 --> 00:13:18.765\nNow here's kinda the key thing that\nI wanted to make sure that we got\n\n269\n00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:19.549\nacross here.\n\n270\n00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:23.548\nThis temporal metric should never\nexceed whatever the base score is.\n\n271\n00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:29.867\nSo if Daniel finds out from Microsoft and\nthey've got a CVSS score, whatever it is,\n\n272\n00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:36.190\nand now, somebody says, I've calculated\nthe temporal metric for this.\n\n273\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.310\nAnd Microsoft says it's a 7.\n\n274\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.445\nAnd whoever, we'll call him Technician X,\n\n275\n00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:46.326\nTechnician X comes to Daniel and\nsays, well, I calculated a 9.7.\n\n276\n00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.970\nWell, that's not supposed to happen, okay?\n\n277\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.640\nSo that score, the highest it should\never get is the same as the base metric.\n\n278\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.070\nAnd this is because the standard, or\n\n279\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.660\nthe default, right,\nis that this score is not defined.\n\n280\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.740\nIt's saying, look, if you don't really\nneed to change any of this stuff\n\n281\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.110\nin terms of the temporal metrics,\njust leave it at the base score, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.618\nEverything else essentially lowers it.\n\n283\n00:14:07.618 --> 00:14:09.820\nSo any time you change something\nin the temporal metrics,\n\n284\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.850\nit should lower from the base score,\nokay, is what should end up happening.\n\n285\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.898\nSo what's what we should end up seeing.\n\n286\n00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:17.109\nAnd then ultimately,\n\n287\n00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:20.752\nyour environmental metrics are where\nyou can't affect the score.\n\n288\n00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:25.581\nBecause you'll actually be able to\nmodify what is the base score in\n\n289\n00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:30.100\nterms of actually presenting\na modified base of that.\n\n290\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.253\nYou might find out that you\nactually do have some other\n\n291\n00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:37.318\nsecurity devices that are out there\nthat hey, the hardware vendor or\n\n292\n00:14:37.318 --> 00:14:40.370\nthe software vendor didn't account for.\n\n293\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.720\nSo this is where you have that\nability to change and say hey,\n\n294\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.414\neven though this is the base score of,\nlet's say, it's a 9 out of a 10, right?\n\n295\n00:14:48.414 --> 00:14:52.400\nAnd you start going, but I have this\nthat actually helps mitigate that.\n\n296\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.842\nI have this that does that.\n\n297\n00:14:53.842 --> 00:14:55.331\nI have this that reduces this.\n\n298\n00:14:55.331 --> 00:14:58.792\nWell, all of a sudden, the base score\nmay actually end up dropping for\n\n299\n00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:00.971\nyou to a point where\nit becomes manageable.\n\n300\n00:15:00.971 --> 00:15:04.482\nSo this allows you to also\nbe able to change it.\n\n301\n00:15:04.482 --> 00:15:09.426\nSo a lot of times, what we focus in on of\ncourse is the idea that the base metrics.\n\n302\n00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:13.155\nNow in terms of how these numbers\nare presented, if you go to some of\n\n303\n00:15:13.155 --> 00:15:17.430\nthe hardware vendors, they'll tell you,\nhere's the CVSS score, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:22.907\nBut you can also go to the CVSS website,\nand all the information on,\n\n305\n00:15:22.907 --> 00:15:28.640\nit's actually kept at first.org,\nokay, and CVSS here.\n\n306\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.370\nThen if I scroll over here\nto the left hand side where\n\n307\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.500\nyou see a lot of these\ndifferent things over here.\n\n308\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.834\nUnder the scoring system,\nI'm gonna select examples here, so\n\n309\n00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:42.730\nthat we can take a look at some of\nthe ways that this is specified.\n\n310\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.470\nSo let's take for an example this\nfirst one that's listed here.\n\n311\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.974\nThis is a phpMyAdmin reflected\ncross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\n312\n00:15:51.974 --> 00:15:57.062\nNotice it has a CVE number right\nhere of 2013, and then it's 1937.\n\n313\n00:15:57.062 --> 00:16:02.734\nSo this was found in 2013, and this is\nthe 1,937th one, I guess in that year.\n\n314\n00:16:02.734 --> 00:16:05.734\nYou can see the description\nof the vulnerability.\n\n315\n00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:08.833\nAnd it even gives you this\nnice description of how\n\n316\n00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:14.440\nthe attack actually occurs, and\nall of the symptoms and details behind it.\n\n317\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.704\nAnd notice that, if you read,\nit's like a cross site scripting attack.\n\n318\n00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:21.513\nAnd it says the base score is 4.3.\n\n319\n00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:26.969\nI would rate that as a ten,\nit was based on a score of ten here.\n\n320\n00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:30.266\nBut notice how they have\nthese numbered here.\n\n321\n00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:33.605\nThey actually show you what these are,\nand even that doesn't make sense,\n\n322\n00:16:33.605 --> 00:16:34.300\nright Daniel?\n\n323\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.562\nWhen it comes down to it,\nnotice it says, Network, Medium, None,\n\n324\n00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:41.086\nNone, Partial, None equals 4.3.\n\n325\n00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:43.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So go ahead Daniel, tell me how do the-\n\n326\n00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:47.229\n&gt;&gt; How do we extrapolated number out of\n\n327\n00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:48.598\nword values?\n\n328\n00:16:48.598 --> 00:16:49.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n329\n00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:51.992\nit's kind of weird algorithm that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very strange.\n\n330\n00:16:51.992 --> 00:16:56.038\n&gt;&gt; You can do something like that,\nso it's not insanely intuitive.\n\n331\n00:16:56.038 --> 00:17:00.930\nBut it can done, we're not gonna\ndo it in our head, that's the key.\n\n332\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.738\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n333\n00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:05.115\n&gt;&gt; They actually have come up with\na calculator in which we will\n\n334\n00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.692\nbe taking a look at\na little bit later on here.\n\n335\n00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:09.906\nBut you can actually see\nhere on the calculator,\n\n336\n00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:12.127\nyou take those same things\nthat they showed you.\n\n337\n00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:16.285\nAnd you just simply put in those values\nthat they give you in place, and\n\n338\n00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.707\nthat will help you out.\n\n339\n00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:21.910\nNow most of us are probably never\ngonna get that far in depth into it.\n\n340\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.219\nUnless we're preparing for something then,\nwhat might we be preparing for?\n\n341\n00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:28.961\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, it seems like there would\nbe a situation in which we would need to\n\n342\n00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:30.504\nknow new details of something.\n\n343\n00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:34.121\nSo maybe answer a series of questions\nbased off of that knowledge.\n\n344\n00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.969\nSomething like a survey, right?\n\n345\n00:17:35.969 --> 00:17:38.872\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, there's no doubt, right?\n\n346\n00:17:38.872 --> 00:17:40.535\nThe idea that we're preparing for\nthe exam.\n\n347\n00:17:40.535 --> 00:17:44.870\nSo yes, you need to know more details\nabout it than just the idea that you're\n\n348\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.330\ngonna have some score that's out there.\n\n349\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n350\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.780\nthat's what we're getting into today,\nis that you do need to know about this.\n\n351\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.510\nYou are gonna find that you're\ngonna be tested on this.\n\n352\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.530\nAnd probably a little\nmore heavily than you and\n\n353\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.500\nI would have liked to actually think here.\n\n354\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.038\nSo that's why we're taking\nthe time to go over\n\n355\n00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:03.311\nthese different things that we-\n&gt;&gt; I was just hoping that they would\n\n356\n00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:04.871\nask me that I knew that it existed.\n\n357\n00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:06.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I-\n&gt;&gt; Do you know about this, yes or\n\n358\n00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:07.248\nno, kind of thing.\n\n359\n00:18:07.248 --> 00:18:08.445\n&gt;&gt; I love those types of questions.\n\n360\n00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:10.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wish that Cisco would ask more of\n\n361\n00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:12.963\nthem, but unfortunately, they don't.\n\n362\n00:18:12.963 --> 00:18:14.286\nThey tend to actually say,\n\n363\n00:18:14.286 --> 00:18:17.398\nhey, here's this base score-\n&gt;&gt; They kind of dive into the minutiae\n\n364\n00:18:17.398 --> 00:18:18.046\ndon't they?\n\n365\n00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:21.033\n&gt;&gt; Base score, but\nhow did it come up with this calculation?\n\n366\n00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:25.398\nNow you're looking at,\nthat's what we have to dive into, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:25.398 --> 00:18:29.444\nSo right here, we're gonna take\na look at these different scores and\n\n368\n00:18:29.444 --> 00:18:32.676\nwe're going to talk about\neach one of these, Daniel.\n\n369\n00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:37.525\nOf the different factors that go into\nmaking up what we call this idea of\n\n370\n00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:38.685\nour base score.\n\n371\n00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:41.789\nNow let's go ahead and\ndive right into that for right now and\n\n372\n00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:43.910\nsee what happens here.\n\n373\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.330\nAll right, so at the very beginning when\nwe start talking about calculating this\n\n374\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.230\nidea of the base metrics, right?\n\n375\n00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.690\nKeep in mind the terminology\nthat I'm using here.\n\n376\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.350\nAnd I think that this will help you out,\nespecially when having to decide\n\n377\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.878\na lot of times over multiple\nvalues that they give you and\n\n378\n00:19:01.878 --> 00:19:05.056\nyou'll see questions like this as well,\nright?\n\n379\n00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:12.070\nVulnerability qualities that do not change\nover time or across environments, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.432\nSo when we start to calculate\nsomething like this, right?\n\n381\n00:19:15.432 --> 00:19:19.273\nWe're actually saying, all right,\nthings that don't change over time and\n\n382\n00:19:19.273 --> 00:19:21.461\ndon't change because of the environment,\n\n383\n00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:25.528\nthat is actually where we're gonna\nactually find those basic metrics.\n\n384\n00:19:25.528 --> 00:19:28.680\nWe're going to see that\nthe base score though,\n\n385\n00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.730\nis actually gonna to be calculated\nover two different types of metrics.\n\n386\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.220\nOne of course, is what we call\nour exploitability metrics.\n\n387\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.713\nAnd this really is about what component\nis actually going to be well,\n\n388\n00:19:42.713 --> 00:19:44.114\nvulnerable, okay?\n\n389\n00:19:44.114 --> 00:19:46.723\nNow, that component can be anything,\nit can be a web application.\n\n390\n00:19:46.723 --> 00:19:49.003\nIt can be a hardware piece,\nit can be software.\n\n391\n00:19:49.003 --> 00:19:51.347\nIt can be operating system, you name it.\n\n392\n00:19:51.347 --> 00:19:56.080\nWe're actually taking a look at that and\nwe are going to talk about these different\n\n393\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.471\nattack vectors, complexities,\nprivileges required to actually use that\n\n394\n00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:04.468\nparticular vulnerability, and\neven the idea of user interaction.\n\n395\n00:20:04.468 --> 00:20:09.359\nNow we have to also think about a couple\nof other things along with this too,\n\n396\n00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:13.412\nwhich is the idea of what we'll\ncall impact metrics instead.\n\n397\n00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:15.347\nImpact metrics surround well, what?\n\n398\n00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:16.096\nLook at that.\n\n399\n00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:18.249\nDoes that look familiar to you, Daniel?\n\n400\n00:20:18.249 --> 00:20:21.597\nConfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n401\n00:20:21.597 --> 00:20:22.590\n&gt;&gt; The iron triangle.\n\n402\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.392\n&gt;&gt; The iron triangle here, right?\n\n403\n00:20:24.392 --> 00:20:27.531\nThe very fact that they're saying,\nhey, what's the impact?\n\n404\n00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:33.056\nWell we don't measure the impact in\nterms of it broke this, you can.\n\n405\n00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:36.117\nBut what they're saying as\nfar as a vulnerability goes,\n\n406\n00:20:36.117 --> 00:20:40.197\nif it kind of affects what we believe\nhere, are certain things like the goals\n\n407\n00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:43.500\nthat we are supposed to be\nable to achieve with us.\n\n408\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.345\nNow, there's one other element,\nI hid on purpose which is down here.\n\n409\n00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At the bottom, okay.\n\n410\n00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:51.258\nAnd that is what we call a Scope.\n\n411\n00:20:51.258 --> 00:20:56.230\nNow notice I actually fed this in as\na dotted line at this point, okay?\n\n412\n00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.560\nBut those are the three\ndifferent types of metrics\n\n413\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.840\nthat we are actually gonna\ntake to look at here.\n\n414\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.433\nVulnerability, impact, as well as scope\nare gonna feed into us being able to\n\n415\n00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.777\nachieve these different base scores.\n\n416\n00:21:08.777 --> 00:21:12.099\nAnd we'll show you how all of\nthis stuff fits together, and\n\n417\n00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:16.089\nhopefully by the end of the episode,\nyou'll be able to kind of help us or\n\n418\n00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:18.097\nactually be able to help yourself.\n\n419\n00:21:18.097 --> 00:21:18.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Taking a look at\n\n420\n00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:20.025\nwhatever's presented to you.\n\n421\n00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:22.387\nYou go, yeah, that's a CVSS score and\n\n422\n00:21:22.387 --> 00:21:25.844\nhere is what this means and\nwe'll be able to do that, right?\n\n423\n00:21:25.844 --> 00:21:27.801\nSo that's where we're gonna be at and\n\n424\n00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:31.852\nwe're gonna take a look at attack vector\nand attack complexity for right now.\n\n425\n00:21:31.852 --> 00:21:36.055\nAnd then we'll see how much time we have\nleft as I continue to jabber on here,\n\n426\n00:21:36.055 --> 00:21:36.719\nall right?\n\n427\n00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:41.216\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of attack vector, okay?\n\n428\n00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.445\nThe key question here is fairly simple.\n\n429\n00:21:43.445 --> 00:21:48.264\nIn terms of attack vector, what is\nthe context of the vulnerability exploit?\n\n430\n00:21:48.264 --> 00:21:52.134\nOkay, now I wrote that question and\nI'm saying what is that about?\n\n431\n00:21:52.134 --> 00:21:55.050\nWhat is the context of\nthe vulnerability exploit?\n\n432\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.402\nWell when you start asking a question\nlike that you're actually going to get\n\n433\n00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:02.850\nyou know a couple of\ndifferent answers here, okay?\n\n434\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.521\nSo depending on how someone actually\nattacked here in your attack\n\n435\n00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:07.531\nvector, right?\n\n436\n00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:13.009\nThe path that they kinda come in,\nis it a network based attack?\n\n437\n00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:15.201\nIn other words,\ndid they exploit through layer 3?\n\n438\n00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:17.683\nThat's kinda the easiest idea behind that.\n\n439\n00:22:17.683 --> 00:22:21.541\nWell, did it come across the router and\nit got into my system?\n\n440\n00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:25.875\nWell if it did, we give it\na score of network up here, okay?\n\n441\n00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:27.489\nNow you say, what?\n\n442\n00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:28.551\nThe score of network?\n\n443\n00:22:28.551 --> 00:22:29.773\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\n444\n00:22:29.773 --> 00:22:32.180\nWell that's the way it's gonna be for\nright now, and\n\n445\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.813\nwe'll see how it translates\na little bit later on, okay?\n\n446\n00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:39.228\nSo if you're actually saying this\nparticular type of vulnerability right\n\n447\n00:22:39.228 --> 00:22:41.618\nhere, it's going to give me a layer 3.\n\n448\n00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:44.376\nWhere I have to come across\nthe network through layer 3.\n\n449\n00:22:44.376 --> 00:22:46.028\nThat's actually gonna happen that way.\n\n450\n00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:50.015\nSo let's kind of give an example of\nsomething like this, Daniel, for\n\n451\n00:22:50.015 --> 00:22:50.699\nright now.\n\n452\n00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:53.296\nLet's say, for example,\na phishing attack, right?\n\n453\n00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:57.659\nSo somebody outside my organization\nsends you an email that's says, Daniel,\n\n454\n00:22:57.659 --> 00:23:01.513\nI've got money waiting for you,\nif you'll just reply to this email.\n\n455\n00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.214\n&gt;&gt; I can't hit reply fast enough [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:23:03.214 --> 00:23:07.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It comes from outside the\norganization, so obviously it passed what?\n\n457\n00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, through all of our\nsecurity systems from the Internet.\n\n458\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.889\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat's actually a good example of yeah,\n\n459\n00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:16.196\nthat can be something like that, okay?\n\n460\n00:23:16.196 --> 00:23:21.585\nSo it makes sense in that way, let's talk\nabout this idea of an adjacent one, okay?\n\n461\n00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:23.491\nNow this is where the terminology for me,\n\n462\n00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:26.826\nI don't know this because they're\nusing international terminology.\n\n463\n00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:30.550\nI didn't quite get this, but\nhere's a way that it's described.\n\n464\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.281\nLimited to the same physical or\nlogical network.\n\n465\n00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.782\nFor me, when I start thinking\nabout within the same [CROSSTALK]\n\n466\n00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:37.210\n&gt;&gt; So it's just a LAN, yeah.\n\n467\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Same LAN, same VLAN.\n\n468\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.819\nAnd that makes sense, but the adjacent,\nI always think about the LAN next to me.\n\n469\n00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:45.771\nI don't know why [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n\n470\n00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:48.162\n&gt;&gt; I guess we're side by side on\nthe same network, that's what it means.\n\n471\n00:23:48.162 --> 00:23:51.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's what\nthey actually meaning, but for\n\n472\n00:23:51.228 --> 00:23:54.169\nme when I thought I was like,\nI think one network next to\n\n473\n00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:56.753\nanother network\n&gt;&gt; I mean think of a switch that could\n\n474\n00:23:56.753 --> 00:23:58.918\nliterally be the adjacent port-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n475\n00:23:58.918 --> 00:23:59.578\n&gt;&gt; And we are on the VLAN.\n\n476\n00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:01.880\n&gt;&gt; And I think that that's\nwhat they really do mean.\n\n477\n00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you've got it spot on,\n\n478\n00:24:03.298 --> 00:24:05.907\nRonnie's mind kind of was\nnot working that way.\n\n479\n00:24:05.907 --> 00:24:07.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It wanders to and fro.\n\n480\n00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:09.933\n&gt;&gt; And then I started saying,\nif we're in VLAN,\n\n481\n00:24:09.933 --> 00:24:13.060\nI do have to go across a router\nlayer three device to get there.\n\n482\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.025\nSo then that would be network.\n\n483\n00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:16.900\nSo I got a little bit more.\n\n484\n00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.630\nNow notice that local,\naccording to the CVSS itself,\n\n485\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.640\ndoes not bound to essentially networking.\n\n486\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.780\nNow, what in the world are we\ntalking about at this point?\n\n487\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.960\nWell, we're no longer talking about\n\n488\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.430\nexploit were you have to be attached\nto a network in some way at this point.\n\n489\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.703\nSo like adjacent we could be\non the same wireless network.\n\n490\n00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:36.902\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so same bluetooth?\n\n491\n00:24:36.902 --> 00:24:38.563\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, okay.\n\n492\n00:24:38.563 --> 00:24:41.648\nWith local, I could just\nsimply do something like this,\n\n493\n00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:43.255\nall right, Daniel-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n494\n00:24:43.255 --> 00:24:43.835\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n495\n00:24:43.835 --> 00:24:48.660\nThe universal symbol of-\n&gt;&gt; Use the USB key I\n\n496\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.267\nfound it in the parking lot.\n\n497\n00:24:50.267 --> 00:24:51.510\nIt's a terabyte drive, man.\n\n498\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.229\nFreebie.\n\n499\n00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:52.953\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n500\n00:24:52.953 --> 00:24:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\n501\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.658\n&gt;&gt; There it is, Daniel.\n\n502\n00:24:55.658 --> 00:24:58.508\nI get a bunch of USB keys\nthat look exactly the same,\n\n503\n00:24:58.508 --> 00:25:00.910\nand I just drop them on everybody's desk.\n\n504\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.010\nYeah, there you go.\n\n505\n00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.560\nI bypassed the network layer, right?\n\n506\n00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.810\nWe're not networking.\n\n507\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.510\nI didn't have to worry about you\njumping on a wireless network at all.\n\n508\n00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.310\nSo there it is.\n\n509\n00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.050\nLocal is something like that.\n\n510\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.510\nSo if somebody can do something\nlike that that makes sense.\n\n511\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.043\nNow, Daniel, what if I have to\nget access to your keyboard.\n\n512\n00:25:18.043 --> 00:25:19.740\nThat's the physical.\n\n513\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.750\nSo if I need access to that physical\nmachine, then at that point, okay,\n\n514\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.690\nthen something else has to go on.\n\n515\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.510\n&gt;&gt; So social engineering would\nprobably apply to that one.\n\n516\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, social engineering.\n\n517\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.660\nThat's a good example\nof something like that.\n\n518\n00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.675\nBut me, just running off with your laptop.\n\n519\n00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.190\n[LAUGH] I grab your laptop, and I run.\n\n520\n00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Snatch [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Snatch it right out of there.\n\n521\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.972\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like hey, look, it's Elvis.\n\n522\n00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:43.050\nAnd then you he'd tell you,\nhe does it all the time.\n\n523\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all of this essentially\njust tells you something about where\n\n524\n00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:48.112\nthe attacker is located, right?\n\n525\n00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:52.740\nSo the system and the way that it scores\nit, the CVSS scores it, is simple,\n\n526\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.580\nand I have it right down here.\n\n527\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.820\nThe remoteness of the attacker\nincreases the score.\n\n528\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.680\nSo the further away the attacker is,\nor the farther away he is.\n\n529\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.850\nPhysically farther away, or further,\n\n530\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.710\nlogically, different LANs,\ndifferent networks here.\n\n531\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.470\nThen what we're actually gonna\nsee is that that score increases.\n\n532\n00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.770\nSo there's a couple ways where you can\nthink about that, and that's the key.\n\n533\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.835\nWhenever you take a vulnerability and\n\n534\n00:26:17.835 --> 00:26:20.609\nif it can be exploited either\nthrough the network or\n\n535\n00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:24.951\ndoes it have to have access into my\nbuilding, actually at the computer itself?\n\n536\n00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:29.298\nWell, then that means they've gotten\na lot farther than they think but\n\n537\n00:26:29.298 --> 00:26:33.220\nat the same time they aren't as remote and\nso the score is lower.\n\n538\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.470\nIn terms of the philosophical\nterm of remoteness.\n\n539\n00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.030\n&gt;&gt; The right remoteness.\n\n540\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.440\nI couldn't think of another term.\n\n541\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.850\nI was just-\n&gt;&gt; I think that is apropos.\n\n542\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:43.850\nThat is very nice.\n\n543\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.640\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to think of it.\n\n544\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.130\nI don't know another word for this.\n\n545\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.320\nRemoteness will work here.\n\n546\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.410\nSo that makes sense, right?\n\n547\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's a fairly simple way to determine\n\n548\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:58.360\na particular score that we see, is right\nthere at the idea of the attack vector.\n\n549\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.562\nSo you also want to pay\nattention right here to\n\n550\n00:27:01.562 --> 00:27:05.198\nthese terms that are also\ninside the parenthesis.\n\n551\n00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:05.801\n&gt;&gt; NALP.\n\n552\n00:27:05.801 --> 00:27:06.336\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n553\n00:27:06.336 --> 00:27:11.670\nThat is the abbreviation for\nthe scoring system that we have.\n\n554\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:17.670\nAnd hopefully then, I know it’s been a\nlong time but Daniel if I go back to this.\n\n555\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.505\nYou're now starting to see\na couple of different things here.\n\n556\n00:27:22.505 --> 00:27:24.980\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\nnetwork.\n\n557\n00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.740\n&gt;&gt; Daniel,\nyou have just keyed it right in there.\n\n558\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.479\nNotice that.\nThere you are, you have now officially,\n\n559\n00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:31.730\nyou're now.\n\n560\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.589\n&gt;&gt; I'm on my way.\n\n561\n00:27:32.589 --> 00:27:36.270\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n562\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.940\nSo, that's starting to make sense here.\n\n563\n00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.960\nThere it is.\nAttack vector is now network.\n\n564\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.870\nNow let's go on to this\nidea of complexity here for\n\n565\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:50.700\njust a moment if we can to make sure that\nwe also understand this one too, okay?\n\n566\n00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.974\nNow when we get into attack complexity,\n\n567\n00:27:53.974 --> 00:27:59.847\nthe question that you want to ask as\nyou're facing something like this,\n\n568\n00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:04.199\ncan the attacker exploit\nthe vulnerability at will.\n\n569\n00:28:04.199 --> 00:28:09.140\nAnd that actually is a very good\nquestion period, all right?\n\n570\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.890\nWhen you're facing a vulnerability,\n\n571\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.160\ncan the attacker attack\nit anytime he wants to?\n\n572\n00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.040\nWell, you're gonna actually get a low\nrating here if the answer is yes.\n\n573\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.981\nI kinda put that backward.\n\n574\n00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:25.020\nI didn't mean to do that, that was just me\ntyping very quickly is what happened here.\n\n575\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.996\nYou're gonna give it a low rating.\n\n576\n00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:28.805\nThat means he doesn't really\nhave to actually do much.\n\n577\n00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:31.952\nHe can actually say this\nis a fairly simple attack.\n\n578\n00:28:31.952 --> 00:28:36.190\nI can go ahead and exploit this system.\n\n579\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.057\nSo, when we start talking about\nsomething like that it could be that\n\n580\n00:28:39.057 --> 00:28:41.037\nthey already have\nprivileges on the network.\n\n581\n00:28:41.037 --> 00:28:45.900\nThere are particular complexity\nlevel may do that for them.\n\n582\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.753\nBut remember, all of this is\nkind of combined together, so\n\n583\n00:28:48.753 --> 00:28:51.720\nif their attack vectors is network,\nit might not ever be low,\n\n584\n00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.621\ndepending on how you have stuff set up.\n\n585\n00:28:53.621 --> 00:28:58.335\nBut you might end up finding out that it\nis low because it didn't require anything.\n\n586\n00:28:58.335 --> 00:29:01.434\nThey just had to send an email,\nand that was pretty much it.\n\n587\n00:29:01.434 --> 00:29:03.370\nAnd that's not really complex.\n\n588\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.073\nI mean, I think my daughter can send\nan email, and probably your daughters go,\n\n589\n00:29:07.073 --> 00:29:07.694\npress here.\n\n590\n00:29:07.694 --> 00:29:08.589\nPress send.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n591\n00:29:08.589 --> 00:29:09.588\n&gt;&gt; Your daughter can send an email.\n\n592\n00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:10.365\n&gt;&gt; But she's three.\n\n593\n00:29:10.365 --> 00:29:11.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's three.\n\n594\n00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:14.489\nMine's 16, so-\n&gt;&gt; She has a little more wherewithal.\n\n595\n00:29:14.489 --> 00:29:17.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can still see this.\n\n596\n00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:23.269\nNow if snow, more than likely,\nit says that the attacker\n\n597\n00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:28.990\nneeds something else or\nsomeone else to make it work.\n\n598\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.805\nSo this is now where it\nbecomes more complex,\n\n599\n00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:36.338\nit is situations that are beyond their\ncontrol that they need to happen.\n\n600\n00:29:36.338 --> 00:29:40.559\nLike an eclipse happening, no we're not\ntalking about the idea of an eclipse but\n\n601\n00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.935\nyou get the idea, right?\n\n602\n00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:44.050\nCertain things have to be in place.\n\n603\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.260\nIt might be a time of day\nin which they realized\n\n604\n00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.880\nthat there's a change going on or that.\n\n605\n00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.170\n&gt;&gt; A service has to be run-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n606\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.003\n&gt;&gt; Service has to be running, yeah.\n\n607\n00:29:52.003 --> 00:29:55.183\nSo something like that where as\nyou start seeing this, right?\n\n608\n00:29:55.183 --> 00:29:58.868\nThe attack complexity of something, right,\n\n609\n00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:05.370\nit increases if you don't need as much\nto actually make the attack work.\n\n610\n00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.000\nThat again makes sense in\nthe vulnerability right, you get a higher\n\n611\n00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.930\nvulnerability if somebody doesn't\nneed to work hard to make it happen.\n\n612\n00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:18.150\nSo these are kind of two of the basic ones\nthat we've been talking about so far.\n\n613\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.025\nAnd we still got a couple more to go\nin terms of vulnerability exploits or\n\n614\n00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:23.972\nexploitable metrics that we have.\n\n615\n00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:27.537\nBut Daniel, once again I've realized\nsomething as I look over at the wall.\n\n616\n00:30:27.537 --> 00:30:29.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have talked a lot.\n\n617\n00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:30.114\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n618\n00:30:30.114 --> 00:30:31.179\n&gt;&gt; And that means I've run out of time.\n\n619\n00:30:31.179 --> 00:30:32.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've run out of time.\n\n620\n00:30:32.166 --> 00:30:36.050\nBut this was a really good stopping spot\nfor us because now you can just kind of\n\n621\n00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.450\nmarinate in the knowledge that you\nhave acquired as of right now and\n\n622\n00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.140\nthen come back for part two and\ngather a little more.\n\n623\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.964\nWe don't wanna overwhelm you with too\nmuch information right off the bat.\n\n624\n00:30:44.964 --> 00:30:47.589\nSo, this is, like I said,\na really good stopping spot for us.\n\n625\n00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:50.709\nRonnie, fantastic job of explaining this,\nI'm totally getting it.\n\n626\n00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:53.385\nI think that our audience out there\nis totally getting it as well,\n\n627\n00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:54.855\nbecause you're doing a great job.\n\n628\n00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:58.028\nWe thank you for your time, and effort and\nlook forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n629\n00:30:58.028 --> 00:31:00.530\nLook forward to seeing you\ngood folks out there as well,\n\n630\n00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.726\nbut as for this one,\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n631\n00:31:02.726 --> 00:31:05.316\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n632\n00:31:05.316 --> 00:31:06.314\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n633\n00:31:06.314 --> 00:31:08.767\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n634\n00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:14.746\n[MUSIC]\n\n635\n00:31:14.746 --> 00:31:21.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.797\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:13.517\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.255\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.246\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:21.986\nwe're back with more in\nour Cisco Sec Ops series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:26.378\nAnd joining us to continue our\nconversation on CVSS scoring,\n\n9\n00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:29.510\nvery cool stuff,\nby our man Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.298\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.750\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.067\nOnce again thank you for\nhaving me back on the show as we\n\n13\n00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:39.552\ncontinue to take a look at\nthis idea of the CVSS scoring.\n\n14\n00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:44.400\nAnd last episode, we kind of got started\nand maybe made a little headway into\n\n15\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.945\nunderstanding what the scoring is about\nand how it helps a little bit and\n\n16\n00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:53.716\nwe dive into some of the different metrics\nthat are used to help us determine\n\n17\n00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:54.810\nthe base score.\n\n18\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.396\nWe got through, of course, attack vectors\nand we talked about attack complexity.\n\n19\n00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:02.124\nWe now need to continue to move forward.\n\n20\n00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:06.379\nWe want to talk about each one and then\nwe'll kinda describe what's actually gonna\n\n21\n00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.978\ngo on in the base metric overall and\nwhat we're talking about as well.\n\n22\n00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:14.700\nAll right, so let's go ahead and just\npick up from where we left off last time.\n\n23\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.480\nAnd that will help us out as we need.\n\n24\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.431\nLet me see if I can move that over just a\nlittle bit so we don't have to do as much.\n\n25\n00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.111\nIt's only as good as I can get for\nright there but\n\n26\n00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.820\nthat'll help us a little bit more here,\nokay?\n\n27\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.040\nSo not only do we have attack vector and\nattack complexity,\n\n28\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960\nwe also need to talk about this idea\nof the privileges that are required for\n\n29\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.570\nthe vulnerability to take place.\n\n30\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.000\nSo this is where we can ask kinda\nthe base question that we need to,\n\n31\n00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.400\nto understand this apart of\nthe vulnerability, what, excuse me,\n\n32\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.660\nmust the attacker be authorized for\nthe exploit to essentially occur, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.880\nNow that's actually a really\ngood question as well.\n\n34\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.950\nThere's a lot of times where\nmost of the things that you and\n\n35\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.620\nI think about right,\nthey require elevated privileges.\n\n36\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.199\nNow Daniel back in the days of XP, right?\n\n37\n00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:05.660\nWay back in the days of XP\non your own home machine.\n\n38\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.300\nDid you log in as a regular user or\n\n39\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.238\ndid you log in as\nthe administrator all the time?\n\n40\n00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.298\n&gt;&gt; I, like most people back in the day,\nlogged in as administrator.\n\n41\n00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:19.318\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Daniel, just in case\nwe have some people that may not have\n\n42\n00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:21.529\nactually experienced that idea of XP,\n\n43\n00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.022\nbefore the days of the cool UAC,\neverybody loves doing UAC.\n\n44\n00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fantastic.\n\n45\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.614\n&gt;&gt; Back before that point, Daniel, what\nwere the issues behind just staying logged\n\n46\n00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:32.800\nin as an administrator all the time?\n\n47\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Well the issues were anything that\nyou ran, you ran as an administrator.\n\n48\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.268\nTherefore, if someone were to try\nsome sort of attack vector and\n\n49\n00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:42.017\nthey gained access in some\nway to execute something,\n\n50\n00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:45.622\nit would execute with administrative\nprivileges, basically giving\n\n51\n00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:49.245\nthem the keys to the kingdom,\nallowing them to do whatever they want.\n\n52\n00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is kind of weird.\n\n53\n00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:55.096\nWe've moved away from that with\nthe advent of the UAC coming on.\n\n54\n00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:59.276\nIn Vista and Windows 7, and\nwhatever edition we're on right now.\n\n55\n00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Seven went to, no, eight.\n\n56\n00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:03.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.930\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, I skipped some numbers here.\n\n58\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.044\nSeven went to eight, but we skipped\nnine and not we're in Windows 10,\n\n59\n00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:12.390\nat least as of the recording\nof this show for right now.\n\n60\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.319\nAll of these have that UAC,\nthat user account control,\n\n61\n00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.260\nwhich limits us what Daniel\nwas talking about, right?\n\n62\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.054\nYou and I no longer stay logged on to the\ncomputer essentially as the administrator\n\n63\n00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:30.001\ngiving whatever is running on that machine\nat the time that my account is connected.\n\n64\n00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.321\nSays, have full access to everything,\nokay?\n\n65\n00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:38.198\nSo if a malware gets on the computer and\nit runs because Ronnie was kind of\n\n66\n00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:43.410\nanxious and clicked on an email\nattachment, and incited it to run.\n\n67\n00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.680\nWell, we now get that nice UAC prompt,\nas much as we don't like it.\n\n68\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.030\nWe get that prompt that says, hey,\nare you sure you want to run this?\n\n69\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.040\nAnd of course you can say yes,\nand that will allow it to run.\n\n70\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.710\nBut normally,\nit's actually an indication that hey,\n\n71\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.880\nyou're not logged in as a user\nthat can actually run this.\n\n72\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.180\nSo that's something that we\nalso want to understand, but\n\n73\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.600\nthere are exploits that may\nbe out there that do not\n\n74\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.900\nrequire any authorization for\nan exploit to take place.\n\n75\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.969\nSo if you do have something like that,\n\n76\n00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.989\nwell then you would actually end up\ngetting a score of what is called none.\n\n77\n00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.571\nNow this one I forgot to actually put\nthe little abbreviation here, which\n\n78\n00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:29.460\nis actually gonna be an N, is what that\none's actually going to be here, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.330\nNow, when you have something like that,\n\n80\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.380\nmost of the time, it's not really\nan exploit that we worry about too much,\n\n81\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.660\nbecause it's limitation is probably\nwithin that one program and so\n\n82\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.950\nit's like all right we're gonna adjust\nthis program to where it doesn't work.\n\n83\n00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.805\nIt says, hey, I've got access to this and\nthat's pretty much about it.\n\n84\n00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.766\nBut normally,\nyou don't see a lot of this, right?\n\n85\n00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:55.056\nA lot of times, of course,\nexploitations that end up happening,\n\n86\n00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:58.591\nnormally do need almost\nadministrative privileges.\n\n87\n00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:00.739\nAnd this is the other key thing here, too.\n\n88\n00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:04.728\nIf it requires you to elevate\nthe privileges, it's probably not saying,\n\n89\n00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:06.070\njust elevate it to here.\n\n90\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.904\nIt's probably saying,\nI want access to what, the kernel?\n\n91\n00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:12.608\nI want access to everything on that\nsystem that we go across here.\n\n92\n00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:17.978\nSo if the attacker does need admin\nprivileges to make that exploit happen,\n\n93\n00:05:17.978 --> 00:05:20.887\nthen that's actually going to be a yes.\n\n94\n00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:26.202\nOkay, and if that's actually\ntrue at that particular point,\n\n95\n00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:29.460\nyou actually score a low or a L.\n\n96\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.641\nNow if that's not true and\nit doesn't need admin privileges to run,\n\n97\n00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:37.750\nbut it needs some elevated privileges,\nthen you can score a an H, or\n\n98\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.147\na no, if you actually answer a no here.\n\n99\n00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:42.653\nSo, this is where it gets tricky,\nDaniel, right?\n\n100\n00:05:42.653 --> 00:05:47.018\nWe have none, we have high,\nand we have low.\n\n101\n00:05:47.018 --> 00:05:48.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:48.017 --> 00:05:51.529\n&gt;&gt; None and High seem to kind of indicate\nthe same thing, but and really no,\n\n103\n00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.696\nnone is just saying look,\nwe're not really gonna measure this,\n\n104\n00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:58.289\nwe're just saying that's not actually\nsomething we wanna account for.\n\n105\n00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.899\n&gt;&gt; I would almost say NA would've been\na better score for it instead of just N.\n\n106\n00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.803\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what I would say too,\nbut that's the way that they have it, so\n\n107\n00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:07.998\nthat's what we're gonna use.\n\n108\n00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:08.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they didn't ask me.\n\n109\n00:06:08.797 --> 00:06:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n110\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.738\n&gt;&gt; Either cuz I wasn't there, so.\n\n111\n00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:11.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n112\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.139\nin this particular instance here right,\nwhat we want to make sure that we\n\n113\n00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.650\nunderstand right is that we have\nthe the L or the age or none.\n\n114\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.060\nAnd this is gonna become a little\nbit trickier at certain parts\n\n115\n00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.090\nof some of the information\nthat we get here.\n\n116\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.943\nCuz we're gonna end up finding out that\nsometimes you're gonna see that, that N,\n\n117\n00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:37.863\nokay, that gives us none is actually gonna\nbe what like I said not actually accounted\n\n118\n00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:41.358\nfor at all, or the very fact that\nwe have a yes or a no, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:44.126\nIf it's actually doing\nsomething like that, well then,\n\n120\n00:06:44.126 --> 00:06:48.140\nwe are actually going to evaluate\nthose a little bit differently, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.750\nSo notice here how the base\nscore is now increased, right?\n\n122\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.490\nThe less privileges that's needed for\nexploiting at this point, that means for\n\n123\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.284\nus, it's gonna get another higher score,\nokay?\n\n124\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.490\nSo the higher the score then,\nthe more vulnerable that we're having.\n\n125\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.113\nAnd that makes sense, right?\n\n126\n00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:07.911\nIf the attacker doesn't have to be\nauthorized for an attack to take place,\n\n127\n00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.951\nwell, that means he doesn't have to go\nthrough at least another level to try and\n\n128\n00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:14.640\nfigure out how this ends up working.\n\n129\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.248\nSo it really is something like that about\nthe idea the privileges that are required\n\n130\n00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:22.876\nfor a certain type of attack or\na certain type of exploit to go on.\n\n131\n00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:28.540\nSo now we have attack vector,\nwe have the attack complexity.\n\n132\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.040\nWe now understand the idea\nof the privileges required,\n\n133\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.139\nnow we have to ask another question\nhere under User Interaction.\n\n134\n00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.778\nThis is something that was added\nin specifically inside 3.0 and\n\n135\n00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:43.396\nas far as the CVSS.\n\n136\n00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.763\nAnd it may be that, I'm trying to\nremember, it may be that privileges\n\n137\n00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:50.860\nrequired was also added and they had\nit kinda under another category here.\n\n138\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.122\nBut now they're actually\npointing this out or\n\n139\n00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:55.855\nseparating it out into two\nlarger categories instead.\n\n140\n00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:59.372\nI think it used to be access control when\nyou actually did all of this together.\n\n141\n00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:01.952\nBut they separated it out\ncuz they wanted to This for\n\n142\n00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:04.954\nus to actually understand there\nare two different things.\n\n143\n00:08:04.954 --> 00:08:08.490\nDoes the attacker require another\nuser to perform the attack?\n\n144\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:14.250\nNow that's a little bit more unusual here,\nwhen we start to think about this idea.\n\n145\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.930\nNow this actually happens\nto do wath is it required.\n\n146\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.820\nAnd that's the key term here.\n\n147\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.750\nAnd that's why if it\nrequires another user well,\n\n148\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.700\nthen we actually will give\nit a score of an R, or\n\n149\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.840\nif no then we'll say an N here, or none,\nis what actually we'll give it a score of.\n\n150\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.630\nSo when you start to take a look at this,\n\n151\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.810\nwhat is this one actually about\nthen when you take a look here?\n\n152\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.710\nWell what they're saying is,\n\n153\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.130\ndoes it need somebody else's\ncredentials to actually end up working?\n\n154\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.044\nYou get access to\na particular application.\n\n155\n00:08:50.044 --> 00:08:52.729\nDoes it require another service\nto make it actually work and\n\n156\n00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:54.400\ndo everything else that it needs to?\n\n157\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.290\nNow there's an important other element\nthat make it to actually work, or\n\n158\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.900\ncan this thing be standalone and\n\n159\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.130\nit can operate on its own without\nneeding any other thing to happen.\n\n160\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.460\nSo when you start to,\nI'm trying to think of a good example.\n\n161\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.230\nSomething like a logic bomb right\nwhere somebody sets it for this time,\n\n162\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.740\nbut Daniel has to log on\nbefore it actually happens.\n\n163\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.440\nWell, I don't have to worry about it.\n\n164\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.450\nI already set it.\n\n165\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.410\nIt's there.\n\n166\n00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.750\nIt's just waiting for\nDaniel to log on, or is waiting for\n\n167\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.750\nDaniel to enter in his password.\n\n168\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.650\nOr for\nDaniel to access this particular file.\n\n169\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.760\nWell, I am now requiring another user\nto interact with whatever exploit\n\n170\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.360\nthat I'm actually running, to make sure\nthat the vulnerability ends up happening.\n\n171\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.190\nSo, any one of these,\nall of this is starting to sound logical.\n\n172\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.909\nIt's not super complex.\n\n173\n00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:44.056\nWe all understand what's going on.\n\n174\n00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:46.298\nBut at this particular point,\nwhen we start seeing it,\n\n175\n00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:48.420\nall of it's going to combine together.\n\n176\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.620\nTo give us, hopefully what we need to\nunderstand this a little bit more.\n\n177\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.230\nSo those are kind of the four big ones\n\n178\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.960\nthat we want to pay\nattention to right here.\n\n179\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.750\nThe Attack Vector, the Attack Complexity,\nthe Privilege Required and\n\n180\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.380\nthe User Interaction, all of those\n\n181\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.620\nare really about the Vulnerability\nComponents that are in place.\n\n182\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.470\nAnd these kind of set up that\nExploitability Metric that we have.\n\n183\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.458\nI want you to make sure\nthat you associate,\n\n184\n00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:21.282\nand you understand that these four\nare the Exploitability Metrics.\n\n185\n00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:25.500\nSo, since I can't tell you\nwhat's actually on the exam,\n\n186\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.233\nI can tell you though that you need\nto make sure that you understand\n\n187\n00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:34.992\nthat if they say, what category\ndoes Attack Vectors come under.\n\n188\n00:10:34.992 --> 00:10:39.790\nIt's not gonna be under\nAttack Vectors as a category.\n\n189\n00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.480\nIt's gonna be under\nExploitability Metrics.\n\n190\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.580\nThese are things you should be able to\npay attention to and understand as well.\n\n191\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.330\nAlso make sure you,\nI wish I could make it any easier.\n\n192\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:56.152\nBut you do have to pay attention to\nthe scoring numbers that are here.\n\n193\n00:10:56.152 --> 00:10:57.630\nIt's gonna become important,\n\n194\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.740\nespecially if you happen to\nsee something like this again.\n\n195\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.360\nSo Daniel, let's just kinda be\nhypothetical here for a moment.\n\n196\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.540\nSo if I were to show you a score\nlike this, Daniel, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.996\nAnd I were to say according to the score,\n\n198\n00:11:11.996 --> 00:11:16.581\nthe privilege required\nindicates what is the score.\n\n199\n00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:17.778\n&gt;&gt; It is low.\n\n200\n00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.116\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is low.\n\n201\n00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.418\nThat's easy enough.\n\n202\n00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:23.517\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hypothetically, you should be able to\n\n203\n00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.370\ndo something like this if you were\nto look at a score like this.\n\n204\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.383\nYeah, it makes sense, right?\n\n205\n00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:32.855\nSo it's not out of the realm\nof possibility that you'll see\n\n206\n00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:34.562\nsomething like this.\n\n207\n00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:36.320\nSo just kind of making sure.\n\n208\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.880\nAnd just by me showing you\nthis example and telling you,\n\n209\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.860\nhey, here's what I would be sure of,\nit's not telling you anything on the exam.\n\n210\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.630\nBut it's saying you gotta know what?\n\n211\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.775\nIf you don't know those letters,\nif you don't know that scoring,\n\n212\n00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:48.943\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n213\n00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:49.662\n&gt;&gt; You're right,\n\n214\n00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:53.217\nit's just like when you showed us this at\nthe very beginning of the first episode.\n\n215\n00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:56.244\nWe were just looking at this and go wow,\nthat's a very interesting string of\n\n216\n00:11:56.244 --> 00:11:58.343\ncomplex numbers with a bunch\nof colons around them.\n\n217\n00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.472\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what the heck is going on\n\n218\n00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:03.422\nhere, but now that we have some\ninsight on how the scoring is done.\n\n219\n00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:06.650\nWe should be able to dissect this and\nfigure it out.\n\n220\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.790\n&gt;&gt; I think that is a good\ndeduction- [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.550\n&gt;&gt; for you Daniel,\n\n222\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.510\nto actually be able to make as you take\na look at the information that were given.\n\n223\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.400\nSo, at this point,\nlet me go back to our diagram, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.310\nSo, remember that we still need to take\na look at impact metrics which we'll\n\n225\n00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.610\ndefinitely get to.\n\n226\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.810\nBut we also need to look at this idea\nof scope here for just a brief moment.\n\n227\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.870\nScope is a little bit tricky\nthe first time that we talk about it,\n\n228\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.680\nbecause we don't understand\nthe whole concept and idea.\n\n229\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.890\nIt sounds easy enough to say,\nhere's the affected area.\n\n230\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.800\nBut scope is not measured in that way.\n\n231\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.700\nWhen we start talking about\nit in terms of vulnerability.\n\n232\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.760\nIt does describe it to a point,\nwhat is affected,\n\n233\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.040\nbut we're not talking about what\nwe call authorization scope.\n\n234\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.260\nBut they're never gonna mention it\nthat way, probably when you start to\n\n235\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.500\nsee this again,\nyou will see the term scope though.\n\n236\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.510\nNow, when it comes down to scope, you\nneed to know about the different scopes\n\n237\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.560\nin which a vulnerability can work it.\n\n238\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.460\nThe red arrows, I'm gonna say symbolizes\nan attack of some sort of vulnerability.\n\n239\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.430\nThat we're actually using to exploit and\nsee what happens here.\n\n240\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.000\nNotice those other two terms that we have,\nthe Vulnerability Component and\n\n241\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.060\nthe Impacted Component here.\n\n242\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.690\nYou can have a vulnerability in which\nthe vulnerability exists on that system,\n\n243\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.940\nand the only system that is\nimpacted is the same system.\n\n244\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.110\nAnd if something like that is true,\n\n245\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.740\nthen the scope of the vulnerability\nis the same scope.\n\n246\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.990\nNow, that's important.\n\n247\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.680\nThere are certain attacks in which\nyou have to identify the scope,\n\n248\n00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.970\ndoes my vulnerability or\nthe vulnerability that's actually attack,\n\n249\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.890\ndoes it affect more than this\nparticular system or not?\n\n250\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.820\nIf it doesn't it means it's localized.\n\n251\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.070\nIt's to that same scope, and\nthat's what we see right up here.\n\n252\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.390\nBut there is a particular chance here,\nI need to do something here,\n\n253\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.061\nI should copy the wrong word-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was very confused-\n\n254\n00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:19.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry.\n\n255\n00:14:19.677 --> 00:14:20.478\n&gt;&gt; For a second.\n\n256\n00:14:20.478 --> 00:14:22.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel,\n\n257\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.570\nI noticed the confused look on your face\nas we took a look at my diagram and said,\n\n258\n00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.690\nwait I minute,\nI see two same scopes there.\n\n259\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.334\nWell let me show you that, again I kind\nof typed it really quickly here, but\n\n260\n00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:35.454\nlet me explain what the next\none as we work at it to.\n\n261\n00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:36.380\nSo here it is.\n\n262\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.950\nSame scope, in this one it is\nlocalized to a single machine.\n\n263\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.950\nNow, that is actually the scope but that's\nthe smallest scope that we can have.\n\n264\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.610\nSo in that,\n\n265\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.170\nif we think about a single machine and\nthat vulnerability only impacts that one?\n\n266\n00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.870\nThat is the scope, the limitation laptop,\nmachine whatever it is.\n\n267\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.630\nBut remember we can actually be\nin the same authorization scope.\n\n268\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.190\nAnd both of these are actually\non the same network.\n\n269\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.970\nSo it might be that you and I are both\nauthorized to be on the ITPro.TV network,\n\n270\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.900\nbut it could be Daniel where\nI actually send an attack and\n\n271\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.050\nyour machine is vulnerable to it, but\n\n272\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.920\nit has this impact on maybe another\nmachine inside of my network.\n\n273\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.080\nSo this is where I kind of should have\ndone a little bit more explanation,\n\n274\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.790\nor in terms of typing this thing out.\n\n275\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.810\nSame scope, but different,\nnot different, yeah, separate.\n\n276\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.280\nMachine.\n\n277\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.012\nThat will at least hopefully,\nhelp us out here.\n\n278\n00:15:37.012 --> 00:15:40.758\nSo remember the idea of\nbeing on the same land.\n\n279\n00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:42.470\nWe're at the same scope.\n\n280\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.530\nCan impact a single machine.\n\n281\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.180\nIt could be where I do attack\none machine on the network.\n\n282\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.044\nOn a vulnerability.\n\n283\n00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:53.247\nAnd that vulnerable component,\nsomehow actually also impacts\n\n284\n00:15:53.247 --> 00:15:57.619\nanother machine that may be out\nthere on that same network as well.\n\n285\n00:15:57.619 --> 00:16:01.990\nBoth are within the same\nauthorization scope.\n\n286\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.328\nNow what I intended over here\nunder different scope is,\n\n287\n00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:07.110\nnow where it becomes tricky.\n\n288\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.450\nLike, okay, so that makes sense.\n\n289\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:15.290\nIs is possible, okay,\nthat I could actually impact one machine.\n\n290\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.410\nLet me kinda give you\nan example of this one, Daniel.\n\n291\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:23.650\nI impact a web server and I install\nsome malicious software on this server\n\n292\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.630\nover here on this vulnerable component.\n\n293\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.230\nBut you Daniel, you choose to\nfollow the link on the email that\n\n294\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.810\nsaid hey come here for\nyou free lotto ticket, whatever it is.\n\n295\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:41.160\nAnd you now actually access this\nparticular machine from your network,\n\n296\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.020\nand now you get weird things\nhappening on your machine.\n\n297\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit sounds like client-side scripting.\n\n298\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah or\nsome type of cross-site scripting-\n\n299\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I mean,\n\n300\n00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.380\ncross-site scripting.\n\n301\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm taking advantage of a\n\n302\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:17:00.620\nvulnerability on a web server to basically\nuse it as an attack platform, to get\n\n303\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.220\npeople that are visiting that web server-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n304\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're gonna go that page,\nand when they visit that page,\n\n305\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.640\nmy script is gonna run, and\nit's going to exploit their machines.\n\n306\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.000\nAnd I'm gonna have access to them.\n\n307\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.760\n&gt;&gt; So that's where we can\nsee this idea working out.\n\n309\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.373\nNow, I tried to use the same terminology\nas you'll find inside the CVSS\n\n310\n00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:22.690\n3.0 so that we can understand\nthis a little bit better.\n\n311\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.560\nBut that's kind of the examples\nthat you might actually understand.\n\n312\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.030\nAn attack app is on that machine,\n\n313\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.160\nonly effects that machine,\nDaniel's computer constantly reboots.\n\n314\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.290\nThat's it.\n\n315\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.310\nDoesn't effect anyone else, I'm over here\nlaughing and yucking it up myself and\n\n316\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.880\nthat's fine, I have the same exact\nmachine that Daniel has but I'm okay but\n\n317\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.340\nif Daniel's machine gets attacked and then\nalso his computer starts to reboot but\n\n318\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.440\nthen my computer starts to reboot\nbecause we're on the same network.\n\n319\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.440\nWell now I'm gonna blame Daniel a little\nbit more, [LAUGH] what's happening here?\n\n320\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.600\nBut on this one it could be something like\nthat where it's a cross site scripting\n\n321\n00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.910\nattack, and\nwe can see something like this.\n\n322\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:06.300\nSo this indicates the scope of\nthe actual attack that we may see or\n\n323\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.650\nthe vulnerability scopes\nthat we're talking.\n\n324\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.400\nRemember that for CVSS they're always\ntalking about authorization scope.\n\n325\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.070\nWhat are you authorized to?\n\n326\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, I may be authorized to actually\naccess this one, but it affected what?\n\n327\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.220\nDaniel's computer on a completely\ndifferent authorization scope.\n\n328\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.630\nDaniel may not actually\nbe a part of the website.\n\n329\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.100\nHe just went to visit.\n\n330\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.390\nThat's a different scope completely.\n\n331\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.560\nSo, adding that in together,\n\n332\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.980\nwe're now starting to see where\nthe components are starting to fill in.\n\n333\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:41.130\nWe've now talked about the idea of\nthe exploitability metrics a little bit.\n\n334\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.770\nWe're now gonna take a look at this\nidea of the base, or the scope, here,\n\n335\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.480\nwhat we're actually talking about.\n\n336\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.260\nAnd now we're gonna head into\nthe impact metrics for just a bit.\n\n337\n00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.210\nNow, these are the only ones I listed.\n\n338\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.530\nBut I want you to know something.\n\n339\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.150\nThere's a lot more to the impact\ncomponents than just this, but\n\n340\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.150\nthis is kinda the meat and potatoes on\nwhat we're actually going to see as well.\n\n341\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.780\nWe are gonna cover them all and\nall the other ones that are what we call\n\n342\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.690\nmodified metrics that\nactually exist on here.\n\n343\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.000\nBut this is where we are beginning.\n\n344\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.090\nAll right, so\nhow does all this stuff begin to work out?\n\n345\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.220\nSo this is what has to happen for\nyour base score to be determined overall.\n\n346\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.660\nSo that long string of\ninformation that I showed you and\n\n347\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.730\nI'll show you how this kind of\nbreaks up here in just a moment.\n\n348\n00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.000\nSo remember, base metrics once again,\na great reminder,\n\n349\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.110\nqualities that do not change over time or\nacross environments, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.220\nSo key terminology for\nus in thinking about this.\n\n351\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.980\nExploitability metrics, so\n\n352\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.930\nonce we determine our attack vector,\nour complexity, privileges required or\n\n353\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.320\nuser interaction, okay, then we\nactually have two things under scope.\n\n354\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.695\nAnd this is what we also\nhave to pay attention to.\n\n355\n00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:01.690\nIf it's all within the same scope,\n\n356\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.970\nthen the scope is unchanged or a U.\n\n357\n00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:12.020\nI didn't write that down on, I didn't\ntype that out on my last screen here.\n\n358\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.870\nBut if it's changed, it's a C.\n\n359\n00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.300\nWhich means it changed.\n\n360\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.070\nSo the only one that looks like\nit actually did change here.\n\n361\n00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.610\nOkay?\n\n362\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.610\nIs going to be the one that\nis the cross site scripted.\n\n363\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.010\nWhereas the other two,\nlet me go back to this one here.\n\n364\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.290\nSo these other two down here,\nthese would be changed.\n\n365\n00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.560\nThis would be unchanged.\n\n366\n00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.460\nThis would be unchanged here.\n\n367\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.708\nBut this one is actually changed\nin this particular instance.\n\n368\n00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:40.278\nAll right.\n\n369\n00:20:40.278 --> 00:20:41.620\nNow.\n\n370\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.140\nBefore I do that, because I just came\nback and I started thinking about this.\n\n371\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.107\nDaniel, do you think that that\nmight be a good question?\n\n372\n00:20:49.107 --> 00:20:52.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To you know,\n\n373\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.290\nthat somebody might go hey, you know,\nI think that the vulnerability to effect\n\n374\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.420\nmore than the target itself,\nwhich is the vulnerability component,\n\n375\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.260\nis this within the same scope or\na different scope.\n\n376\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.070\nI could see that as being something.\n\n377\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.015\n&gt;&gt; I definitely might put\nthat down on a questionnaire.\n\n378\n00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:10.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could see that, or\n\n379\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.610\nactually saying hey,\ndoes the scope change or is it unchanged?\n\n380\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.650\nI don't know.\n\n381\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.814\n&gt;&gt; Know the difference in\nhow that is calculated,\n\n382\n00:21:17.814 --> 00:21:20.423\nmight be something you good\nfolks out there need to know.\n\n383\n00:21:20.423 --> 00:21:23.092\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I could see something\nlike that as being a test question.\n\n384\n00:21:23.092 --> 00:21:25.684\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Very easily.\n\n385\n00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.330\n&gt;&gt; In just taking a look at it.\n\n386\n00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.656\nSo just when we think,\nso what, I missed one.\n\n387\n00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:34.900\nWell, remember that Cisco\nexam Daniel you and\n\n388\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.900\nI have both experienced\nquite a few of these.\n\n389\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.190\nThe Cisco exams has\nthe harsh unforgiving part.\n\n390\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.730\nRight?\n\n391\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.980\nIt's gone right answer.\n\n392\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.900\nNext.\n\n393\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.140\nCrap that was the wrong answer.\n\n394\n00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.800\nAnd then you realize the button\ndoesn't work to go backwards.\n\n395\n00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.380\n&gt;&gt; No, you're kinda done.\n\n396\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n397\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.010\nmake sure that you kind of get this\ndown as you start to take a look at it.\n\n398\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.750\nAnd don't only let this first viewing,\nokay, and I mean this.\n\n399\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.750\nDon't let this first time watching this,\nI've got this down.\n\n400\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.380\nMake sure you review this.\n\n401\n00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.100\nWe've thrown how many, I mean, just\na number of terms, a number of acronyms at\n\n402\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.648\nyou that I've chosen not to repeat\ncuz I know that gets more confusing.\n\n403\n00:22:12.648 --> 00:22:17.500\nBut just at you to try and\nhelp you understand here, okay?\n\n404\n00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.070\nSo Scope Unchanged is gonna be a U so\nit's actually in the same scope.\n\n405\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.950\nYou're gonna mark that that way.\n\n406\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.420\nAnd then Change.\n\n407\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.350\nNow, we haven't talked about\nImpact Metrics yet, but we will.\n\n408\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.790\nBut notice that the scope, and\n\n409\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.830\nthis is why I put the dotted line\nhere at the very beginning, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.800\nIt's not directly\nimpacting the base score.\n\n411\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.190\nSo it does influence it.\n\n412\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.000\nDon't get me wrong,\nit is a big influence in it.\n\n413\n00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.630\nBut if you want to actually know\nhow that works out, is that\n\n414\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.210\neven in the exploitability metrics,\na lot of that's effected by the scope.\n\n415\n00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.250\nRight, that exploitability,\nthat vulnerability component.\n\n416\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.600\nIt changes due to whether or\nnot we're changing the scope.\n\n417\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.620\nAnd then we'll end up seeing what\nthe impact metrics actually are, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.850\nOnce we get that, then we'll\ndetermine what the base score is.\n\n419\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.100\nSo if I go back to this\noriginal score her,\n\n420\n00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.240\nbecause of the way that I just showed you,\nright?\n\n421\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.100\nWe have the vulnerability,\nwhy can't I remember the right term,\n\n422\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.600\nI'm talking about it here, and\n\n423\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.190\nI still can't remember the proper-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.960\n&gt;&gt; Exploitability metrics and\n\n425\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.540\nthe impact metrics here.\n\n426\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.800\nLet me go back to this, and\n\n427\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.550\nthen let me see if I can use\nthe proper drawing tool here.\n\n428\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.200\nJust need a line.\n\n429\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.830\nI can start to see something,\nif I can do this correctly here.\n\n430\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:36.250\nThere is a division that we\nare actually starting to see and\n\n431\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:41.840\nit comes right here and then.\n\n432\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.458\nOf course, why let me draw another\nline immediately after when I.\n\n433\n00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Want to.\n\n434\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.217\nWhich is right here.\n\n435\n00:23:54.173 --> 00:23:57.817\nSo here's where we're seeing\nthe combination of these things, right?\n\n436\n00:23:57.817 --> 00:24:02.031\nIt probably doesn't mean that\nI need to draw an arrow, but\n\n437\n00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:04.619\nthat's what I had available to me.\n\n438\n00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:10.535\nAll right, so Daniel,\non the left-hand side of this line,\n\n439\n00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:14.943\nwe have attack vector, attack complexity,\n\n440\n00:24:14.943 --> 00:24:19.710\nprivileges required, user interface, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.800\nThat is my exploitability metrics.\n\n442\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes sense.\n\n443\n00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.400\nRight here with the S, scope.\n\n444\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Scope.\n\n445\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.380\n&gt;&gt; And the scope is?\n\n446\n00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.170\n&gt;&gt; Unchanged.\n&gt;&gt; Unchanged, okay.\n\n447\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.670\nSo I can see where the scope comes in.\n\n448\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.306\nAnd then we can see C,\nfor confidentiality.\n\n449\n00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.924\nI, integrity.\n\n450\n00:24:36.924 --> 00:24:38.720\nA, availability.\n\n451\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.830\nThis is the impact metric.\n\n452\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.004\nSo now you can see that\noverall total combined here,\n\n453\n00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:47.890\nof the information that you see,\n\n454\n00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:53.050\nthat is actually saying here's where\nthe score all comes into play.\n\n455\n00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.960\nThat gives you the overall base score.\n\n456\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.550\nSo when you see something like this,\nyou can actually determine that if you\n\n457\n00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.170\nkind of know what\nthe exploitability measures are.\n\n458\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.300\nI'm going to mess that up.\n\n459\n00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.050\n&gt;&gt; You want to call a vulnerability,\nyou want it so bad.\n\n460\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.490\n&gt;&gt; I do want to call it so badly.\n\n461\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.080\nThat scope and\nof course the impact metric,\n\n462\n00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.005\nso, dividing that up really does\nnow give you the sense like, crud,\n\n463\n00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:22.560\nRonny, you weren't just going through\nthis to show us all these things.\n\n464\n00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.030\nThe score does make sense to a point.\n\n465\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.082\n&gt;&gt; We have yet to get to how you got\nthe number in the first episode, though.\n\n466\n00:25:30.082 --> 00:25:30.620\n&gt;&gt; No, but we will.\n\n467\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.250\nYeah we will, we'll get to that.\n\n468\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.610\nBut at this point we just need\nto understand that first because\n\n469\n00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.870\neven CVSS says, hey,\nthe numbering thing is optional.\n\n470\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.950\nWell it's optional to them,\ndoesn't mean it's optional to us.\n\n471\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.550\nSo we'll definitely get to that.\n\n472\n00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.530\nBut just kinda realize that yes,\nwe are working towards this, and\n\n473\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.750\nnow hopefully you're able to\nsee this a little bit better.\n\n474\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.879\nWe still need to describe some\nimpact metrics as well and\n\n475\n00:25:53.879 --> 00:25:56.953\ntalk about the scoring and\nhow we can come across that.\n\n476\n00:25:56.953 --> 00:26:00.228\nAnd we'll talk about what we called a\nseverity rating is what that's technically\n\n477\n00:26:00.228 --> 00:26:01.200\ncalled there.\n\n478\n00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.019\nAnd bring everything into play and\nwrap it all up.\n\n479\n00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:08.950\nBut Daniel, once again I have talked\na lot and I have run out of time [LAUGH].\n\n480\n00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you have run out of time.\n\n481\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.880\nThe clock doth tick.\n\n482\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.330\nWhile Ronny is a-yappin',\nhe's a-bumping his gums but\n\n483\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.780\nhe's giving you great information\nwhen it comes to this and\n\n484\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.265\nhow to figure out these scoring systems\nfrom CVSS, if I have that correctly.\n\n485\n00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:24.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, CVSS.\n\n486\n00:26:24.018 --> 00:26:25.050\n&gt;&gt; CVSS, yes.\n\n487\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.356\nIt's very difficult, I just wanna\nsay CVS cuz it's a local store.\n\n488\n00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:30.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway, Ronny,\n\n489\n00:26:30.294 --> 00:26:32.263\ndo we have one more to go,\nit looks like, or at least?\n\n490\n00:26:32.263 --> 00:26:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n491\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.720\nAt the very least, you never know,\nRonnie could get very verbose.\n\n492\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.495\n&gt;&gt; Not me [LAUGH].\n\n493\n00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:40.210\n&gt;&gt; He never does that so\nit's really out of

It is going great.\n\n13\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.310\nThank you again Daniel for\nus being able to continue this particular\n\n14\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.840\nmini series that we've had here in\nthe midst of the SecOps series.\n\n15\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.610\nThere is a lot of material here\nthat we have to cover so we wanna\n\n16\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.490\nmake sure that you do get all that you\nneed in getting ready for the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.905\nAs well as understand a little bit more\nas you start to work as a analyst in\n\n18\n00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:59.470\na security operation center and\nthat's what this entire series is really\n\n19\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.289\nhoping that you know to\nhelp you be able to do.\n\n20\n00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.920\nNow, some this you may use,\nsome of this you may not.\n\n21\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.390\nBut over all they're preparing for\nthe exams that's the biggest part so\n\n22\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.292\nthat's we're getting to.\n\n23\n00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:12.050\nWe're gonna talk now about the idea\nof exploitabilty matrix, we've\n\n24\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.200\ntalk about the scope and now we've talk\nabout the impact matrix system as well.\n\n25\n00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.839\nAnd that is what we\nare heading into right now.\n\n26\n00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:21.441\nNow when it comes down\nto the impact metrics,\n\n27\n00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:26.070\nlet me go back to our little diagram here\nfor a moment, and that will help us out.\n\n28\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.110\nThat we have now actually\ntalked about everything but\n\n29\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.150\nthe impact metrics right here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.240\nAnd then we still got to talk\nabout some temporal metrics.\n\n31\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.494\nAnd then some environmental metrics,\ncuz it all comes into play and\n\n32\n00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:37.704\ngives us what we need to.\n\n33\n00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:41.475\nWe're gonna move into the areas\nof confidentiality, integrity and\n\n34\n00:01:41.475 --> 00:01:42.390\navailability.\n\n35\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.369\nOnce again, the iron triangle that we are\nall used to understanding if we dealt any\n\n36\n00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.410\ntime in security fundamentals at all.\n\n37\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.310\nSo let's move onto the idea\nof confidentiality.\n\n38\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.590\nWhen it comes down to vulnerabilities,\nnow we're at the impact.\n\n39\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.040\nSo what was the impact of\nthe vulnerability, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.650\nDid it impact the confidentiality\nof our machines, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.530\nWell, really for us, data is what we're\nreally talking about at this point.\n\n42\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.680\nSo that's actually a simple yes or\nno answer as we take a look at, right?\n\n43\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.650\nIf it's no, it's simple, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.644\nThat means confidentiality wasn't breached\nat all as we still have control of all of\n\n45\n00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:23.979\nour data and we're not so worry about.\n\n46\n00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.362\nSo we'll give it a rating of none,\nis what we'll end up doing.\n\n47\n00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:29.290\nThat's pretty much the end of it, but\n\n48\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.870\nif it's a yes, we now have to ask\nit a secondary question here.\n\n49\n00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010\nDoes the attacker gain information\nfrom the impacted component or\n\n50\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.680\nis critical information lost.\n\n51\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.660\nNow the reason why we want to do this\nis because we understand something that\n\n52\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780\nespecially in this day and age, right.\n\n53\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.590\nIt's nice to think that,\nwe'll never have a component,\n\n54\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.070\nthat will be breached in any possible way.\n\n55\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.890\nBut the reality that we're starting to\nfind out, especially in network monitoring\n\n56\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.070\nsolutions that are out there is that,\nwe can't prevent everything.\n\n57\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.920\nSo, even if somebody gets on\nto our system, the key and\n\n58\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.590\nthe understanding here is,\ndid they get access to what they wanted?\n\n59\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.250\nSo they might be able to\ngain access to other things.\n\n60\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.625\nSo let's say for an example,\n\n61\n00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:21.810\nDaniel, that they find out, ooh,\nDaniel's on a Dell laptop, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.520\nNow, Daniel, is that really so concerting\nif they found that information out?\n\n63\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n64\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.460\nNow, getting access to the operating\nsystem, that's a little bit more, right?\n\n66\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.916\n&gt;&gt; And that would definitely ruffle my\nfeathers a tad bit more than them knowing\n\n67\n00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:37.728\nthat I run a bill.\n\n68\n00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:38.993\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean yeah, overall though,\n\n69\n00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:42.030\nwhen we start seeing information out,\nthis is why it's important.\n\n70\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.180\nBecause we may think that\nany attack that we get,\n\n71\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.010\nor any vulnerability,\nit exposes more than we think it should.\n\n72\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.679\nCuz we all do, I mean, that's what we do.\n\n73\n00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:55.750\nBut the reality is, did it actually\nexpose what we didn't want to lose, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.880\nWell, if it's yes,\nthen we'll score a high rate, so\n\n75\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.970\nyes, this particular vulnerability can\ncause where I'm gonna lose information.\n\n76\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.010\nAnd that's something I\nwanna score as high.\n\n77\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.390\nBut if I say no,\nit didn't do anything like that and\n\n78\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.850\nhere they give it a lowest score.\n\n79\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.051\nI put an asterisk beside this\nbecause I wanted to make\n\n80\n00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.838\nsure that we understood that\nno doesn't mean none, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:24.340\nIt can, that's why I have it, it can mean\nthat it's none, that nothing happened.\n\n82\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.300\nBut essentially,\n\n83\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.440\nno significant information was lost\nthat we thought should been protected.\n\n84\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.051\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe difference here really is whether or\n\n85\n00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:36.173\nnot confidentiality was breached.\n\n86\n00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n87\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.111\nNot whether or not how impactful\nthat was if it was breached.\n\n88\n00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.200\nSo that's why they wanna make that\nparticular distinction in CVSS.\n\n90\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.530\nThat's why they ask that\nsecondary question.\n\n91\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.560\nThey know that there's\na chance that confidentiality,\n\n92\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.810\nwe think that a breach of the machine\nactually breaches confidentiality,\n\n93\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.290\nand here they're saying that may\nnot technically be that way.\n\n94\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.120\nWhat we have here is that they wanna\nask that secondary question so\n\n95\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.390\neven if your machine did get to the point\nwhere you realize somebody was on it.\n\n96\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.520\nDidn't get access to what you\nthink that they got access to it.\n\n97\n00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.530\nIt's something you're protecting here,\nand if it is a yes,\n\n98\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.360\nthat they could do it then we give it\na higher score rating at that point.\n\n99\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.000\nAnd that will of course\nsignificantly bag that up.\n\n100\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.580\nSo it increases then with the degree of\ninformation that is disclosed so this\n\n101\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.480\nis the first time where they actually use\nthis term right here which is the degree.\n\n102\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.240\nNow they're separating out not yes or\nno that it just happened.\n\n103\n00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.660\nNow they're saying let's take a look\nat the information itself and see.\n\n104\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.440\nAlong with that, of course,\nis the idea of our data integrity.\n\n105\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.640\nHas the integrity of our machines been\nimpacted or our data been impacted?\n\n106\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.710\nNow, this is where it gets a little bit\nmore unusual in terms of the terminology.\n\n107\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.000\nThe first one, of course, is pretty much,\ndid that get exposed out there, right?\n\n108\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.150\nThis is about the modification\nof that data.\n\n109\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.090\nWhen we start taking about the integrity,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.680\nThe integrity says, nothing's\nbeen modified between you and me,\n\n111\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.360\nit's the same that existed on my\nmachine that now exists on yours.\n\n112\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.840\nSo here, if it's not actually impacted,\nthen it's a none.\n\n113\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.720\nBut if it is, does the attacker modify the\ninformation from the impacted component,\n\n114\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.559\nor critical information?\n\n115\n00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.260\nSay yes, then we mark it as a high.\n\n116\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.520\nSo that again makes sense, I'm not going\nto spend too much time because we're\n\n117\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.430\nfairly familiar with this concept.\n\n118\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.400\nBut overall, though, you do see where it's\nactually playing into something like this\n\n119\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.010\nTo help us out, to try and think about.\n\n120\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.900\nAnd then, of course, availability.\n\n121\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.940\nThis is different here, right.\n\n122\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.950\nFor confidentiality, and\nfor integrity, Daniel,\n\n123\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.690\nwe're really talking about data, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.710\nBut when it comes down to availability,\n\n125\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.130\nthough, okay, the availability that's\nimpacted is the data impacted.\n\n126\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.359\nReally, that component, that machine.\n\n127\n00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:55.771\nNow, all of the sudden we have the two\nparts of the CIA triangle right.\n\n128\n00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:59.830\nConfidentiality and the integrity\nreally associated with the data.\n\n129\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.960\nBut, accessibility or\navailability to that machine or\n\n130\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.450\nto that component is what were doing.\n\n131\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.536\nSo, does the attacker deny\naccess to affected component?\n\n132\n00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.870\nOr to that critical information which\nmeans they're not able- [CROSSTALK]\n\n133\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.470\n&gt;&gt; The dead-end signal.\n\n134\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.480\n&gt;&gt; To get access to the data.\n\n135\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.610\nBut it means they have to get access\nto the component, the machine itself.\n\n136\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.090\nSo here, if it's a yes, once again\non high, if it's no, then it's low.\n\n137\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.750\nSo it makes sense in those three,\n\n138\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.260\nso those are kinda the big\nthree in terms of the impact.\n\n139\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.030\nThey're just trying to say,\n\n140\n00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.590\ndo you realize what the impact is to\nyour overall security goals, right?\n\n141\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.830\nSo what does this vulnerability\ndo to your security goals?\n\n142\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.660\nIs it a high scorer on\nyour confidentiality,\n\n143\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.960\na high scorer on your integrity,\na high scorer on your availability?\n\n144\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.291\nWell, that means it's gonna get a higher\nImpact score, overall that's gonna feed\n\n145\n00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.955\ninto that base score and save them\nwith your vulnerability component.\n\n146\n00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:54.084\nThe more vulnerable it is,\nthe higher the score is gonna be.\n\n147\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:58.057\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, going back to that\naffected component kind of idea.\n\n148\n00:07:58.057 --> 00:08:02.899\nThe single running something like HSRP,\nand we got two routers right, one goes\n\n149\n00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.570\ndown through exploitation or you know,\nsome vulnerability as it's exploited.\n\n150\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.440\nThe other one takes over and\nyou still have access to the data.\n\n151\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.070\nIs that impacting availability\nas according to CDSS?\n\n152\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.071\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, but\nis its impact actually super high.\n\n153\n00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.823\n&gt;&gt; Right, gotcha.\n\n154\n00:08:19.823 --> 00:08:22.429\n&gt;&gt; Well that's-\n&gt;&gt; So now, it's a high low thing.\n\n155\n00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now it actually becomes\nthat degree on what we need.\n\n156\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.380\nSo in this aspect,\n\n157\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.590\nit would actually be a high impact\nif you had a ton of users coming in.\n\n158\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.470\nAnd now everything wasn't actually doing\nthe load distribution if you set up\n\n159\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.350\nHSRP across a global load balancing and\nstuff.\n\n160\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.180\nOr is it actually fine to still\nkeep the same level at that point.\n\n161\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.020\nWell remember since we're taking\na look at it from the standpoint of,\n\n162\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.670\nis it impacted because\nof that vulnerability,\n\n163\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.040\nwell if it is, then we'll actually have\nto take that into account here too.\n\n164\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.230\nSo all that is a part of what we\nhave to be able to understand.\n\n165\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.185\nIs it significant?\n\n166\n00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:03.030\nAnd, maybe, is it not?\n\n167\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.220\nYou kinda have to weigh that out and\nthen that's where your environmental\n\n168\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.570\nmetrics are gonna come in and\nhelp you affect that.\n\n169\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.930\nSo may leave it as in\nterms of the impact here.\n\n170\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.935\nAnd this is where the base scores.\n\n171\n00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:17.845\nNow who does all this?\n\n172\n00:09:17.845 --> 00:09:19.878\nOkay,,that's what we wanna\nget to before we move on\n\n173\n00:09:19.878 --> 00:09:20.802\nto [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; Somebody else.\n\n174\n00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:21.483\n&gt;&gt; Somebody else.\n\n175\n00:09:21.483 --> 00:09:23.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n176\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.230\nSo normally this is\nwhere hardware vendors.\n\n177\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They take a look at their own\n\n178\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.642\nstuff and go.\n\n179\n00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:32.898\nWell here's the chances right, and here's\nwhat we believe and, they kind of report\n\n180\n00:09:32.898 --> 00:09:38.190\nthis and kind of give us an overall base\nscore that we can kind of measure off of.\n\n181\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.660\nEverybody would love to say that their\nbase score is 1, okay, or 0, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's impossible,\n\n183\n00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.910\nbut they all realize that\nif they walk through this,\n\n184\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.630\nit's now a common voluntary standard\nthat they're going through.\n\n185\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.220\nAnd they're say, hey, we submitted this,\nand we're noticing something here.\n\n186\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.150\nOur base score is kind of average,\n\n187\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.640\nbut you add in the level of protection\nyou're gonna add in, Daniel.\n\n188\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.780\nThat score is gonna lower.\n\n189\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.609\nIt's just like what I said in episode one\nthat you may see that has a base score of\n\n190\n00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:07.801\n8 at the very beginning, but\nthen we go, I have this component,\n\n191\n00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.493\nI have this component,\nI have this actually in there.\n\n192\n00:10:10.493 --> 00:10:14.060\nAll of a sudden the base score\ndrops down to 4.6 or something.\n\n193\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.630\nAnd you say, how the heck did that happen?\n\n194\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.960\nIt's because, well you've added in so\nmany other security benefits and so\n\n195\n00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.960\nthe vulnerability scores just drop.\n\n196\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.840\nMuch more significant on your network\nthan it may be on my network when I don't\n\n197\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.030\nhave as many.\n\n198\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.900\nSo, that's where it actually affects it,\nalright?\n\n199\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.350\nSo, those are kind of the base things\nthat we have to worry about now.\n\n200\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.760\nSince, we understand that, and now we've\nalso shown you of course how everything\n\n201\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.880\nfits together, and determines this\nidea of the base core for us.\n\n202\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.890\nWe now need to take a look\nat the temporal metrics and\n\n203\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.690\nof course, the environmental metrics.\n\n204\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.212\nWe'll come back and\nget the overall severity finally.\n\n205\n00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:50.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know Daniel has been waiting for\n\n206\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.890\nthis and I'm like are you joking?\n\n207\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.040\nWe still haven't gotten the numbers yet,\nwhat's going on?\n\n208\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.080\nWe're about to take a look.\n\n209\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.520\nSo, let's talk about this idea of\ntemporal metrics for a moment.\n\n210\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.380\nTemporal matrix,\nvulnerability that changes over time.\n\n211\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.080\nNow you may look like, what the heck is\na vulnerability that changes over time.\n\n212\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.990\nWell for us, this is depending on the\nstage where we catch a vulnerability okay.\n\n213\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.990\nSo yo might find out that you get a 0\ndata tap right, well that's actually in\n\n214\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.660\nthe earliest part in it's life process\nin terms of it's vulnerability.\n\n215\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.730\nWe didn't know that it exists,\nwe find out that exist.\n\n216\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.061\nWell at that particular point in time,\nokay?\n\n217\n00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:33.926\nThen we know something, that's gonna be\ndifferent than maybe three days from now.\n\n218\n00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:38.390\nIf the vendor comes out with,\nyou know patches or\n\n219\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.850\ncomes out in changes the code or\nupdates or whatever.\n\n220\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.308\nAnd all the sudden three days later it not\nthe same vulnerability that existed three\n\n221\n00:11:46.308 --> 00:11:46.890\ndays ago.\n\n222\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.750\nSo this is where we talk about the idea\nof a vulnerability that changes overtime.\n\n223\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.740\nMake sure you pay attention that this\nscore can never exceed the base score, and\n\n224\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.869\ni'll have this one each of the diagrams.\n\n225\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.430\nThat it created over\nthese three to remind us,\n\n226\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.980\nbecause it's such an important concept.\n\n227\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.060\nNormally the default here,\nis that it's not defined.\n\n228\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.478\nWhen Temporal Metrics are not defined,\nit is actually says,\n\n229\n00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:13.450\nwe'll use the base score.\n\n230\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.180\nThat's essentially what it says.\n\n231\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.090\nWe'll just use the base score.\n\n232\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.260\nIf you don't wanna find it,\n\n233\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.520\nwe'll give the highest rating\nwhich is gonna be the base score.\n\n234\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.400\nRemember that, this score is never\ngonna exceed that base score as well.\n\n235\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.600\nEverything else that we choose to modify\nfrom this point will lower the score.\n\n236\n00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.970\nThat's what we'll see.\n\n237\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.590\nWe'll talk about\nthe exploit code maturity.\n\n238\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.960\nWe'll talk about the remediation level and\nthen the report confidence and\n\n239\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.840\nwe'll start talking about\nthe temporary methods, alright.\n\n240\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.670\nNow in the exploit code maturity,\n\n241\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.960\nokay, this measures the likelihood of\nthe vulnerability being exploited.\n\n242\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.640\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n243\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.370\nAre we catching this particular\nexploit code as just a simple idea?\n\n244\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.567\nDaniel, I think that I can exploit\nthis on this system, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:05.920\nWell, then you come back to me and\ngo, how do you know that?\n\n246\n00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.007\nI'm guessing Daniel.\n\n247\n00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:08.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well guess what,\n\n248\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.590\nthat means that,\nmy exploit code maturity, not so mature.\n\n249\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nprobably hasn't even reached You know yet.\n\n250\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Not even close, not really close.\n\n251\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.300\nI'm just guessing.\n\n252\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.453\n&gt;&gt; Conception at this point to\nbe honest with you [CROSSTALK].\n\n253\n00:13:20.453 --> 00:13:21.810\n&gt;&gt; It's just not there.\n\n254\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.245\nSo we can mark that,\nwhat I've got is not defined.\n\n255\n00:13:24.245 --> 00:13:29.786\nBecause, even though I like to say it\nwas further on than this, it may not be.\n\n256\n00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:33.443\nBut there is a chance that I might\nactually be able to do a proof\n\n257\n00:13:33.443 --> 00:13:35.039\nof concept at this point.\n\n258\n00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:39.870\nOr yes it is, and\nnow that do I have this Daniel.\n\n259\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.601\nI have a tool or I have a technique\nthat if you run this script Daniel,\n\n260\n00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:46.101\nyou watch it happen.\n\n261\n00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:49.970\nBut now if I tell you that Daniel,\nif I say, I have a tool or tip,\n\n262\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.230\nhow much time do you think I'm now spent\nin, making this a little bit more mature.\n\n263\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.790\n&gt;&gt; You spent a great deal of time.\n\n264\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.330\nAt least as much time as\nit took to actually verify,\n\n265\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.930\nthat your concept, and\nthat the code that you come up with\n\n266\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.790\ndoes actually work within\na certain environment.\n\n267\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo\n\n268\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.930\nall of a sudden you start seeing this\nidea of the exploit code maturity.\n\n269\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.561\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n270\n00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:13.845\n&gt;&gt; So that is what they are saying is,\nif you come across a vulnerability, and\n\n271\n00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:17.410\nnow you go,\nall right Daniel why do you think this is?\n\n272\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.180\nI'm guessing.\n\n273\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.390\nThen I go, all right then I'm gonna\nsay that that's really unproven.\n\n274\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.083\nIt's theoretical.\n\n275\n00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:22.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n276\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.698\nonce it has become like you said you have\nthat mature that it's a real threat at\n\n277\n00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:28.860\nthe point of time where you said.\n\n278\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.910\nI've written code, I've executed the code,\n\n279\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.200\nthe code has exploited the vulnerability,\nand I'm in.\n\n280\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.740\nNow it's a real threat,\nthat's in the real world.\n\n281\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so there's a couple of\ndifferent levels that they want you to go\n\n282\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.390\nthrough and understand here, right?\n\n283\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.360\nYou might even go alright,\nI'm not really ready, but\n\n284\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.440\nI have a proof of concept\nthat's coming up.\n\n285\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.990\nWhen you start talking about this\nidea of proof of concept here, right.\n\n286\n00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.960\nNow the way I have it is,\n\n287\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.000\nexploit is available but requires\nmore than I have access to right now.\n\n288\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.170\nSo I've gotten to a point where I can say,\nI can do it this far.\n\n289\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.330\nBut for me to finish the rest, I may have\nto have access to the source code, so\n\n290\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.740\nI can take advantage of a little bit more.\n\n291\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.820\nAnd right now,\nI don't have access to the source code.\n\n292\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.540\nSo I can say I've ran it in this condition\nand I've gotten this far into it.\n\n293\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.570\nIf I've gotten this far, I bet you\nthere's some more that's there, okay.\n\n294\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.440\nSo that's the proof of concept, but\nit's not really ready for the real world.\n\n295\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.125\nIn a testing environment,\nit's really just beginning.\n\n296\n00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:28.310\nThat I need to verify that this thing\nis actually working here, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.620\nIt is possible that I get\nto the functional level.\n\n298\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.220\nThe functional level is that\nthe exploit is possible, but\n\n299\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.230\nit may not be possible in\nevery single situation.\n\n300\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.163\nSo, I might've gotten to this point where\nI'll go, I can make it work, as long as\n\n301\n00:15:42.163 --> 00:15:45.933\nthis is ready, as long as this is ready,\nas long as we have these things set up.\n\n302\n00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:48.877\nThen, yes, it is totally functional, and\nnow Daniel says, good luck in getting\n\n303\n00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:51.154\nthose three components all lined\nup in the way that you want to.\n\n304\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:55.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\nis it functional if it works?\n\n305\n00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.431\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In other words, if Daniel goes and\n\n306\n00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:01.756\ntries and says, all right so, Ryan says\nif I turn this off and I turn this on and\n\n307\n00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.805\nif I set this to this and I ran this.\n\n308\n00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:04.971\nCrap there it is, it works.\n\n309\n00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.316\n&gt;&gt; It's functional, right?\n\n311\n00:16:07.316 --> 00:16:09.864\nBut what we hope to never see of course,\nright?\n\n312\n00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:11.213\nIs that it just works.\n\n313\n00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:13.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's when it gets to add to\nthe metaspoil framework and you're done.\n\n314\n00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:14.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:17.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And also, it's just working.\n\n316\n00:16:17.548 --> 00:16:22.496\nYou're like, I don't know how but\nI just ran it exactly like the script\n\n317\n00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:26.305\ntold me online and\nit looks like it's working nicely.\n\n318\n00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:27.805\nWhen a script kiddie can do it,\n\n319\n00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:30.650\nyou know you need to something\nabout that vulnerability.\n\n320\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n321\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.770\nhere they want you to be able to\nunderstand that this is why they talk\n\n322\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.650\nabout under,\n&gt;&gt; Where do you encounter\n\n323\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.110\nsomething like the vulnerability,\nwhat in that timeline, you know?\n\n324\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.360\nAnd that is what you\nwant to be able to do.\n\n325\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.675\nSo, that's a big part of it.\n\n326\n00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:49.696\nOf course this means the higher it is,\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:52.568\nSo if I get up here high,\nit means the scores going to be higher.\n\n328\n00:16:52.568 --> 00:16:54.879\nBecause it actually says, hey.\n\n329\n00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:56.030\nYeah, it doesn't need much.\n\n330\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.390\nAll he needs to do is run this\nscript is that works, and\n\n331\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.390\nthat's where you start to go, all right,\nand exploitability code, okay.\n\n332\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.690\nTake a look again at these letters\nhere and pull this up, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:12.020\nAlso, the other one there on remediation\nlevel, this is something else that also of\n\n334\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.570\ncourse helps us to measure\nthe prioritization level.\n\n335\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.670\nIn what can be done.\n\n336\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:24.181\nAnd the reason way this is important is\nbecause we will hit that vulnerability\n\n337\n00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:29.034\nat different stages where the vendor\nactually tried to fix things.\n\n338\n00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:32.010\nSo you might have some of this\nwhere we don't have a clue.\n\n339\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.090\nSo we just leave it undefined.\n\n340\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.130\nWhether or not the vendor's fixed at all.\n\n341\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.340\nOr there's not actually\na solution available right now.\n\n342\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.920\nEverybody knows it out there, but\nthere's no solution available.\n\n343\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.940\nAnd then people have actually said,\nyeah it's available,\n\n344\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.690\nbut we're gonna retire that product\nanyway, so we're not gonna fix it.\n\n345\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:50.922\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not worried about it.\n\n346\n00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:52.698\nThere's a work around, and\n\n347\n00:17:52.698 --> 00:17:56.996\nthe way that CVSS describes a work\naround is an unofficial solution.\n\n348\n00:17:56.996 --> 00:17:59.610\nSo it's not vendor pushed out.\n\n349\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.360\nSomebody's come up with a way that we\ncan kinda patch this up if we need to.\n\n350\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.190\nA temporary fix is an official one but\n\n351\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.990\nis not one that is actually meant\nto be a permanent solution.\n\n352\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.370\nSo it might be where they say on this\nfeature in our software we don't recommend\n\n353\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.140\nthat you use it because using it can\nactually expose this vulnerability.\n\n354\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.550\nNow we know that you bought this you know\nbecause it was part of features that you\n\n355\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.695\nwant, but\nthe temporary fix is don't use it yet.\n\n356\n00:18:27.695 --> 00:18:28.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Until we patch it,\n\n357\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.200\nand we'll let you know when we patch it.\n\n358\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.010\nYou call them up and go,\nhey how is that patch going,\n\n359\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.385\nwe dont' have any particular end\ndat that we're shooting for.\n\n360\n00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:35.930\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, probably not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:19:34.253 --> 00:19:36.197\n&gt;&gt; Up to speed as we like to say on\n\n381\n00:19:36.197 --> 00:19:38.310\nthe ins and outs of that thing.\n\n382\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in something like that,\n\n383\n00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:43.400\nwe may actually go all right,\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n384\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.840\nbut it's possible, more than likely,\nI don't know anything about it,\n\n385\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.620\nI'm gonna leave it undefined and\nnot have to worry about it.\n\n386\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.830\nBut an unknown is an indication\nof vulnerability.\n\n387\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.650\nIt might actually go quiet,\nI run across this, and now you go,\n\n388\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.540\nlet me write this down so I can try\nto do it again, and it never happens.\n\n389\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.548\nSo that might be a glitch\nthat just somehow,\n\n391\n00:20:03.548 --> 00:20:08.950\nsomething ended up happening right at that\nright point in time, but it's unknown.\n\n392\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.370\nNow, there is times when\nit becomes reasonable,\n\n393\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:18.250\nwhere people do publish significant\ndetails about the exploit, do publish some\n\n394\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:23.650\nreally technical information even at\nthat point they can't fully confirm it.\n\n395\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.130\nNobody's actually saying,\n\n396\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.440\nI was able to get this to work just\neasily using the steps that I found.\n\n397\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.241\nThere is the idea of confirm.\n\n398\n00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:32.574\nMakes sense here.\n\n399\n00:20:32.574 --> 00:20:35.784\nThe author or vendor though,\nhas to have confirmed it.\n\n400\n00:20:35.784 --> 00:20:38.100\nThe details may be in existence out there.\n\n401\n00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.980\nYou actually read the reports and somebody\nsays that's a true vulnerability, and\n\n402\n00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.280\nit has just been confirmed by the author\nof whoever, whatever the software is.\n\n403\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.260\nAnd that lets you know that\nsomething else is happening, okay?\n\n404\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.350\nOnce again, the higher the level\nof confidence at this point,\n\n405\n00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:59.190\nokay, the more that this is going\nto actually raise this score, okay.\n\n406\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.463\nAny score that is done, right, anytime\nwe change it from the not defined, okay.\n\n407\n00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:07.575\nIt is actually going to still\nlower the score a little bit.\n\n408\n00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:10.888\nEventhough we've confirmed that the\nhighest that it can ever be is the same\n\n409\n00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:13.737\nthing as whatever the base score\nis gonna be on this, all right.\n\n410\n00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:19.330\nSo those are kinda the ideas behind the\ntemporal metrics that also play in this.\n\n411\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.640\nNow, this is where we get into\nthe real world thing, all right.\n\n412\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.960\nThe fact that the vendor tells\nus what the base score is,\n\n413\n00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.560\nwe know that it's not gonna change.\n\n414\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.690\nBut as we start looking at it now\novertime, we have to add in these,\n\n415\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.450\nand that again starts adjusting\nthat level and that detail.\n\n416\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.520\nThen, we wanna talk about this,\nwhich is a little bit more scary.\n\n417\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.992\nNotice the sheer number\nof things here that we.\n\n418\n00:21:40.992 --> 00:21:41.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n419\n00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.410\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI wish I could tell you that\n\n420\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.290\nThat this was.\n\n421\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.210\nBut we don't have to go, or we're not\ngonna go through every single one of them,\n\n422\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.760\nbut we will talk about\nat least the two ideas.\n\n423\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.690\nThis is something specific for\nus working in our own enviroment.\n\n424\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.410\nIt is pretty much the key here.\n\n425\n00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.110\nNow when I say that, right.\n\n426\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:04.550\nThat means this is what your environment\ndoes to influence, this information.\n\n427\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.850\nThis is where you actually customize and\nyou modify, essentially,\n\n428\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.560\nthe base score depending on what elements\nyou have inside of your network.\n\n429\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.270\nNow notice that these aren't really\ndifferent than what we've already looked\n\n430\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.910\nat, okay, the majority of them, right?\n\n431\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.350\nThere's the AV, there's the AC,\nthe PR, the UI.\n\n432\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.480\nSo they are not different.\n\n433\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.930\nBut they are saying modify it.\n\n434\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.020\nAnd the reason why they modify it is\nbecause we now take a look at our own\n\n435\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:28.710\nenvironment.\n\n436\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n437\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.320\n&gt;&gt; And we go, I have this.\n\n438\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.800\nAnd this makes it kind of less.\n\n439\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n440\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.650\nessentially what we are saying here.\n\n441\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.910\nBut then we have to actually begin\nwith something else as well.\n\n442\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.130\nNotice this idea of\nthe confidentiality requirement.\n\n443\n00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.600\nWe are not talking about\nthe impact anymore.\n\n444\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.150\nOkay?\n\n445\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.300\nBut we're saying, what is my requirement?\n\n446\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:55.090\nSo, do I want it to be where it's\nabsolutely, 100%, totally can't be hacked?\n\n447\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.730\nWhatever it might be.\n\n448\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.750\nYou do have that.\n\n449\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.770\nAnd so, each one of these will also have\n\n450\n00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.840\ntheir particular levels of\nwhat they end up doing.\n\n451\n00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.550\nSo, all of these, remember that, the only\nthing we're doing here as we modify this\n\n452\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.690\nstuff, is we're lowering those scores.\n\n453\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.030\nIs what's happening.\n\n454\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.500\nSo you start off with a base score.\n\n455\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.190\nAnd then everything else here you add in\nand you have to kind of walk through and\n\n456\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.720\nfigure it out depending on your\ncontext of what you are doing to\n\n457\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.050\nhelp determine that score.\n\n458\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.330\nNow, once you kind of evaluate all of\nthat, notice I am not getting in depth or\n\n459\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.070\nany detail into this.\n\n460\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.160\nThat's because this is really\nkind of the nitty gritty.\n\n461\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.280\nEvery single one of us will come up\nwith a different modification, so\n\n462\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.680\nthat's why the score's kind of not\npublished as, here's a modified score.\n\n463\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.950\nCuz your organization\nwill do it differently.\n\n464\n00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:47.750\nAll right.\n\n465\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.700\nSo this is what we get into,\n\n466\n00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.920\nwhat Daniel finally-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.062\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much the idea.\n\n510\n00:26:06.062 --> 00:26:07.547\nThere's a gigantic formula and\n\n511\n00:26:07.547 --> 00:26:09.967\nbackground if you want to\ntake a look at the formula,\n\n512\n00:26:09.967 --> 00:26:13.542\nI'm not going to show it to you right\nhere because I don't understand it, but\n\n513\n00:26:13.542 --> 00:26:16.237\nyou can kinda see a summarized\nversion of it on Wikipedia,\n\n514\n00:26:16.237 --> 00:26:19.176\nwhere they go, here's how you do that.\nI looked at it and I was like,\n\n515\n00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:22.283\nthat's still confusing.\n&gt;&gt; Will be on the scope of the exam I'm\n\n516\n00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:22.928\nsure.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n517\n00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:24.060\nif you're on the scope of me,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n518\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say that,\n\n519\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.890\nwon't you turn and take a look.\n\n520\n00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.060\nNow you're not done here right?\n\n521\n00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.770\nSo it's at this point,\nyou go into the vector string, right?\n\n522\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.271\nAnd look at that, does that look familiar?\n\n523\n00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:35.550\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that.\n\n524\n00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.950\nSo there it is,\nit actually starts to pull it out for you.\n\n525\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.270\nAnd you can see what we\nactually set that up.\n\n526\n00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.610\nAnd then you'll continue\nto find it right here.\n\n527\n00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.270\nNotice, there's the exploitation code.\n\n528\n00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.460\nSo we startup with the 4.6.\n\n529\n00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then let's say the code is,\n\n530\n00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:56.985\nlet's do high here, and this one\nunavailable and this one is confirmed.\n\n531\n00:26:57.985 --> 00:26:58.765\n&gt;&gt; That's bad.\n\n532\n00:26:58.765 --> 00:27:01.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the highest score\nwe can get, right, is what?\n\n533\n00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:02.965\n&gt;&gt; Is 4.6.\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah because the base score.\n\n534\n00:27:02.965 --> 00:27:04.695\nYou're not gonna ever get\nanything higher than that.\n\n535\n00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:07.105\nBut yeah that would be\nbad when it comes out.\n\n536\n00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.125\nBut now when you go and\n\n537\n00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:13.200\nthen you take your own information and\nyou go all right, so undefined means what?\n\n538\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.110\nBase score.\n\n539\n00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just used the base score,\n\n540\n00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.210\ndon't worry about.\n\n541\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.530\nSo now if I start changing this,\nlook at what happened immediately.\n\n542\n00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.540\n&gt;&gt; It went down.\n&gt;&gt; It dropped, yeah.\n\n543\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.360\nIt started to drop here.\n\n544\n00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.060\nSo if I go medium, notice it didn't drop,\nlow again, didn't drop.\n\n545\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.980\nLet's see, let's do physical, now notice.\n\n546\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna do the rest but\n\n547\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.020\nyou can kinda get the idea.\n\n548\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.870\nSo that's where these\nscores come into play.\n\n549\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.180\nSo you can take that for\nany vulnerability that you have.\n\n550\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.580\nAnd if you go and you find some system or\nsome vulnerability out there.\n\n551\n00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.971\nI don't know why I think I'm zoomed in,\ncuz I'm not.\n\n552\n00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:45.373\nLet me go back to here, okay?\n\n553\n00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:48.867\nAnd you can take these examples over here,\nand\n\n554\n00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:53.981\nnow you can see where they might\nlist to you the base score, 4.3.\n\n555\n00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:56.208\nAnd you can enter this information in.\n\n556\n00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:59.059\nThen take those temporal metrics\non when you encounter them and\n\n557\n00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:02.125\nwhat you're actually doing you know and\nthe information do that and\n\n558\n00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:05.297\nthen your environmental and\nthen you can just skip the temporal ones,\n\n559\n00:28:05.297 --> 00:28:09.240\ngo directly to your environment and\ncome up with your own base score, okay.\n\n560\n00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.040\nAnd that will hep you to be able\nto prioritize if you have three or\n\n561\n00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.430\nfour of these instead you're going,\n\n562\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.450\nthey all seem to be about the same level\nwell this might help you determine.\n\n563\n00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.650\nHere's what we need to do first,\nsecond, third, prioritization is cool.\n\n564\n00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.560\nNow, that one, this particular\ncalculator right here, okay?\n\n565\n00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.330\nIt kind of, we won over every\nsingle one of these just about.\n\n566\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n567\n00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.519\nBut it does make a little bit complicated.\n\n568\n00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:39.220\nMy gosh,\nwell Cisco of course decided look.\n\n569\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.250\n&gt;&gt; They can be left out of this.\n\n570\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.820\n&gt;&gt; They have the same thing, okay?\n\n571\n00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.340\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in here so\nthat we can see it.\n\n572\n00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.120\nJust a little bit better.\n\n573\n00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.620\nBut they just put everything in line,\nokay.\n\n574\n00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.579\nIt's what they did.\n\n575\n00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:53.113\nSo if you don't wanna\ngo to CVSS calculator,\n\n576\n00:28:53.113 --> 00:28:56.092\nI think they've typed it in somehow.\n\n577\n00:28:56.092 --> 00:29:00.357\nBut here they've just put everything\nin a line instead to make it easier for\n\n578\n00:29:00.357 --> 00:29:02.060\nyou to kind of calculate out.\n\n579\n00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.880\nAnd then notice that once again,\nbase parameters.\n\n580\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.960\nMake sure you understand that\nidea of the base parameters.\n\n581\n00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.970\nNothing changes over time or impacted by\nanything inside of your environment here.\n\n582\n00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.740\nTemporal parameters.\n\n583\n00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.120\nWe've already talked about that.\n\n584\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.460\nChanges over time.\n\n585\n00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.540\nEnvironment.\nThis is what you change, due to this.\n\n586\n00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.990\nAnd then at the end,\nyou can calculate the overall score, okay.\n\n587\n00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.840\nSo that should give you\na score that you can work with\n\n588\n00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.880\non the different vulnerabilities.\n\n589\n00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.650\nIf you have multiple vulnerabilities\nyou're dealing with,\n\n590\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.230\nit will allow you to calculate that out,\n\n591\n00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.310\nallow you then to prioritize them in\nthe way that you need to on your network.\n\n592\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.280\nSo don't think that this is\nkinda the end of what we have,\n\n593\n00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.240\nbut it at least gives you a beginning,\na solid foundation on working with it.\n\n594\n00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.630\nYou'll sometimes end up seeing where they\nwill give like that CVE number that you'll\n\n595\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:55.140\nhave to go and you'll have to actually\nget that from the CVE database and\n\n596\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.160\nthen they'll say,\nhere is what you'll have to determine and\n\n597\n00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.330\nthen you'll add that in there and\ntry determine your own base score as well.\n\n598\n00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.600\nSo from that,\nyou'll see something like that.\n\n599\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.090\nMore than likely on the exam,\nmake sure you know these terms.\n\n600\n00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:14.010\nWe've kinda emphasized all the ones\nthat we can to help you out there,\n\n601\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.960\nbut do not overlook this.\n\n602\n00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.860\nIt may actually impact your\nscore more than you think.\n\n603\n00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.710\nSo make sure you do pay attention,\nas many of the details that are here,\n\n604\n00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.150\nit's worth us taking\nthe time to go through, and\n\n605\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.220\nthat's why we kinda spent\na few episodes on this one.\n\n606\n00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.230\nInstead of going,\n\n607\n00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.110\nyou just have to know it exists and\nknow what the acronym stands for.\n\n608\n00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.290\nI would love questions like that.\n\n609\n00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong,\n\n610\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.300\nthey could ask you that, okay?\n\n611\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.460\nFor all I know but I'm gonna say that\nyou probably gonna be more surprised\n\n612\n00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.098\nat the questions you're gonna get on CVSS.\n\n613\n00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Well you know, I think this is\nactually a really good thing that Cisco\n\n614\n00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.650\nadded this into this exam\nbecause it does help us.\n\n615\n00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.550\nWe need to have some situational awareness\nwhen it comes to our environment and\n\n616\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.460\nthe security there in.\n\n617\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.840\nBecause if we don't then we're just,\nyou know, hoping and\n\n618\n00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.500\npraying that nothing happens.\n\n619\n00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.528\nAnd as I heard before,\nhope is not a strategy.\n\n620\n00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:04.454\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That's not a good strategy.\n\n621\n00:31:04.454 --> 00:31:05.615\nOr a strategy at all.\n\n622\n00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:10.961\nSo, it's good for us to have an idea of\nwhere do we stand when it comes to our\n\n623\n00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:17.280\nsecurity vectors that we have available\nto outside attackers coming in at us.\n\n624\n00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.375\nThis is a great starting point to say,\nokay, boys we really need to buckle down,\n\n625\n00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:24.027\nfigure out how we can make\nthis a little more secure or\n\n626\n00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:28.210\nall right we're already doing really well,\nwe just need to keep up the good work.\n\n627\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.372\nReally cool stuff, and Ronnie,\nthank you so much for showing us,\n\n628\n00:31:30.372 --> 00:31:31.503\nI didn't even know this existed.\n\n629\n00:31:31.503 --> 00:31:33.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I just think it's a great product,\n\n630\n00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:37.967\ngo out there, learn about it, play with\nit, and get prepared for the exam for\n\n631\n00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:39.000\nit as well.\n\n632\n00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.060\nRonnie, thank you again, it's looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode though.\n\n633\n00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.120\nWe thank our audience for\nwatching as well.\n\n634\n00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.250\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n635\n00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.098\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.140\nGreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.370\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.500\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570\nwell brace yourselves cuz we're back\nwith more in our Cisco SecOps series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.870\nBeen a lot of fun so far.\n\n10\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.600\nLearning a lot of cool and interesting\nideas when it comes to the security world\n\n11\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.410\nand joining us back in the studio to help\ncontinue our conversation on that very\n\n12\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.160\ntopic, I get it from Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nsir how are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nthank you again Daniel for\n\n15\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.879\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\nto move through some of the other topics.\n\n16\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820\nWhere we covered just a little bit of\nanalysis and the topics that we can use to\n\n17\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.980\nhelp us as a security analyst inside\nof a security operation center.\n\n18\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.435\nI'm trying to get too many words in.\n\n19\n00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:58.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When we start to see that, we're now\n\n20\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.100\nkind of taking a step to the side a little\nbit and step backward a little bit.\n\n21\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.070\nIn which we're going to be talking\nabout the idea the Windows file system.\n\n22\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.520\nAnd we want to take a look at\nsome of those components and\n\n23\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.110\ndetails that we must understand\nas a security analyst as well.\n\n24\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.820\nAnd this means we're starting\nto dive back into the realm of\n\n25\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.320\ncomputer forensics just a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.560\nAnd we're not gonna get a full long\ncomputer forensics show or series.\n\n27\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.670\n&gt;&gt; We had a show coming out actually.\n\n28\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's what I was about to mention here.\n\n29\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.240\nAnd I think Daniel is actually\nin that particular show.\n\n30\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920\nSo, if you do want to learn more\nabout the realm of computer forensics\n\n31\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.920\nmake sure you take a look at of\ncourse the ITPro.TV library.\n\n32\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.920\nAnd check out the computer\nforensics show there.\n\n33\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.570\nAnd that will help you out much more than\nwhat we're going to be doing today, but\n\n34\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.560\nthere is a few terms,\ngoing to be able to say this.\n\n35\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.130\nThere is a few concepts that we want\nto make sure that you know about and\n\n36\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.740\ndeal with on a day to day\nbasis that most of us,\n\n37\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.410\nif this is our first time really jumping\ninto the analyst side of things.\n\n38\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.460\nWe don't see everything, we just kind\nof experience the hard drive and\n\n39\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.850\neven of course even the operating system\nalmost as we take it for granted, right?\n\n40\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.630\nThe very fact is we install\nan operating system on the computer,\n\n41\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.780\nwe don't think anything\nabout the drive itself.\n\n42\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.290\nDaniel, do you think about FAT32 or\nNTFS when you end up using your computer.\n\n43\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.876\n&gt;&gt; Almost never.\n\n44\n00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:28.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never yeah, it's\n\n45\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.680\njust not something that crosses our\nmind on a typical day to day basis.\n\n46\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.030\nEvery now and\nthen that kind of thing will pop up.\n\n47\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690\nI'm trying to save a file that's 6\ngigs in size and it's not doing it.\n\n48\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.090\nIt's because it's this drive is\nformatted fat 32 and I need to move it.\n\n49\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.850\nThat's the kind of thing that will bring\nit to the forefront but typically.\n\n50\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.080\nNo, you're not thinking about that.\n\n51\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.300\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we want to\nget back into this right,\n\n52\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.010\nis that a lot of the things that we now\ntake for granted as an analyst especially\n\n53\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.330\nif you believe something is happening that\nyou wanna learn a little bit more about\n\n54\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.130\nthe details of the file systems\nthat you're gonna be working with.\n\n55\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.290\nSo let's kind of step into that, and\n\n56\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.820\nwe're gonna have another\nconversation piece here in a moment.\n\n57\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.600\nLet's take a look at my screen and\n\n58\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.380\nlet's talk about what we're really dealing\nwith when that first begins, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.600\nWhich is the idea of the hard drive,\n\n60\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.560\nonce again something we kind of take for\ngranted.\n\n61\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.780\nWe buy a machine, the operating system is\ninstalled on it, the only time we really\n\n62\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.270\ndo think about it at all is, I start\nrunning out of space, or if it breaks.\n\n63\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n64\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Is really what it comes down to.\n\n65\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.100\nSo in previous years, right,\nwe started off this way.\n\n66\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.440\nWhere this was kind of our best bet,\nright.\n\n67\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.080\nThe conventional hard drive in which we\nhad a spindle right here in the center.\n\n68\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.060\nAnd of course platters\nthe aperture arm and\n\n69\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.460\nthe writing instrument that gives us the\nability of course to store, to read data,\n\n70\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.170\nto write data,\nto that mechanical drive that we have.\n\n71\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.630\nElectromagnetic field, you name it.\n\n72\n00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690\nYou kind of get the idea, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.260\nSo when we deal with something like that,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n74\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.430\nwe use it in the same way that we do.\n\n75\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.990\nWhich today, I'm actually beginning\nto think that even more common today,\n\n76\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.370\nwe're starting to run into the SSDs.\n\n77\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.360\nNow I didn't try to draw a true SSD,\nbut this is like a chip.\n\n78\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.562\n&gt;&gt; Looks like the door\non my school library.\n\n79\n00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:17.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lunch room, yeah,\n\n80\n00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.060\nthe school lunch room.\n\n81\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.420\nDoor as they peak out there when\nyou don't throw things at them.\n\n82\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nright here on this one is just a chip, and\n\n83\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.730\nwe store data on here.\n\n84\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.310\nEverything is kept electronically.\n\n85\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.500\nThe advantages in terms of speed is great,\nokay?\n\n86\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.180\nWith this one we have to worry\nabout read and write speeds,\n\n87\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.440\nwe have to worry about disk contention or\nwhat we call disk IO, input output.\n\n88\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.510\nAll of that stuff matters where\nas this one it doesn't have to\n\n89\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.050\nworry about it so much.\n\n90\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.380\nSo if we compare these two, the SSD for\nthe majority of what we're doing\n\n91\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.720\nis probably going to be where we\ntend to reside in terms of speed,\n\n92\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.490\nthis is where we're going.\n\n93\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.060\nBut let's talk about\nthe Windows file system, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.100\nDaniel, if we have\na hard drive right here,\n\n95\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.300\njust let's say that we buy a hard drive.\n\n96\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.650\nMy own hard drive is done and\neverything is kind of at its end.\n\n97\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.380\nAnd I go ahead and I order a new\nhard drive from some online store,\n\n98\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.590\nand it gets here.\n\n99\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.585\nI can just slap the disk in and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n100\n00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.035\nGo everything is gonna pop right back up,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:22.865\nI don't have to worry about anything else,\ndo I?\n\n102\n00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:23.539\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely wrong.\n\n103\n00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:24.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n104\n00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:26.435\n&gt;&gt; No, obviously, when you get the disk,\n\n105\n00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:27.395\nit is completely blank.\n\n106\n00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:28.565\nIt has nothing on it,\n\n107\n00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:32.235\nnot even a file system for\nyou to be able to write and read from.\n\n108\n00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:35.795\nSo that would be our first stop\nis laying a file system down\n\n109\n00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:36.925\nover the top of the thing.\n\n110\n00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:39.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we\nwanna talk about just briefly.\n\n111\n00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.085\nMost of the time,\n\n112\n00:05:40.085 --> 00:05:43.770\neven if you're good at computing,\njust kinda review this concept with me.\n\n113\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.732\nIf you're really good just\nskip it if you want to.\n\n114\n00:05:45.732 --> 00:05:48.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But overall though, just remember,\n\n115\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.090\nwhat does the file system really do for\nus and why is it so important?\n\n116\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.290\nWell first and foremost, right,\n\n117\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.710\nthe file really helps to organize\nthe data on the physical disk itself.\n\n118\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.080\nWhen it comes down to something\nlike a conventional hard drive.\n\n119\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.640\nWithout that,\n\n120\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.420\nif we store data on that disk, we don't\nknow how to get access to it again.\n\n121\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.380\nThe operating system says, hey,\nI'm looking to get access to this.\n\n122\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.960\nAnd the hard drive is just gonna say,\nwell, it's here somewhere.\n\n123\n00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.680\nYou can look around all you want.\n\n124\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.370\nMaybe you'll find traces of it.\n\n125\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.480\n&gt;&gt; But\nthere's no particular order to this.\n\n127\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.520\nWell the file system\nhelps us to organize and\n\n128\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.140\nestablish the order to the data\nas it lays it onto the disc.\n\n129\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.100\nIt makes sense for us as well.\n\n130\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.270\nIt also helps us to manage the free space\nthat we have on whatever storage and\n\n131\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.930\nmedia that's actually out there.\n\n132\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.300\nAnd this is also important because as we\nwant to actually get more efficient and\n\n133\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.240\nspeed.\n\n134\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.680\nWanna make sure that all the files\nare stored in the proper area.\n\n135\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.670\nAnd the free space of course is also\nstored in a contiguous chunk as well.\n\n136\n00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.360\nAnd even at this point, right,\nbeing able to specify a particular\n\n137\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.740\npath directly to that data, all that\nis done through the file system itself.\n\n138\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.836\nSo it allows them now that we've talked\nabout the idea of a file system to go\n\n139\n00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:03.364\nahead and\n\n140\n00:07:03.364 --> 00:07:08.140\nput that into the drive folders first\nbefore we have an operating system on it.\n\n141\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.990\nIt is really is gonna help essentially for\nus to build and use that.\n\n142\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.150\nSo Daniel,\n\n143\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.030\nlet's start by some of the issues that can\nhappen especially when it comes down to\n\n144\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.710\nwhen we start talking about the forensic\nside of things just briefly here.\n\n145\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.860\nNow when we start to deal with this,\nright, this show,\n\n146\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.280\neven though we're talking about just\nthe basics here, we're not gonna install\n\n147\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.720\nan operating system, we're not even really\ntalking about moving files back and\n\n148\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.710\nforth between one disk to another, but\nwe want to actually make sure that we\n\n149\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.950\nunderstand that that file system\nis primo important, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.560\nHow else do we describe this?\n\n151\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.390\nSo, if there is a corruption\non the file system\n\n152\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.045\nthe chances are if I know that\nthere's some information on that data.\n\n153\n00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:53.935\nThen I have to be able to retrieve that.\n\n154\n00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:57.895\nBut I might actually have to find out,\nhow is the file system okay?\n\n155\n00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.487\nSo I need to know what\nfile system's on it.\n\n156\n00:07:59.487 --> 00:08:00.285\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n157\n00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:01.884\n&gt;&gt; I need to be able to\nactually understand,\n\n158\n00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:03.676\nare there any details\nabout that file system?\n\n159\n00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:05.185\nAnd Daniel mentioned some.\n\n160\n00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:10.541\nFor FAT, right, that may actually\nsize limitations to it, that I go,\n\n161\n00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:15.480\nno, I know that it's supposed to\nbe a six gig file, that's on that.\n\n162\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.010\nWell, and then I look, and\nI realize it's a FAT32 volume.\n\n163\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.560\nWell, then I know that something is wrong.\n\n164\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.160\nSo we actually need to understand\nsomething like this as we\n\n165\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.510\nstart to take a look here, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.519\nThe other thing we also want to talk\nabout it what happens then, and\n\n167\n00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.178\nwe're going to get into this\nin a little bit more in depth.\n\n168\n00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:37.684\nBut just as a teaser here, Daniel,\nif we end up finding out that that\n\n169\n00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:42.270\ncomputer is gonna be used in some\ntype of legal case in the future, and\n\n170\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.300\nnow you actually see\nthe computers running.\n\n171\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.900\nWhat I do with that hard drive?\n\n172\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.820\nDo I just go in and shut down the machine?\n\n173\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.690\nDo I go ahead and\nformat the drive so they can use it?\n\n174\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.620\nWhat would I need to do?\n\n175\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can totally do those things\nif you don't want to submit that in\n\n176\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.287\nas evidence.\n\n177\n00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:02.580\nSo [LAUGH] when it comes to something that\nyou may be working with in a legal term,\n\n178\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.160\nlegal sense, you want to keep\nthe integrity of that file system and\n\n179\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.110\nthat device as solid as a rock.\n\n180\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.330\nYou do not wanna mess with it at all\notherwise they'll call into question\n\n181\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.300\nthe evidence and\nit will not be admissible.\n\n182\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.490\nSo when it comes to that drive,\nif there's any question about being able\n\n183\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.650\nto use it as evidence,\nthen you need to make sure that\n\n184\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.610\nit stays unchanged throughout\nthe lifecycle of that litigation.\n\n185\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's incumbent upon us then as analysts\n\n186\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.760\nto be able to know as many of\nthose details as we need to.\n\n187\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.640\nSo that if we are getting\nready to present this\n\n188\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.870\nas some type of evidence in\nsome proceeding, legal case,\n\n189\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.640\nthat's out there that we know what those\ndetails are nd some of the things that we\n\n190\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.330\nhave to be able to make sure that\nit's actually clear in our mind.\n\n191\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.210\nSo that is what we're going\nto talk about today and\n\n192\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.300\nunderstand some of the details\nbehind them so we know whether or\n\n193\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.510\nnot the information can be\nretrieved the way that we want to.\n\n194\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.299\nOr if there's corruption on it, or\n\n195\n00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:01.470\nif we actually have to do something\nelse with the drive itself.\n\n196\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.190\nSo let's talk about the idea of file\nsystems here just briefly as well.\n\n197\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.990\nI went ahead and listed kinda\nthe major ones that we tend to see\n\n198\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.550\njust kind of out there on a day\nto day basis at this point.\n\n199\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.380\nSome of these, of course,\n\n200\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.190\nare not used as regularly as other\nones are actually used down there.\n\n201\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.140\nBut these are the ones that you do see,\nand\n\n202\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.990\nsome of them have more\nbenefits than the others.\n\n203\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.470\nAnd we'll get to some of those\nas we go on through this,\n\n204\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.460\nbut I just wanted a basic\nlist at the beginning.\n\n205\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.700\nOkay, so when we start talking about file\nsystems, kind of the earliest ones that\n\n206\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.610\nyou and I will probably end up dealing\nwith is some type of what we call FAT,\n\n207\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.700\nFile Allocation Table.\n\n208\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.660\nSo this particular type\nof file location table\n\n209\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.640\ncomes in a couple of different\nvarieties and flavors.\n\n210\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.338\nYou might hear the term FAT16,\nyou might hear the term FAT32.\n\n211\n00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:53.690\nThat's probably the most common\none that's available out there.\n\n212\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.070\nBut that's actually a file\nsystem that is available for\n\n213\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.860\nwhat we actually want to be able to do.\n\n214\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.486\nIf we need to be able to store\nfiles onto a hard drive,\n\n215\n00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:04.770\nwe might use something like that.\n\n216\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.390\nOkay, now we also have now,\nwhat you hear about sometimes as\n\n217\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.220\nextended File Allocation Table\nbecause of the limitations.\n\n218\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.290\nAnd you might wonder,\nwhy did they actually make this limited?\n\n219\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:22.061\nWell, it was kind of really established\nway early in the days of, now, Daniel.\n\n220\n00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:24.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna kind of see if I can give\n\n221\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.040\nyou a little bit of a shocker.\n\n222\n00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.550\nThe very first hard drive,\nthe very first hard drive\n\n223\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.440\nI ever worked on as a support technician,\nit was a 20 megabyte hard drive.\n\n224\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.060\n&gt;&gt; That's small.\n\n225\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.880\n&gt;&gt; 20 megabytes.\n\n226\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.040\n&gt;&gt; That's little.\n\n227\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.740\n&gt;&gt; It was little, I was in college.\n\n228\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.621\nBut then, a professor ended up\nbuying a 40 megabyte hard drive and\n\n229\n00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:45.607\nwe were just blown out of our mind.\n\n230\n00:11:45.607 --> 00:11:48.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We thought, there is no way, but\n\n231\n00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:49.766\nwhat existed at the time?\n\n232\n00:11:49.766 --> 00:11:52.370\nFile Allocation Table.\n\n233\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.750\nThat is what existed at that point.\n\n234\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.756\nSo what about these other ones?\n\n235\n00:11:56.756 --> 00:11:57.820\nNot so much, right?\n\n236\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.690\nSo when they started realizing that\nthese drives were gonna grow big,\n\n237\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.889\nwere going to continue to be this way and\nstorage was pretty much the future,\n\n238\n00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:08.400\nthey realized that they\nneeded to also grow.\n\n239\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.460\nAnd this is where\nthe Extended File Allocation Table\n\n240\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.550\nalso comes into play as well.\n\n241\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.360\nRemoving some of the limitations\nin terms of file size and\n\n242\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.530\neven the idea here when we start\ntaking a look at that, right?\n\n243\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.030\nAnd those limitations\nare relatively small in comparison.\n\n244\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.460\nBut also the portability of these things,\ntoo.\n\n245\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.619\nFAT and exFAT usually portable\neven between Linux systems and\n\n246\n00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.900\nApple systems and Microsoft systems.\n\n247\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.340\nSo you might see that.\n\n248\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.776\nThe Hierarchical File System Plus here,\nthis is also another type\n\n249\n00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:49.517\nof file system that we generally see\nused inside a Mac OS a lot of times.\n\n250\n00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:53.930\nAn older version of it is pretty\nmuch what we'll end up seeing, too.\n\n251\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:59.130\nAnd then, of course,\nin Unix kind of defaults is the EXT, and\n\n252\n00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.420\nthere's EXT2, 3, and\n4 out there that you'll also see.\n\n253\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.370\nAnd then New Technology File System,\n\n254\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.040\nthe one that we're probably most\nfamiliar with today, is NTFS.\n\n255\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.570\nOkay, now it's funny.\n\n256\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.690\nNTFS was really designed around\nthe Windows NT operating system to give it\n\n257\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.190\nthe stability that it needed in comparison\nto the idea of the File Allocation Table,\n\n258\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.000\nand it's kind of been around.\n\n259\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.420\nIt's kind of operated as kind\nof the default for a long time.\n\n260\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:33.200\nMost of us are fairly familiar with it,\nbecause really after Windows 95,\n\n261\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.730\nit was actually XP and Windows 2000,\n\n262\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.830\nthat NTFS really came on the scene for\nmost people\n\n263\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:47.560\nthat they would actually end up dealing\nwith a file system that's out there.\n\n264\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.620\nIt'd be NTFS is pretty much\nthe ones that we wanna see.\n\n265\n00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.470\nNow as we're preparing for the exam,\n\n266\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:58.080\nI know this sounds fairly elementary,\nbut you should be able to\n\n267\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.650\nidentify which ones are natively supported\nin the Windows file systems here.\n\n268\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.157\nFAT and NTFS are pretty much the two that\nare kind of the real natives here, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:09.157 --> 00:14:11.717\nSo at one point it was actually given,\n\n270\n00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:16.677\nlike if you were installing Windows,\nokay, and I think even Windows XP,\n\n271\n00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:20.771\nthat you could choose to install\nit with FAT32 if chose to.\n\n272\n00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:25.132\nBut if you did, you lost some of the\nability to do things like compression and\n\n273\n00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:29.564\nthen the encryption that you would also\nhave, and the ability to disc code and\n\n274\n00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:30.610\nstuff like that.\n\n275\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.770\n&gt;&gt; File permissions is the big one, right?\n\n276\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.039\n&gt;&gt; Permissions is the big one.\n\n277\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.650\nAnd so the warning was fairly simple.\n\n278\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.550\nIt's like you can do this as long\nas you have a good reason to,\n\n279\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.670\nbut if you don't have a good reason to,\n\n280\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.050\nlet it default what it actually wants to\ndefault as which is going to be NTFS.\n\n281\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.800\n&gt;&gt; Which also supports\nlarger file sizes as well.\n\n282\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.850\nI mean there's just so\nmany advantages to going to NTFS.\n\n283\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.260\nCouldn't think of really any\ngood reason to stay on FAT.\n\n284\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if somebody had a good reason\nto stay on it, then they could, but\n\n285\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.270\nyeah, most people didn't.\n\n286\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.250\nAnd what we used to call it though, right,\n\n287\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.840\nthe term that we use around\nhere about back in the day.\n\n288\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back in the day.\n\n289\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.975\n&gt;&gt; We love that term for\nsome reason, back in the day.\n\n290\n00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:12.020\nIt's because we're dual booting, right?\n\n291\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.290\nUsing the Windows 98 and the Windows XP,\n\n292\n00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.230\nwe're still dual booting\nboth of those things.\n\n293\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.540\nSo you boot into one and then go,\ncrud, I need my Windows 98 machine.\n\n294\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.360\nThen you boot into the other one.\n\n295\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.950\nWell, you might find out that you had\nto kind of choose one or the other.\n\n296\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.430\nIf you wanted them to be compatible\nyou had to choose the right one.\n\n297\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.400\nSo you might see stuff like that.\n\n298\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.140\nBut at least at a very simplistic level,\n\n299\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.880\nidentify which of these essentially ends\nup being the ones that are native to\n\n300\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.380\nthe Windows file system since that's what\nwe're really focusing in on here, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.455\nNow even though we're\nreally focusing in on this,\n\n302\n00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:54.556\nwe're just learning about a few of\nthe details between those two right now.\n\n303\n00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:59.356\nAnd FAT, like I said, there's two\ndifferent versions, FAT16 and FAT32.\n\n304\n00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:02.259\nFAT32 is probably the one that\nyou'll see most often today.\n\n305\n00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:06.851\nIn this one, it does allow you to keep\ntrack of what they call allocation status\n\n306\n00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:10.430\nand that's an important\nterm that we need to know.\n\n307\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.600\nNow, it's not gonna be something that\nwe're gonna have to deal with too much,\n\n308\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.786\nbut this idea of allocation means\nhow much space is it taking up?\n\n309\n00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:22.470\nThere's allocated, there's unallocated.\n\n310\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:27.590\nSo those are some of the different\nstatuses that we're talking about,\n\n311\n00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.580\nand then you also have end of file and\nbad sectors.\n\n312\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.700\nSo it keeps track essentially of\nthose types of information for\n\n313\n00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.100\nus too, along with the data itself.\n\n314\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.204\nNow, when we start to take a look.\n\n315\n00:16:40.204 --> 00:16:42.942\nNow, you do wanna know the maximum file or\n\n316\n00:16:42.942 --> 00:16:47.020\nvolume size limitation that we have or\nfile size limitation.\n\n317\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.730\nAnd we'll talk about volume size as well,\nokay?\n\n318\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.920\nOn FAT or FAT32, which is probably what\nwe normally mean when we talk about FAT\n\n319\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.790\ntoday, a single file size,\nthe max size is gonna be four gigs.\n\n320\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.780\nNow, if you were running like FAT16,\nI believe it was 2 Gigs was kinda the max,\n\n321\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.730\nbut usually on FAT32 it's 4\nGigs is the maximum file size.\n\n322\n00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.820\nIn terms of volumes that you do this,\n\n323\n00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.910\na max of up to 2 terabytes is\nwhat you also have as well.\n\n324\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.030\nSo you couldn't access drives that\nwere larger than 2 terabytes.\n\n325\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.726\nIf you did have a hard drive larger than\n2 Terabytes you'd have to partition it\n\n326\n00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:27.589\noff form another volume to build\nbe able to access it as well.\n\n327\n00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:32.077\nThe limitation also that we have here\nno compression and no encryption.,\n\n328\n00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:34.480\nthat's pretty much it, okay.\n\n329\n00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.200\nSo good to kinda solve the little\nreview there and if you're unsure,\n\n330\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.090\nmake sure you go back and also check out\nthings that you might have on ITProTV.\n\n331\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.149\nLook at the A+ show,\nlook at some of these,\n\n332\n00:17:48.149 --> 00:17:52.378\nwe probably go over these details\nad nauseam in those shows.\n\n333\n00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:55.970\nBut good reminder if you're\nactually looking for information.\n\n334\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.363\nSo when it comes back\ndown to forensics again.\n\n335\n00:17:59.363 --> 00:18:02.120\nSo let's come back to this idea.\n\n336\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.420\nWhat are some of those details that I\njust mentioned that might be interesting?\n\n337\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.530\nWe already mentioned one which is\nthe idea the file size, right.\n\n338\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.456\nIf somebody says, I pulled off a file\nthat was 6 Gigabytes, 6 Terabytes.\n\n339\n00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:17.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That'd be pretty interesting too.\n\n340\n00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:21.350\nA 6 Gigabyte file, and\n\n341\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:27.450\nthen somebody else says well,\nwhat was the file system that was on it.\n\n342\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.275\nYou gotta know that it's probably not,\nwhat, at 32.\n\n343\n00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.217\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense here, so,\n\n344\n00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:34.407\nyou might do that or if you go, hey,\n\n345\n00:18:34.407 --> 00:18:39.430\nthis file was encrypted,\nusing the native file system encryption.\n\n346\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.960\nWell, that 32 doesn't support\nencryption or compression on this.\n\n347\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.250\nSo you've got to understand some of\nthose details when you're looking for\n\n348\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.650\nthe information.\n\n349\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.840\nAnd what might actually have\nto kind of stand out to you,\n\n350\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.940\nbut that's kind of the big\nones that we have.\n\n351\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.158\nNow, we're now gonna focus in on NTFS.\n\n352\n00:19:00.158 --> 00:19:03.811\nAnd this is gonna take the majority of the\ntime that we have left and may even take,\n\n353\n00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:07.500\nnow, that I look at it, maybe even\ntake part of the next show, here.\n\n354\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.270\nBecause this is the one that we all\nuse and this one has many more details\n\n355\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.050\nthat we need to make sure that we do take\na look at and understand as well, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.146\nWith the NTFS, there's a couple\nof different things that go on\n\n357\n00:19:21.146 --> 00:19:24.333\nhere that we wanna make\nsure that we understand.\n\n358\n00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:29.880\nWith NTFS, it keeps track of\nwhat we call different metadata.\n\n359\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.690\nAll right, Daniel,\nI just spewed out a gigantic term there.\n\n360\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.725\nMetadata, it sounds fancy, it sounds\nFrench, Daniel, what do you think?\n\n361\n00:19:38.725 --> 00:19:39.373\n&gt;&gt; It's Greek actually.\n\n362\n00:19:39.373 --> 00:19:43.000\n&gt;&gt; It's Greek, it is,\nyeah, so feta, fetadata.\n\n363\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.828\nIt's about cheese [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:19:43.828 --> 00:19:45.540\n&gt;&gt; Meta is a Greek term.\n\n365\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.244\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is a Greek.\n\n366\n00:19:46.244 --> 00:19:48.693\n&gt;&gt; It means like under or around.\n\n367\n00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:49.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kinda surrounding.\n\n368\n00:19:49.878 --> 00:19:51.982\n&gt;&gt; Right, surrounding and basically,\n\n369\n00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:55.010\nI always say metadata is\ninformation about data.\n\n370\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.520\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n371\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's information about\n\n372\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.524\nthe information.\n\n373\n00:19:57.524 --> 00:19:59.925\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's kinda make sure that we,\n\n374\n00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:01.380\ncuz most of the time.\n\n375\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.894\nI kinda go, yeah, sure, we'll deal\nwith the metadata on that stuff.\n\n376\n00:20:04.894 --> 00:20:07.253\nI may not have a clue what\nI'm even talking about, but\n\n377\n00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:09.782\nlet's make sure we know what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n378\n00:20:09.782 --> 00:20:14.080\nSo for example, Daniel,\nit's not the data that's in a file.\n\n379\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.777\nSo if I say here's a file that has\npay information into it, okay.\n\n380\n00:20:18.777 --> 00:20:19.441\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n381\n00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:24.098\n&gt;&gt; The metadata of that file might\nbe information that you might\n\n382\n00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:28.860\nfind out about that file itself,\nsuch as the time stamp.\n\n383\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.530\nWhen that file was actually generated,\nokay?\n\n384\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.650\nWhen it was modified,\ninformation like that.\n\n385\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.550\nDid somebody post a tag on it and\n\n386\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.710\nadd additional data to that file, so\nthat it can be found in some way?\n\n387\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.360\nSo is data about the actual file or\n\n388\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.990\nabout the data itself,\nwhen we start to take a look?\n\n389\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:56.117\nWell, NTFS says, look, it's not enough\nto say that I can put a file in place,\n\n390\n00:20:56.117 --> 00:20:59.243\nand make sure that you\ncan retrieve it back out.\n\n391\n00:20:59.243 --> 00:21:04.032\nBut it also is about keeping\ntrack of metadata here, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:04.032 --> 00:21:07.087\nAnd, very important process,\nin terms of forensics,\n\n393\n00:21:07.087 --> 00:21:09.687\nwhen it comes to things\nlike time stamping, and\n\n394\n00:21:09.687 --> 00:21:14.890\nsome different information that we have,\nyou know, that we wanna talk about too.\n\n395\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.320\nWhen we start to take a look\nat the metadata of NTFS,\n\n396\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.870\nit really does track, let me see,\none, two, three, four, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.050\nIt tracks four different aspects here and\n\n398\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:30.040\nlet me go and type this in,\ncuz I didn't do it right here.\n\n399\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:36.049\nAnd that will help us and this should be\nsomething you want to take a look at too.\n\n400\n00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:39.260\nAnd they're all hidden when\nyou start to take a look here.\n\n401\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.807\nSo it begins with, oops, all hidden\nwhich would be dollar sign, right?\n\n402\n00:21:44.807 --> 00:21:47.988\n&gt;&gt; MFT master file table, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:48.699\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n404\n00:21:48.699 --> 00:21:55.170\nSo MFT that makes sense, and\nthen there's also going to be a bit map.\n\n405\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.410\nThen there's also gonna be log, and\nnlogs are essentially metadata.\n\n406\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:08.513\nSo there's gonna be a log file, and\nthen ultirnately boot data, all right?\n\n407\n00:22:08.513 --> 00:22:12.262\nSo those are kind of the big things\nin terms of metadata that we\n\n408\n00:22:12.262 --> 00:22:14.360\nkeep track, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.690\nSo it has the ability to actually take\nthe information, the metadata and store\n\n410\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.190\nit in these kind of hidden files that we\nhave there on the actual drive itself.\n\n411\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.670\nTo give us what we need, besides just\nthe files and retrieving the files,\n\n412\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.260\nand being able to write and\nmodify the files themselves.\n\n413\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.510\nIt keeps track of all that because of\nthe other things that it does, such as\n\n414\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.310\ncompression and encryption, which are kind\nof the two things that we really do like.\n\n415\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.570\nDisk quotas gives us the ability to do\nrecovery as well as some performance\n\n416\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.330\naspects that are really\nneat about NTFS as well.\n\n417\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:54.070\nAnd even some of the reliability features\nthat we have available through NTFS.\n\n418\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:59.200\nSo these are very important types of\nthings that we need to know about\n\n419\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.770\nthe idea of using NTFS for us, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.980\nNow, when we start to take a look at this,\nright?\n\n421\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.565\nRemember that because of the preferred\nfile system, we're likely to see it,\n\n422\n00:23:11.565 --> 00:23:14.072\ntoday I'm gonna assume almost 100%.\n\n423\n00:23:14.072 --> 00:23:19.600\nI just don't know of anybody that's said,\nyou know I'm running Windows 10 on On FAT.\n\n424\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.150\nI don't even know if you can,\nI haven't tried.\n\n425\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.457\nI [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Do it just to say that you've done it.\n\n426\n00:23:24.457 --> 00:23:26.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna say that,\n\n427\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.080\nI mean Windows, yeah.\n\n428\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.990\nI can't even remember anybody\non Windows XP saying, just for\n\n429\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.200\nthe fun of it I'm gonna run this on FAT.\n\n430\n00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just don't\n\n431\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.900\nremember anything like that.\n\n432\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.150\nSo I'm gonna say you're\ngonna see this more often.\n\n433\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.720\nAnd that means you have to deal with a lot\nmore when it comes down to forensics.\n\n434\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.160\nWhen you think that all you're looking for\nis just the files that are on the drive,\n\n435\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.650\nNTFS promises the analyst that they\ncan get access to more, right.\n\n436\n00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.070\nThose things that we just talked about,\nthe master file table, the bitmap,\n\n437\n00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.140\nthe log files and the boot.\n\n438\n00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.970\nAll that about every single file\nthat's actually on the drive itself,\n\n439\n00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.930\nall that information is stored.\n\n440\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.210\nOkay, now we do need to talk\nabout something else here,\n\n441\n00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.710\nwhich we'll get to which is what we\ncall the volume structure of NTFS and\n\n442\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.470\nhow the data is actually stored and\nhow it's actually separated out.\n\n443\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.490\nBut I have once again come to that point\nwhere I'm not gonna be able to describe it\n\n444\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.716\nin the last two or\nthree minutes of the show.\n\n445\n00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:25.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we need to go ahead and\n\n446\n00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:27.070\ncarry that over to a part two.\n\n447\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.058\nWho would have guessed,\nDaniel that I would-\n\n448\n00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n449\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.658\n&gt;&gt; Actually do something like that.\n\n450\n00:24:29.658 --> 00:24:32.249\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nwe never have multiple [INAUDIBLE] wait.\n\n451\n00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:34.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The opposite of that is true.\n\n452\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.590\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n453\n00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.210\n&gt;&gt; But\nit's cool because it's great information.\n\n454\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.639\nThis is stuff that you have to\nknow as a security professional,\n\n455\n00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:45.858\nsomeone that's working within a security\nrole inside of your environment.\n\n456\n00:24:45.858 --> 00:24:48.658\nSo Ronnie we're more than\nhappy to listen to wax\n\n457\n00:24:48.658 --> 00:24:53.800\neloquent you about file systems that\nare supported by Windows operating system.\n\n458\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.843\nSo we'll come back for a part two on that.\n\n459\n00:24:54.843 --> 00:24:56.246\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie so much for\n\n460\n00:24:56.246 --> 00:24:57.280\njoining us so far.\n\n461\n00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.820\nWe hope you'll be back for\npart two as well.\n\n462\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.678\nUntil then though we're gonna go ahead

Here they dive into filesystems supported by the Windows Operating System, which includes: File Allocation Table(FAT) and New Technology File System(NTFS), as well as how we handle them in a forensically sound way. Also covered: Alternate Data Streams, MACE, EFI, and Timestamps.",

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.164\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:16.871\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.620\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.259\nAnd in today's episode, that's right,\nwe're back with more on our\n\n8\n00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.310\nCisco Cyber Security Operations, I think,\nSec Ops, we like to call it around here.\n\n9\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.420\nJoining us back in studio to\ncontinue that conversation and\n\n10\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240\nthat series, we've got Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.000\nRonnie, welcome back,\nwe're glad to have you yet again.\n\n12\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.140\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.010\n&gt;&gt; It is going great,\nDaniel, thank you again.\n\n14\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.300\nAs we continue on in our Part 2 right here\non the Windows file system understanding\n\n15\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.550\na little bit more.\n\n16\n00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.020\nWe had just really gotten into the NTFS.\n\n17\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.304\nWe've talked about FAT32 and FAT.\n\n18\n00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:52.506\nSome of these details,\nagain, not exactly the most\n\n19\n00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:56.890\nenthralling or life-changing,\n&gt;&gt; Riveting,\n\n20\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Content in the world.\n\n21\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.150\nBut at the same time,\n\n22\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.370\nit's stuff that analysts at least has to\nhave the foundation of in their mind when\n\n23\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.710\nwe begin this process of understanding\nthe computer forensics a little bit more.\n\n24\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.540\nNow as we move into NTFS, we start to\nlearn that NTFS though is not only about\n\n25\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.310\nthe file system, putting it in a logical\nplace and then the operating system or\n\n26\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.930\nyou being able to request it and retrieve\nit very quickly and what we need to do.\n\n27\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.790\nNow NTFS also stores metadata and\nthat is data about the data itself.\n\n28\n00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.191\nI know it's strange, but\nthat's the easiest way that I remember it.\n\n29\n00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:34.357\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, data about data [LAUGH].\n\n30\n00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:35.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, data about data.\n\n31\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.490\nIt kinda makes it easier to remember that\nthere's a lot more that goes on with your\n\n32\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.728\ndata than we think.\n\n33\n00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:45.056\nAnd the metadata is so\nimportant, especially in today's\n\n34\n00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:50.004\nworld of cloud computing and\nthe way that metrics end up working and\n\n35\n00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:55.682\nthe way that everything else is going\nhere, metadata's super important.\n\n36\n00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.256\nBut in terms of forensics,\nit can also, of course,\n\n37\n00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.783\nlead you to things that we\nreally wanna know about.\n\n38\n00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:05.533\nAnd the kind of key element behind almost\neverything here are things like time\n\n39\n00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:06.570\nstamps, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.335\nAnd what actually we're taking a look at.\n\n41\n00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:13.314\nAnd that's because timing is critical\nto the events of what's going on,\n\n42\n00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:16.820\nespecially in a forensics\ncase that's happening here.\n\n43\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.620\nThat they wanna make sure they know\nwhat's happening at any particular\n\n44\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.850\nmoment in time.\n\n45\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.830\nAnd we'll see that a little bit\nmore in a little bit later on here.\n\n46\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.470\nNow I want to talk about something I\nthink is absolutely cool that I did not\n\n47\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.870\nreally think about for\nthe file system itself.\n\n48\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.990\nDaniel, I'm going to ask you cuz\nI'm pretty sure you'll be honest\n\n49\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.820\nwith me about this.\n\n50\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.310\nHave you ever heard of alternative\ndata streams before, Daniel?\n\n51\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, actually I have.\n\n52\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.111\nIt's a interesting little ability\nof the NTFS file system to\n\n53\n00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:54.282\nbasically kind of hide or\ninject data into already existing data.\n\n54\n00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:57.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing,\nbecause we already have metadata, right?\n\n55\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.980\nNTFS goes, sure,\nyou can store data about this data here.\n\n56\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.540\nWell, imagine now what\nan attacker might be able to do\n\n57\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.590\nif working with somebody on\nthe inside that knows about ADS.\n\n58\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.230\nADS, is that what you call it?\n\n59\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.150\nThe proper acronym.\n\n60\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.760\nI forget acronyms.\n\n61\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.606\nWe learn so many of them and I forget\nmore of them then I end up learning.\n\n62\n00:03:18.606 --> 00:03:22.285\nBut if somebody on the inside really\ndoes need to get information outbound,\n\n63\n00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:26.310\nthey don't have to take advantage of\nsomething like, all right, Daniel, we need\n\n64\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.350\nto get this message out here, but it needs\nto make sure that it doesn't get caught.\n\n65\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.530\nWell Daniel goes,\nlet me just open up Notepad, and\n\n66\n00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.513\nI'll just go ahead and create that.\n\n67\n00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And send out an email attachment.\n\n68\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.634\nEmail attachment gets flagged,\nand there you go,\n\n69\n00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.155\ncuz it's got a phrase like run now.\n\n70\n00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Phrase in it, cops are coming.\n\n71\n00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:44.990\n&gt;&gt; Cops are coming,\nthey're heading to your house, run now.\n\n72\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.370\nYeah, we don't have to\nactually have that happen.\n\n73\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.132\nSo an attacker that understands\nhow alternative data streams work,\n\n74\n00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:59.980\nlike Daniel, he could ex-filtrate\ninformation very quickly.\n\n75\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.000\nBut the weird thing about\nthis is in the other metadata\n\n76\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.140\nthat we understand and know about it\nmay actually not show it up at all.\n\n77\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.640\nSo, Daniel, if I add something to a file,\n\n78\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.960\nlet's just say Notepad,\nI add in 10, 15 lines of data.\n\n79\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.030\nIt might generate and\ntell me I have 6-700 bytes of data,\n\n80\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.450\nso the file size itself kinda increases.\n\n81\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.950\nBut Daniel, what if I use that\nmetadata and we do type that in?\n\n82\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.750\nHey, run now, cop's on the way, and\n\n83\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.220\nwe send that off, what about the file\nsize, do you think that changes?\n\n84\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.560\n&gt;&gt; You would think that it would, but\nit actually doesn't change the file size\n\n85\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.100\nwhatsoever, which is one of\nthe reasons it can be insidious.\n\n86\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.240\nIt wasn't developed for\ninsidious purposes, but, any good hacker,\n\n87\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.460\nit's not what it's meant to do,\nit's how can I make it work?\n\n88\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this is what some of\nthe cases are actually showing.\n\n89\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.620\nIf you go out and\nyou take a look at case studies.\n\n90\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.560\nWe're starting to see more and\nmore, people not saying,\n\n91\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.630\nlook I need to get a mass\namount of data out an one time.\n\n92\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.830\nDon't get me wrong,\nthat is their golden pot,\n\n93\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.520\nthe leprechaun gold pot at\nthe end of the rainbow.\n\n94\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.700\nYes, everything comes out at one time,\nand you got it all.\n\n95\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.680\nBut if they're working with an insider.\n\n96\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.274\nDaniel, what if you worked for a system,\nand I'm not trying to encourage you, but\n\n97\n00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:29.430\nyou're privy to credit card information.\n\n98\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.730\nAnd at the same time, it's not that\nyou're privy to a lot of them,\n\n99\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.370\nlet's say it was three or four a day.\n\n100\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.580\nAnd yet, you can actually type in\ncredit card information to ADS and\n\n101\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.270\nsend it out to your\nparticular partner in crime.\n\n102\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.570\nIt goes through my scan, looks like,\nhey there it is, it's the same thing.\n\n103\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.670\nNo big deal.\n\n104\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.680\nIt goes out and we don't even realize it.\n\n105\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.677\nWe're seeing that not only with something\nlike ADS, which is what we're really\n\n106\n00:05:57.677 --> 00:06:01.497\nfocusing in on, but\neven DNS requests that are coming back and\n\n107\n00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:06.583\nthe DNS record is modified with payment\ncard industry data that's going across.\n\n108\n00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:10.849\nAnd you're only able to catch it through\nsomething like a packet sniffer of some\n\n109\n00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.850\nsort, and\nthat's when you start going, what?\n\n110\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.700\nYeah, it's the request that's coming\nback and it's got credit card\n\n111\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.130\ninformation tagged right on to the end\nof it in the metadata that's out there.\n\n112\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.590\nIt is amazing.\n\n113\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.938\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would also be kinda\nfunny if you were scanning drives or\n\n114\n00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:30.170\ntry to use maybe one\ngigabyte thumb drive or\n\n115\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.961\nsomething and\nit's only got a 4 MB file on that.\n\n116\n00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.340\nAnd you try to copy some of that,\nwhy is it saying disk is full?\n\n117\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n118\n00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:41.035\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing how some of this stuff is\nhidden and we don't think about until we\n\n119\n00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:44.045\nknow something that we may have\nto look for this information.\n\n120\n00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:47.090\nAnd that's part of the analyst\nis to understand that.\n\n121\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.410\nIf you get a computer, and it's ready for\nthat computer forensics part,\n\n122\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.210\nthat you may have to kind of remember that\nwith NTFS you have to go further than just\n\n123\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.190\nsaying, yeah that does encryption,\nit does compression, and does that.\n\n124\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.060\nBut we can also use alternative data\nstreams with it, that will help us.\n\n125\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.855\nSo when we start to see this here,\nlet's go ahead and take a look,\n\n126\n00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:10.483\nwell we'll do that as\nan example right away.\n\n127\n00:07:10.483 --> 00:07:13.758\nAll right, so here at my command prompt,\nI'm running as the administrator so\n\n128\n00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:15.040\nI can create files.\n\n129\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.030\nI'm just gonna create\na simple Notepad file.\n\n130\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.300\nI'm gonna type in notepad and\n\n131\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.440\nthen I'm gonna place this on the root\nto make it easier for me to find.\n\n132\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.312\nIf not, I won't remember where\nit actually is gonna be.\n\n133\n00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:30.200\nI'm gonna call it adsfile.txt.\n\n134\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.135\nSo now it's gonna bring up no path and\nsay, hey,\n\n135\n00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:33.896\nare you sure you wanna\ncreate this new file?\n\n136\n00:07:33.896 --> 00:07:35.341\nAnd yes, I do.\n\n137\n00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:38.380\nI'm not gonna add anything\nto it at this point in time.\n\n138\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.500\nI want you to see it as totally blank.\n\n139\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.050\nSo this file shouldn't be any size at all,\nokay?\n\n140\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.994\nSo if I now go and\nverify that, I do a dir,\n\n141\n00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:52.523\nwe can see that has\nthe file size adsfile of 0.\n\n142\n00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.466\n&gt;&gt; A whopping 0 [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A whopping 0, so it's not big.\n\n143\n00:07:55.466 --> 00:08:00.552\nIt's tiny, it's tiny as far as what\nthe summary information shows us here.\n\n144\n00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:03.841\nNow, if I wanna create\nan alternative data stream,\n\n145\n00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:06.476\nwhich I don't know if I can actually say.\n\n146\n00:08:06.476 --> 00:08:10.939\nAt this point,\nI just need to bring that file back up,\n\n147\n00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:15.900\ntype in notepad, and\nthen adsfile.txt, I put a colon in,\n\n148\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.950\nand now I actually name\nthe alternative stream that I want.\n\n149\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.328\nAnd we'll just call this\none ads-demo instead, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:29.894\nSo if I now type that in, and press Enter.\n\n151\n00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:34.082\nNotice it opens up notepad again and\nthis time,\n\n152\n00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:39.314\nit's saying,\nhey I cannot find adfile, I probably,\n\n153\n00:08:39.314 --> 00:08:43.518\nlet me make sure I actually\nnamed it correctly.\n\n154\n00:08:43.518 --> 00:08:44.847\nHere let me do a cancel here.\n\n155\n00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:49.590\nAdsfile that's why,\nthat's actually gonna be bad.\n\n156\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.090\nSo let me I'm gonna rename a new file.\n\n157\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.833\nSo let me do that\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.885\n&gt;&gt; I'm like that's actually bad.\n\n159\n00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:58.850\nSo, let's try it again, there we go.\n\n160\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.830\nSo now if I try to do the same thing\nagain, good thing I actually zoomed in on\n\n161\n00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.216\nthis or I would have really been like\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n162\n00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:06.293\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why'd that work?\n\n163\n00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:11.923\nAdsfile notice it actually has\nthis colon and then adsdemo.txt.\n\n164\n00:09:11.923 --> 00:09:13.453\nDo I want to create a new file?\n\n165\n00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:14.847\nI'm gonna say Yes.\n\n166\n00:09:14.847 --> 00:09:19.267\nSo you would think that this is gonna\ncreate two separate files that are listed\n\n167\n00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.307\nright there for us to be able to see.\n\n168\n00:09:21.307 --> 00:09:28.290\nSo now I say run Daniel [LAUGH] run.\n\n169\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n170\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.955\nOkay, so we'll do that and we'll save\nit and I'm going to close it out.\n\n171\n00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:38.990\nNow if I do a DIR..\n\n172\n00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.394\nDaniel notice that there is no listing for\n\n173\n00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:44.013\nwhat looked like a new file I created,\nokay?\n\n174\n00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:47.794\nAnd that is because it did save it,\nit is there but\n\n175\n00:09:47.794 --> 00:09:53.346\nI'm not able to see it if I don't\nknow about alternative data streams.\n\n176\n00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:58.620\nSo from that point, that means I could\nsend this possible file out to Daniel.\n\n177\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.418\nDaniel could get it and go, wait a minute.\n\n178\n00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:03.770\nHe's sending me a file with nothing in it.\n\n179\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.366\n&gt;&gt; Zero bytes, yeah.\n\n180\n00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Something else may be going on.\n\n181\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:13.951\nNow, if I wanted to look at it, though,\nI can type in dir and then a /r.\n\n182\n00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:18.187\nNow this particular /r\ndidn't come in until later.\n\n183\n00:10:18.187 --> 00:10:19.896\nI think Windows 7 or\n\n184\n00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:25.235\nlater is when we actually see\nthat the /r coming to existence.\n\n185\n00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:30.671\nBut now when I take a look notice,\nright here, what has actually occurred.\n\n186\n00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:34.743\nWe can now see where it now\nlists not only the file but\n\n187\n00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:39.500\nit's actually associated this\nalternative data stream.\n\n188\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.688\nAnd you see there's dollar sign\ndata associated with this that is,\n\n189\n00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:46.926\nwell notice that nothing\nis entered in here Daniel.\n\n190\n00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.959\nThis is where it becomes\na little bit tricky for\n\n191\n00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.689\nthe forensics investigator, right?\n\n192\n00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:54.559\nWell, but the great thing is we know that\nit's actually attached to this one file,\n\n193\n00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.898\nbut now notice there's\nno other separate entry.\n\n194\n00:10:56.898 --> 00:11:00.619\nSo even though it looked like I was\ncreating a second file, I really wasn't.\n\n195\n00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:04.366\nSo this is one of those things that\nare in there that really is helpful for\n\n196\n00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:08.640\nyou to add in additional information\nabout the file if you choose to.\n\n197\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.671\nBut you can imagine why\nsomeone with more nefarious\n\n198\n00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.077\npurposes could take advantage of this.\n\n199\n00:11:14.077 --> 00:11:18.566\nImagine me now, Daniel, adding in\nthe payment card industry information that\n\n200\n00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:23.323\nmight be in there, personally identifiable\ninformation of somebody right there in\n\n201\n00:11:23.323 --> 00:11:25.137\nthat alternative data stream.\n\n202\n00:11:25.137 --> 00:11:29.670\nAnd the file still looks like 0 is\nwhat it looks like going across.\n\n203\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.478\nIt is amazing,\nto me that was one of the neat things.\n\n204\n00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:36.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very cool, those dastardly\ndogs out there using things for\n\n205\n00:11:36.564 --> 00:11:38.243\npurposes they weren't intended for.\n\n206\n00:11:38.243 --> 00:11:42.273\nNow what was interesting Ronnie, is that\nwe look at the, as you did the lasting,\n\n207\n00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:46.327\nthe dir with the /r, showing that, you\nnotice that we didn't get a time stamp.\n\n208\n00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:49.178\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; A date, associated with that,\n\n209\n00:11:49.178 --> 00:11:52.719\nis that sharing with the adsfile.txt?\n\n210\n00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:53.585\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n211\n00:11:53.585 --> 00:11:55.525\n&gt;&gt; So if one gets modified,\nthe other showing modified as well?\n\n212\n00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:56.227\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n213\n00:11:56.227 --> 00:11:59.944\n&gt;&gt; And those are important statistics\nwhen it comes to forensics investigation.\n\n214\n00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:01.579\n&gt;&gt; That's what it comes down to right,\n\n215\n00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:03.963\nbecause the timing is actually\na part of everything.\n\n216\n00:12:03.963 --> 00:12:08.752\nSo that's why NTFS tracks a lot more\ntiming than just the fact that it\n\n217\n00:12:08.752 --> 00:12:09.517\ngot made.\n\n218\n00:12:09.517 --> 00:12:10.533\nNow this right here,\n\n219\n00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:13.930\nwhen you see it, you're like,\nit doesn't show me anymore, Ronnie.\n\n220\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.603\nWhat do you mean by tracking a lot more?\n\n221\n00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:21.000\nWell, let's go to the GUI interface for\njust a moment.\n\n222\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.485\nAnd that's actually easier to see here.\n\n223\n00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:28.124\nSo if I go back and find that\nsame file again there is adsfile.\n\n224\n00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:31.830\nIf I right click on it and\ngo down to Properties.\n\n225\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.318\nNow inside of the properties window.\n\n226\n00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:37.705\nI apparently clicked on the wrong thing.\n\n227\n00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:43.273\nRight click and\nthen Properties, get the file.\n\n228\n00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:48.049\nNotice right here, Daniel,\nthat we do have access to a lot\n\n229\n00:12:48.049 --> 00:12:52.055\nmore information than what\nwe think that we see.\n\n230\n00:12:52.055 --> 00:12:56.352\nTake a look right there in that center\nsection I've kinda highlighted here.\n\n231\n00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:01.461\nModified, look the date and the time\nstamp and the date is actually different\n\n232\n00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:06.977\nfrom the time it was created and even when\nit believes the last time it was accessed.\n\n233\n00:13:06.977 --> 00:13:10.508\nThis file was accessed five minutes\nago when I created it, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:11.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n235\n00:13:11.203 --> 00:13:14.538\n&gt;&gt; But now it says wait a minute,\nit was modified three minutes ago.\n\n236\n00:13:14.538 --> 00:13:17.594\n&gt;&gt; How do you modify a file\nwithout accessing a file, right?\n\n237\n00:13:17.594 --> 00:13:21.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know it's amazing when\nyou start to take a look here,\n\n238\n00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:25.822\nthat there's also another one that it\nkeeps track of that's not here, right?\n\n239\n00:13:25.822 --> 00:13:32.150\nM, A, C, there's one called E,\nand E is for Entry Modified.\n\n240\n00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.887\nSo if you also did something like\nthat it would also be added in there.\n\n241\n00:13:35.887 --> 00:13:42.196\nYou want to make sure you know\nthat acronym of MACE, M-A-C-E,\n\n242\n00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:47.371\nModified, Accessed,\nCreated and Entry Modified.\n\n243\n00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:52.397\nThose are also additional dates that\nare stored with every single file\n\n244\n00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:57.422\nin terms of metadata that is gonna be\nimportant in terms of forensic for\n\n245\n00:13:57.422 --> 00:14:01.613\nsomebody, to make sure you\nalso understand that as well.\n\n246\n00:14:01.613 --> 00:14:05.598\nSo there are a few different things\nthat you can end up seeing there, but\n\n247\n00:14:05.598 --> 00:14:08.466\nthis is kinda the easiest\nway that you can see that.\n\n248\n00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:12.273\nJust because you think that there's\nonly one time stamp when you created it,\n\n249\n00:14:12.273 --> 00:14:13.338\nnope there's more.\n\n250\n00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:17.709\nThat's because We really do need to\nunderstand what else is happening here,\n\n251\n00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:18.459\ntoo, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:21.970\nNow, I'm gonna go back to our\ndiagram here for a moment and\n\n253\n00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.930\nshow you something that should look,\nwell, hopefully not super intimidating.\n\n254\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.468\nBut I want you to understand this and\n\n255\n00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:30.678\nthere's some that you do\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n256\n00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:31.453\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared, Ronnie.\n\n257\n00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:32.996\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's, but\n\n258\n00:14:32.996 --> 00:14:38.253\nthere's elements that are involved\nwhen you format a drive with NTFS.\n\n259\n00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:42.769\nAnd you need to know these different\nsections that happens on your drive and\n\n260\n00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:47.140\nthe information that's associated\nwith it right here, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.242\nSo when you do format a drive with NTFS,\n\n262\n00:14:49.242 --> 00:14:53.473\nwe get all the stuff that we just showed\nyou which is darn neat, at least for me.\n\n263\n00:14:53.473 --> 00:14:56.753\nThe alternative data streams,\ncompression, encryption,\n\n264\n00:14:56.753 --> 00:15:01.307\nall that's actually good quotas, you name\nit, it's all great information for us.\n\n265\n00:15:01.307 --> 00:15:02.849\nBut when you first do it,\n\n266\n00:15:02.849 --> 00:15:07.558\none of the very first things it creates\nof course is a partition boot sector.\n\n267\n00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:10.583\nPay attention to these numbers right here.\n\n268\n00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:14.051\nDaniel, I'm only saying that for\neducational purposes.\n\n269\n00:15:14.051 --> 00:15:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pay attention to these\n\n270\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.222\nnumbers here, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:19.760\nSo, the first 16 sectors\nof the hard drive, and\n\n272\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.942\nremember that with file systems, right?\n\n273\n00:15:21.942 --> 00:15:28.984\nWe don't access clusters as far as us as\nuser interaction, I mean cluster sectors.\n\n274\n00:15:28.984 --> 00:15:30.156\nWe access clusters, right?\n\n275\n00:15:30.156 --> 00:15:33.534\nThat's kinda the space that\na file actually gets accessed to.\n\n276\n00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:35.988\nBut the first 16 sectors\nof the hard drive,\n\n277\n00:15:35.988 --> 00:15:38.840\nthat's pretty much what\nwe have right here, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.201\nIt allows us, of course to be able to\nboot up the computer, that makes sense.\n\n279\n00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:47.191\nAnd it points to the location\nof the master file table.\n\n280\n00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:50.828\nBut then the last 16 sectors though, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:50.828 --> 00:15:53.227\nIs also a copy of the boot sector.\n\n282\n00:15:53.227 --> 00:15:58.134\nSo of that particular drive the first\n16 sectors it does everything\n\n283\n00:15:58.134 --> 00:16:03.223\nthat we have it to do, but then the last\n16 is a copy of the boot sector.\n\n284\n00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:07.671\nSo that way if, what,\nif the boot sector here gets corrupted?\n\n285\n00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.410\nIt has a copy of it, and\nit can still continue to function.\n\n286\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.460\nRemember that with FAT,\nright, if you go ahead and\n\n287\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.720\nyou have somehow corrupted the boot table.\n\n288\n00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.440\nIf you corrupted the master file,\nif you corrupted whatever,\n\n289\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.280\nright, that contingency boot process.\n\n290\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.350\nYou may find the disk\ntotally inaccessible, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.280\nBut with NTFS,\nit eliminates that, at least,\n\n292\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.110\nas a single point of failure for us.\n\n293\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.900\nThen, we can take a look at it\ngenerating the Master File Table.\n\n294\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.659\nNow this is important,\nevery place that you have a file and\n\n295\n00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:43.809\nwherever it's stored on the drive,\nit's gonna be kept as a record right here.\n\n296\n00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:45.402\nSo that when your operating system goes,\n\n297\n00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:47.880\nit doesn't have to search\nthe entire hard drive.\n\n298\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.270\nIt can go ahead and look right here and\nfind where the location of the files and\n\n299\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.060\ndirectories are on that partition.\n\n300\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.400\nBut this is also the location where it\nstores all those additional attributes\n\n301\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.290\nthat we were talking about,\nincluding file names,\n\n302\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.740\nsecurity descriptors and a timestamps.\n\n303\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.620\nSo this is an important location for\n\n304\n00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.450\nsomebody doing forensics\nto be able to dive into,\n\n305\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.840\nlook at all the rich information\nthat they can get here too, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.272\nOn top of that, of course,\nhidden files that are stored as well,\n\n307\n00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:23.622\nmetadata on the file, NTFS volumes,\nlogs, file attributes,\n\n308\n00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:27.990\nall that is stored in what we call\nthe System Files of partition.\n\n309\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.700\nAnd then this is actually where we\nstore data, okay, the File Area.\n\n310\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.863\nNow, I'm not trying to make too\nmuch of an emphasis of this.\n\n311\n00:17:34.863 --> 00:17:42.908\nBut I would not be surprised if they ask\nyou somewhere later on down the line that,\n\n312\n00:17:42.908 --> 00:17:49.886\ndo you know how big this boot partition\nsector is, where is it stored or\n\n313\n00:17:49.886 --> 00:17:56.070\nhow does NTFS deal with\nthe corruption of the boot partition?\n\n314\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.054\nI mean [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, it's strange but\njust small information that you and\n\n318\n00:18:09.045 --> 00:18:10.810\nI don't think about.\n\n319\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.285\nBut it's something that we want\nto make sure that we understand.\n\n320\n00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Cisco loves to bite in to\nthe minutia of a lot of topics.\n\n321\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.057\nSo be prepared for these little,\nwhat seems insignificant,\n\n322\n00:18:22.057 --> 00:18:26.038\ndetails to maybe creep up in\na survey type environment.\n\n323\n00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.655\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that something like\n\n324\n00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:29.750\nthat could happen.\n\n325\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.790\nBut at least generalized understand those\nconcepts that we're just mentioning.\n\n326\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.290\nMake sure that we know that.\n\n327\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:41.280\nNow other factors of course that come\ninto play when working with NTFS, right?\n\n328\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.430\nWe wanna talk about EFI for a moment.\n\n329\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.510\nWe're gonna talk about this a little bit\nmore depth when we get into the Linux side\n\n330\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.190\nof things in just a little\nbit of time here.\n\n331\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.020\nBut when we go in, we wanna\nunderstand that when we do have UEFI.\n\n332\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.282\nWhich essentially for\nus is the easiest way to say it.\n\n333\n00:18:59.282 --> 00:19:01.870\nIt's a replacement for BIOS, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.611\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n335\n00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.880\nit pretty much is what it actually is.\n\n336\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.820\nWhen you're doing that, you gotta remember\nthat what we're also taking a look at\n\n337\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.400\nis that when we say we're gonna run a\nWindows system on these newer systems that\n\n338\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.450\nare deployed with UEFI,\nthe hard drives must also be formatted.\n\n339\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.210\nWith a special type of system here, right?\n\n340\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.150\nWe know that there's master boot record,\nwhich we haven't mentioned before.\n\n341\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.540\nBut there's also something call GPT.\n\n342\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.640\nIf you're using BIOS,\nyou're gonna use NBR.\n\n343\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.728\nBut GUID would prefer you use GPT,\nthe newer GUID partition table,\n\n344\n00:19:35.728 --> 00:19:39.674\nguide partition table everybody\npronounces it differently, so\n\n345\n00:19:39.674 --> 00:19:42.268\nI'm gonna give you both pronunciations.\n\n346\n00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:42.949\n&gt;&gt; I've only ever heard it GUID.\n\n347\n00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:43.695\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n348\n00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:47.700\nguide is the one that I heard\non a podcast at some point.\n\n349\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.140\nI'm like,\nI never heard it called that before.\n\n350\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.840\nSo it's amazing how many people\nwill change things the wrong way.\n\n351\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.650\nNo I'm joking, I really don't\nknow exactly how it's pronounced.\n\n352\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.510\nFor me, as far as I ever recalled it,\nit's been GUID.\n\n353\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n354\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.720\nthat's what I've always seen it as, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.140\nAlso Windows always\nneeds system partition.\n\n356\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.180\nAnd let me show you if you\nhaven't seen this before here.\n\n357\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.180\nSo here it is,\nI've brought up disk management and\n\n358\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.570\nI've got another hard drive waiting here.\n\n359\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:21.560\nBut what they're talking about is right\nhere, the System Reserved partition.\n\n360\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.850\nRemember that Windows goes ahead and\nmakes this for you when you first install.\n\n361\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.570\nYou don't have to do anything\nit makes it for you.\n\n362\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.720\nIn the early days,\nit was just 100 megabytes.\n\n363\n00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.420\nYou can see that this has changed\nover time, at least one my system.\n\n364\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.840\nIt's 500 megabytes that it takes\naway from your drive here,\n\n365\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.020\nokay, to do this system reserve partition,\nokay?\n\n366\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.550\nSo if you're running EFI, you're gonna\nactually have this what is called an ESP\n\n367\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.710\nin the system reserved partition for\nyou as well, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.970\nSo that's pretty much kind\nof the big factors of that.\n\n369\n00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.110\nThe only last things I really\nwant to point out to you\n\n370\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.020\non just some of the trivial details.\n\n371\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.640\nI do not know why this is so important,\nbut it's mentioned everywhere.\n\n372\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.600\nThat in Windows,\nwhen they do timestamps on file systems,\n\n373\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:19.400\nit originally started off as a 64-bit\nvalue based on 100 nanosecond intervals.\n\n374\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.920\nNow, no big deal,\ndon't worry about that, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.150\nBut the weird part is,\nthe date that they chose to start this on.\n\n376\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.620\nNow, Daniel, you're looking at date.\n\n377\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.710\nWhat’s the weird date.\n\n378\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.102\n&gt;&gt;

Is that be a Dr. Gregorian calendar or\nsomething of that point.\n\n382\n00:21:39.308 --> 00:21:42.595\n&gt;&gt; I think that that’s what it\nbegins at is the beginning date of\n\n383\n00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:44.610\nthe Gregorian Calendar.\n\n384\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.768\nSo actually the first group-\n&gt;&gt;

When Gregory was still alive.\n\n388\n00:21:52.742 --> 00:21:54.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n389\n00:21:54.025 --> 00:21:56.141\nI think that that's what happens,\nthey say look,\n\n390\n00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:59.360\nwe're not gonna kind of estimate this and\ntry to figure it out.\n\n391\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.180\nA data essentially is just serialized and\nthat's what they did, they just said,\n\n392\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.690\nokay here's 100 milliseconds and\nhere's how they calculated out.\n\n393\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.016\nEvery single time value is calculated\nout that way in the Windows system.\n\n394\n00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:15.730\nNot exactly for me usual.\n\n395\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.590\nBut something that has\nappeared multiple times in\n\n396\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.090\neverything that I've been\nreading to get ready for this.\n\n397\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.570\nI was like, that's gotta be important for\nsome reason.\n\n398\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.990\nIf not,\nit's just whatever it chooses to be.\n\n399\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.350\nNow at the beginning,\nMTFS also just only the UTC,\n\n400\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.060\nthe Universal Time Code,\nfor the way they did\n\n401\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.010\nthe time stamping on things,\nthat normally just did the local time.\n\n402\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.290\nBut on my machine,\nit's clearly shown as local time so\n\n403\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.680\nI'm not gonna worry too much\non that one as well, okay.\n\n404\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.970\nBut you do need to know this last\nlittle tidbit when getting ready for\n\n405\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.020\nthe exam as well.\n\n406\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.960\nThe file timestamp is really\nonly correctly reported okay,\n\n407\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.380\nwhen the final handle makes the change and\nis closed.\n\n408\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.070\nSo don't think that you're gonna get an\naccurate timestamp if a file's still open.\n\n409\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.340\nIt's only after you close the file,\nand that handle is actually ended.\n\n410\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.520\nWill you actually get a proper timestamp?\n\n411\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.110\nNow that's important because of\nthe way that we shut down computers or\n\n412\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.560\nthe way we don't shut down computers,\nright.\n\n413\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.270\nSo Daniel, again briefly let's just\ntalk about this just a moment.\n\n414\n00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.370\nI know I'm out of time.\n\n415\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.603\nBut what happens when i'm in\nthe middle of saving something and\n\n416\n00:23:26.603 --> 00:23:28.860\nnow we just inject\nthe plug on the computer.\n\n417\n00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.710\nWhat happens with that phone?\n\n418\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.850\n&gt;&gt; The files gets probably corrupted.\n\n419\n00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n420\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it was corrupted is saying I can't\n\n421\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.450\ntimestamp anything like that,\nthat's jut kinda silly.\n\n422\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.370\nSo if it doesn't see\nan accurate file saved,\n\n423\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.350\nit just says yeah there's\nno timestamp with that.\n\n424\n00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.330\nPossible corrupted mess that you've\nleft behind so realize that is\n\n425\n00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.910\na kind of marker that if you end up\nsaying hey there is a portion of a file,\n\n426\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.250\nI can't tell when it was made,\nI can't tell when it was done.\n\n427\n00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.750\nIt probably means it's\nnot gonna be good for\n\n428\n00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.630\nyou as well when it comes\ndown to forensics too.\n\n429\n00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.170\nSo just some basics inside\nof the Windows file system.\n\n430\n00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:15.520\nFor some computer forensics, we still\ngot a lot to go in terms of Linux.\n\n431\n00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.100\nAnd then we'll kind of deal with\nthat computer forensics part.\n\n432\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.300\nBut at least for Windows,\nI think that's a good start.\n\n433\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely great information\nwhen it comes to working forensically\n\n434\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.100\nwith Windows-based file systems.\n\n435\n00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.360\nNow you know a little bit about them,\n\n436\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.520\nhow they work and what to expect\nwhen you're dealing with them, and\n\n437\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.100\nthings that you might wanna avoid or\nlook for when it comes to them as well.\n\n438\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.030\nRonnie, great stuff.\n\n439\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.860\nWe do appreciate your effort on this show.\n\n440\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.030\nIt's really good content, and\nwe know you work hard for\n\n441\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.880\nthat to help our viewers out\nthere pass an exam, hopefully.\n\n442\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.590\nThat being said,\n\n443\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.570\nwe are out of time for this episode,\nso we're gonna have to call it a day.\n\n444\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.370\nBut we'll be back with more\ndon't worry about that.\n\n445\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.320\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n446\n00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.119\n&gt;&gt;

California\n\n3\n00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:08.202\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.986\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.746\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:17.360\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your host, Daniel Lawrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.040\nin today's episode we are moving forward\nwith more on our Cisco SecOps series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.000\nAnd joining us back again yet again,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.250\nRonnie, welcome back again, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.220\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.250\n&gt;&gt; It is once again going awesome.\n\n13\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.151\nI am grateful to be here\ntoday working with you, and\n\n14\n00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:38.250\ntaking a look of course\nat Sysco's SecOps here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.680\nWe are now moving into the realm of\ntrying to understand a little bit more\n\n16\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.240\nabout the Linux file systems that\nare out there and available to us.\n\n17\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.540\nAnd remember that we're not taking\neverything apart all the way down to\n\n18\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.000\nthe basics of Linux.\n\n19\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.070\nBut what we're trying to do is make\nsure that we hit some of the highlights\n\n20\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.740\nto let you know what you may find and\nwhat you may not in\n\n21\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.690\na computer forensics kind of\nperspective more than anything else.\n\n22\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.640\nWe just in previous episodes took a look\nat it a little bit more inside of\n\n23\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.960\nAnd now we're moving in Linux.\n\n25\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.300\nThere's not as much for us to do here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.380\nA lot of the information that you want\nin Linux is really designed around you\n\n27\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.090\nknowing Linux, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.820\nSo if you wanna learn more about Linux,\n\n29\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.540\nright, make sure you check out the Linux\nepisodes right here on ITProTV.\n\n30\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.715\nBut also the security fundamentals\nin the first part of this series for\n\n31\n00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.305\nthe Cisco CyberOps exam as well.\n\n32\n00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:36.955\nWe kind of do a deep dive there on getting\nyou to use Linux a little bit more, and\n\n33\n00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:38.955\nshowing you some of the options\nthat you have available.\n\n34\n00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:40.905\nSo make sure you check that episode out.\n\n35\n00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:42.175\nBut this is where we're starting.\n\n36\n00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.185\nAnd we're really starting\noff with a file system,\n\n37\n00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:46.540\nwhich means dealing with,\nof course, drives.\n\n38\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.910\nAnd in the forensics world, right,\n\n39\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.670\nthis is where we have to remember that the\nfile system is ultimately important, and\n\n40\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.920\nwe want to retrieve data\noff of those systems.\n\n41\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600\nAnd knowing what file systems that\nare available and readily available for\n\n42\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.480\nus is really going to help out, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.050\nSo let's take a look at list of terms that\nwe wanna make sure that we're familiar\n\n44\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.620\nwith as we deal with the idea of\nthe Linux file system here, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.070\nThe first one, of course, is EXT 4.\n\n46\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.090\nNow, there's actually Versions 2 and 3.\n\n47\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.390\nI kinda listed them in reverse order.\n\n48\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.530\nFour is by far the most popular right now,\nand the newest one that's available.\n\n49\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.974\nBut 3 is still fairly popular\nbu kind of really dropping off.\n\n50\n00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:33.809\nTwo, not as popular anymore, but\nit still has its uses, Daniel, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.558\nWhich is actually pretty\ndarn neat here and\n\n52\n00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.460\nsome of the things that\nwe don't think about.\n\n53\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.427\nBut kind of at least remember\nthat when you run across this,\n\n54\n00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.709\nthis is what you wanna do.\n\n55\n00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.530\nNow, as we start to take a look,\nall right.\n\n56\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.050\nSo here it is,\nI'm actually on my Ubuntu machine here.\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320\nAnd I want us to take a look at\nthe idea of the file system.\n\n58\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.270\nNow, Daniel, just looking at this thing\nright now, I don't know exactly how I find\n\n59\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.930\nout what file system that I am on,\njust taking a look here.\n\n60\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.270\nBut there are ways that we can do it.\n\n61\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.370\nAnd this may be important for\nwhat we have access to.\n\n62\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.770\nNow, I just installed\nthe one that was like 15,\n\n63\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.770\nwhich is probably the like two generation.\n\n64\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.530\nI think we're up to 17 something.\n\n65\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.380\nBut I was just using 15 here so\nthat we could see what it's like.\n\n66\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.920\nIt's not that it's super old.\n\n67\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.990\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; It really isn't super old here.\n\n68\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.500\nBut if we go, and I went ahead and\nlaunched up the terminal.\n\n69\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.040\nIf we start right here and\ntake a look at some of the information,\n\n70\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.170\nwe can start finding out,\njust a little bit here.\n\n71\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.470\nSo I want to get in to, let's see here.\n\n72\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.393\nLet me type in SUDO parted -l for\nthe moment.\n\n73\n00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:40.310\nSo we can take a look.\n\n74\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.770\nNow, right here as we start to see some\nof the information, first thing that I'm\n\n75\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.320\nreally looking for, of course, is the idea\nof that file system information here.\n\n76\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.410\nSo, there it is.\n\n77\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.230\nI just used a particular\nutility that shows me a ton of\n\n78\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.910\ninformation on what got parted.\n\n79\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.160\nThere's fdisk.\n\n80\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.930\nThere's GParted.\n\n81\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.390\nThere's a ton of different ones\nthat are out there and available.\n\n82\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.690\nIt really just depends on what you need.\n\n83\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.200\nThis was kind of an easy one for me to do.\n\n84\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.950\nSo I launched it using,\nof course, SUDO, or\n\n85\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.610\nSUDO, however you pronounce it once again.\n\n86\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.920\nAnd we'll see right here under the first\nsection under Disk Flags, notice,\n\n87\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.840\nDaniel, that my boot partition here is\nformatted with something a little bit\n\n88\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.510\nstrange even though I'm not at the oldest\noperating system that's available.\n\n89\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.310\nNow, Daniel do you know why I would\nhave chosen something like this?\n\n90\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.850\nJust to, I'm putting you on the spot.\n\n91\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably because it doesn't\nrequire the journaling mechanisms\n\n92\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.120\nof the later ext file systems.\n\n93\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, and there's got to be\na reason behind that, right?\n\n94\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.470\nAnd the reason is cuz I'm\nrunning on solid state-drive.\n\n95\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.600\nSo it automatically recognized that I was\nrunning this on a solid-state drive, and\n\n96\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.381\nit said, look, on a solid-state drive\nwe don't need the necessary ideas of\n\n97\n00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:55.170\njournaling going on there.\n\n98\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.250\nSo instead of actually running EXT3 and 4,\n\n99\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.810\nwhich gets into the idea of journaling\nhere, it said let me run this instead.\n\n100\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.770\nSo it went ahead and used EXT2,\nwhich most of us are probably going like,\n\n101\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.765\nwhy the heck would\nsomebody have chosen that?\n\n102\n00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:12.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's because of that.\n\n103\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.560\nSo certain situations allow you, just by\ngetting this information printed out,\n\n104\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.470\nyou might have, and I'm not gonna say that\nsomebody couldn't have chosen EXT2, but\n\n105\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.590\nthis might actually indicate\nto you that you're now,\n\n106\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.460\njust looking at base information\nhere in terms of analysis,\n\n107\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.490\nthey might be running on\na solid-state drive instead.\n\n108\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.710\n&gt;&gt; And the one thing you do know for\n\n109\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.770\nsure is they are not using\na journaled file system, right?\n\n110\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n111\n00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:40.300\nthat could be important forensically\nas you move down the road.\n\n112\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n113\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.800\nAnd so there's a lot of good information\nthere that we also want to take up.\n\n114\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.936\nNow the thing that I found interesting\nwhen I was taking a look at this stuff,\n\n115\n00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:48.920\nDaniel, notice this.\n\n116\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.020\nThe partition table itself is listed as-\n&gt;&gt; Msdos.\n\n117\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.120\n&gt;&gt; Msdos?\n\n118\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.670\nWhat in the world is going on here?\n\n119\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.390\nSo you start to see some like what,\nmsdos on a Linux system?\n\n120\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.552\n&gt;&gt; It's tried and true.\n\n121\n00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It still works unless you need all\n\n122\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.945\nthe GUID stuff.\n\n123\n00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:12.130\nThen, yeah, go with that.\n\n124\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's just kind of interesting, right?\n\n125\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.610\nSo you start finding out just some\nneat little tidbits here, of course.\n\n126\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.230\nYou can find out the number of\npartitions that are on this table,\n\n127\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.760\non this particular drive\nright here available.\n\n128\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.290\nYou can also end up seeing, look,\nthere's an unrecognized disk label.\n\n129\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.240\nSo there's another drive\nthat's attached here, but\n\n130\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.860\nit's not able to read it\nbecause I just attached one.\n\n131\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.900\nI didn't actually do\nanything else with it.\n\n132\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.320\nBut you can start seeing just some neat\ninformation that's available to us.\n\n133\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.996\nSo that we can see that.\n\n134\n00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:44.378\nBut right at the beginning, if you ever\nneed to find something like that out,\n\n135\n00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:47.850\nyou do have that ability to find\nout some of that information.\n\n136\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.030\nNow, since Daniel mentioned journaling,\nokay?\n\n137\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.280\n&gt;&gt; I did [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll talk about this\nidea of journaling, okay?\n\n139\n00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.282\nSo when we start taking a look at\nthe necessary idea of journaling,\n\n140\n00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:01.820\nyou're gonna find it,\nof course, EXT3 and 4.\n\n141\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.850\nAnd there's another file system\nthat's out there that really kind\n\n142\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.650\nof spearheaded this idea of journaling\na lot, but is no longer really used.\n\n143\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.370\nOne called riserfs, and I was talking to\nDaniel about this before the episode.\n\n144\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.260\nRiserfs is the one that has the most\ninteresting background story behind it.\n\n145\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.170\nAnd riserfs a guy named Riser.\n\n146\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Han Riser.\n\n147\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.130\n&gt;&gt; I think his name was Hans,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n148\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.920\nSo he sounds like\na villain from James Bond.\n\n149\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.710\n&gt;&gt; Or Die Hard.\n\n150\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah or Die Hard [LAUGH] that's true.\n\n151\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.350\nI didn't think about that one.\n\n152\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.030\nSo it sounds like a villain,\nbut I think his name was Hans.\n\n153\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.685\nI could be wrong.\nBe wrong.\n\n154\n00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:43.463\nI'm probably wrong on that.\n\n155\n00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:48.735\nBut Riser, he developed this very\nneat journaling file system.\n\n156\n00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:51.331\n&gt;&gt; It's actually really smart,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n157\n00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:55.946\nCuz it's just like saying I want to take\nthese little snapshots in time of your\n\n158\n00:07:55.946 --> 00:08:00.064\nfile because you haven't saved yet,\nso that if you lose power Well,\n\n159\n00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:05.035\nwe have that saved over here, you don't\nlose everything, just lose a little bit.\n\n160\n00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's the overall goal, right?\n\n161\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.610\nIs that the problem that\nwe had at the beginning,\n\n162\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.445\nright, is that everything would\njust get written to the drive.\n\n163\n00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:14.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n164\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.730\nas you're writing stuff to the drive,\nhere's it is,\n\n165\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.240\nlet's just take for an example,\na file of ten megabyte, right?\n\n166\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.643\nYou're writing that ten megabyte file,\nsomebody says,\n\n167\n00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:28.660\nI wonder what happens if unplug Ronnie's\ncomputer in the middle of that.\n\n168\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.520\nWell, you get partial files,\n\n169\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.646\nyou get at least a corrupted file,\nsomething you can't really recover from.\n\n170\n00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:39.171\nSo, guys are starting working on this\nidea of journals filling systems like\n\n171\n00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:39.960\nriser here.\n\n172\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.290\nAnd bunch of other people started working\non them as well, but working on this\n\n173\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.080\nidea they kind of realized we need\na better system than something like this.\n\n174\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.800\nSo what it actually does is it\nmaintains a special type of file that\n\n175\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.490\nwe call a journal, makes sense here,\nthat says look, here's what we'll do.\n\n176\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.500\nBefore we write anything to the hard\ndrive, we'll make sure that we\n\n177\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.080\nissue a transaction, and\nthat that transaction is fully there,\n\n178\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.530\nsaying hey everything is\nexactly as it should.\n\n179\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.820\nAnd then you write the file over,\nit's not in the transaction log,\n\n180\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.760\nit doesn't get written to the drive.\n\n181\n00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.610\nWhy does that help?\n\n182\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.730\nBecause it means that in the middle\nof as we're transferring a file or\n\n183\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.700\nwe think we're transferring a file,\nwe're not.\n\n184\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.960\nWe're just writing to\nthe transaction logs.\n\n185\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.900\nSo, if power gets pulled out,\n\n186\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.330\nthe transaction log entry gets corrupted,\nis gone.\n\n187\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.450\nWell, we didn't start sending\nthe file to the hard drive yet.\n\n188\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.190\nSo, even though we haven't transferred it,\nwe didn't lose it or\n\n189\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.416\nwe didn't have it corrupted on the drive.\n\n190\n00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:44.740\nSo journal filling systems\nare really good and\n\n191\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.070\nthey help especially when you\nget other things that happen.\n\n192\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.030\nLike when two people trying to\naccess the file at the same time,\n\n193\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.640\nyou'll get corruption as well.\n\n194\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.270\nJournal filing systems says let me kinda\njust mark this as a transaction first.\n\n195\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.660\nLet's make sure we get everybody in\nline in the way that they want to, and\n\n196\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.250\nthen we'll give them access in the way\nthat appears in transaction logs.\n\n197\n00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.250\nSo it really does help out here.\n\n198\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.467\nSo journaling is one of the things that\nallows us now to say the file system\n\n199\n00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:14.636\nitself is no longer than a single\npoint of failure, once again, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:18.232\nAnd the same thing with the master\nboot record which we'll talk about\n\n201\n00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:19.419\nin comparison to GPT.\n\n202\n00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.956\nBut let me get back to this riser\nbecause it's really interesting,\n\n203\n00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.475\nyou got me on the wrong\ntrain of thought Daniel.\n\n204\n00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:28.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm getting back now, this is\n\n205\n00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:34.030\na side note, but riser after a while he\ndid good, people liked what he was doing.\n\n206\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.657\nAnd then he decided to murder somebody,\nyeah.\n\n207\n00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:40.119\nSo he was arrested and\nthen finally convicted, and\n\n208\n00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:42.760\nas far as I know he's serving in jail or\nhe died in jail.\n\n209\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.730\n&gt;&gt; You're not supposed to do that.\n\n210\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.364\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, okay?\n\n211\n00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:48.185\nSo that's how I always remember it,\nI don't know why,\n\n212\n00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:52.520\nI always remember John to rise always\ncomes to mind for one reason or another.\n\n213\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.120\nBut just kinda remember that this\nis the way that most file systems\n\n214\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.590\nthat we tend to want to work with today\nreally do or are beneficial to us, right?\n\n215\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.270\nIt really does prevent us\nfrom having data corruption\n\n216\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.590\nbecause we do actually write these types\nof journals or transaction logs, and\n\n217\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.670\nthen if it's not in transaction log\nit's not gonna get transferred.\n\n218\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.160\nNow transferred is not gonna get\ncorrupted in the midst of a transfer,\n\n219\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.040\nso we're not gonna ever have\npartial files or mixed up files or\n\n220\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.650\nanything like that we're done\nhave associated data with it.\n\n221\n00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.600\nSo journaling is a very\ngood thing that we want.\n\n222\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.899\nBut there are times when you cannot\nuse it, or you should not use it,\n\n223\n00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.698\nand those times are on solid-state drive.\n\n224\n00:11:32.698 --> 00:11:39.410\nNow, I wanna kind of go, well, so what I'm\nstill gonna run it, well you can, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.890\nBut remember that the limitation\nbehind the solid-state drive\n\n226\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.640\nis that there's only a limited amount\nof reads and writes that you can do.\n\n227\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.000\nAnd once that's done, it's done.\n\n228\n00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.840\nWell, in journaling file systems,\nit's always [LAUGH] I mean, it's constant.\n\n229\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.640\nYou're constantly battering that\nparticular solid-state drive,\n\n230\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.660\nand when you're doing something like that\nit is a constant read and write battle.\n\n231\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.390\nAnd you're not actually making\nsignificant transfers, right,\n\n232\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.440\nyou're not actually transferring data.\n\n233\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.390\nIt's really the transaction logs, and if\nyou're eating up half of the life of your\n\n234\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:18.870\ndrive by using transaction logs is fine,\nbut you've got to be able to account that.\n\n235\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.480\nBut as you take a look at the idea\nof solid-state drives though,\n\n236\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.230\nthey're saying that these things last\nas long as conventional drives now\n\n237\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.660\nas far as equality goes.\n\n238\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.689\nBut again who says that?\n\n239\n00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:33.470\nWhile you read articles\nthat's all I can tell you.\n\n240\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.097\nI don't know how they test that out except\nby running them as long as they do.\n\n241\n00:12:37.097 --> 00:12:41.040\nBut I know and Daniel you probably know\nthat we can buy a brand new drive,\n\n242\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.510\nyou smell it you go, yeah that's\nbrand new hard drive, it's fresh.\n\n243\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.100\nPut it in a drive and within a week you\nmight go, crap, this thing crapped out,\n\n244\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.400\nit's broken.\n\n245\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.790\nSo, you can't take everything\njust because somebody says,\n\n246\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.110\nit'll last as long as whatever you can.\n\n247\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.320\nBut you kind of have to go\nwith what you know here.\n\n248\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.910\nSo, for us you tend to not want\nto run journaling file systems\n\n249\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.470\non something like\na solid-state drive overall.\n\n250\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.070\nBut, if you want to I guess you can\nif you're willing to take that risk\n\n251\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.750\nat doing so.\n\n252\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.160\nThe other thing we also want to get to, of\ncourse, then is talking about the idea of\n\n253\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.510\nthe master boot record in\ncomparison to the GPT.\n\n254\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.340\nNow I've kinda have make sure as\nthis is as max as I can get it.\n\n255\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.350\nOver here, so\nthat we can do a side-by-side comparison\n\n256\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.490\non why we would choose to run\none over the other, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.290\nWell, at this point in time, right,\nas of the recording of this episode,\n\n258\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.606\nokay, it is 2017, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:46.030\nThe bios and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.760\n&gt;&gt; The MBR, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.270\nMBR was actually essentially\nkind of established in 1983.\n\n262\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.380\n&gt;&gt; It's a very good year.\n\n263\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A very good year.\n\n264\n00:13:54.415 --> 00:13:56.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's vintage.\n\n265\n00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're like me,\nyou already born, but\n\n266\n00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:02.364\nwe have plenty of staff here\nthat 1983 they were not born.\n\n267\n00:14:02.364 --> 00:14:04.644\n&gt;&gt; They know nothing about that date.\n\n268\n00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:09.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and it's not that it's bad,\nMBR still has its purpose and\n\n269\n00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:11.371\nits use, but it is old, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:14.125\nWhen it comes down to itself\nthere's limitations and\n\n271\n00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:15.724\nthat's kind of the key thing.\n\n272\n00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:18.700\nWhat are some of the limitations\nwe're essentially talking about?\n\n273\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.150\nSize limit on hard drive partitions\nis what we're really talking about.\n\n274\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.420\nSo, ultimately at this point an MBR can\nonly support up to two terabytes in\n\n275\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.520\nthe partition limit size.\n\n276\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.310\nAnd I'm going, why did they choose that,\n\n277\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.350\nit has to do with the number of bits\nmore than anything else, right?\n\n278\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.234\nSo whatever it is that equals two\nterabytes, if it's a 32-bit number they're\n\n279\n00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:45.287\nsaying, yeah we only made that\nparticular entry to be 24-bits.\n\n280\n00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:48.721\n&gt;&gt; Well 1983,\ntwo terabytes was unfathomably large.\n\n281\n00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:53.570\n&gt;&gt; It was unfathomable, yeah, and today\nwe're like I need a four-terabyte drive.\n\n282\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.514\n&gt;&gt; I'll get a thumb drive.\n\n283\n00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:55.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with that.\n\n284\n00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:56.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n285\n00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:01.195\nthat's the size limitation\nhere is kind of the key.\n\n286\n00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:05.880\nNotice that with MBR you have that\nmax of four partitions on a drive.\n\n287\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.820\nNow you go, I know that we can\nmake more volumes than that Ronny.\n\n288\n00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.409\nWell you can as long as you\nonly make three partitions,\n\n289\n00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:14.055\nand then one extended partition.\n\n290\n00:15:14.055 --> 00:15:17.589\nThen you can make as many drives as your\nspace will allow you to make in terms of\n\n291\n00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:19.870\nultimate volume that you have access to,\nokay?\n\n292\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.970\nHere's where the big limitation is,\nas a single point of failure the boot data\n\n293\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:31.090\nis stored once at the beginning\nof the disk itself, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.630\nThat's a big limitation in today's world\nwhen you start to think about, right?\n\n295\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.400\nYou're relying on that hard drive to\nhave all of the data that you have,\n\n296\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.350\nand you're gonna say, it's okay that\nI only have this information once.\n\n297\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.832\nI mean, I'd boot up to it,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n298\n00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:47.730\n[LAUGH\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.347\n&gt;&gt; If that thing gets corrupted,\n\n300\n00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:52.640\nthe big deal is you might not be\nable to access that drive again,\n\n301\n00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.022\nif you can't recover that boot data, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:57.334\nSo, that's why there's\na big limitation there.\n\n303\n00:15:57.334 --> 00:16:01.132\nThe other thing is it doesn't check for\nany of the data integrity either.\n\n304\n00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:03.099\nSo will it store a corrupt file?\n\n305\n00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:04.100\nYou better believe it.\n\n306\n00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.390\nIt'd go, yep, sure thing.\n\n307\n00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.960\nYou save it, I'll save it.\n\n308\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.390\nThat's-\n&gt;&gt; That's what you told me to do.\n\n309\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.187\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what you told me to do.\n\n310\n00:16:10.187 --> 00:16:13.140\n&gt;&gt; And computers have this\nweird little thing about them.\n\n311\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.110\nThey do what we tell them to do.\n\n312\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.270\n&gt;&gt; It is interesting how they do that.\n\n313\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.346\nIt's not the Terminator series that\nwe hope it might be to do this.\n\n314\n00:16:22.346 --> 00:16:28.620\nSo today, though, GPT really is associated\n\n315\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.240\nwith the idea of UEFI, okay, that\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n316\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.530\nOn this one, there are no real\nlimits of the partitions itself.\n\n317\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.870\nSo what does this mean?\n\n318\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.810\nIf there's any limitations,\nit's essentially artificial limitations,\n\n319\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.605\ndepending on the file system\nthat you end up choosing.\n\n320\n00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:50.437\nSo if I remember correctly, and this is\nwhere somebody will probably call me on\n\n321\n00:16:50.437 --> 00:16:52.990\nthis, and\nthat's fine cuz I won't remember.\n\n322\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.950\nBut I think, if I remember right, when\nWindows 7 came out, they said you can use\n\n323\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.130\nUEFI and GPT for\na maximum of 128 partitions.\n\n324\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.287\nSo you're not created\nextendable partitions or\n\n325\n00:17:06.287 --> 00:17:08.829\nyou're not doing anything like that.\n\n326\n00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.860\nYou're actually saying, 128 partitions?\n\n327\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.075\nYes, you can.\n\n328\n00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.718\nWe don't even have that many letters.\n\n329\n00:17:14.718 --> 00:17:17.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what does that?\n\n330\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.190\nBut the great thing is,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n331\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.390\nIt worked with volumes just as\nwell as on something like Linux.\n\n332\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.469\nThere are no real limits again on\nthe actual number of partitions,\n\n333\n00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:30.837\nnot partitions.\n\n334\n00:17:30.837 --> 00:17:31.980\nWhat did I want to say here?\n\n335\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.060\nThis was number of limits on-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n336\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.012\nRonnie, there doesn't really seem to be a\nwhole lot of difference between your first\n\n337\n00:17:40.012 --> 00:17:41.690\nbullet point there and your second.\n\n338\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.130\nI assume that you have something mixed up,\nwhich happens when you copy and paste.\n\n339\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me take a look at this.\n\n340\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.740\nYeah, there's no doubt.\n\n341\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.980\nI did write exactly almost the same\nthing on the number of partitions here.\n\n342\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.660\nWhat I meant as I take a look\nacross over here is no real\n\n343\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.790\nsize limits, is what I meant here.\n\n344\n00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.280\nSo what I just kind of expounded on,\nright,\n\n345\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.700\nwas this one,\nwhere number of partition limits.\n\n346\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.480\nSo remember that Windows itself\nactually says 128 actual partitions.\n\n347\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.340\nBut in terms of sizes, though,\neven though we can have a maximum of two\n\n348\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:24.120\nterabytes here, and this one,\nit is also up to the file system itself.\n\n349\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.440\nSo that is dependent upon\nwhatever the file system says.\n\n350\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.260\n&gt;&gt; So UEFI's not putting any limitations\non how large your partitions can be.\n\n351\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.570\nThat is in the realm of the file system.\n\n352\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what you choose, like NTFS,\nor you choose something else here, EXT,\n\n353\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.623\nEXT might go, no,\nwe're gonna limit you to 1,000 and\n\n354\n00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:49.140\nthen all of a sudden you're like,\nyeah, I wanted 1,010.\n\n355\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.580\nThat's what will happen.\n\n356\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.630\nBut you kind of get the idea, so\nthat was just me being a typo and\n\n357\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.150\na blunder on something like this as well.\n\n358\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.910\nThe boot data, though, notice that now\nthe reason why we would choose this, too.\n\n359\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.310\nSo these things probably don't really\nbother us in terms of the number of\n\n360\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.950\npartitions and any of the limits.\n\n361\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:11.460\nEven with the BIOS, it's still\npretty large for a partition size.\n\n362\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.020\nMax of four, I can't think of\nthe last time I said I needed five.\n\n363\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.090\nI'm really kinda going, I don't see\nthat as being a real limitation.\n\n364\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a file server.\n\n365\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a file server.\n\n366\n00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.540\nYeah, databases galore where\nyou have a ton of things.\n\n367\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.120\nBut for me, not so much.\n\n368\n00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.380\nBut notice the boot data though.\n\n369\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.740\nThis is stored multiple times, and\n\n370\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.690\nin GPT it's stored with every\none of these partitions, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.830\nSo that way, if it corrupts,\n\n372\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.640\nwhichever the first one is it corrupts, it\ngoes, I've got plenty that I can back up.\n\n373\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.340\nYou corrupt the first two?\n\n374\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.360\nI've got a third one\nthat we can actually do.\n\n375\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.030\nYou name it, it actually does that.\n\n376\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.370\nIt has it stored in multiple places.\n\n377\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.840\nSo it can build on that\neven if it actually goes,\n\n378\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.030\nI found these being corrupted, it has\nenough remaining left over to do that.\n\n379\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:03.490\nThe last little attribute I want to\nreally focus in on is right here.\n\n380\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:09.243\nStores the cyclic redundancy check for\ndata integrity, okay?\n\n381\n00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:11.070\nAnd this is really important.\n\n382\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.510\nIt means we're not gonna\nactually store corrupted files.\n\n383\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.150\nAnd when it writes it, it checks and\nverifies it, right, so when it read it,\n\n384\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.250\nit goes, all right,\nhere is the number I got.\n\n385\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.010\nWhen it write it it goes,\nhere is the number I got.\n\n386\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.570\nIt's the same, let's restore.\n\n387\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.190\nIt doesn't match out, it goes,\nlet's not store that.\n\n388\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.680\nLet's kinda get the right one there.\n\n389\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.590\nSo this is really helpful once again.\n\n390\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.380\nWe're not gonna lose data due to\neither one of these ideas, right?\n\n391\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.650\nThe boot data being corrupted, so\n\n392\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.970\nthere's no single point of failure there,\nand there's no single point of\n\n393\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.480\nfailure in terms of the data\ngetting corrupted as well.\n\n394\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.780\nSo those are kind of key elements\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n395\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.065\nAnd that's something that\nyou can decide based on your\n\n396\n00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:58.800\nhardware that you have access to,\ntoo, okay.\n\n397\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.660\nAll right, so last two that we have here,\nright, the swap file system.\n\n398\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.590\nSwap file system for us really allows us\nto be able to take a portion of our hard\n\n399\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.700\ndrive, okay, and\nuse it if we run out of RAM.\n\n400\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.780\nIt's pretty much what it\ngives us that ability to do.\n\n401\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.150\nSo we have this not only,\nof course, inside of Linux,\n\n402\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.110\nwe also have something like\nthis inside of Windows.\n\n403\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.260\nIn Windows, they don't call it this.\n\n404\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.010\nThey call it the page file.\n\n405\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.240\nI was trying to make sure\nif I remembered it right.\n\n406\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.940\nThey call it like the page file,\nsomething like that.\n\n407\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.310\nBut just kinda remember that\nthis is also something that we\n\n408\n00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.458\nwant to take a look at as well.\n\n409\n00:21:34.458 --> 00:21:38.120\nYou wanna make sure that you're\nmindful of this in terms of forensics.\n\n410\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.800\nThat data could be existing right here.\n\n411\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.630\nWhen would it actually exist?\n\n412\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.100\nWell, if there's some type of hibernation\nfeature like there is in Windows,\n\n413\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.870\nyou can actually pull data right out of\nthat swap file and that will also do it,\n\n414\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.410\ntoo, just like you can a page\nfile inside of Windows, okay?\n\n415\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.520\nSo those are kinda the basic features that\nwe wanna go over, but if you wanna learn\n\n416\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.660\nmore about Linux, again,\ncheck out the Linux shows that we have.\n\n417\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.310\nBut as well as what we\nwere focusing on inside\n\n418\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.930\nof the cybersecurity fundamental\nshow that we also did too, okay?\n\n419\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:16.342\nNow the last one down here, this to me\nis a little bit of a, I don't know.\n\n420\n00:22:16.342 --> 00:22:20.897\nIt's a mistake, I think,\ninside of the exam objectives.\n\n421\n00:22:20.897 --> 00:22:24.350\nIt doesn't make sense that\nthey're talking about the-\n\n422\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.320\n&gt;&gt; The media access control?\n\n423\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the media access control\nnumber with the file system.\n\n424\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.580\nI guess somebody could figure something\nout but I couldn't figure it out.\n\n425\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.720\nBut I think what they really meant\nwas we need to take a look at the MAC\n\n426\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.770\nfile system as well.\n\n427\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.380\nAnd this is where you get into the AFP,\nthe Apple file protocol,\n\n428\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:47.735\nas well as the one that's really kinda\ncalled out there is gonna be the HFS.\n\n429\n00:22:47.735 --> 00:22:49.570\nThe hierarchical journaling,\n\n430\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.920\nthe hierarchical journal file\nsystem that they have available.\n\n431\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.230\nNormally this is gonna run on MacOS 10 or\nMacOSS as it's called now.\n\n432\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.115\nThat's kind of the big thing\nthat we have here, too.\n\n433\n00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:06.175\nGreat thing about whether you're talking\nabout Mac or Linux they're compatible just\n\n434\n00:23:06.175 --> 00:23:11.025\nabout, right, cuz the Mac is\npretty much a version, is Unix.\n\n435\n00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:11.600\n&gt;&gt; It is Unix.\n\n436\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is Unix,\na version this out there.\n\n437\n00:23:13.907 --> 00:23:18.287\nSo it really does kind of coincide and\nmatch really well but we're\n\n438\n00:23:18.287 --> 00:23:22.257\nnot going to spend, actually that's about\nall of the time we're going to spend.\n\n439\n00:23:22.257 --> 00:23:23.527\nYou might be going like, why.\n\n440\n00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:26.977\nOnce again it's not that\nbig in the enterprise so\n\n441\n00:23:26.977 --> 00:23:29.547\nwe're going to mention it and\nmake sure that we know that.\n\n442\n00:23:29.547 --> 00:23:32.197\nThe great thing is on Mac you can read\n\n443\n00:23:32.197 --> 00:23:34.560\nfrom these other systems\nthat are out there.\n\n444\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.770\nSo on a Mac computer I can\npull an NTFS drive and\n\n445\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.800\npull a file off and\nbe able to do that as well.\n\n446\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.760\n&gt;&gt; You can't write to it.\n\n447\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Can't write to it very easily\nwithout third party utilities, but\n\n448\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.420\nyeah, it can be done.\n\n449\n00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.810\nAnd the same thing now with even NTFS,\nyou can actually write to Mac and\n\n450\n00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:50.660\neven the Linux stuff.\n\n451\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.105\nBut with third party utilities,\nthere's no native support.\n\n452\n00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:55.930\nBut all that can be done if\nyou're willing to use third\n\n453\n00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.520\nparty utilities that are out there.\n\n454\n00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.730\nBut just kind of have those basics down\nand make sure you go over once again\n\n455\n00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.630\nyour knowledge of Linux before\nyou get ready for this exam.\n\n456\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.030\nThere's gonna be a lot more Linux\nstuff coming up in our shows\n\n457\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.550\nas we start doing more\nof the analysis part.\n\n458\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.290\nBut at least here on the file system side,\nthat will get you started.\n\n459\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.850\nThose are the actual terms that are called\nout for the exam objectives, so\n\n460\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.790\nmake sure you do understand them and\nget ready for them for the exam.\n\n461\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.284\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, I look forward to\nthat because Linux is my hometown,\n\n462\n00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:27.979\nthat's for sure.\n\n463\n00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:29.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I enjoy working in there and\n\n464\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:35.230\nseeing how other areas of\nthe IT spectrum deal with it.\n\n465\n00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.480\nSo it's a lot of fun\nseeing those perspectives.\n\n466\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.510\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today.\n\n467\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.860\nWe appreciate your effort on this show.\n\n468\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.340\nIt was really great content.\n\n469\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.610\nAnd we do appreciate our audiences,\nas well, for watching.\n\n470\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.588\nHopefully you got a lot out\nof this you could take and\n\n471\n00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:47.785\ngo ruminate in it a little bit.\n\n472\n00:24:47.785 --> 00:24:49.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as for the show, it's time for\n\n473\n00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.070\nus to sign off.\n\n474\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.340\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n475\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.123\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n476\n00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:56.849\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n477\n00:24:56.849 --> 00:25:02.781\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:05.718\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.282\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:11.753\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:17.030\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.777\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and in today's\nepisode, well I hope your strapped\n\n7\n00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:24.152\nin your seat because we're back with\nmore in our Cisco SecOps series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:25.894\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:30.100\nagain, lending his expertise on this very\ntopic, our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.970\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.940\nWe're so glad to have you again.\n\n12\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.780\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.870\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.540\nThank you again for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to work through\n\n15\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.340\nthese exam objectives that's gonna help us\nget ready for, of course, the SecOps exam.\n\n16\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.670\nAnd we are now up to this point\nwhere we're taking a look at\n\n17\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.880\nsome of the different\nforensic requirements.\n\n18\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.950\nI don't know how to describe\nthe idea here in terms of evidence.\n\n19\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.540\nAnd we wanna talk about this\nidea of evidence in a little it.\n\n20\n00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.300\nBut some of the terminology that\nyou really need to be familiar with\n\n21\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.840\nbecause if there's anything, especially\nwhen getting ready for the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.130\nThey love these areas whereas,\n\n23\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.370\nit's just basic knowledge\nthat you just have to know.\n\n24\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.225\nAnd they like it because most of us\nwill tend to skip over this to try and\n\n25\n00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:18.481\nget to the meat and\npotatoes of the things we want to do, and\n\n26\n00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.817\nnot pay attention to other areas as well.\n\n27\n00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:23.701\n&gt;&gt; Memorization, not so\nmuch fun in most people's books.\n\n28\n00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not so much fun but\n\n29\n00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:26.876\nstill important because there is a chance.\n\n30\n00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:30.837\nEspecially as security analyst,\nthat what you may end up find out, right?\n\n31\n00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:33.920\nIs that you get called onto the stand and\n\n32\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.343\nat this point here it's because\nyou're having to do that testifying\n\n33\n00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:45.340\nto the very fact that there is a computer\nthat you ended up taking apart.\n\n34\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.230\nOr are you the one who did\nthe disk imagine here?\n\n35\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.940\nAt least tell us the process\nof what's going on.\n\n36\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.910\nAnd how did you do it?\n\n37\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.370\nYou have to know that kind of stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.450\nSo we need to get our minds\ninto the proper framework and\n\n39\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.980\nunderstand some of the basic terminology\n\n40\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.220\nwhen it comes down to forensic evidence\nthat we are going to deal with.\n\n41\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.514\nSo we are gonna take a little bit of\na step backward in case it's been\n\n42\n00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:13.054\na while since you did take a look at\nthe security fundamentals course.\n\n43\n00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:16.580\nCuz I know that we briefly touched on\nsome of the the terminology there.\n\n44\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.380\nSo this is just a little bit of a brief\nreview and primer to that concept as well.\n\n45\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.150\nAnd then we'll get started into the areas\nthat are really called out on the exam for\n\n46\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.440\nus to focus on.\n\n47\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.100\nAnd that's what we want to do.\n\n48\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.910\nSo Daniel, as we begin,\n\n49\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.470\nwe of course are going to mention\nthe term computer forensics.\n\n50\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.180\nIt's actually part of the exam objective\nthat we're taking a look at now\n\n51\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.450\nis this idea and\nthey just call it computer forensics.\n\n52\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.600\nSo when we start to take a look at that,\n\n53\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.770\nwe need to break those two\nterms down a little bit more.\n\n54\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.080\nSo when it comes down\nto the term forensics.\n\n55\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.630\nDaniel, there have been\nenough TV shows out there for\n\n56\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.610\nus to kind of really get our\nhead almost wrapped into it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.540\nBut do you get the sense that any time you\nactually see the word forensics inside of\n\n58\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.520\na TV show that you're really gonna learn\nmuch about what the real concept is now.\n\n59\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.645\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's CSI, that's the best show.\n\n60\n00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean no,\n\n61\n00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.257\nnot really, obviously.\n\n62\n00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:12.148\nIt's a show, they're trying to\nglamorize things and make it look cool.\n\n63\n00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:17.688\nSo probably not getting a perfect\ntype of forensics investigation.\n\n64\n00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:21.640\nBut forensics is just basically boils\ndown to the fact that we're taking\n\n65\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.480\nin depth look at something and\nacquiring evidence through that look.\n\n66\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and technically,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.910\ntake a look at the kind of formalized\ndefinition that I've pulled in here and\n\n68\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.450\nthey're in quotes because I\npulled this right from here.\n\n69\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.240\nLet me see if I can show you where\nI actually pulled that from.\n\n70\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.600\nThere is a place online and\nI'll show you this and\n\n71\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.810\nthis will also be included\nin the [INAUDIBLE] right,\n\n72\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.100\nhere from us-cert.gov and\nthis is just a basic publication.\n\n73\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.626\nThis says updated, now.\n\n74\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.600\nDaniel, the weird thing about\nthe updating from the government, right.\n\n75\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.220\nIf big companies move at\nthe speed of a glacier,\n\n76\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.033\na government moves at\nthe speed of an ice age, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:00.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't.\n\n78\n00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:01.430\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n79\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.840\n&gt;&gt; So when I saw an update, I said,\n\n80\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.793\nthat's cool and then I scrolled\ndown to the bottom of the document.\n\n81\n00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:13.690\nIt was updated in 2008 and you're like,\nthat's the updated version [INAUDIBLE].\n\n82\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.899\n&gt;&gt; It was a while back, Ronnie.\n\n83\n00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.737\n&gt;&gt; A while back when it\ncomes down to it but\n\n84\n00:04:16.737 --> 00:04:19.250\nthis is where I pulled\nthe information from.\n\n85\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.300\nAnd the great thing, like I said,\n\n86\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.990\nis you'll see it in your notes too,\non the show notes on the site.\n\n87\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.900\nAnd I'll even have a link there\nthat you can click on and see this.\n\n88\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.150\nBut let's define that term\nforensics at the beginning,\n\n89\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.510\njust like Daniel did in better\nlayman's terms than we have.\n\n90\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.930\nBut there's a couple of phrases here that\nwe want to point out of course, right?\n\n91\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.390\nSo forensics is the process of using\nscientific knowledge, ooh nice,\n\n92\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.180\nfor collecting, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.000\nSo, there's that word,\ncollecting, right there.\n\n94\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.260\nAnd of course, even analyzing, okay, that\nactually sounds pretty darn good there.\n\n95\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.479\nBut that's the part that we get\nto see on the TV shows, right?\n\n96\n00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.600\nThe collecting and the analysis part.\n\n97\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.730\nBut then when it come to\npresenting the evidence in court.\n\n98\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.010\nWell, that part it almost\ngets glossed over or\n\n99\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.660\nif it's anything it's just really\na brief sentence or two that you have.\n\n100\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.500\nBut notice right here,\neven in the definition.\n\n101\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.670\nThe word forensics and\nwhat it really means.\n\n102\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.140\nIt means to bring it to the court and\n\n103\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.940\nthere are particular procedures that\nwe have to be able to understand.\n\n104\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.050\nBut the whole thing that you're getting\nto is that forensics is about the idea of\n\n105\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.020\ngathering evidence, right?\n\n106\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.280\nAt least according to using the scientific\nknowledge that you have in the proper\n\n107\n00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.560\ncollection, in the analysis of it and\nof course, presenting it that way.\n\n108\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.960\nAnd it primarily deals\nwith the recovery and\n\n109\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.260\nanalysis of what they\ncall latent evidence.\n\n110\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.438\nAnd so that's kinda the basics.\n\n111\n00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:52.539\nThe strange thing about the realm\nof computer forensics which is\n\n112\n00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.547\nreally what's caught out on our\nexam objectives here is that,\n\n113\n00:05:57.547 --> 00:06:01.860\nit's own scientific\ndiscipline unto itself.\n\n114\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.552\nSo even though forensics is a big part of\nthe discipline of everything that we do in\n\n115\n00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:08.210\nterms of criminal justice.\n\n116\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.093\nIn computer forensics at least as of 2008,\nand that's the only place I\n\n117\n00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:17.123\ncan point you to officially,\nthat they don't consider it yet\n\n118\n00:06:17.123 --> 00:06:21.130\nit's own scientific theory or\ndiscipline unto itself.\n\n119\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.440\nBut they refer to it as the discipline\nthat combines the elements of law and\n\n120\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.580\ncomputer science.\n\n121\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.060\nWell, pretty much do the same thing.\n\n122\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.870\nCollect and analyze data from computer\nsystems networks here notice that?\n\n123\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:39.160\nWireless as well, and even storage devices\nin a way that is admissible as evidence.\n\n124\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.740\nAnd that is that key term that we're\nreally focusing in on here, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.960\nSo it's all about this idea of making\nsure that we understand that this is key.\n\n126\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.482\nNow the problem that we have, of course,\n\n127\n00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:55.749\nis that when you start taking a look\nat the idea of computer forensics.\n\n128\n00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:01.306\nAnd you start to talk about that,\nyou have to be very careful\n\n129\n00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:06.910\nin the way that the data is\nactually collected as well.\n\n130\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.098\nAnd that is because the data on computers\ndon't only reside on well, hard drives.\n\n131\n00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:18.170\nOkay, so it'd be nice Daniel that if\nevery computer crime that was committed,\n\n132\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.070\nit only really had to deal with the idea\nof the data being on the hard drive.\n\n133\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.340\nThat means that we could walk into,\n\n134\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.900\nof course with the approval\nof the court and everything.\n\n135\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.647\nAnd we could walk, grab somebody's laptop,\nturn it off or whatever, and\n\n136\n00:07:32.647 --> 00:07:35.010\nwe have all the evidence right there.\n\n137\n00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.650\nBut Daniel,\n\n138\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:41.130\nif somebody is in the middle of doing\nthe criminal activity on the computer and\n\n139\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.990\nI shut off is there a possibility that\nI'm going to lose data at some point?\n\n140\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great possibility.\n\n141\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160\nCuz that's what we've talked about before.\n\n142\n00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.900\nMaybe you're in the middle of\na ride you pull the power.\n\n143\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.174\nPeople think it's been effective.\n\n144\n00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:55.361\nIf something's happening just snatch\nthat power cable out of that.\n\n145\n00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:59.911\nNot the best thing that you wanna do\nin most cases if not all cases because.\n\n146\n00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:04.050\nYou could corrupt data, you could lose\ndata, and that can be the smoking gun\n\n147\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.720\nnecessary, or it just calls in\nthe integrity of the data itself.\n\n148\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.461\nRight.\nAnd that's what you don't want.\n\n149\n00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.754\n&gt;&gt; And so, there's another term that\nwe definitely need to get to before we,\n\n150\n00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:14.395\nI kind of jumped the gun a little bit.\n\n151\n00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:17.604\nBut at the same time it's\nactually worth us talking about,\n\n152\n00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:21.197\nbecause in computer forensics,\nyou do have to be careful to try and\n\n153\n00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:23.464\nkeep the data preserved as well as we can.\n\n154\n00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:27.453\nAnd we're going to find out something,\nit's not as easily preserved as we\n\n155\n00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:30.260\nthink it is, some of it is,\nbut a lot of it isn't.\n\n156\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.320\nA lot of it is during the activity in\nwhich you're just sitting right there, and\n\n157\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.380\nit's actually right up there on the\nscreen, and if somebody drops the power\n\n158\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.140\noff whatever is in RAM kinda just\ndisappears and there you go.\n\n159\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.589\nSo, that's what we wanna talk about\nbefore we get to that, okay, so\n\n160\n00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:51.961\nthe term that I forgot to mention in terms\nof basic terminology that I wanted to get,\n\n161\n00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:55.185\nis the idea that collecting the evidence,\nokay,\n\n162\n00:08:55.185 --> 00:08:57.996\nis key in the process\nthat we collect it in.\n\n163\n00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.528\nAnd there's a lot of information\nthat we have to know,\n\n164\n00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:03.500\nbecause what we need to do if we\nare going to collect it is we have to\n\n165\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.280\nestablish what we call\nthe chain of custody.\n\n166\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.270\nNow, there's no easy way\nto kind of define and\n\n167\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.600\ndescribe all this, but when it comes\ndown to it you need to know about who,\n\n168\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.780\nyou need to know about when and\nwhy, who is handling it.\n\n169\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.180\nSo, where, when, why, if you can\nprobably establish the why through your\n\n170\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.440\nanalysis more than anything else.\n\n171\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.760\nBut you wanna make sure that\nthere's clear documentation,\n\n172\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.630\nokay, of each step of the process.\n\n173\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.190\nNotice down here at the bottom when we\ntalk about establishing the chain right\n\n174\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.630\nthrough here, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.140\nFrom the time it's collected all the way\nthrough to the time it's actually\n\n176\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.310\npresented and reported.\n\n177\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.520\nIn the court, there has to be\nthat clear chain of custody.\n\n178\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.300\nNow, Daniel, why is that so important?\n\n179\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.260\nWhat could happen if I don't establish\nthat clear chain of custody?\n\n180\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.540\n&gt;&gt; We start to call into question\nthe integrity of the evidence itself.\n\n181\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.670\nBecause I can't account for where it\nhas been, who's done something to it.\n\n182\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.740\nDo we know?, we don't know, because there\nhas been no clear chain of evidence that\n\n183\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.620\nthe custody chain has not been followed.\n\n184\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.210\nTo some degree where I say, okay, Ronny,\nI'm heading these over to you, and\n\n185\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.220\nthere's a log of created date and time,\nwho picked it up, who you got it from,\n\n186\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.890\nhow long they had it, and moving on and\nforward, because as it now.\n\n187\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.850\nIf I'm an attorney, I'm just gonna go,\n\n188\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:28.150\nwell during time A to time B who can\naccount for having this evidence?\n\n189\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.980\nWho can account for what happened\nto this evidence during that time?\n\n190\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.975\nCan you?\nNo, no one can.\n\n191\n00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:34.670\nIt's inadmissible.\n\n192\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.630\n&gt;&gt; That's the problem.\n\n193\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.503\nThe very fact that any point in\nthe line in that time period,\n\n194\n00:10:40.503 --> 00:10:46.265\nthat broken up timeline I've drawn\non the bottom of the screen there.\n\n195\n00:10:46.265 --> 00:10:49.432\nIf somebody can show where you\ndon't have a clue who's doing it,\n\n196\n00:10:49.432 --> 00:10:52.890\nmeans somebody could have\ntampered with it and put it back.\n\n197\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.320\nSomebody could have actually replaced it,\nand we wouldn't actually know about this.\n\n198\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.070\nSo, the idea of clear documentation\nis pretty much key here.\n\n199\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.000\nAnd notice, that it actually does talk\nabout it in each of the phase that we've\n\n200\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.930\ntalked about, when it was discovered and\ncollected when it was handled, or\n\n201\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.450\nexamined, every stage has\nto have this information.\n\n202\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.230\nAnd then, of course,\nwho had custody, what period?\n\n203\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.336\nHow long it was stored and\n\n204\n00:11:16.336 --> 00:11:18.768\nhow it was stored is another\npart through the archive.\n\n205\n00:11:18.768 --> 00:11:20.995\n&gt;&gt; Take it and check on my car [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.707\n&gt;&gt; And just that's kinda\nthe most famous case of it.\n\n207\n00:11:23.707 --> 00:11:24.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n208\n00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:26.957\n&gt;&gt; Daniel,\nof all of the ones that we think about,\n\n209\n00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:28.820\nthis goes back years and years.\n\n210\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.796\nIf we go back to the OJ Simpson trial,\none of the things that they picked on\n\n211\n00:11:33.796 --> 00:11:38.459\nwas that the guy collected the evidence,\nand then, went to lunch.\n\n212\n00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.850\nAnd he pretty much said,\nthe evidence was in the trunk of the car.\n\n213\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.440\nNobody was bothering it,\nand they tore that apart.\n\n214\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.288\nAnd they were just pretty much saying,\n\n215\n00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:48.752\nwere your eyes in the trunk\nof the car the whole time?\n\n216\n00:11:48.752 --> 00:11:51.730\nNo, I was ordering my burritos,\nor whatever it was.\n\n217\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.950\nIn line, I was watching those, so,\nI know it's kind of weird, but\n\n218\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.000\nthey were able to tear that apart.\n\n219\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.770\nSo, here chain of custody is\nvery important once again, and\n\n220\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.560\nmaking sure we understand that.\n\n221\n00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.000\nWe don't have the clear idea\nof whose responsible for\n\n222\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.770\nthis, at any point in time, all the way\nto the time it's presented in court.\n\n223\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.120\nThen that means there's\na legal argument for\n\n224\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.750\nthe very fact that somebody could\nhave actually tampered with it.\n\n225\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.020\nOr, you could have actually gone,\nI don't know where it is.\n\n226\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.530\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to computer forensics, or\n\n227\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.140\nforensics in general,\nyou'll hear this phrase thrown a lot.\n\n228\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.140\nWhich is forensically sound way, right?\n\n229\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.300\nYou must do everything in\na forensically sound way.\n\n230\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.680\nThrowing evidence in\nthe trunk of your car, and\n\n231\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.000\ngetting a burrito is not a forensically\nsound way to transport evidence.\n\n232\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.240\nAnd therefore it calls in the question and\nthe integrity of set evidence, and\n\n233\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.370\nit worked very well for\nthe defense attorneys for every Simpson,\n\n234\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.730\nbecause they got him, he was acquitted.\n\n235\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.960\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, so in this instance, right,\n\n236\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.280\nas we start to take a look now at the idea\nof computer crime, it's the same thing.\n\n237\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.340\nSo, whether we're talking about something\nlike that, which of course, is a horrific\n\n238\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.000\ncrime, and even of course, even most\nof the computer crimes are horrific.\n\n239\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.184\nWe have to make sure\nthat we maintain that.\n\n240\n00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:09.355\nSo, having a good understanding of\nwhat computer forensics is about,\n\n241\n00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:13.596\nunderstanding that we're still following\nthat same idea of the chain of\n\n242\n00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:18.730\ncustody is really going to be something\nthat we don't want to move away from.\n\n243\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:24.900\nThese particular terms and understanding\nthis, is clearly part of something that\n\n244\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.240\nif we do have something that happens\nwithin our organization, that from\n\n245\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.500\nthe time it is collected, and that is\nthe key, that we have this established.\n\n246\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.920\nSo, if you do find out that there is,\nthrough your own analysis, or\n\n247\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.180\nthrough your security operations\ncenter analysis, that a server did get\n\n248\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.740\ncompromised, well, if you know that\nthis is a criminally prosecutable thing,\n\n249\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.850\nyou start at that point.\n\n250\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.240\nHere's what we've done\nto isolate this thing.\n\n251\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.720\nAnd then you go, who, where.\n\n252\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.870\nI won't want to say, why, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.110\n&gt;&gt; Where, when and\n\n254\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:01.220\nwho has actually collected this,\nand what are we actually in place\n\n255\n00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.930\nto the point where you can hand that off,\nand then somebody else takes over.\n\n256\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.760\nBut you want to make sure\nthat's actually clear.\n\n257\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.940\nNow, let's go back to what Daniel was\nsaying a little early and what I was\n\n258\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.730\ntrying to lead to and kind of skipped\nover, or jumped over this for a moment.\n\n259\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.373\nRemember that, because evidence,\nespecially in computer terms, is digital,\n\n260\n00:14:20.373 --> 00:14:23.535\nnot everything's on a hard drive there is,\nof course,\n\n261\n00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:27.997\nthen evidence that resides in what we\ncall the volatile areas of the computer.\n\n262\n00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:32.460\nAnd that means it can change very\nquickly in the things that we do.\n\n263\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.520\nOne of the neatest kind\nof events that happen and\n\n264\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.520\nthe way that you know that that computer,\nCrime Stoppers that are out there like\n\n265\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.070\nthe FBI are really up on this, right, is\nthe guy that got taken down for Silk Road.\n\n266\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.830\nThey didn't wait for him to go,\nI'm done logging off and\n\n267\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.530\nshutting his computer down.\n\n268\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.220\nThey actually waited for him to type\nin his laptop, and they tackled him.\n\n269\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.342\nThey didn't just go,\nplease step away from the computer.\n\n270\n00:14:58.342 --> 00:14:59.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n271\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.840\n&gt;&gt; They tackled him before he actually got\na chance to not only encrypt the drive,\n\n272\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.110\nbut before he gotta chance\nto close the drive.\n\n273\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.030\nAnd that's how they were able to get into\nthe system, and that's, because there\n\n274\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:13.160\ncould be information right there on\nthe screen that is available to them.\n\n275\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.100\nSo, when it comes down to the idea of\nthe collection of the evidence then,\n\n276\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.970\nthis is where we have to work through\nwhat we call the order of volatility.\n\n277\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:27.000\nNow, when we start to take a look at\nthis idea of the order of volatility.\n\n278\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.850\nEven though I thought like this\nis gonna be relatively new,\n\n279\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.040\nit's older than I think it is.\n\n280\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.840\nAnd even has it's own RFC of all the\nthings that you kind of take a look at.\n\n281\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.600\nAnd you know, I thought that the US\nsort was kind of, how I can describe it?\n\n282\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.290\nNotice, Daniel.\n\n283\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.511\nLook at the date.\n\n284\n00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.402\n&gt;&gt; 2002.\n\n285\n00:15:48.402 --> 00:15:51.283\n&gt;&gt; Right, from 2002.\n\n286\n00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.215\n&gt;&gt; 15 years old now.\n\n287\n00:15:52.215 --> 00:15:57.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's still kind of the standard\nin the way that we collect this idea of\n\n288\n00:15:57.079 --> 00:15:58.070\nthe evidence.\n\n289\n00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.003\nYou can see where it's actually the.\n\n290\n00:16:00.003 --> 00:16:03.704\nGuidelines for\nevidence collecting and archiving and\n\n291\n00:16:03.704 --> 00:16:08.692\nwhat's out there, because they realize\nthis is gonna continue to become\n\n292\n00:16:08.692 --> 00:16:12.980\nan issue as the world started\ngrowing along with Internet.\n\n293\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.780\nLast quarter I hit a 2.1, is where we are.\n\n294\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:23.350\nWe can see very clearly this idea of\nthe order of volatility right here.\n\n295\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.510\nWhen we start to talk about this.\n\n296\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.600\nAnd let me make it bigger coming back.\n\n297\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.130\nToo big.\n\n298\n00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Too big.\n\n299\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Coming back over here.\n\n300\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.470\nThis should help us out.\n\n301\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.040\nWe always want to make\nsure that as you kinda\n\n302\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.050\ngo from the top to the bottom, right?\n\n303\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.960\nThe order of volatility means\nwhat can disappear the quickest.\n\n304\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.560\nSo when you are now collecting\nthe evidence, you need to get the evidence\n\n305\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.000\nwhile it exists out there and\nthat's the kind of key.\n\n306\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.990\nWhen you close down the actual computer,\n\n307\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.830\nyou remove electricity a lot fo time,\nbesides your laptop.\n\n308\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.200\nOn a regular computer system,\nyou might actually end up of\n\n309\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.910\ncourse losing what's ever right\nhere in the CPU on the cache.\n\n310\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.780\nRegister content not so much but\nthey still include it up here as being\n\n311\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.640\nkind of that primary\ninformation that you have.\n\n312\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.340\nSo if you have the utilities and\ntools make sure you start there.\n\n313\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.700\nAnd pull off whatever information\nyou can get from that particular.\n\n314\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.090\nRealm right there as well, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.720\nAnd that is because that\ninformation flies through there\n\n316\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.160\nat billions of calculations per second.\n\n317\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.870\nAnd that's why we want to\nmake sure that we do that.\n\n318\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.570\nIn register content it's\nbecause it's really small and\n\n319\n00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.680\ngets replaced when you have that too.\n\n320\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.430\nAnd the same thing with the cache.\n\n321\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.750\nIt's just a small amount of\ncache memory that's in there.\n\n322\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.200\nIt again gets replaced after a while.\n\n323\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.220\nVery quickly too.\n\n324\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.730\nMuch faster than even\nthe RAM on your computer.\n\n325\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.730\nOf course, CPU is by far insanely fast.\n\n326\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.870\nMake sure you get the information out\nof there as much as you can to do that.\n\n327\n00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.730\nNotice this is more generic.\n\n328\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.230\nIf we're on a PC, we'd be talking about\nlike tons of these ARP Cache, but you can.\n\n329\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.310\nBut here it is.\n\n330\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.260\nRouting table, ARP Cache,\nprocess table, kernel stats, and\n\n331\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.680\nI included memory right here as well.\n\n332\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.790\nAnd the reason why is that the original\nRFC put some memory up here but\n\n333\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.600\nyou'll end up seeing\nthat as you read more and\n\n334\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.230\nmore articles on this order of volatility,\nthis kind of separated out a lot of\n\n335\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.750\ntimes as well, that it kind of\ngot moved into it's own category.\n\n336\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.790\n&gt;&gt; It is little more stable than\nthe others in the list, I guess.\n\n337\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yep, and that's the only thing\nI can think of as well as that when you\n\n338\n00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.170\nstart reading another people's blogs and\nstuff they always separate this one out,\n\n339\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.110\nso I put it in two places.Now,\nyou- Ronnie which one- I don't know.\n\n340\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.170\nAnd if it comes down to the exam on this,\n\n341\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.990\nI can't tell you which one you'll\nsee it in because I really can't.\n\n342\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.310\nI wish I could tell you.\n\n343\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.020\nBut overall, though, just kinda realize,\n\n344\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.960\nwhen you see something like this here,\nyou may see it as a standalone unit or\n\n345\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.320\nyou may see it along with\nthis type of information too.\n\n346\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.990\nNow earlier in our series, Daniel,\n\n347\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.550\nwe also talked a little bit about\nthe idea of the temporal file system, or\n\n348\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.740\nthe swap space page file,\nwhatever information that we have.\n\n349\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.160\nNow Daniel, what's so important about\nthis swap file that we might need to get\n\n350\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.340\nbecause it's part of the hard\ndrive do I have to worry about it?\n\n351\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.430\n&gt;&gt; Totally you have to worry about it.\n\n352\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.380\nYou have to worry about everything\nwhen it comes to this stuff.\n\n353\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.140\nYou have to remember, what does the spot\nfile do basically working as extra memory.\n\n354\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.440\nIf memories important then the swap\nfile is going to be just as important.\n\n355\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.200\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt especially, I kind of\nmentioned this in the other show, as well.\n\n356\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.300\nThat if you are, whether on Linux, or\na Windows machine, I'm more familiar with\n\n357\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.110\nthe Windows side, there's a hibernate of\nsome sort, or a sleep state of some sort.\n\n358\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.610\nA lot of times if you go\ninto the hibernate mode,\n\n359\n00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.780\nwhere it shuts down everything but\nwhat's actually in the RAM.\n\n360\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.450\nThe way that it does that,\nespecially on Windows computers,\n\n361\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.260\nat least the way I used to,\nI don't know about recently, but\n\n362\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.090\nit used to take whatever was in RAM and\nsent you right into the swap file,\n\n363\n00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.590\ninto the page file and that way when\nyou went to turn the computer on,\n\n364\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.690\ninstead of booting through\nthe boot process, you just go.\n\n365\n00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.200\nLet me check the page file and just pull\nall that stuff back up into memory' and\n\n366\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.820\nyou are up and going.\n\n367\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.510\nIn no time because I was able to\nretrieve that that quickly and\n\n368\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.880\njust pull it in RAM instead of having to\ngo through the entire boot process here.\n\n369\n00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.630\nSo you do want to make sure you even check\n\n370\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.510\ninformation like that out as well\nwhen you gather the information here.\n\n371\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.640\nAll of this stuff here\nthat we've talked about so\n\n372\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.600\nfar, this is stuff that\ndisappears very rapidly.\n\n373\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.390\nSo here's the order that if you do\nknow that this is gonna happen,\n\n374\n00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.830\nnow when might we really worry about.\n\n375\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.110\nIf you're in the middle of gathering the\nevidence and there's an electrical storm\n\n376\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:52.130\nand you don't have a UPS, you start going\nthrough this as quickly as you can.\n\n377\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.150\nOr if you're on a laptop,\nyou can't find the charger to it and\n\n378\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.830\nit's about to go away.\n\n379\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.360\nYou try and\n\n380\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.580\nget all of this information that you can\nout of that laptop while you can do it.\n\n381\n00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.250\nOkay.\n\n382\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.130\nMost of the people doing this\nprofessionally have bought every single\n\n383\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.460\npower adapter known to mankind and\ncarry it in a bag with them.\n\n384\n00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.600\nBut at the same time, if you have to\ndo it, you may find your self, \"Well,\n\n385\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.970\nit says 6% battery, I should be able-\"\nYou may but hopefully if you do that\n\n386\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.830\nright you dont want to spend time, let\nme go and start disk imaging right away.\n\n387\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You may instead go,\n\n388\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.380\nall right let me get what I\ncan out of these processes\n\n389\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.670\nthat are essentially relatively\nvolatile in comparison.\n\n390\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.680\nOnce we get to the hard drive though.\n\n391\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.220\nIf it's finished it's writing.\n\n392\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Volatility is very low because of that.\n\n393\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very low.\n&gt;&gt; It's in a good\n\n394\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.160\nstatic state at that point.\n\n395\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.850\n&gt;&gt; It's at a good static state and\nthe idea here is fairly simple, right.\n\n396\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.530\nThat can remain in a static state for\nyears, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:59.030\nSo even if we never get, in other words,\nif the investigation stalls at some point.\n\n398\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.040\nAnd it can happen that\nthe investigation ends up stalling out.\n\n399\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.230\nThat hard drive is probably\nstill going to boot up\n\n400\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.770\nat some point in time in the future.\n\n401\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.610\nYou're probably not going to\nhave to worry about it too much,\n\n402\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.660\nbarring the idea of physical damage or\n\n403\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.690\nsomebody intently damaging that drive the\ndata will probably still be there, okay?\n\n404\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.300\nAnd a few years ago one of our colleagues,\nright here at ITProTV,\n\n405\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.690\nhe was teaching a course\non computer forensics.\n\n406\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.270\nAnd they look like old hard-drives\nthat had been written over like fifty,\n\n407\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.040\nsixty times.\n\n408\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.200\nAnd they ran some of these free\nforensics tools that were out there\n\n409\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.770\non the Internet on it.\n\n410\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.890\nAnd they were still able to\nretrieve data off of those things.\n\n411\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.330\nAnd it was quite amazing about how much\ndata that they could actually pull off.\n\n412\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.860\nSo Mike Rodrick was actually\nthe one that did that.\n\n413\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.510\nSo when you start seeing this like, yes\ndata can actually still remain on there,\n\n414\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.410\neven though they had actually been,\nyou know,\n\n415\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.100\nran through and\nformatted a couple of different times.\n\n416\n00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.920\nI think you said like fifty times or\nso, they had formatted it.\n\n417\n00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.220\nSo, it was amazing how they could actually\neven uncover that type of information too.\n\n418\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.860\nNow, Daniel, this is where it\ngets more into the gray area,\n\n419\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.850\nespecially we're not familiar with\nthe realm of forensics,right?\n\n420\n00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.250\nThat seems to be co op as understandable.\n\n421\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.945\nHard drive is magnetic, right?\n\n422\n00:23:16.945 --> 00:23:19.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Losing it's magnetic properties is\n\n423\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.790\nprobably not going to happen for\na little while.\n\n424\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.500\nYeah.\nA bit at a time, right?\n\n425\n00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.810\nA magnet doesn't tend to lose\nit's data to often but it can.\n\n426\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.700\nOkay.\nOver time it can.\n\n427\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.930\nBut notice this idea of\nremotely logged data.\n\n428\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:37.890\nThat's when it becomes, now you're\nlike what the heck is this about?\n\n429\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.330\nThe idea of remotely logged data.\n\n430\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.436\nThe reason why we don't actually\nworry about this one cuz it resides\n\n431\n00:23:43.436 --> 00:23:44.741\non another machine.\n\n432\n00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:49.913\nSo I don't even have to worry about\nthe damage to the Drive itself for\n\n433\n00:23:49.913 --> 00:23:53.359\nthe laptop or the machine,\nI can then go hey,\n\n434\n00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:58.553\ndoes this machine over here have\na copy of the logs that I might need?\n\n435\n00:23:58.553 --> 00:24:01.011\nThat machine's still running,\neverything's good on it.\n\n436\n00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:02.073\nSure.\n\n437\n00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:05.523\nSo you kind of have that backup\nwhere you can do some of that,\n\n438\n00:24:05.523 --> 00:24:09.300\nespecially on those remotely\nlogged types of data here.\n\n439\n00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.600\nSo this is kind of that neat\norder of volatility in which\n\n440\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.260\nsomebody's actually thought through\nthis process very well, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:24.010\nAlso, then there is the physical and\nthe network typology at this point.\n\n442\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.970\nNow when you get to this point, right?\n\n443\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.932\nYou're just look for any other.\n\n444\n00:24:27.932 --> 00:24:31.080\nConfiguration changes that are there.\n\n445\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.780\nSo you might not actually get as much\nevidence out of it at this point, but\n\n446\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.020\nit's more generalized and at least\ngives you the context of what you have.\n\n447\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.590\nAnd then this presentation\nmode is kind of gotten me.\n\n448\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.130\nLet me switch out of that for a moment, so\n\n449\n00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.800\nI can now see the last one that\nI want to get to for right now.\n\n450\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.180\nWhich is just basic archival media.\n\n451\n00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Super long term storage.\n\n452\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.350\n&gt;&gt; Super long term storage, CDs, DVDs,\n&gt;&gt; Tapes.\n\n453\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Tapes.\n\n454\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And pretty big notebooks.\n\n455\n00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:04.275\nAnd I've seen Daniel's actually little\nhacking notebook before as well.\n\n456\n00:25:04.275 --> 00:25:05.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel's\n\n457\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.370\nlittle hacking notebook, right?\n\n458\n00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.370\nUnless he's over there\njust burning it with fire-\n\n459\n00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.362\n&gt;&gt; I eat them when I'm hungry.\n\n460\n00:25:11.362 --> 00:25:13.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or eats them when they're done.\n\n461\n00:25:13.632 --> 00:25:15.560\nIt's probably gonna be around for\na while, right?\n\n462\n00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If that were part of something that we\n\n463\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.190\nwere investigating,\n\n464\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.050\ncollecting evidence for, well that is\ntechnically archival media as well.\n\n465\n00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.190\nNot in the same way that we\nthink about media, but USB keys,\n\n466\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.040\nstuff like that is always good.\n\n467\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.550\nWe do have to be careful,\nespecially with optical discs, though.\n\n468\n00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.270\nSo, even though they\nare archival purposes,\n\n469\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.690\nit doesn't mean that they\nnecessarily will last forever.\n\n470\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.200\nNow just when I say that, right?\n\n471\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.800\nDaniel, do you have, I don't know, do you\nkeep regular media for your music CDs?\n\n472\n00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.470\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n473\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I have them, but\n\n474\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.030\nI don't use them anymore, yeah.\n\n475\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.120\n&gt;&gt; That's good, no,\nthat's exactly my point.\n\n476\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel,\n\n477\n00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.800\ndo you think you have a CD\nthat's older than ten years old?\n\n478\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.650\n&gt;&gt; I guarantee it.\n\n479\n00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, do think it still plays today?\n\n480\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.080\nYeah, you and me would say that but when\nit comes down to this stuff a lot of times\n\n481\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.797\nwhen we start looking at data DVDs and\n\n482\n00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:13.640\nstuff I say don't do it like after\na year or two or three years or so.\n\n483\n00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.240\nJust saying,\nyou better copy that over to another disc.\n\n484\n00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.820\n&gt;&gt; To something more long term,\nlike a tape or whatever.\n\n485\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's amazing because\nlike I said, you and I have CDs.\n\n486\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n487\n00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.110\n&gt;&gt; I have one from like\n1989 that's still in place.\n\n488\n00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Impressive.\n[LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.250\n&gt;&gt; So you go figure.\n\n490\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.115\nIt's a vital signs from survivor,\nit's still there.\n\n491\n00:26:30.115 --> 00:26:33.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it still plays and it still works.\n\n492\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.700\nI know, you're probably saying,\nare you joking?\n\n493\n00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.955\nHe still uses a CD?\n\n494\n00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:38.451\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\nI thought I was the only one.\n\n495\n00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:40.283\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I still have eight tracks, but\n\n496\n00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:41.820\nno eight track player that works.\n\n497\n00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.063\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; I still have my original VHS from 1985\n\n498\n00:26:45.063 --> 00:26:46.530\nof the Karate Kid.\n\n499\n00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.890\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And it still works.\n\n500\n00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n501\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.350\n&gt;&gt; Still works.\n&gt;&gt; So tapes, yeah,\n\n502\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.460\nmore long term in terms\nof that type of storage.\n\n503\n00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.580\nBut archival media in that stuff, on\nthose optical ones be careful with those,\n\n504\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.030\ndon't just think you're gonna\ntoss those on the shelf.\n\n505\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.340\nThey are gonna need if you're gonna\narchive stuff like that, they're gonna\n\n506\n00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:09.930\nneed replacement or copy, disk copy of\nthose over time because they can corrupt.\n\n507\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.780\nEven the Smithsonian they show like\nthe original CDs that come out, and\n\n508\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.130\nyou can actually look right through\nthem even though they're printed.\n\n509\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.250\nHere's an original one from like\nMozart symphony or something.\n\n510\n00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.995\nI don't remember and you're looking\nat it and they got gloves on.\n\n511\n00:27:22.995 --> 00:27:23.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n512\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like well,\nwhat are you preserving at this point.\n\n513\n00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.080\nIt is already kinda degraded in that way.\n\n514\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.300\nSo but technology of course has improved\nover time and they made the better even\n\n515\n00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.370\nthough over time, where we're not so\nworried about that anymore.\n\n516\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:42.780\nBut just when I say that, yes even this is\nprobably the longest time in storage here.\n\n517\n00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.490\nAll right.\nSo what about this for the exam?\n\n518\n00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.380\nThat, all right Daniel.\n\n519\n00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.980\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell them what's on the exam.\n\n520\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.580\nBut if I were to present to\nyou a list that was called,\n\n521\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.010\norder of volatility, okay?\n\n522\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:05.550\nLet's say that we kind\nof had something like.\n\n523\n00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:10.510\nI'm trying to make it harder, okay?\n\n524\n00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.360\nLet's say we had something like that,\nokay?\n\n525\n00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.801\nSo Daniel, because you have actually done\nmore of this than a lot of people have,\n\n526\n00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:22.761\nwould you kind of be able to spot this and\ngo,\n\n527\n00:28:22.761 --> 00:28:26.379\nsomething is wrong about\nthe order about [CROSSTALK]?\n\n528\n00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:32.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I might be able to go, hm, it\nseems like CPU cache and registry content.\n\n529\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.600\nMight be more volatile than\nthe other three options on this\n\n530\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.490\nlittle slide that you're giving me.\n\n531\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:44.760\nMaybe I'll reorder them in a certain\nway to really reflect true volatility.\n\n532\n00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.870\n&gt;&gt; I think that would really be helpful.\n\n533\n00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That you could take something called,\n\n534\n00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.855\norder of volatility\n&gt;&gt; And put it in the order.\n\n535\n00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:54.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and kinda go.\n\n536\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.630\nI think that there's something\nsignificant about the order.\n\n537\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.200\nDon't get me wrong,\nvolatility's important.\n\n538\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.490\nBut they list order of volatility for\na particular reason.\n\n539\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.910\nSo if they do something like that I would\nassume that I would have to kind of\n\n540\n00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.720\nunderstand the idea of the order.\n\n541\n00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.930\nThat would kinda make sense.\n\n542\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm following your logic here,\nand I think you're spot on.\n\n543\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:13.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n544\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.620\nSame thing with the idea\nof the chain of custody.\n\n545\n00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:21.440\nUnderstanding that events do occur,\nfor us at least in this particular\n\n546\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.820\ndimension that we have [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n547\n00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.760\n&gt;&gt; That they do occur from\n\n548\n00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.120\ncollection to the time they're\npresented in court at sometime.\n\n549\n00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.860\nAnd being able to understand that.\n\n550\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:38.510\nSo if we kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Little bit of this, little bit of that.\n\n551\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:43.170\n&gt;&gt; We might notice something,\nnot exactly correctly here,\n\n552\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.600\nthat we might want to focus\nin on just a little bit more.\n\n553\n00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.750\nSo it seems easy enough, right?\n\n554\n00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.590\nBut it's a lot of information.\n\n555\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.460\nSo I don't want you to just discount\n&gt;&gt; The whole thing that\n\n556\n00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.580\nwe've talking about here for this episode,\n\n557\n00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.200\nbut at the same time running about it is\nthe easiest way to keep the right order.\n\n558\n00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.930\nIt's just like what you said, right?\n\n559\n00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.430\nIf I put this list up and\n\n560\n00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.595\nyou didn't know what this was,\nIt wouldn't mean anything to you.\n\n561\n00:30:10.595 --> 00:30:11.825\nEven I put the order of volatility.\n\n562\n00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:12.525\nYou'd go, okay.\n\n563\n00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:15.775\nI didn't know it well it's not gonna\nhelp you if you don't learn it.\n\n564\n00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:17.895\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you at least learn it and\n\n565\n00:30:17.895 --> 00:30:21.095\nunderstand that, and\nthat's gonna help you out as well.\n\n566\n00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:26.525\nHaving clearer and understandable ideas\nof what forensics actually means,\n\n567\n00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:28.340\nand computer forensic mean.\n\n568\n00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.500\nAlso is another important part\nof being able to do this,\n\n569\n00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.840\nespecially when we're working with\nbasic forensics terminologies.\n\n570\n00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.970\nWhen you also start seeing this as well.\n\n571\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.900\nSo if you can keep in mind\ngood computer forensics.\n\n572\n00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.890\nIf you can understand that\nidea of the chain of custody,\n\n573\n00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.830\norder of volatility that's\nkinda that little primer.\n\n574\n00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:50.550\nNow there's a lot more to this\nthan what I'm going around.\n\n575\n00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.270\nBut that should at least get you started.\n\n576\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.370\nYou still need to take a look,\nof course, at the idea of evidence and\n\n577\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.700\nthe different types of\nevidence that we have.\n\n578\n00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.980\nAnd then some other things,\n\n579\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.530\nto really get us back on track to where\nwe need to be able to identify the idea\n\n580\n00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.320\nof more of this digital type of\nevidence that we're gonna see.\n\n581\n00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.850\nSo Daniel, once again, I have talked a\nlong time and that was just on terminology\n\n582\n00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.590\nand we haven't really gotten to some of\nthe other things that we need to get to,\n\n583\n00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.570\nso it looks like we're gonna have\nto do at least a part two here.\n\n584\n00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the time is allowed for\nthis episode, but\n\n585\n00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.720\nit's really good information.\n\n586\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.210\nDefinitely spend some time to\nassimilate that information\n\n587\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.340\ninto your knowledge base so\nthat you can maybe,\n\n588\n00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.910\nI don't know, answer a question\nbased off of said information.\n\n589\n00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.175\nIt could be helpful for you down the road.\n\n590\n00:31:35.175 --> 00:31:35.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thanks so much for\n\n591\n00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.540\njoining us today,\nlooking forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n592\n00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.850\nLooking forward to seeing you\ngood folks out there as well.\n\n593\n00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.210\nBut as we've said, for this episode\nwe've come to the end of the road.\n\n594\n00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.980\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n595\n00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n596\n00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n597\n00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:56.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n598\n00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:03.419\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.tv.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.500\n[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.220\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.650\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.520\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.710\nwell, we're back with more\nin our Cisco SECOPS series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.543\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain to lend his expertise to us,\n\n10\n00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:27.190\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.910\nRonnie welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.820\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.970\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540\nThank you once again for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n15\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.322\nAs we continue onto this part two, I would\nprobably be a little bit scared if I did\n\n16\n00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.589\npart one and\nwas unable to continue in part two.\n\n17\n00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because there is a lot of information\n\n18\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.390\nfor us to get to when it comes down to,\nof course, identifying forensic evidence.\n\n19\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.141\nAnd even though we did just a basic\nprimer in the very first episode of\n\n20\n00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:55.460\nthis little miniseries, now we're getting\ninto some of the information that we\n\n21\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.270\nreally need to focus in on, which is\nto talk about this idea of evidence and\n\n22\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.500\nunderstand that there are, well, different\nlevels or different grades of evidence\n\n23\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.320\nthat we may also encounter, and\nyou just have to know about them.\n\n24\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.100\nSo we of course are going to talk about\nthe idea of what we call best evidence.\n\n25\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.310\nWe're going to talk about\ncorroborating evidence, and\n\n26\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.800\nthen indirect evidence as well,\nand make sure that we have a good\n\n27\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.500\nunderstanding of what each of these things\nare, as we kind of take a look at them,\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.250\nand talk about what they are, and\nhow they differ a little bit, and,\n\n29\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.570\nof course, even, well, try and give\nan example of what we're talking about\n\n30\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.640\nwhen it comes down to everything\nthat we're going to be facing when,\n\n31\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.610\nif and when, as an analyst,\nwe might actually get called into a court\n\n32\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.550\nof law to have to offer testimony\nabout something, someway, somehow.\n\n33\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.074\nI hope I never have to do that, but\nif it is, we will be given of course good\n\n34\n00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:56.455\ninstructions by lawyers, exactly\nwhat to say and what not to say, but\n\n35\n00:01:56.455 --> 00:02:00.860\nat the same time just understanding\nwhat types of things are going on.\n\n36\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.222\n&gt;&gt; I can see it now Ronnie, they'll say,\nstate your name for the record and\n\n37\n00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.138\nRonnie will look over at those lawyers and\nhe'll be like.\n\n38\n00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:07.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No yeah.\n\n39\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.105\nDon't tell them, don't do that.\n\n40\n00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.830\nSo let's go ahead and get to it.\n\n42\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.323\nSo, here on my screen I have\nmade it into a game, Daniel.\n\n43\n00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:16.141\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n44\n00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:17.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But but it's close here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.719\n&gt;&gt; It is like Monty.\n\n46\n00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.580\n&gt;&gt; Kind of yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Where's the best evidence?\n\n48\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.358\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Behind door number one!\n\n49\n00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:25.880\n[LAUGH] You could trade-\n&gt;&gt; Two, two.\n\n50\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.920\nYou could trade this for\nthis door number two.\n\n52\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.320\nWhat do you want?\n\n53\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.210\nBut let's talk about this\nidea of best evidence.\n\n54\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.980\nIt sounds like, Daniel, that of all\nthe evidence, we want best evidence.\n\n55\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.613\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with that, yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:43.620\nI'll take the best evidence for\n3000 there, Bob.\n\n57\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you would think that that's\nexactly what we want and that's true.\n\n58\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.970\nThat's what it does come down to,\n\n59\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.760\nbut what does it mean when we talk\nabout the idea of best evidence?\n\n60\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.980\nSo when you start seeing\nsomething like this and\n\n61\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.560\nthis is again the specific terminology\nthat's called out for the example.\n\n62\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.950\nThis is where we want to kind of\nunderstand what we're looking at.\n\n63\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.172\nThe first thing that we're looking at\nwhen it comes down to best evidence,\n\n64\n00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:13.778\nof course, is really the original\nevidence that was collected.\n\n65\n00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:16.670\nYou can say it at\nthe scene of the crime but\n\n66\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.710\nwherever the event has\nactually occurred here.\n\n67\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.150\nSo that particular type\nof evidence itself that\n\n68\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.500\nwas a part of it was there,\nand now it's been collected.\n\n69\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.920\nWe have the proper chain of custody.\n\n70\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.330\nEverything is good.\n\n71\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.102\nThat is something that was there,\nit's pretty much as rock solid as it gets.\n\n72\n00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:43.540\nBut, what does that really mean,\nnow that I've collected the evidence?\n\n73\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.430\nWell when it comes down to\nthe presentation here and\n\n74\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.740\nwhy it’s considered the best evidence,\n\n75\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.040\nit is because it does something for\nitself which is unusual, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.310\nIt is essentially evidence that proves\nitself to be exactly what it claims to be.\n\n77\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.020\nSo, when somebody presents this\nas being the best evidence,\n\n78\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.165\nit doesn't need additional testimony to\nsay hey, you're what you say you are.\n\n79\n00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is that object,\n\n80\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.050\nit is exactly what it says it is.\n\n81\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.150\nAnd that's kind of neat that\nwe can do stuff like that.\n\n82\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.370\nIf we can present whatever it is that\nactually proves itself, well, that is,\n\n83\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.742\nof course, the idea of the best evidence.\n\n84\n00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.990\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those things that\nyou learn in Philosophy 101 is,\n\n85\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.650\nnot all circular logic is fallacious.\n\n86\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.214\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is unusual, but\n\n87\n00:04:35.214 --> 00:04:39.425\nlet's talk about some examples and\nhopefully this will help us out here.\n\n88\n00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.540\nSo, here's a few examples of\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.616\nLet's kind of work from the bottom up.\n\n90\n00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.880\n'Cuz this is kind of the easiest one,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.560\nIf Daniel says,\nI didn't make that deal, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.250\nBut I have a photograph of Daniel\nshaking hands with the guy [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.968\n&gt;&gt; This is how it's gonna go down.\n\n94\n00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:56.889\nNot me.\n\n95\n00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not me at all.\n\n96\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.630\nBut yet, I have a photograph of that.\n\n97\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.540\nIt seems to indicate that now if we\nkind of pile it on a little bit more,\n\n98\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.500\nit's not me.\n\n99\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.141\nAnd I go, all right, Daniel, so\nexplain this audio recording.\n\n100\n00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:14.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got the wrong guy there judge.\n\n101\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.150\nI'm sorry to tell you.\n\n102\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.346\nI don't mean to burst your bubble, not me.\n\n103\n00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:19.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like that would\n\n104\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.768\nactually be like a- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like a legitimate defense,\n\n105\n00:05:23.768 --> 00:05:24.962\njust deny it.\n\n106\n00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:26.147\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n107\n00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:27.260\nthen they go all right Daniel.\n\n108\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.186\nSo what at this angle that shows\nyour face, here's a video.\n\n109\n00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man,\n\n110\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.117\nthat guy is a handsome devil, but hate\nto tell you, that's still not this guy.\n\n111\n00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:41.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Got it.\n\n112\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.890\nIt seems like that as we pile on more-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.090\n&gt;&gt; It is proving itself, right?\n\n114\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, in this sense, something like that,\n\n115\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.990\nthat's really of the event itself,\nthat's what we have.\n\n116\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.240\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nvoicemail, you kinda get the idea.\n\n117\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.170\nBut a lease is probably one of the, and\n\n118\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.765\nthat's probably the more serious things,\nright?\n\n119\n00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If Daniel says no,\n\n120\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.290\nI have no part of that building.\n\n121\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.925\nHere's a lease.\n\n122\n00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:06.195\n[LAUGH] Has Daniel's name on it.\n\n123\n00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:07.331\nGo ahead Daniel.\n\n124\n00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:12.602\n&gt;&gt; Sorry there Mr. lawyer man, but\nyou've got the wrong guy again.\n\n125\n00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.355\nYou should really follow\nup on your evidence.\n\n126\n00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:17.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you would think that somebody\n\n127\n00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:19.667\nwould actually take that as\na legitimate defense at some point.\n\n128\n00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:20.225\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:24.160\n&gt;&gt; But here that's what\nthe best evidence does for us.\n\n130\n00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.360\nIt is evidence that proves itself\nto be exactly what it says it is.\n\n131\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.210\nSo when we have something like this,\nit makes sense, okay, that this is kind of\n\n132\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.540\nthe strongest evidence that we have,\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n133\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.890\nMore often though, okay, a lot of times\n\n134\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.230\nbest evidence is not\nthe most difficult to find.\n\n135\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.000\nBut it may not actually be as\nstrong as we think it is, right?\n\n136\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.020\nSo let's take for\nan example the video recording, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.160\nIt really looks grainy.\n\n138\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.420\nDaniel could make it,\nthat doesn't really say.\n\n139\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.190\nThe same thing with the photo, it's not\nsuper high, you can't say that it's me.\n\n140\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.190\nDaniel could bring in five or\nsix people and\n\n141\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.950\ngo, there are tons of\npeople that sound like me.\n\n142\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.275\n&gt;&gt; I will give you\na prime example of this.\n\n143\n00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That we still have yet\n\n144\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.354\nto confirm the existence of UFOs and\nBigfoots, right?\n\n145\n00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:14.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because every time we saw a video or\n\n146\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.180\na picture,\nI don't know what people are doing.\n\n147\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.675\nMaybe they have a grain filter.\n\n148\n00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.670\n[LAUGH] It immediately goes over\nwhen these things are in view.\n\n149\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.170\nBut it's super super grainy, so therefore\nthe evidence is called into question.\n\n150\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\noop something has happened here.\n\n151\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.750\nApparently my machine has gone.\n\n152\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.623\n&gt;&gt; What perfect timing.\n\n153\n00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:35.237\n&gt;&gt; Well I know, exactly, that's weird.\n\n154\n00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But apparently\n\n155\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.810\nI'm going to install Mac OS in the\nbackground here for one reason or another.\n\n156\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.624\nBut overall though,\nsometimes you need more, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:43.624 --> 00:07:44.423\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n158\n00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:47.970\nthat's the idea of\ncorroborating evidence as well.\n\n159\n00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.015\nSo even though you have best evidence and\ngo, I've got this, everything seems\n\n160\n00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:57.780\nto line up, you also still might need\nthe idea of corroborating evidence.\n\n161\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.130\nThat really pulls in\na little bit more here.\n\n162\n00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.822\nNow, this is unusual in the very fact\nthat it really doesn't show as far as\n\n163\n00:08:05.822 --> 00:08:08.472\nthe crime goes or anything like that, but\n\n164\n00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:12.110\nit's evidence that supports\na particular theory.\n\n165\n00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.820\nIt is at least one or two steps removed.\n\n166\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.758\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's saying,\n\n167\n00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:19.660\nhere's what the evidence shows and\nhere's the theory behind it.\n\n168\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.110\nAnd all the evidence points\nto that particular direction,\n\n169\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.210\nthat it is Daniel, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.600\nSo I can't say that it's Daniel.\n\n171\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.020\nBut here's a video.\n\n172\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.240\nBut here's some other things that\nare corroborating that it could be Daniel.\n\n173\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.655\nDaniel, we notice that\nyou car was right here.\n\n174\n00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:40.080\n[LAUGH] And you continue to see that.\n\n175\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.202\nSo it is essentially evidence that\nconfirms a proposition of it.\n\n176\n00:08:44.202 --> 00:08:45.986\n&gt;&gt; So this would be something like,\n\n177\n00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:50.650\nwe've got a picture of Ronnie's car in the\nparking lot where the crime was committed.\n\n178\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.170\nSo we know that at least\nyour car was there.\n\n179\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.630\nAnd we have corroborating evidence\nto verify that that picture is\n\n180\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.580\nof the parking lot.\n\n181\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.630\nBecause your GPS was turned on and\n\n182\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.490\nwe geolocated the fact that yes,\nit was right there.\n\n183\n00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.350\nWe have two pieces of evidence\nthat are corroborating each other,\n\n184\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.810\nsaying yes, Ronnie's car was there.\n\n185\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.490\nAnd therefore,\nRonnie was most likely there as well.\n\n186\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.024\n&gt;&gt; In the example I came up with before to\nshow as simple as that, Daniel goes, yeah,\n\n187\n00:09:14.024 --> 00:09:14.909\nI saw his car there.\n\n188\n00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:16.254\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:18.103\n&gt;&gt; And that is, it's corroborating.\n\n190\n00:09:18.103 --> 00:09:19.668\nI can say, no I wasn't there.\n\n191\n00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:22.969\nAnd Daniel comes on goes,\nno he were there.\n\n192\n00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:27.010\n&gt;&gt; And what it goes back to best evidence,\nthat is corroborating evidence.\n\n193\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.280\nBut you also still kinda have best\nevidence as corroborating evidence.\n\n194\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.450\nWell, the GPS location would be better\nevidence than my eyewitness testimony,\n\n195\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.340\nto be honest with you.\n\n196\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.266\nBecause as we've seen in the past,\neyewitness testimony can be wrong.\n\n197\n00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:44.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where we get back into\nthe crime dramas that we're gonna talk\n\n198\n00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.090\nabout, right?\n\n199\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.170\nMeans, motive, and opportunity and\nestablishing motive is a big part of this.\n\n200\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.720\nCorroborating evidence\ngives us that theory of why\n\n201\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.000\nsomething like this might've\nactually gone down.\n\n202\n00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.490\nOr yes, he was there.\n\n203\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.930\nSo if he was there, more than likely\nhe is the one in that photograph and\n\n204\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.530\nyou kind of get that idea.\n\n205\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.682\n&gt;&gt; I told you, you've got the wrong guy.\n\n206\n00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:09.729\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not me.\n\n207\n00:10:09.729 --> 00:10:12.186\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the last of that joke.\n\n208\n00:10:12.186 --> 00:10:14.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n209\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.470\nit's probably gonna continue to happen.\n\n210\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.360\nSo here we go, now this is probably\nthe one that we see more often,\n\n211\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.530\nespecially when it comes down\nto those crime dramas here.\n\n212\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.320\nWhich is the idea of what\nwe call indirect evidence.\n\n213\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.680\nNow, this is a term that\nyou haven't heard as much.\n\n214\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.295\nBut you're probably more familiar\nwith it from those crime dramas,\n\n215\n00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:35.980\nbecause we don't ever refer\nto it as indirect evidence.\n\n216\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.970\nWe normally refer to it as evidence.\n\n217\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.610\nYeah, just circumstantial evidence,\ninstead.\n\n218\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.160\nSo we've heard that.\n\n219\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.700\nI know that just watching\nthe repeats of Law and Order.\n\n220\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.455\n&gt;&gt; Not strong enough to get you a warrant.\n\n221\n00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:52.649\n&gt;&gt; No, but\nat least it's circumstantial and so\n\n222\n00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:55.280\neverything that takes\nthat into account here.\n\n223\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.070\nNow it's unusual, things that I thought\nthat weren't circumstantial evidence,\n\n224\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.900\nmight actually be\ncircumstantial evidence here.\n\n225\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.990\nSo what in the world are we talking about\nwhen it comes to circumstantial evidence\n\n226\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.000\nin this particular meaning?\n\n227\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.820\nWhen it comes down to what circumstantial\nevidence or indirect evidence actually is\n\n228\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.920\nis that you can take whatever evidence\nis presented circumstantially.\n\n229\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.593\nOkay, so it doesn't prove\nthat a crime has been there.\n\n230\n00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:24.430\nBut you can conclude from\nthe evidence that was presented.\n\n231\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.090\nSo what they're trying to say\nis here's enough evidence.\n\n232\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:33.280\nYou should be able to deduce what\nhappened from this evidence.\n\n233\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.157\n&gt;&gt; So this goes back to the whole, so\n\n234\n00:11:35.157 --> 00:11:38.927\nRonnie's car is in the parking lot\nwhere the crime was committed.\n\n235\n00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:41.050\nThat doesn't necessarily mean\nthat Ronnie committed the crime.\n\n236\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.630\nIt just means he was in the area\nduring the time of the crime, so\n\n237\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.795\nthat's circumstantial.\n\n238\n00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:47.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Great,\n\n239\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.310\na lot of people were in the area\nat the time of the crime.\n\n240\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.380\nIt doesn't mean they did it either,\n\n241\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.720\nyou have to prove that there's some\nsort of correlation, some connection.\n\n242\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.127\n&gt;&gt; And this is where it's\na little bit more unusual, so\n\n243\n00:11:57.127 --> 00:12:00.479\nthis is what kinda surprise me as I\nstarted reading more and more on this.\n\n244\n00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:03.072\nThey had fingerprints, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:08.172\nDNA on a laptop, it's circumstantial,\nbecause there could be\n\n246\n00:12:08.172 --> 00:12:14.129\nmany reasons why my particular\nfingerprints were on somebody's laptop.\n\n247\n00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:16.240\nDaniel handed me his laptop.\n\n248\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.810\nI explain it that way.\n\n249\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.943\nThat's easy enough.\n\n250\n00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:23.170\nWhy was my DNA at the scene?\n\n251\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.423\nCuz, well, it's a public place,\nwhatever it is.\n\n252\n00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:28.498\n&gt;&gt; We ride the same bus and\nRonnie sneezed on my laptop.\n\n253\n00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.850\nThere it is, there's Ronnie's DNA.\n\n254\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean those\nare some of the unusual things.\n\n255\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.790\nCuz for me and what we hear on, it's DNA.\n\n256\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.805\nIt always proves everything.\n\n257\n00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:38.599\nWell, it's actually still circumstantial.\n\n258\n00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:39.295\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n259\n00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:41.720\nyou're supposed to draw\nfrom the conclusion right?\n\n260\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.890\nThat because my particular DNA or\nmy fingerprints was on your laptop,\n\n261\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.790\nthat you're drawing from that that\nI possibly committed that crime.\n\n262\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.456\n&gt;&gt; It's usually the lack of DNA\nto be honest with you that is\n\n263\n00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:55.024\nthe smoking gun per se.\n\n264\n00:12:55.024 --> 00:13:00.220\nTo say, we found no evidence of\nRonnie's DNA at the crime scene.\n\n265\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:07.420\nTherefore, that lends to Ronnie having\nnot been at the actual scene, so.\n\n266\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something that we really\nwant to make sure that we understand here.\n\n267\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.780\nNow, as we kind of circle\nthis thing back around,\n\n268\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.210\nthere's a couple other things\nthat I wanna point out.\n\n269\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.770\nEspecially about this\nidea of best evidence,\n\n270\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.840\nand how this stuff is actually\ndescribed here, okay?\n\n271\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.420\nThe idea of best evidence\nreally comes from one location.\n\n272\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.040\nAnd let me show you, believe it or not.\n\n273\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.463\nThere is actually federal\nrules of evidence.\n\n274\n00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:33.077\n&gt;&gt; You made this up, didn't you?\n\n275\n00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:34.974\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wish I could say I did.\n\n276\n00:13:34.974 --> 00:13:38.126\n[LAUGH] But there's actually\nfederal rules of government and\n\n277\n00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:39.740\nI've included the link here.\n\n278\n00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.615\nAnd I'll go ahead and show it to you right\nhere on the screen for just a moment and\n\n279\n00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:44.805\nyou can download this.\n\n280\n00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:50.020\nI don't know if you have a need to, but\nyou can download it if you choose to.\n\n281\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.031\nAnd like I said, the link will\nactually be in the show notes so\n\n282\n00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:54.665\nthat you can do that from there.\n\n283\n00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:55.690\nBut what we're looking for,\n\n284\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.650\nthough, is actually section, now,\nthere's a few pages here, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's section 1001, that's what we're\n\n286\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.688\nactually looking for, so-\n&gt;&gt; And obviously, this is pertaining to\n\n287\n00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:07.835\nUS courts, if you're in the Philippines-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n288\n00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:10.051\n&gt;&gt; Or somewhere else,\nEngland or something like that.\n\n289\n00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:10.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:11.520\n&gt;&gt; This is not gonna work.\n\n291\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.861\n&gt;&gt; So, this one is actually\nin Article X and Rule 1001.\n\n292\n00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:20.624\nI keep saying, section 1001 but\nit's the definitions that apply to this\n\n293\n00:14:20.624 --> 00:14:26.040\nparticular article, which is really about,\nwell, primary or best evidence.\n\n294\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.281\nContents of writings, recordings, and\nphotographs is kinda the key here,\n\n295\n00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.276\nand that's what they consider,\nof course, the idea of best evidence.\n\n296\n00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:35.104\nNow when it comes to that.\n\n297\n00:14:35.104 --> 00:14:37.700\nIf I can actually get there quickly,\n\n298\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.906\nlet me see if I can do that\nwithout causing somebody nausea.\n\n299\n00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:47.941\nRule 1001, come on, one more.\n\n300\n00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:52.490\nThere we go, Rule 1001.\n\n301\n00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.430\nIt doesn't always have to\nbe exactly what happened\n\n302\n00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.680\nat the crime which is a little\nbit more unusual here.\n\n303\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.082\nBecause notice that even though they talk\nabout writings, recording of photographs,\n\n304\n00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:10.608\nin section (d) here, okay, they talk\nabout the original of a writing or\n\n305\n00:15:10.608 --> 00:15:13.535\nrecording, and\nany counterpart intended by.\n\n306\n00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:17.546\nIt also says that the idea\nof the original, okay?\n\n307\n00:15:17.546 --> 00:15:20.970\nAnd this is what we're getting to,\nespecially for computers.\n\n308\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.200\nHere's the section that I wanted to get to\nif I can just highlight what I mean here,\n\n309\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.630\nso that we can see it a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n310\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.255\nFor electronically stored information and\nthat is because we've got to\n\n311\n00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:36.666\nrealize something about the idea\nof digital evidence right, okay?\n\n312\n00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:41.301\nElectronically stored information,\noriginal then,\n\n313\n00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:45.837\nmeans any printout or\nother output readable by sight,\n\n314\n00:15:45.837 --> 00:15:49.950\nif accurately reflects the information.\n\n315\n00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.586\nAn original of a photograph includes\na negative or a print form of it.\n\n316\n00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:58.079\nBut for us though, a lot of times\nwhen we think about it, right,\n\n317\n00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:01.140\nwe're saying you can't produce\nit cuz it was digital.\n\n318\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.810\nHow are you going to reproduce that\nif that's all that it is, okay?\n\n319\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.354\nWell here they're saying when it comes\nto the evidence and the procedures that\n\n320\n00:16:08.354 --> 00:16:10.675\nare especially about computers-\n&gt;&gt; Just take a picture of it.\n\n321\n00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:12.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just take a picture of it.\n\n322\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.400\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat they have for\n\n323\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.630\nlaw enforcement officers right now.\n\n324\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.570\nThe training of it is part of\ntheir forensic procedures, right?\n\n325\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.570\nIs if the computer is on,\nrule number one, don't turn it off, okay?\n\n326\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.940\nBut rule number two immediately\nfollowing that, take a screen shot, or\n\n327\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.640\ntake a picture, of what is\nactually on that computer, okay?\n\n328\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.330\nSo that they can see what was\non the screen at the time when\n\n329\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.580\nthe evidence was actually collected.\n\n330\n00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.940\nAnd that is what they want, they want\na good, clear picture, and today I'm\n\n331\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.380\nguessing the higher definition the picture\nthe better that it's going to be.\n\n332\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.090\nBut that's the key so,\nit's really important.\n\n333\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.870\nBecause there are gonna be issues with\ndigital evidence if we are not very\n\n334\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.218\ncareful with it.\n\n335\n00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:00.590\nFor example, and I was trying to remember\nsome of the questions that I had\n\n336\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.770\nactually written down.\n\n337\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.424\nEven though digital evidence may be\nthe best evidence, like what we've talked\n\n338\n00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:09.290\nabout, we do have to remember that\nevidence could only reside in RAM,\n\n339\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.110\nwhich means If somebody accidentally\nunplugs a computer, it's gone.\n\n340\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.135\nYour best evidence has just disappeared.\n\n341\n00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:16.740\nOkay?\nOr\n\n342\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.350\nit could become corrupted even over\ntime or for one reason or another,\n\n343\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.220\nthe image kind of glitched at\nthe time that you actually had it and\n\n344\n00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.037\nnow you're gonna say, this is what was\non the, I can't tell what that is.\n\n345\n00:17:28.037 --> 00:17:31.710\nElectronic data can be damaged\neven during the investigation or\n\n346\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.200\nthe analysis process\nif we are not careful.\n\n347\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.210\nAnd I present that and go, but\nwhen I did it, it was damaged,\n\n348\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.980\nwhich means it was modified.\n\n349\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.740\nSo it's kinda one of those things\nwhere you do want to remember\n\n350\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.550\nthat this is where that order of\nvolatility draws in, that pulls in here.\n\n351\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.150\nAnd you also want to make sure that you\nunderstand this idea of the original.\n\n352\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.380\nIt's not always that it has to be that\nparticular computer at that time,\n\n353\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.780\nbecause you're never gonna reproduce that.\n\n354\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.990\nYou can't keep a laptop plugged in for\nyears and expect it to not go down.\n\n355\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.850\nThere's gonna be some point in time\nwhere something's gonna happen, and\n\n356\n00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.370\nyou're gonna have to power it down,\nor even a regular, physical machine.\n\n357\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.190\nSo having that evidence, making sure that,\nfor electronically stored information,\n\n358\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.060\noriginal means of any printout or\nessentially a photograph of it,\n\n359\n00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.920\nis what you want to be able to take\nas well, and that is kind of key.\n\n360\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.760\nThe readable by sight is\nkind of the standpoint, or\n\n361\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.890\nthe clear point, that we want to make.\n\n362\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.130\nSo much so that,\neven in my notes I went ahead and\n\n363\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.590\nput it in bold,\nthat it needs to be readable by sight.\n\n364\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.780\nSo don't take the lowest\nimage photo that you can.\n\n365\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.420\nMake sure you take it to where it's\nsomething that actually says, all right,\n\n366\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.330\nhere's what it looks like, I took it from\ntwo feet away, and here's the highest\n\n367\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.400\noutput that I had here at the resolution,\nhere's what you can see, all of that is\n\n368\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.910\npretty much key when it comes down to the\nidea of the best evidence that we have.\n\n369\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:04.140\nAnd it's important to write because\nof the very fact that more and\n\n370\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.120\nmore with the crimes that are going on\ntoday, and as many crimes are going on,\n\n371\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.820\ncyber security and\nthe cyber crimes that are happening,\n\n372\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.720\nthere's gonna be possibly more\ntimes where you will be called to\n\n373\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.680\njust verify that you did the things\nthat you said that you did.\n\n374\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.950\nAnd you do have to understand where\nthis is going to fit into the play\n\n375\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.400\nof just about all that information.\n\n376\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.200\nAll right?\n\n377\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:33.180\nAll right, so, that pretty much does\nit for that term of the evidence there.\n\n378\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.140\nWe do need to talk about one other\nthing and I thought I had a diagram for\n\n379\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.440\nit but I did not actually end\nup with a diagram for it here.\n\n380\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.350\nSo we need to kind of at least talk about\nthe idea here of, let me make sure.\n\n381\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.560\nWell we'll go into\nthe attribution here and\n\n382\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.060\nthen we'll come to the last one which\nis the types of images instead.\n\n383\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.930\nSo I'm gonna go a little bit over,\nI'm letting Daniel know right now and\n\n384\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.920\nthat way we can we can kind\nof have this off, okay?\n\n385\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.470\nSo there is one other term\nspecifically called out, and\n\n386\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.310\nthen we'll get back to the idea of disk\nimaging here, which is to make sure that\n\n387\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.890\nwe can describe the role of\nattribution in an investigation.\n\n388\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:18.170\nNow, the reason why this is\nimportant is because everybody has\n\n389\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:24.380\nsome particular agenda, and\nyou do have to understand that this can\n\n390\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.880\nkind of harm you, and it can help you if\nyou actually understand what's going on.\n\n391\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.930\nSo when it comes down to\nthe idea of attribution,\n\n392\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.300\nwe've got to understand\nwhat that actually means.\n\n393\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.900\nSo Daniel if I attribute to\nyou that you did the crime,\n\n394\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.120\nwhat am I really saying to somebody?\n\n395\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.910\nI am doing what?\n\n396\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.580\nI am blaming you for it.\n\n397\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're putting the guilt on me or\nwhoever.\n\n398\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but whoever it is, right, the idea\nof the role of attribution is saying,\n\n399\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.870\nhere's what we're gonna do,\nI'm gonna blame Daniel, okay?\n\n400\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.230\nAnd whether you're on the prosecution\nside, whatever it is, we are attributing\n\n401\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:04.080\nthat crime, that event, whatever it is to\nDaniel at this particular point, okay?\n\n402\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.190\nWell, there's a couple of things about\nevidence that we have to worry about\n\n403\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.540\nIf I do that, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.230\nAnd one, if I'm stating that,\nI'm stating it as a certainty, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.340\nIf I'm the one prosecuting,\nI'm saying, look, Daniel did it, okay?\n\n406\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.218\nAnd you're looking at it and you're\nhearing my words essentially saying,\n\n407\n00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:27.760\nhe must have what evidence that\nproves that Daniel did it.\n\n408\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.860\nSounds logical, right?\n\n409\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.630\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n410\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.370\n&gt;&gt; if I say it with confidence, 12 people\nsitting there might go, that Ronnie,\n\n411\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.700\nhe looks pretty smart.\n\n412\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.110\nNow I don't think that will\never happen in my lifetime,\n\n413\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.920\nbut let's just say he makes a sound,\nconvincing argument and\n\n414\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:48.100\nhe is stating confidently that Daniel\nis the one that did this, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.240\nAnd in their mind, because we're in\nthe court, they're assuming what?\n\n416\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.340\nEvidence must exist that corroborates or\nsupports that statement.\n\n417\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.870\nThere can be another side to this,\nDaniel, right?\n\n418\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:01.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n419\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.938\n&gt;&gt; What if you and I have just always\nbeen a little bit at odds here?\n\n420\n00:22:05.938 --> 00:22:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n421\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:11.710\n&gt;&gt; And now I've got Daniel\nkind of under my thumb here.\n\n422\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.990\nAnd I go,\nDaniel is the one who committed the crime.\n\n423\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.400\n&gt;&gt; I told you it was a frame job,\nit's a Ronnie.\n\n424\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.536\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea.\n\n425\n00:22:19.536 --> 00:22:20.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n426\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.780\nIt is very possible that what\nmight actually have happened is\n\n427\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:32.250\nthe evidence that is there is there, and\nI'm saying it all points to Daniel, okay?\n\n428\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.380\nNow I can't do that.\n\n429\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.840\nI can't sit there and go,\n\n430\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.720\nDaniel is the suspect,\nI'm gonna make all my evidence say, what?\n\n431\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.480\n&gt;&gt; That I'm guilty.\n\n432\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.110\n&gt;&gt; That you're guilty.\n\n433\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.169\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you've decided\nI'm the guilty party and\n\n434\n00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:47.553\ntherefore, you frame it in such\na way as to support that theory.\n\n435\n00:22:47.553 --> 00:22:50.439\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but can it happen?\n\n436\n00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n437\n00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Somebody looking for an answer, that\nthey're saying, we got to blame someone.\n\n438\n00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.450\nAnd I don't want to say that for everyone,\nbut somebody just says, all right,\n\n439\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.330\nheres our suspect.\n\n440\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.840\nDid he do this?\n\n441\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.670\nI can tell you somebody did it, but\nI can't tell you it was Daniel.\n\n442\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.600\nOr can I?\n\n443\n00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.840\nCan I tell you it was Daniel and\nthen make all the evidence look like.\n\n444\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's like\nan organization that actually helps\n\n445\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.370\nfree people that have\nbeen wrongfully accused.\n\n446\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wrongfully accused.\n\n447\n00:23:21.374 --> 00:23:24.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, for those because you know what?\n\n448\n00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.100\nPeople will do things like that.\n\n449\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.390\nA prosecutor gets in his mind\nthat this is the guy that did it.\n\n450\n00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.600\nA cop gets in his mind, this is\nthe guy that did it, I'm sure of it.\n\n451\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.008\nAnd they push that evidence into that, and\nlike I said they frame it in such way.\n\n452\n00:23:38.008 --> 00:23:42.839\nI'm not necessarily saying that they're\ndoing this maliciously, sometimes it's\n\n453\n00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:47.667\njust our own personalities, that we think,\nman I am convinced that this is the guilty\n\n454\n00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:52.845\nparty and I've in my mind worked out how\nall the evidence can support that theory.\n\n455\n00:23:52.845 --> 00:23:55.931\nThere are times when it does happen,\nwe do have things of that nature.\n\n456\n00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:59.741\nIt's not as common as the television\nmight want you to think, I'm sure,\n\n457\n00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:02.160\notherwise it'd be a land of chaos.\n\n458\n00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.630\nBut it does occur, and\nwe have to worry about that.\n\n459\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.280\n&gt;&gt; You do, so\nlet's take a look at on my screen here.\n\n460\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.560\nAnd I tried to logically draw it out in\na couple of different approaches, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.110\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to\nthe role of attribution,\n\n462\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:19.090\nthere's two different approaches that\nwe should think about here, okay?\n\n463\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.780\nThe first one is probably the correct one,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.360\nWhere does the evidence actually lead,\nokay?\n\n465\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.210\nAnd that's the key here, right?\n\n466\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.330\nSo I start off with the evidence,\n\n467\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.210\nwhich might point me to what\nwas actually used, okay?\n\n468\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.710\nAnd then who is the threat actor?\n\n469\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.620\nNow I went ahead and put a second threat\nactor here, because I might be able\n\n470\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.580\nto confidently say, I know what was used\nin the crime as an asset to do this.\n\n471\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.010\nI might even know that somebody\nhad to be involved in it, or\n\n472\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.920\neven a couple of people involved in it.\n\n473\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:57.740\nBut for me to directly point at Daniel,\nI can't necessarily say that unless I have\n\n474\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:03.030\nabsolutely solid evidence that it\npoints to Daniel for me to say that.\n\n475\n00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.500\nI can say it's possible.\n\n476\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.410\nDaniel was in the area, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.105\nHis car was seen around around there,\n\n478\n00:25:08.105 --> 00:25:11.315\nbut just like Daniel mentioned\nearlier in the episode,\n\n479\n00:25:11.315 --> 00:25:15.255\nit could be many people that was actually\nthere earlier in the other episode.\n\n480\n00:25:15.255 --> 00:25:16.500\nI can't remember which episode I'm in.\n\n481\n00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it might actually be that.\n\n482\n00:25:18.495 --> 00:25:22.265\nSo just kind of remember\nthat we might have that.\n\n483\n00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:25.337\nSo whereever the evidence leads you,\nit might ultimately lead to Daniel.\n\n484\n00:25:25.337 --> 00:25:28.815\nIt's possible, but\nthe very fact is we don't decide that.\n\n485\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.490\nWe don't sit there and go,\nall right, here's what I know, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.912\nWe take the evidence and\nwe decide it in this way.\n\n487\n00:25:35.912 --> 00:25:39.370\nIt is, in philosophy we'll call\nit deductive approach, right?\n\n488\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.770\nWe actually take the whole and\n\n489\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.290\nwe essentially break it out, and\nthen we see where that leads.\n\n490\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.280\nBut there is a possibility where\nthere is what we call a suspect\n\n491\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.640\nled approach instead.\n\n492\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.490\nIn the suspect led approach I say,\nhere is Daniel.\n\n493\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.810\nHere is the evidence that I'm\ngonna make to point to Daniel.\n\n494\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.398\nOkay so I start off by seeing Daniel\nas being the threat hacker and\n\n495\n00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:08.130\nI go, every single piece of evidence,\nDaniel could've done it.\n\n496\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.590\nAnd I don't actually let people\nknow that I'm saying that.\n\n497\n00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.520\nI just go, I know it was him\nbecause that's who I want it to be.\n\n498\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.590\nAnd that's where we can run\ninto issues as well, okay?\n\n499\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:25.190\nSo if you're going to help out,\nespecially in forensic investigation,\n\n500\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:31.090\nyou need to be very cautious about which\nway that things happen to be leaning.\n\n501\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.850\nThe only way to really guard against\nthis is one, there's a couple ways, but\n\n502\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:40.070\none is to make sure and go, all right, let\nme just follow where the evidence goes.\n\n503\n00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.825\nDon't let me start off and go,\nI'm gonna prove it's Daniel.\n\n504\n00:26:44.825 --> 00:26:46.641\nI'm gonna absolutely prove\nit's Daniel that did this.\n\n505\n00:26:46.641 --> 00:26:47.925\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it's funny,\n\n506\n00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:49.885\nwe keep talking about crime dramas.\n\n507\n00:26:49.885 --> 00:26:53.785\nAnd they're so compelling, we enjoy them\nvery much, it's why they're so prevalent.\n\n508\n00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:56.305\nIs you have the two different\ntypes of crime dramas, really.\n\n509\n00:26:56.305 --> 00:27:00.905\nYou have the one that is suspect led,\nprobably the most prevalent that we see.\n\n510\n00:27:00.905 --> 00:27:04.400\nThe gritty cop has that gut feeling,\nthis is our guy.\n\n511\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.290\nAnd they try to track down all\nthe little loose ends that lead to\n\n512\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.790\nthat suspect being the bad guy, right?\n\n513\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.740\nWe love that, that's really cool.\n\n514\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:18.300\nBut we also have the Sherlock Holmes type,\nwhich is the evidence-led approach.\n\n515\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.560\nHe doesn't go anywhere\nthe evidence doesn't lead him.\n\n516\n00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.280\nIf the evidence says this is the path,\nthis is the way he goes.\n\n517\n00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.190\nSo we do see those different types.\n\n518\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.350\nAnd I don't know about you, Ronnie, but\n\n519\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.000\nI get more enjoyment out of\nthat Sherlock Holmes type.\n\n520\n00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like the idea that\nit's not who I think it is.\n\n521\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.450\nYeah, and then I have to actually\nfigure out who actually did it.\n\n522\n00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.810\nBut overall, though, that's kinda some of\nthe things you definitely need to take in\n\n523\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.170\nmind, because we do end\nup working with people.\n\n524\n00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.570\nAnd they have their own agendas,\nas well, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.900\nNow, actually there's two topics here.\n\n526\n00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.950\nBut I think we actually probably can\nfinish both of these topics here\n\n527\n00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.260\nvery quickly, and\nthat will be our show here too, okay?\n\n528\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.420\nBut let's go back to the idea\nof talking about images here,\n\n529\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.300\njust briefly as well, okay?\n\n530\n00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.730\nWhen we talked about\nthe idea of disk imaging,\n\n531\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.720\nwe have to remember the golden\nrule of all evidence, okay?\n\n532\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.550\nAnd this golden rule of all\nevidence is to not modify or\n\n533\n00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.370\ndestroy the original evidence that exists,\nokay?\n\n534\n00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.130\nSo when you have that whatever\nthe original media is,\n\n535\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.500\nmake sure you don't modify\nit if at all possible.\n\n536\n00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.970\nYou don't destroy it, you don't do\nanything that changes that original data.\n\n537\n00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:29.080\nSo, Daniel, if I'm not to do that,\nhow do I investigate a computer crime if\n\n538\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.490\nI'm actually talking about it's\ngot on the hard drive, but\n\n539\n00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.710\nI know I might have to kind of disassemble\nthe hard drive to make it work?\n\n540\n00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.550\n&gt;&gt; It would be a good idea to make a copy\nof the hard drive that you can work on, so\n\n541\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.242\nthat you don't destroy the original.\n\n542\n00:28:41.242 --> 00:28:45.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Daniel, if we take that\nprocess that you're talking about here and\n\n543\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.150\nI say that, Daniel, it's a copy.\n\n544\n00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.030\nHow do I know that it really is a copy,\nand\n\n545\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.930\nit's not one that you just put together\nand put all different stuff on it?\n\n546\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.440\n&gt;&gt; You know, that is a great question.\n\n547\n00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.290\nAnd it's one that,\nwhen this was an original thing\n\n548\n00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.710\nthat they had to worry about,\nthey had to go, hm, how do we do this?\n\n549\n00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.850\nSo they used hashing algorithms, which\nare wonderful little things, easy to use.\n\n550\n00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.030\nIf you've never used a hash before,\ngo out and play with MD5.\n\n551\n00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.020\nIt's simple, it's easy, and a lot of\ncomputers have something installed on it.\n\n552\n00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.850\nOr you can download a third-party app.\n\n553\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.620\nVery simple,\nit just runs an algorithm to see,\n\n554\n00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.380\nto generate a-\n&gt;&gt; Thumbprint.\n\n555\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a thumbprint,\nthank you, very good.\n\n556\n00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.940\nAnd then if I run the algorithm on\nthe copy and I get the same thumbprint,\n\n557\n00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.760\nI know that I have a good copy.\n\n558\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what it\nreally comes down to, right?\n\n559\n00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.980\nAnd so when we take a look\nat the idea of imaging,\n\n560\n00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.120\nwe don't want to destroy\nanything of the original.\n\n561\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.540\nBut there is a possibility that\nthe analysis could destroy the original.\n\n562\n00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.235\nBut a copy though,\n\n563\n00:29:42.235 --> 00:29:46.170\nthere's a way that we can generate these\ncopies using disk imaging utilities.\n\n564\n00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.510\nAnd there's tons of them out there, right?\n\n565\n00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.850\nThere really is, in Linux there's DD.\n\n566\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.011\n&gt;&gt; The data destroyer.\n\n567\n00:29:53.011 --> 00:29:54.917\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the data destroyer.\n\n568\n00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:56.317\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if you do it wrong,\nthat data is gone.\n\n569\n00:29:56.317 --> 00:29:58.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty much hefty.\n\n570\n00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.142\nAnd Norton Ghost, there's so\nmany different ones.\n\n571\n00:30:01.142 --> 00:30:02.720\nYou wanna make sure the one you get is,\nof course,\n\n572\n00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.210\napproved by whatever the situation is.\n\n573\n00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.080\n&gt;&gt; There's physical devices as well\ncalled write blockers, so that\n\n574\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.820\nyou basically just stream the data through\nan electronic medium of physical media.\n\n575\n00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.530\nAnd it makes sure that no\ndata goes the other way.\n\n576\n00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.400\nThere's no change in the data backwardsly,\nright?\n\n577\n00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.330\nJust all goes in and you're good to go.\n\n578\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.830\nAnd these are used by forensic\ninvestigators to copy disks.\n\n579\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is amazing and\nthe process and\n\n580\n00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.300\nthe speed that they can do this.\n\n581\n00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.130\nBut the goal is to get a copy of it, and\n\n582\n00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.840\nthe copy that we call this is\nwhat we call an unaltered image.\n\n583\n00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.810\nLet me make sure I tell you the right one,\nunaltered disk image here, okay?\n\n584\n00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.700\nWell, when we can run that on\nthat image that we've taken\n\n585\n00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.050\nversus the original hard drive and\nget the same hash value,\n\n586\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:49.050\nthe same thumbprint,\nwe know that it is an unaltered copy.\n\n587\n00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.090\nBut if we do that, and\nnow we can't get the same thumbprint,\n\n588\n00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.330\nwe know that somebody has\naltered that particular copy.\n\n589\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.710\nAnd that is one we shouldn't end up using.\n\n590\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.910\nSo that one actually does make sense\nin what we take a look at and do.\n\n591\n00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.420\nSo it's very important that we understand\nthat what we're always after, of course,\n\n592\n00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.520\nis an original copy if we can.\n\n593\n00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.650\nWe leave the original alone, and\nif we're doing analysis on the data or\n\n594\n00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.820\non any of the others.\n\n595\n00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.060\nWe're actually doing it based on that\nimaging, or that image that we've taken.\n\n596\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.380\nAnd then we can validate that it\nis the proper one that we want.\n\n597\n00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:28.195\nThe key here is to also emphasize the very\nfact that when we do something like this,\n\n598\n00:31:28.195 --> 00:31:33.170\nif it's gonna be presented in court,\nit's probably even better that\n\n599\n00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.504\nyou don't do it, but\nyou use a third-party to do it, okay?\n\n600\n00:31:37.504 --> 00:31:39.884\nAnd that way nobody is,\nyou're not picking the tool,\n\n601\n00:31:39.884 --> 00:31:41.610\nthe other guy's not picking the tool.\n\n602\n00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.525\nThe third party guy did it and\nyou're off and ready to go, okay?\n\n603\n00:31:44.525 --> 00:31:47.130\nThe last thing I wanna talk abou,t even\nthough it's gonna run us over a little\n\n604\n00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.854\nbit of time, but\nthis is our last little bit here.\n\n605\n00:31:48.854 --> 00:31:50.940\nIs we do have to worry\nabout one other thing,\n\n606\n00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.290\nespecially in this age of\nevidence gathering that we're in,\n\n607\n00:31:54.290 --> 00:32:00.280\nwhich is the idea of the BYOD era\nthat we are living in, right?\n\n608\n00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.300\nThe idea of bring your own device, IOT.\n\n609\n00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.990\n&gt;&gt; The double-edged sword of the network,\nyeah.\n\n610\n00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing how\nthe terminology's changed, right?\n\n611\n00:32:07.293 --> 00:32:10.000\nBYOD, today it's IOT, you name it.\n\n612\n00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.850\n&gt;&gt; It'll be something else tomorrow,\nwon't it?\n\n613\n00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.120\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's so amazing.\n\n614\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.000\nBut these are our devices that are now\nactive on your networks a lot of times.\n\n615\n00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.430\nAnd which you may need to still\ngather data from them, and\n\n616\n00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.450\nthe problem that you're\ngonna have is simple.\n\n617\n00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.690\nYou're not gonna be able to do the imaging\nthe way that we were just talking\n\n618\n00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.380\nabout on a disk image.\n\n619\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.710\nSometimes you do end up,\n\n620\n00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:33.230\nhaving especially on smartphones, you\nhave to work with the manufacturer, okay?\n\n621\n00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.560\nSo for example, on an Apple phone,\nif you wanna go,\n\n622\n00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.950\nhey, I need to kinda clone that phone and\nget it done,\n\n623\n00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:44.540\nyou have to get the manufacturer's\nown passcode for them to unlock it.\n\n624\n00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.770\nIn other words,\nyou might have to bring the device in and\n\n625\n00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.440\nthey enter it in because they're probably\nnot gonna tell you, here's the passcode.\n\n626\n00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.358\nYeah, they're probably not\ngonna tell you that, but\n\n627\n00:32:52.358 --> 00:32:54.620\nyou have to work with them\nto at least get that done.\n\n628\n00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.930\nSo realize, especially on these smaller\nhandheld devices, you're probably going to\n\n629\n00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.300\nwork closer with the manufacturer\non those devices with anything.\n\n630\n00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.902\n&gt;&gt; And that actually happened, right?\n\n631\n00:33:01.902 --> 00:33:02.750\nApple, the FBI came.\n\n632\n00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.550\n&gt;&gt; San Bernadino, yeah.\n\n633\n00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with the San Bernadino case.\n\n634\n00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:08.460\nThey would not release that stuff,\nand they got around it anyway.\n\n635\n00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.930\nBut they held true to the fact that we're\njust not gonna pass this stuff out.\n\n636\n00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so it makes sense here.\n\n637\n00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:18.220\nBut just realize that that's another part\nthat we're gonna be dealing with more and\n\n638\n00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.270\nmore into the future.\n\n639\n00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.370\nBut realize that especially\non things on that,\n\n640\n00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.130\nyou'll probably have to\nwork with the manufacturer.\n\n641\n00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.160\nSo there's a lot of different ways to\nbe able to collect the evidence that\n\n642\n00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.670\nwe've been talking about, but you just\nneed to identify the few that we've been\n\n643\n00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.620\nmentioning in these past\ncouple of episodes.\n\n644\n00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Ronnie,\n\n645\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.860\ngreat stuff when it comes to forensic\nevidence inside of your digital world.\n\n646\n00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.310\nIt does have a few caveats and things that\nwe have to be aware of as we deal with and\n\n647\n00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.870\nwork with it when it comes to\nmaybe some litigation, right?\n\n648\n00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.020\nRonnie, you did a great job of\nwalking us through that list so\n\n649\n00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.230\nthat we're a little more situationally\naware of that environment.\n\n650\n00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.680\nThank you guys for watching, but\nit does look like we are out of time for\n\n651\n00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.870\nthis episode.\n\n652\n00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.460\nGonna go ahead and sign off, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n653\n00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.474\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n654\n00:33:58.474 --> 00:33:59.474\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n655\n00:33:59.474 --> 00:34:06.999\n[MUSIC]\n\n656\n00:34:06.999 --> 00:34:10.021\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat there are.\n\n30\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360\nBut let's get to the idea of\nwhy we actually need them and\n\n31\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.180\nwhy we're using them as well.\n\n32\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.060\nA lot of times,\nwhen we start to work as an analyst,\n\n33\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.650\nwe're gonna end up finding out that we are\ngoing to get a firehose of information.\n\n34\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.930\nAnd when I mean that,\na fire hose of information.\n\n35\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.860\nDan, it's like when we first get hired for\nany job, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.740\nYou go, cool!\n\n37\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.360\nThis is the job I applied for.\n\n38\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.170\nIt's the job that I wanted.\n\n39\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.780\nAnd all the sudden,\n\n40\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.260\nthat first day, how much paperwork\nis there, namely that first?\n\n41\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Man.\nThey hammer you, don't they?\n\n42\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.970\nThey love to just inundate you.\n\n43\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.300\nIt's like, finally Sign my name for\nthe 40th time.\n\n44\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They're like,\n\n45\n00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.940\nwell now that you're done with that,\nhere's these.\n\n46\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.460\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.380\n&gt;&gt; And now, here is your manual for,\n\n48\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.800\nhere's the compliance manual.\n\n49\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.790\nHere's your user authorization.\n\n50\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.650\nHere's all this stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.790\nNow, make sure you have\nthat kind of memorized,\n\n52\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.710\ncuz you're gonna need to know\nthese procedures by tomorrow,\n\n53\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.920\nwhatever it might be, right, there's a ton\nof information that's thrown at you.\n\n54\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.860\nAnd then all of a sudden, you need to look\nfor that certain piece of information.\n\n55\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.200\nI know during the last 48 hours,\nI scanned through a lot,\n\n56\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.100\nbut there was that,\nI needed to go back and find that.\n\n57\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.050\nNow, in the old days it was simple.\n\n58\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.920\nYou kind of had to break open the book,\nlook for\n\n59\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.640\nthe index on one of those three or\nfour manuals,\n\n60\n00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.510\nor five manuals that you had, and\ngo, finally I found the one I want.\n\n61\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.450\nAnd you flip to the page and\nyou read it, and you're good.\n\n62\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.490\nTook a little bit of manual process.\n\n63\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.600\nBut today in the days of electronic\nprocessing, we can do that a lot easier.\n\n64\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.330\nAnd it's actually even easier for\nmost companies\n\n65\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.370\nbecause they've actually hooked up like\nthe Google search engine even internally.\n\n66\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.580\nSo that they can go through and\nsay here's all of your documentation for\n\n67\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.190\nyour the employee documentation\nthat you need, and what do you do?\n\n68\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.602\nFind that little search box and [SOUND].\n\n69\n00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.656\nAnd then, it brings it right up\nwhen you actually do search for\n\n70\n00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.260\nwhat you need to do.\n\n71\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.890\nSo, Daniel,\nI'm assuming you've used Google before.\n\n72\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.580\n&gt;&gt; I've heard of it.\n\n73\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.650\nIt sounds familiar.\n\n74\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.080\nYeah of course, everybody is,\nhopefully, most people.\n\n75\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.530\nI believe your Google\nkung fu is pretty strong.\n\n76\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.280\n&gt;&gt; I can find what I'm looking for,\nusually.\n\n77\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.200\n&gt;&gt; It's great when you know\nexactly what you're looking for.\n\n78\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.690\nThe very fact is,\nwhen you want to find something.\n\n79\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.470\nWe can type in random words and\n\n80\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.840\nGoogle still says, Ronnie,\nI can figure out what you want.\n\n81\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.780\nI'm always amazed by that.\n\n82\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.980\nBut there is times it doesn't work\nthat well, but Google has a search\n\n83\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.390\nengine in the back and works that well,\nbut not everything that you search, right?\n\n84\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.180\nEspecially when it comes down to\nequipment, when it comes down to software,\n\n85\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.040\nis everything that we can actually\nhave a search for, like inside\n\n86\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.940\na software that I know I'll ask a software\nthat you've worked with sometimes,\n\n87\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.210\nisn't as intuitive as\nwhat Google let's you do.\n\n88\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.180\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.260\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n90\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.279\nWhen Ronnie says intuitive he means these\nare views in which that you experience.\n\n91\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.970\nIt's really difficult to get your mind\nwrapped around because there's so\n\n92\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.440\nmany different ways in\nwhich they can be used.\n\n93\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.640\nIt's extremely powerful, but\n\n94\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.270\nit can be a bit of a bear to grapple\nwith especially your first time in.\n\n95\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.460\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that\nwe'll end up seeing that when\n\n96\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.600\nit comes down to a lot of\nthe equipment that we work with.\n\n97\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.020\nAnd even the software that we work with,\n\n98\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.100\nif you don't have the exact right\nsearch terms sometimes, it's not good.\n\n99\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.930\nI remember a show that I did with\nDaniel on batch scripting a little bit,\n\n100\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.120\nwhere I kept emphasizing this\npoint because I wasn't so\n\n101\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.725\ngood\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:49.586\n&gt;&gt; At batch scripting.\n\n103\n00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:51.418\nAnd Daniel,\nyou made the point one time, and\n\n104\n00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:54.430\nthen you kind of typed in this command,\nand it didn't work.\n\n105\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.410\nAnd then Daniel said,\nthat's why it has to be capitalized.\n\n106\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.020\nSo I think on every show that\nwe've mentioned after that.\n\n107\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.280\nI'm like, Daniel,\nhow important is the capitalization?\n\n108\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.570\nEven though it's the same exact word-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n109\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.450\n&gt;&gt; Pretty important, right?\n\n110\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, extremely important, but\n\n111\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.230\nthat's where the power of\nregular expression comes in.\n\n112\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.320\nCuz then I can say, well if it's a lower\ncase or upper case, which one has results.\n\n113\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.950\nSo that I find every generation of\nthe string that I'm looking for.\n\n114\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.370\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, that's a great contacts for\nus to think about it.\n\n115\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n116\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.350\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is if we're looking for\n\n117\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.420\nsomething let's say on a Linux\noperating system, we're find up\n\n118\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.420\nending using that utility that everybody\nloves and everybody uses, grep.\n\n119\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing.\n\n120\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.360\n&gt;&gt; And so inside of grep we also have\nthe ability to combine that not only with\n\n121\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.850\nthe exact such term of string\nthat we're looking for and\n\n122\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.040\nit will turn to us the results\nvery quickly and we are all proud\n\n123\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.810\nof that fact that fit does exactly want to\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n124\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.690\nthere's sometimes though when you need\nit to actually return more than that.\n\n125\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.180\nBecause you're not exactly sure what\nyou're looking for but you're close.\n\n126\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.120\nOr you actually know that there's\nsupposed to be more than one result.\n\n127\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.780\nDaniel have you ever did that search and\n\n128\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.100\ngo I know that there's more than one\nresult here but you only got one?\n\n129\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit\n\n130\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.690\nfrustrating isn't it?\n\n131\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it can be frustrating.\n\n132\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.790\n&gt;&gt; And then it becomes even more\nfrustrating because your like I okay well\n\n133\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.885\nI know regular expression\ncould help me with this.\n\n134\n00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:14.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now I just have to craft it,\n\n135\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.430\njust right so that it will.\n\n136\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.810\n&gt;&gt; And that's the problem right.\n\n137\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.830\nIn the Linux realm and\nmost users that are using Linux today and\n\n138\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.190\na lot things of course are based on Linux,\neven Linux users,\n\n139\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.905\nregular expressions are almost a bit\nof voodoo, aren't they, Daniel?\n\n140\n00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:32.430\n&gt;&gt; {LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n141\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.740\nYou're definitely a witch doctor of\nthe craft if you're handy with the Reg X.\n\n142\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.740\n&gt;&gt; If you really get to the point where\nyou feel comfortable in using regular\n\n143\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.820\nexpressions in everything that you do,\nyou're going to master a ton of things\n\n144\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.490\nbecause you're going to be able to search\nfor everything so much more efficiently.\n\n145\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.450\nThen what you think about.\n\n146\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.930\nThat's why we want to jump into learning\nabout regular expressions a little bit.\n\n147\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.220\nLet me go ahead and\nkind of set the boundary here.\n\n148\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.070\nWe're not doing a primer on rejects.\n\n149\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.860\nIf you hear the term regular expression,\nyou hear rejects.\n\n150\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.824\n&gt;&gt; What I just heard\nwas a collective sigh.\n\n151\n00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:12.774\n[LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:12.774 --> 00:07:18.209\nBut the exam objectives do call out for\nus to be able to interpret basic\n\n153\n00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:23.365\nregular expressions, and\nthat's actually pretty difficult if\n\n154\n00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:29.020\nyou don't know some of the foundations\nof regular expressions.\n\n155\n00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.046\nSo expect this especially when you\nget into the exam that when they tell\n\n156\n00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:39.497\nyou on the objectives that the actually\nexam objective is interpretative,\n\n157\n00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:43.245\nthey're saying I'm going\nto show you something and\n\n158\n00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:48.292\nyou've got to interpret it for\nme on what either result is going to be.\n\n159\n00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:52.897\nI don't think I'm learning out about\nthe exam that's something that I\n\n160\n00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:57.439\nshouldn't disclose, but\nit's right there in the exam objectives.\n\n161\n00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:02.418\nThis interpret, assuming that you're\ngonna get that, a regular expression.\n\n162\n00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:06.696\nAnd you must kind of figure out\nwhat it's regularly expressing.\n\n163\n00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:10.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's a big part of that\nthat we have to at least know and\n\n164\n00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:11.420\nunderstand.\n\n165\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.840\nSo let's go first into the idea\nof identifying the elements.\n\n166\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.424\nAnd then we'll start off with the same\nscenario that we were talking about,\n\n167\n00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:21.169\nwhich we'll kind of use a Cisco\nrouter to help us out here.\n\n168\n00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:24.525\nBecause that's the one that I'm most\nfamiliar with that we're gonna actually\n\n169\n00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:25.940\nhave to look for information on.\n\n170\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.180\nAnd it's actually a good one because\nit's actually real equipment that\n\n171\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.290\nwe're using too.\n\n172\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.250\nSo there's a couple of sites that\nI'm gonna point out that can\n\n173\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.710\nreally help you along as\nyou go along doing this.\n\n174\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.170\nSo I'm gonna click on this tab right here,\nand\n\n175\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.354\nthis one is an old article\ncalled CiscoZine right here.\n\n176\n00:08:43.354 --> 00:08:45.633\nAnd you can see the actual link.\n\n177\n00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:49.328\nThe reason why I wanna do this is not\nbecause we're going through the whole\n\n178\n00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:52.080\nthing, but\nI like this little table that they made.\n\n179\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.249\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a cheat sheet there.\n\n180\n00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a nice cheat sheet.\n\n181\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.570\nAnd that's pretty much what it is.\n\n182\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.180\nAnd I wanna make sure that we at\nleast understand some of these, and\n\n183\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.750\nit's nice because it gives\nyou some examples too.\n\n184\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.894\nSo the first one that you want to\nmake sure that you do understand and\n\n185\n00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:10.038\nknow about is that when you use this\nin a search function with grep or\n\n186\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:14.258\neven inside of something like\nthe Cisco command prompt on a router.\n\n187\n00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:17.110\nYou can add in your particular command,\nand\n\n188\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.370\nyou're doing a search function\nlike the show running-config.\n\n189\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.840\nYou can also add in a pipe symbol,\nand then, include,\n\n190\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.148\nat that point, you can start using\nregular expressions there too.\n\n191\n00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:30.910\nNow, can you use it before that?\n\n192\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.660\nYes, you can,\n\n193\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.190\nbut I'm just kinda giving you the scenario\nthat we're gonna use it in instead.\n\n194\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.020\nSo here, if I wanna match just\nany single character, and\n\n195\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.810\nthis is actually very important for\nus, okay?\n\n196\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.930\nSo, a single period can\nactually help you out\n\n197\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.310\ntremendously if you are creating\nregular expressions.\n\n198\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.735\nThe good thing is, you and I are not\ntalking about creating an expression.\n\n199\n00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:57.120\nYou and I are actually just talking\nabout recognizing an expression.\n\n200\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.545\nSo when you see that it can match\nany single character here, and so\n\n201\n00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:05.350\nthey give you some examples,\nlike 0.0 here, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.280\nNotice it can match anything.\n\n203\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.570\nAnd what we're looking at, of course,\n\n204\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.900\nis the very center of this\nkind of example, right?\n\n205\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.600\nIt can match an x, it can match a 2.\n\n206\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.020\nIf you actually do have\nthe 0s on both sides,\n\n207\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.480\nanything in that middle there,\nwe can actually have that matched.\n\n208\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.941\nSo whether it's alpha-numeric, whatever it\nmight be, it can end up doing that, and\n\n209\n00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.297\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n210\n00:10:27.297 --> 00:10:29.822\nThe same thing also here too,\n\n211\n00:10:29.822 --> 00:10:35.280\nwhen they show you just a line\nof a couple of alphabetas here.\n\n212\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.650\nSo notice t and then period, period,\nand then of course, the t again.\n\n213\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.665\nNotice it says it can match\nanything in between, and\n\n214\n00:10:42.665 --> 00:10:46.722\nnow you see where they've added an es,\ntx, and even ar in the middle.\n\n215\n00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:50.545\nWhy the heck would I ever match\nthe word tart in a search on?\n\n216\n00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:54.280\nNo, I'm not saying you're gonna look for\nthat, but\n\n217\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.360\nit's giving you an example of\nsome words that may come up.\n\n218\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.240\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It's a true wildcard.\n\n219\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.788\nIt's anything that matches\nthat regular expression.\n\n220\n00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:08.909\nSo if you have t..t,\nanything can be in those dots.\n\n221\n00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:12.512\nFor whatever reason you had t0xt,\nfor whatever strange reason,\n\n222\n00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:17.410\nmaybe it's a serial number or something\nto that effect, it will find that string.\n\n223\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's pretty important.\n\n224\n00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:23.240\nIt really is important because of the very\nfact that we may actually just think up,\n\n225\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.500\nwhat about the word testx, like T-E-S-T-X,\nit's not gonna match that, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.320\nBecause notice at the end of this,\nwe're not searching for another s.\n\n227\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.575\nSo just kind of realize and focus in\non the expression character and try and\n\n228\n00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:39.370\nunderstand that.\n\n229\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.320\nThe next one here is\na little bit more confusing,\n\n230\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.080\nthe first time I ran into\nthis more regularly, right,\n\n231\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.640\nis when we started switching\nthe way that we did our show notes.\n\n232\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.790\nDaniel, did you come along before\nwhen we went to Markdown or after,\n\n233\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.770\nI can't remember.\n\n234\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.270\n&gt;&gt; I think it was right at the time\nwe started using Markdown.\n\n235\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.399\n&gt;&gt; About right at the time when\nwe started using Markdown, so\n\n236\n00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:01.470\nI've gotten a little bit better at\nthis since we started using Markdown.\n\n237\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.667\nBut before that, what I would find out in\na Markdown editor that we were using is,\n\n238\n00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:09.330\nall the sudden, certain characters\nwould disappear in my Markdown.\n\n239\n00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.100\nAnd I was like, why is this not working?\n\n240\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.990\nWhat's going on here,\nas I'm typing this stuff out?\n\n241\n00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.010\nCertain characters would just disappear.\n\n242\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.230\nAnd that is because in\nthe way that Markdown works,\n\n243\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.400\nyou had to use this regular\nexpression to make it show up.\n\n244\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.735\nSo this actually tells you that it matches\na character following the backslash.\n\n245\n00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:29.830\nSo that means whatever the character is,\n\n246\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.360\nso if you end up finding that it's\nmissing when you see the output, well,\n\n247\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.120\nit's saying, go ahead and\ntry and add this backslash in.\n\n248\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.520\nSo for example, notice that this one,\nand this is actually a good one for\n\n249\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:49.190\nus to pay attention to right here,\n172\\.1\\.\n\n250\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.350\nNotice what it ends up matching here,\nokay?\n\n251\n00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.350\nAnd that's because it adds in\nthe periods in between because\n\n252\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.580\nthey're not actually there.\n\n253\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.120\nSometimes a period actually is\nan expression that it won't recognize.\n\n254\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.450\nSo if you need that to show up,\n\n255\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.820\nyou may have to do something like\nthis too to make it actually show up.\n\n256\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.010\nSo this is a good one as well.\n\n257\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.240\nThe other things that might not show\nup are things like apostrophes.\n\n258\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.540\nSo when you're, like,\nwhy is that not working?\n\n259\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.230\nI don't see the apostrophe there.\n\n260\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.570\nWell, do a backslash, an apostrophe, and\nall of a sudden, it will show up again.\n\n261\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.400\nAnd you'll see that.\n\n262\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.930\nOne of my favorite ones is right here,\nwhich is within these brackets, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.950\nI like it because you actually\nhave two possibilities here.\n\n264\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.943\nWhen you see brackets around\na certain amount of characters and\n\n265\n00:13:32.943 --> 00:13:35.949\nwhatever string that they give you,\nright, you can see that.\n\n266\n00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:40.360\nSo let's take for an example,\nDaniel, just a regular IP address.\n\n267\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.067\nIf I go, hey, look at this router,\nthere's four IP addresses on it.\n\n268\n00:13:45.067 --> 00:13:49.740\n172.16, the first one is 10.,\nwhatever, 11.\n\n269\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.292\nThe next one is 20.11,\nthe next one is 30.11.\n\n270\n00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:59.280\nAll three of them essentially end with the\nsame, have the first two octets the same.\n\n271\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.470\nThe third one though is different.\n\n272\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.330\nWell Daniel, if you were to try and\nwrite just a regular search and\n\n273\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.720\ndo that, it'd probably be three different\nsearches before I was able to find that.\n\n274\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.973\nBut with regular expressions though,\nwhat I can actually do and\n\n275\n00:14:14.973 --> 00:14:22.281\nwhat I can tell about this, right, is if\nI see this 172 and then this /..16/..\n\n276\n00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:28.036\nIn that third section,\nputting in parentheses here,\n\n277\n00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:31.671\nlet’s say a 1, 2 and 3, okay.\n\n278\n00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:36.938\nAnd then you close the parentheses,\nokay, and you put a 0 after that.\n\n279\n00:14:36.938 --> 00:14:40.422\nAnd say hey,\nany one of those numbers can match there.\n\n280\n00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:43.387\nAnd that would actually put the 10, 20,\n\n281\n00:14:43.387 --> 00:14:49.300\n30 right there in that third octet, and\nthey pull all of them in there for us.\n\n282\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.910\nNow, if I do that, right,\nI can do any one of those,\n\n283\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.650\nbut what if I wanted to match any of them?\n\n284\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.299\nI could actually just put in a 1-3 and\nsay,\n\n285\n00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:03.560\nhey, look for the entire range if I\nwant to, not just any one of them, but\n\n286\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.870\nI could look for the entire range or\nI could exclude some.\n\n287\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.630\nWe'll do an example of this one,\ncuz I find it to be more regular.\n\n288\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.140\nThe other one that's kind of neat\nhere of course is this carat, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.400\nJust when I say carat, the more that I\nkept looking up, people call it also hat.\n\n290\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.007\n&gt;&gt; A what?\n&gt;&gt; A hat.\n\n291\n00:15:19.007 --> 00:15:21.352\n&gt;&gt; A hat, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a hat, which I did not know.\n\n292\n00:15:21.352 --> 00:15:23.581\nSo, you like the term hat, you use hat.\n\n293\n00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:26.050\nIf you like the term carat, carat here.\n\n294\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.090\nIt matches a character or\na null string at the beginning.\n\n295\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.580\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n296\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.685\nIt means go to the beginning of this,\nokay, and so take this and\n\n297\n00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:39.023\nit disappears at the beginning,\nmatch it, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:42.230\nAnd then look for\nwhatever else follows after that.\n\n299\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.095\nSo you'll see that as well in here,\nyou'll see this idea.\n\n300\n00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:50.549\nNotice that if they do the hat and\n1, 2, 3, it does match 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n301\n00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:56.065\nBut notice it doesn't match anything\nthat has anything prefixed before that,\n\n302\n00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:57.477\nsuch as a 0, okay?\n\n303\n00:15:57.477 --> 00:16:00.442\nThe other one, it can actually be there,\n\n304\n00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:04.000\nnot just zero or\none occurence of the pattern.\n\n305\n00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.870\n&gt;&gt; It's fun, isn't it?\n\n306\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now this is where it starts\ngetting trickier at this point.\n\n307\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.240\nYeah, not just either zero or\none occurrence of the pattern,\n\n308\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.400\nso it can be multiple occurrences.\n\n309\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.840\nIt can either match one, or\nit doesn't have to match it at all.\n\n310\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.690\nSo, here they give an example.\n\n311\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.901\nNotice here in the bab, notice it can\nactually put another bb there, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:30.622\nOr bab, but notice it doesn't\nactually have a fourth letter there.\n\n313\n00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:33.510\nSo that's what they're showing\nyou is in the middle and\n\n314\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.220\nthat one's probably more than out of the\nrealm of some of the stuff we're doing.\n\n315\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.240\nThe dollar sign, again,\nkinda does the same thing but\n\n316\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.500\nat the end of the string instead of\nat the beginning such as the hat.\n\n317\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.250\nSo, it's kinda the opposite here.\n\n318\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.891\nAnd this is of course my favorite one,\nthe wild card.\n\n319\n00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:53.197\nI use this more often than I realize,\nwhen I actually wanna find something and\n\n320\n00:16:53.197 --> 00:16:55.328\nI don't know exactly how to spell it.\n\n321\n00:16:55.328 --> 00:16:59.713\nMy favorite is when I'm actually\ndoing like a show interface and\n\n322\n00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:02.805\nI don't wanna spell out gigabit interface.\n\n323\n00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, gigabit Ethernet.\n\n324\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.460\nI can go ahead and\nput in like an asterisk, and\n\n325\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.080\njust type in essentially the middle\nof the word if I want to.\n\n326\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.500\nAnything at the beginning that\nhas this too,and do that.\n\n327\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.260\nSo you can actually do that, as well.\n\n328\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.020\nSo this is just the regular wildcard\nthat we would see anyplace else.\n\n329\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:31.480\nNotice, it says 5* matches any occurrence\nof the number 5, including none.\n\n330\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.020\nSo it might not match anything.\n\n331\n00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.720\nAnd here, now, notice,\nwe're getting challenged here.\n\n332\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.063\nSo if I take a look at this I can\nnow see that this one says hey,\n\n333\n00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:48.520\nmatch 18\\ and then a dot, so\nI know it's supposed to be 18.\n\n334\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.850\nAnd then we have this other one over here\nthat says hey, anything else that follows\n\n335\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.820\nbut notices it says that and any character\nthat follows the 18, if you want to.\n\n336\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.760\n&gt;&gt; And that would also be any length\ncharacter can follow because you have\n\n337\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.080\nthe period, which says any, it's\na true wildcard, any character at all.\n\n338\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.730\nThen, you have the star or the asterisk,\n\n339\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:14.990\nwhich says any of the previous character\n0 or as many times as you like.\n\n340\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.180\nSo, there you go.\n\n341\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyeah this is kinda more of more towards\n\n342\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.450\nexam-like stuff that we're talking about.\n\n343\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.700\nSo I can't really tell you what's on it,\nbut fairly similar, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.310\nSo it makes sense, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:33.045\nAnd then there's a plus sign if you have\none or more sequences preceding this.\n\n346\n00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.890\nSo, notice it says A+\nrequires there to be at least\n\n347\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.930\none 8 in the string to be matched.\n\n348\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.845\nAll right.\n\n349\n00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:43.890\nThis one's kind of a repeat of what we did\na little bit earlier, the pipe symbol is\n\n350\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:49.110\na concatenation and this one's a little\nbit strange on which is the underscore.\n\n351\n00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.797\nIt really only matches,\nit says a comma, a left brace,\n\n352\n00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:56.177\nwhich notice it actually\nincludes a parentheses.\n\n353\n00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.014\nNo, it's just the left brace.\n\n354\n00:18:58.014 --> 00:19:02.541\nI was gonna say, I'm trying to\nfocus in on the wrong character.\n\n355\n00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:08.926\nAnd, a right brace, at the beginning\nof the end of the string or space.\n\n356\n00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:10.786\nThis one's kind of weird.\n\n357\n00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:16.370\nSo if you take a look and you see\nan expression that looks like this,\n\n358\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.977\nthe underscore on both sides,\nnotice that any of these can match.\n\n359\n00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:25.561\nIt could be where you're saying\nwhether this is at the beginning,\n\n360\n00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:30.041\n13 at the beginning and at the end, or\nwhether you're actually seeing a space bar\n\n361\n00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:33.562\nat the end or whether you're seeing\na space bar at the beginning.\n\n362\n00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:37.457\nWhether you're seeing an opening,\na brace, or\n\n363\n00:19:37.457 --> 00:19:43.900\nwith a comma afterwards or you're\ndoing a comma and a comma in between.\n\n364\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.200\nOr the braces itself or\nagain comma and a comma,\n\n365\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.010\nprobably supposed to be\nan ending brace there instead.\n\n366\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.410\nSo those are kind of the most basic ones\n\n367\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.978\nthat we should feel a little bit\nconfident about as we go into this.\n\n368\n00:19:58.978 --> 00:20:04.030\nSo don't overlook this,\n\n369\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.540\nespecially for the exam,\nbecause you're going to find,\n\n370\n00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.330\nprobably more often than not, that\nyou're going to get questions on this,\n\n371\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:16.080\nespecially about identifying certain\nthings and about retrieving information.\n\n372\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.470\nSo let's see just at least\nthe basic example here,\n\n373\n00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.190\nusing the router like I promised you.\n\n374\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.970\nSo I'm going to our practice labs,\nwhich is a great platform for\n\n375\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.890\nus to be able to practice in.\n\n376\n00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.502\nAnd the great thing is,\nyou can do this too.\n\n377\n00:20:29.502 --> 00:20:31.984\nI just opened up the first\nCisco lab that was there.\n\n378\n00:20:31.984 --> 00:20:36.130\nI turned on the New York edge\nrouter is all I did, and\n\n379\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:42.020\nI put a couple of IP addresses in and\nturned on some interfaces.\n\n380\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.980\nI'm trying to get it to where\nit doesn't look too bad here.\n\n381\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.650\nThere we go.\n\n382\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.630\nOkay, so that way we can go ahead and\nput this in here and see what happens.\n\n383\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.160\nAll right, so\nI'm going to do enable, and oops.\n\n384\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.300\nWhere is my.\n\n385\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.050\nHad to press enter.\n\n386\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.730\nHere we go, all right so now there it is.\n\n387\n00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:07.080\nI am now into the router itself and\nI am ready to use regular expressions.\n\n388\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.930\nJust about everything we type\nin is a regular expression but\n\n389\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.290\nat the beginning,\nkind of the first basic command\n\n390\n00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.170\nthat we normally run to when we\ndon't remember anything else.\n\n391\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.980\nEspecially on a Cisco router,\nit's gonna be show running-config.\n\n392\n00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.780\nAnd when I do this,\nit shows me everything, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.710\nSo, Daniel, there it is.\n\n394\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.410\nThere's the current configuration.\n\n395\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.440\nAs we go through this, we see everything\nthat we want to and this is great.\n\n396\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.480\nI see the interfaces there, descriptions,\nIP addresses, whether to shut down or not.\n\n397\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.890\nI can see all that great information,\nand it continues to scroll on and on.\n\n398\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.390\nAnd this is just a small configuration,\n\n399\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.882\nit's probably one of the smallest\nconfigurations we'll normally ever get to.\n\n400\n00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:52.560\nBut now,imagine this as being a production\nrouter or a switch, in which there's a ton\n\n401\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.990\nmore interfaces on these devices and\nthere's a ton more information.\n\n402\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:03.302\nAnd now, if you had to find a certain\namount of information, what would I have\n\n403\n00:22:03.302 --> 00:22:08.972\nto do to actually go back into gigabit\nEthernet, or gigabit Ethernet interface.\n\n404\n00:22:08.972 --> 00:22:11.592\nInterface gigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n405\n00:22:11.592 --> 00:22:16.921\nWell, in a regular configuration,\nI don't even have to do that.\n\n406\n00:22:16.921 --> 00:22:20.528\nLet me type in show Int, but\nlet's go ahead and type those off,\n\n407\n00:22:20.528 --> 00:22:23.440\njust in case somebody doesn't know.\n\n408\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.188\nAnd at this point,\nit's actually spelled this way.\n\n409\n00:22:27.188 --> 00:22:32.108\nGigabit ethernet 0/0 here,\n\n410\n00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:36.130\nif I remember correctly.\n\n411\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.590\nI'm just trying to, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.970\nSo now you notice, no spaces, nothing.\n\n413\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.870\n&gt;&gt; You've got a space.\n\n414\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.290\n&gt;&gt; And\nI've got a space in my command here.\n\n415\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.760\nWell, I did.\n\n416\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.660\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n417\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.380\nthat's the way that she ends up looking.\n\n418\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.160\nNow, that's a lot of typing to\ndo at the beginning of the your\n\n419\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.290\nactually working with Cisco.\n\n420\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.580\nEven though we can use\nabbreviations everywhere, and\n\n421\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.190\nI recommend that you do, on the exam\nthere may not be an abbreviation.\n\n422\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.980\nSo make sure you learn them, don't just\ngo, well Ryan said you could do this.\n\n423\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.780\nit's not gonna matter that Ryan said\nthat when you go into the exam, so\n\n424\n00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.030\njust kind of remember.\n\n425\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.440\nWell, I can find that information out and\nbe able to type that in, but\n\n426\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.500\nthere are abbreviations,\nso we can do that.\n\n427\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.310\nBut what if we're looking for\nsomething a little bit more specific or\n\n428\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.550\na little bit more generalized,\nwhatever it might be here.\n\n429\n00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.900\nSo this is where we can use some\nof these regular expressions.\n\n430\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.690\nSo the first one that I'm going to use,\n\n431\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.380\nwe're gonna start off with\nthe show running-config again.\n\n432\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.075\nAnd then, we're going to use that pipe\ncommand, which says hey let's go ahead and\n\n433\n00:23:35.075 --> 00:23:39.570\nbring this information\ntogether in this way.\n\n434\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.720\nThen I'm gonna do an include and\nI can shorten that up to an i,\n\n435\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.820\nif I wanted to as well.\n\n436\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.350\nI want to say,\nI wanna show all of the interfaces here.\n\n437\n00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.818\nNow, if I do that,\nI've got an issue sometimes.\n\n438\n00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:55.350\nLet me go back and\nshow you what I'm talking about.\n\n439\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.582\nNow, even though all of these\nare at the beginning of the line.\n\n440\n00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:01.643\nI wanna make sure that I pick up\nonly those at the beginning of\n\n441\n00:24:01.643 --> 00:24:02.571\nthe line as well.\n\n442\n00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:10.400\nSo I'm gonna start off with the caret, and\nthen type in interface and press Enter.\n\n443\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.728\nAnd now notice the output\nthat I got instead.\n\n444\n00:24:13.728 --> 00:24:17.981\nIt still showed running config,\nbut now notice it went ahead and\n\n445\n00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:22.575\njust gave me everything that has\nan interface on it, which is great.\n\n446\n00:24:22.575 --> 00:24:26.898\nIt allows me to kind of limit what I\nwant to see and what I want to do.\n\n447\n00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:30.498\nIf I need to see every single interface,\nright, I can do the show run,\n\n448\n00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:33.440\nwhich is probably at least\nthe easiest thing for us to do.\n\n449\n00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.993\nBut it puts so much more\ninformation on the machine itself.\n\n450\n00:24:36.993 --> 00:24:41.327\nAnd on a router that's really busy,\ndoing a show run, even though it's not\n\n451\n00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:45.067\nthe hardest thing in the world,\nit still adds compute cycles in.\n\n452\n00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.321\nIt still has to hold it in RAM,\n\n453\n00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:49.660\nit still has to do all that stuff\nwhile the router is still functioning.\n\n454\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo it can take away a little bit of\nthe processing power that we have.\n\n455\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.217\nThe other thing that we also\nwant to think about here, okay,\n\n456\n00:24:56.217 --> 00:24:57.856\nis that the more times I run this.\n\n457\n00:24:57.856 --> 00:25:02.615\nLet's say that I do one for\neach one, for show interface,\n\n458\n00:25:02.615 --> 00:25:06.810\ngigabit, ethernet, 0/0, 0/1, 0/2.\n\n459\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:12.725\nThat's three, whereas in one particular\nuse of regular expressions here,\n\n460\n00:25:12.725 --> 00:25:15.280\nand you see it kind of right here.\n\n461\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.560\nIt's kind of the use of the regular\nexpression at this point.\n\n462\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.820\nIn just doing something like this,\n\n463\n00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.720\nit allowed me to actually bring in\nall that and put it into one command.\n\n464\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.606\nAnd this is a lot more efficient than\nthe way that we would have to do this,\n\n465\n00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:31.970\nif I didn't know at least\nthe regular expression.\n\n466\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.520\nSo seeing something like this,\nlet's take for an example here, okay.\n\n467\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.040\nAnd if they were to show you,\nlet's say, A, B, C, or D, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.090\nWhich of the following would\nactually include this output?\n\n469\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.550\nWell, again, just kind of think\nabout what this actually shows you,\n\n470\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.360\nthat the output would actually include,\nand what you might end up seeing.\n\n471\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.430\nNow along with this,\nlet's go ahead and do this too.\n\n472\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.470\nWe did see IP address is assigned on here,\nright?\n\n473\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.280\nSo we saw it, but what if I\nwanted to actually go, all right.\n\n474\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.491\nLet's kind of add in four or\nfive more in our minds.\n\n475\n00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:07.997\nBut we'll add all this,\nlet's say that I want to find out like,\n\n476\n00:26:07.997 --> 00:26:11.643\nI'm supposed to add an another route\nback to Daniel's branch office.\n\n477\n00:26:11.643 --> 00:26:16.443\nAll right, I know that there is one\nof these interfaces that doesn't\n\n478\n00:26:16.443 --> 00:26:18.195\nhave an IP address on it.\n\n479\n00:26:18.195 --> 00:26:19.736\nAgain, I'd have to hit show run.\n\n480\n00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:23.904\nAnd on the big router, it's just, okay,\nclick, click, click, click, click, click,\n\n481\n00:26:23.904 --> 00:26:25.355\nclick, whichever one it is..\n\n482\n00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:29.905\nBut instead, what I can do,\nmaybe, is type in show run.\n\n483\n00:26:33.685 --> 00:26:34.580\nGotta spell running right.\n\n484\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.140\nAnd we'll go back and\ndo just about the same command here.\n\n485\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.985\nActually, we're going to do it\ndifferently, not do the show run here.\n\n486\n00:26:42.985 --> 00:26:47.681\nThat's going to be show\nip interface brief.\n\n487\n00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:50.735\nSo we're doing a very brief\noutput of the interface.\n\n488\n00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:56.484\nAnd then we're going\nto tell it to include.\n\n489\n00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.890\nLet's do first exclude here, okay?\n\n490\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.930\nExclude all of the unassigned ones.\n\n491\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.194\nNow I'm going to abbreviate this one at\nthe end, because I don't want to spell out\n\n492\n00:27:05.194 --> 00:27:07.059\nunassigned cuz I may\nactually spell it wrong.\n\n493\n00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:09.255\nOr let's say that at the beginning here,\n\n494\n00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:12.500\nunassigned is actually\ncapitalized in the config.\n\n495\n00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.060\nSo I'm just trying to abbreviate what\nwe have here, and see what happens.\n\n496\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.750\nNow as we do this, notice that I'm\nactually excluding some of them.\n\n497\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.410\nI see all of these interfaces.\n\n498\n00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.280\nBut now notice that what's happened\nhere as I'm excluding the ones\n\n499\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.270\nthat may actually not be\nassigned any IP addresses.\n\n500\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.190\nNow, can I confirm that for sure?\n\n501\n00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.455\nYes, definitely because I can just\nrun essentially the same command,\n\n502\n00:27:35.455 --> 00:27:38.090\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n503\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.150\nAnd then this time do an include.,\nand let's just do the unassigned.\n\n504\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.200\nAnd now, look at this Daniel, there it is.\n\n505\n00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.120\nI can see that it found exactly what I was\nlooking for on, unassigned right here.\n\n506\n00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.670\nAnd it sees that those IP\naddresses were right here too.\n\n507\n00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.630\nSo I could pick one of\nthose interfaces and\n\n508\n00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.212\nstart my configuration instead of going,\nokay, show run.\n\n509\n00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:05.091\nI should have wrote that down,\nscroll all the way back up to that point.\n\n510\n00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:07.720\nYeah here it is, and\nthen start typing it in.\n\n511\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.970\nSo just a basic idea here of some of\nthe things that it really can do.\n\n512\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.940\nSo just using those simple\nones are really neat as well.\n\n513\n00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.580\nAlso, Daniel, I can even see,\n\n514\n00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.520\neven though you can see it right\nhere which ones are up and down.\n\n515\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.849\nRemember that on a router that\nactually is doing quite a bit more,\n\n516\n00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:31.429\nwe may actually wanna go, all right,\nwhich ones are actually down?\n\n517\n00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:33.701\nSo I think I've got every one up, but\n\n518\n00:28:33.701 --> 00:28:37.390\nI wanna confirm which\nones are actually down.\n\n519\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.633\nSo, again we can do show run,\nbut that means I have to go and\n\n520\n00:28:40.633 --> 00:28:42.763\nstop at every single one and find out.\n\n521\n00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:46.683\nOr, I can do show run, oops, maybe not.\n\n522\n00:28:48.485 --> 00:28:52.730\nToo many n's.\n\n523\n00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:57.213\nAnd then, I can also say include.\n\n524\n00:28:59.702 --> 00:29:02.602\nI'm going to do all\nthe interfaces in this command.\n\n525\n00:29:04.484 --> 00:29:08.084\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe\nthat into shutdown, okay?\n\n526\n00:29:08.084 --> 00:29:11.281\nAnd now, oops,\nwhy didn't that show my inter?\n\n527\n00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:14.030\nI know why,\nlook at what I typed in, Daniel.\n\n528\n00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:17.906\n&gt;&gt; Interfaces.\n\n529\n00:29:17.906 --> 00:29:19.556\n&gt;&gt; Interfaces, yeah.\n\n530\n00:29:19.556 --> 00:29:20.619\nSee, this is where it can bite you.\n\n531\n00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:21.549\n&gt;&gt; Not interface.\n\n532\n00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:22.173\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n533\n00:29:22.173 --> 00:29:23.382\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This is where it can bite you,\n\n534\n00:29:23.382 --> 00:29:25.954\nso this is why it's one of those\nthings where if you're like me,\n\n535\n00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:27.972\nyou're like okay Ronnie,\ntry and hurry up here.\n\n536\n00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:32.453\nTry it again.\n\n537\n00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:39.340\nOops.\n\n538\n00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.888\nPut my space back in, there we go.\n\n539\n00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:44.596\nSo now I can see, of the interfaces,\n\n540\n00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:48.363\nlet's say that I thought I configured\neverything but it still wasn't working.\n\n541\n00:29:48.363 --> 00:29:52.454\nAnd then I had to go back and go,\nwhich one didn't I actually shut down?\n\n542\n00:29:52.454 --> 00:29:55.755\nNow let's say it's this one,\nso there it was, okay?\n\n543\n00:29:55.755 --> 00:29:58.358\nSo this one I forgot to do a no shutdown.\n\n544\n00:29:58.358 --> 00:30:01.355\nAnd that way I can go and\nfind out exactly which ones.\n\n545\n00:30:01.355 --> 00:30:04.110\nThe other two do show up, okay?\n\n546\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.658\nBut notice that we don't have the word\nshutdown immediately afterwards,\n\n547\n00:30:08.658 --> 00:30:13.072\nwhich helps me to identify these as\nbeing possibilities of what we have.\n\n548\n00:30:13.072 --> 00:30:16.611\nSo this is at least the beginning\nof what we're seeing now.\n\n549\n00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:22.387\nI'm pretty much emphasizing really just\nthe use of that one expression so far.\n\n550\n00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:25.222\nBut there's gonna be others\nthat we're going to see.\n\n551\n00:30:25.222 --> 00:30:30.128\nBut what we're going to do is because\nI'm running out of time here is\n\n552\n00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:34.963\nthat I wanna continue on with this and\ndo a couple of more examples.\n\n553\n00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:38.542\nBut then, I wanna show you how we actually\nwould use this in an analysis type of\n\n554\n00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:39.610\nway as well.\n\n555\n00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.370\nSo Daniel, we'll have to save this for\nepisode number two.\n\n556\n00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.290\n&gt;&gt; No, no, problem Ronnie,\nyou have been really cool so far.\n\n557\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.470\nAs you can see,\nit's a bit to wrap your head around.\n\n558\n00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.910\nBut if you do get your head wrapped\naround it, man, it's extremely powerful.\n\n559\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.250\nIt will help you out in your day\nto day life, that's for sure.\n\n560\n00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.880\nRonnie, thanks for\nshowing us Regex so far.\n\n561\n00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.640\nLooking forward to a couple more\nexamples that he's got lined up for\n\n562\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.270\nus in that part two.\n\n563\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.330\nSo definitely come on back for that.\n\n564\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.460\nAs for this episode it's time\nto sign off for ITProTV.\n\n565\n00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.722\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n566\n00:31:05.722 --> 00:31:06.919\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:16.527\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.992\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe're more on our Cisco SECOPS show right,\n\n9\n00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:23.785\nbeen a lot of fun so far,\nhaving a good time here.\n\n10\n00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:27.050\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.610\nRonnie, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.520\n&gt;&gt; It has gone great, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.652\nThank you again for allowing me to\ncontinue on with you on regular\n\n14\n00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:35.797\nexpression I know,\none of your favorite topics here, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:37.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, joy, rapture.\n\n16\n00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:39.267\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:39.950\n&gt;&gt; It is funny,\n\n18\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.990\nwe get to make faces at\nthe camera all day and\n\n19\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.534\nthen you get to try to guess\nwhat that expression is.\n\n20\n00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:45.696\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good luck.\n&gt;&gt; Remember that for\n\n21\n00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:48.329\nus here on regular expressions\nwe are continuing on.\n\n22\n00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.110\nWe're taking a look.\n\n23\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.480\nAnd in part one we showed\nyou kinda the basics.\n\n24\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480\nWe talked about those\ndifferent meta characters,\n\n25\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.817\nwhatever they call them that you're\nsupposed to make sure that you know.\n\n26\n00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:00.890\nMake sure you do pay attention there.\n\n27\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.180\nThese are gonna be important for\n\n28\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.420\nyour Cisco exam as you continue on\ntowards your SECOPS exam there.\n\n29\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.540\nThe whole objective, right, is about\ninterpreting basic regular expressions.\n\n30\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.530\nAnd we've at least given you the tools and\nshown you a couple of examples.\n\n31\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.440\nWe wanna show you a couple of more to\ntry and round out a few other things.\n\n32\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.051\nNow this is not a comprehensive example,\nof course,\n\n33\n00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.438\nof every single possibility\nthat's out there.\n\n34\n00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:28.386\nBut at least we'll give you\na little bit of hint, and\n\n35\n00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:33.078\nshow you at least in a Cisco context where\nyou'll also see them regularly used too.\n\n36\n00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:34.910\nSo let's go ahead and continue that.\n\n37\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.103\nWe had just picked up on the Cisco router.\n\n38\n00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:42.083\nAnd we've typed in a few using,\nof course, the pipe command which is\n\n39\n00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:46.290\nprobably where I tend to use them more\noften and now we are continuing on.\n\n40\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.899\nSo as we take a look at the router,\nwe'll go ahead and pick back up here.\n\n41\n00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.175\nThere were just a couple\nmore I wanted to show you,\n\n42\n00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.990\none dealing with the idea of IP addresses.\n\n43\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.210\nNow, if we take a look\nat the router again.\n\n44\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.950\nAnd we'll try to put\nthis into context here.\n\n45\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.080\nSo that we will start up\nwith a basic running config.\n\n46\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.550\nSo that we can see well,\n\n47\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.630\nwhat I'm trying to show you here which\nof course are these IP addresses, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160\nSo notice that I have these different\nIP addresses right here on the screen.\n\n49\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.638\nAnd for GigabitEthernet0/0, 0/1 and 0/2,\n\n50\n00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:26.320\nnotice that these IP addresses\nthat are available to me.\n\n51\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.010\nAll I've got them set up kind of in,\nhopefully a logical order here.\n\n52\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.360\nOne connecting to Atlanta at 0.10,\nthe one connecting to London at 1.10,\n\n53\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.590\nthe one connecting to Seattle at 2.10.\n\n54\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.832\nLets say that I wanted to actually see\nlet's say two out of the three of these,\n\n55\n00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:45.939\nfor the information I wanted.\n\n56\n00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.440\nAt least a brief output of this,\nbut I didn't need the other one.\n\n57\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.190\nSo let's say I'm pretty much satisfied\nwith how one of those ends up being,\n\n58\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.440\nbut I want to verify some information\non these other two instead.\n\n59\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.678\nWell, what I can do is type in,\n\n60\n00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:07.280\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n61\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.830\nAnd now we'll use a pipe command include.\n\n62\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.810\nNow I want to do an IP address.\n\n63\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.043\nNow as I do this IP address, notice\ndown here at the bottom of the screen in\n\n64\n00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:19.730\nthe black here, that's where I'm typing.\n\n65\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.570\nIf I go ahead and just try and\ntype out the numbers, it will work, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.263\nBut what I need to do is that I need\nto tell it to actually look for 192.\n\n67\n00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:30.760\nBecause I'm looking for a pattern.\n\n68\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.948\nI'm not looking for\nwhat's just on the screen.\n\n69\n00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:36.202\nBut I'm looking for\na pattern which includes,\n\n70\n00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:39.440\nwell, even the actual dot here, right?\n\n71\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.120\nSo 192\\.168, so I need to include\nthat escape character, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.672\nIf I don't include the escape character,\n\n73\n00:03:46.672 --> 00:03:49.353\nthe dot looks like one of those special\nsymbols and regular expressions.\n\n74\n00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.670\n&gt;&gt; So it's looking for\nany old thing under the sun.\n\n75\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything else under the sun.\n\n76\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.510\nBut I want it to actually look for\nthe dot instead.\n\n77\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.400\nSo this is where we are going to pick up.\n\n78\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.360\nLet's say that I wanted to look at\nthe first two but not at the zero dot.\n\n79\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.250\nWell I have a couple of options\nthat I can do here, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.100\nSo I can actually do a, let's do it\nthis way, let's do a range here.\n\n81\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.826\nI'm gonna use the square brackets and\nI'm gonna do [1-2 and then close that one.\n\n82\n00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:24.820\nAnd then after that, another dot and\nthen I can end with a .10.\n\n83\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.147\nNow, before I press Enter on this,\n\n84\n00:04:27.147 --> 00:04:32.203\nI wanna make sure that we do understand\nwhat the output should be here, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:36.260\nSo I should see what I normally\nsee in the show interface brief.\n\n86\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.603\nBut instead it should limit me to well,\nthe 1,\n\n87\n00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:47.800\nwhich is Ethernet0/1, and\nof course the 2 dot on interface 0/2.\n\n88\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.880\nAnd then of course anything\nthat ends in 10, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.200\nIf this is your first time doing this,\nyou may not get it exactly right.\n\n90\n00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.073\nYou wanna try, right?\n\n91\n00:04:57.073 --> 00:05:00.320\nGive yourself a little bit\nof freedom to try here.\n\n92\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.674\nMake sure at the very end here you\ndo not also add in an extra space.\n\n93\n00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:09.870\nIf you add in a space that's also\nconsidered a character as well.\n\n94\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.020\nSo make sure at the very\nend you press Enter, oops!\n\n95\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.811\nAnd I hope that I should be able\nto spell the word show correctly.\n\n96\n00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:16.460\nAnd how is that?\n\n97\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.280\nThat actually is what got me there.\n\n98\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.514\nSo interface brief, and\nin our lab environment,\n\n99\n00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.826\nit does not allow us to use the up arrow,\nwhich I would love to have.\n\n100\n00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.250\nBut it's fine.\n\n101\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.824\nWe can do without it.\n\n102\n00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:34.779\nIt just means I have to improve my\ntyping skills a little bit more.\n\n103\n00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.251\nBack in here.\n\n104\n00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:42.318\nSo [-1-2, And\n\n105\n00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:45.680\nthen .10, press Enter.\n\n106\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.700\nAnd now there we go.\n\n107\n00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.169\nWe can now see where I was\nlimiting myself to 0/1 and 0/2.\n\n108\n00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.257\nNotice it was just not the other one\nwhich is the standard one that I always\n\n109\n00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:58.160\nuse here.\n\n110\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.070\nProbably one of the most popular\ncommands I normally used,\n\n111\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.860\nshow ip interface brief, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.669\nSo, here's a comparison which allows\nme to filter out a lot of the noise.\n\n113\n00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.386\nSo if you happen to see something\nthat looks fairly similar to this,\n\n114\n00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:19.660\nnotice you are able to do that.\n\n115\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:26.990\nNow what if I wanted to see the interfaces\nof 0 and 2 instead and leave 1 out?\n\n116\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.340\nThe 1 right in the middle.\n\n117\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.400\nIs there a way I can do that?\n\n118\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.750\nThere is, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.890\nSo it's pretty much the same thing,\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n120\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.310\nAnd then, we do the include,\ngonna be 192 and\n\n121\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.460\nI need the .168 and the period.\n\n122\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.013\nAnd then this time,\ninside of the square brackets instead,\n\n123\n00:06:59.013 --> 00:07:03.649\nI just type in a 1 or 01, let's do that.\n\n124\n00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:08.410\nAnd we'll talk about it here\njust briefly to make sure.\n\n125\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.246\nSo down at the bottom edge of the screen,\nas we take a look right here,\n\n126\n00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:15.753\nnotice this time I did not include\nthe dash which meant inside of\n\n127\n00:07:15.753 --> 00:07:17.295\nthe range of what I wanted.\n\n128\n00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:22.030\nBut this now says, either one of\nthose should be able to show up.\n\n129\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.574\nSo that's why I like\nthese square brackets.\n\n130\n00:07:23.574 --> 00:07:27.025\nCuz you can either do an entire\nrange if you want to, or\n\n131\n00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:31.320\nyou can actually just do one of\nthese if you choose to, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.340\nSo once again,\nmake sure you do not put a space after it.\n\n133\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.750\nAnd then press Enter.\n\n134\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.469\nAnd now notice that in comparison\nto what we had before,\n\n135\n00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:45.234\nwhich is the output that we saw right\nup here, which gave me that range.\n\n136\n00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:50.269\nIt might also be where you\nmight see this one in step.\n\n137\n00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:55.713\nNow Daniel as we kind of try to help out\nand help focus in on the exam again,\n\n138\n00:07:55.713 --> 00:07:58.947\nI can see two possibilities here, right?\n\n139\n00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:01.475\nSo let's take from the example, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:04.316\nAnd I can't tell you this is on the exam,\nbecause it's not on the exam.\n\n141\n00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:07.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I could see something like this,\n\n142\n00:08:07.284 --> 00:08:07.786\nokay.\n\n143\n00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:08.950\nWhere it's a possibility.\n\n144\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.450\nMaybe even on a practice question,\n\n145\n00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.790\nthat you might see which of\nthe following would be the output?\n\n146\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.900\nSo let's say for an example,\nyou might see that hey, here's A.\n\n147\n00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.540\nHere's an output, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.847\nYou might see B,\nas being the output that looks like this.\n\n149\n00:08:25.847 --> 00:08:29.505\nYou might see C, as being the output\nthat looks like this, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:32.242\nAnd they ask you, which of the command?\n\n151\n00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:33.096\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n152\n00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.475\n&gt;&gt; Which option do you\nhave that comes out, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:35.075\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n154\n00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:38.795\n&gt;&gt; So, again, can't tell you it's on the\nexam, but I can tell you that it's very\n\n155\n00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:41.835\npossible that you could see\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:43.835\nThe other portion is also,\n\n157\n00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:46.690\nsomething else that you might have\nto be able to interpret as well.\n\n158\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.902\nWhich is the backward way, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:52.770\nIn other words, they might just\nshow you an output like this.\n\n160\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:59.607\nAnd give you a couple of examples of,\nyou know.\n\n161\n00:08:59.607 --> 00:09:01.740\nThe regular expression type of output.\n\n162\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.740\n&gt;&gt; So one way or the other,\n\n163\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.540\nyou gotta be able to, interpret what it is\nyour looking at and go, I can deduce that,\n\n164\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.250\nthis was the proper output or input that\ncaused this, what they're giving us.\n\n165\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, so regardless of what they give\nyou as a tool that you'll use, whether\n\n166\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.740\nit's a router or whether you're using\nwire or sure what you're looking for.\n\n167\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.960\nMake sure you kind of see\nwhat's going on there.\n\n168\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.590\nSo, there not gonna give you so\nmuch where it's gonna overwhelm you,\n\n169\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.720\nit's enough that, remember that because\nof the way the exams tend to work out,\n\n170\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.800\nit's still about a minute per question.\n\n171\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.910\nSo, they're not gonna give you five\nminutes or ten minutes of analysis and\n\n172\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.945\ngo, make a quick decision on these.\n\n173\n00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:42.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are going\n\n174\n00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:46.169\nto give you about a minute, you know\nabout forty five seconds worth analysis,\n\n175\n00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.505\nso that you can pick the right answer or\nit is primary or about 30 seconds and\n\n176\n00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.093\nthen you can pick the right answer.\n\n177\n00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:55.940\nBut that is kind of the the idea at\nleast of what we are talking about to.\n\n178\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.102\nNow the other things that you might also,\nso\n\n179\n00:09:58.102 --> 00:10:00.331\nI you just adding\nan another character here.\n\n180\n00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:05.512\nIf I type in show run, and this is just\nkinda last couple of examples before\n\n181\n00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:11.113\nwe show you an analysis of part of what\nwe wanna show you on regular expressions,\n\n182\n00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:13.860\nis something looks like this.\n\n183\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:19.460\nSo I'm taking the show run- configuration\nwhich I did a spell out there, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.296\nInstead of doing abbreviation,\ntoo many n's\n\n185\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.126\nAnd then piping that into the include,\noops.\n\n186\n00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:37.625\nNow, when we start to take a look at\nthis one, notice the carrot symbol\n\n187\n00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:42.890\nwhich means here is what the beginning\nshould look like, which is IP.\n\n188\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.894\nAnd now notice that there\nis a dash at the end, or\n\n189\n00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:48.810\nan underscore at the end here, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.910\nYou do want to make sure that\nyou pay attention at the end and\n\n191\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.620\nthe result of what you're seeing here,\n\n192\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.860\nbecause if you add in an extra space\nit will not show you anything.\n\n193\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.030\nSo I'm gonna press Enter.\n\n194\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.010\nNow, notice it shows me every\nline that begins with IP.\n\n195\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.700\nRonnie, that's not every\nline that begins with IP.\n\n196\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.240\nI know if you scroll back\nup to the show run command.\n\n197\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.540\nI can still see IP address here, that is\nnot actually doing what I want, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:31.650\nNow, Daniel, I'm going to kind of quiz\nyou here for a moment, just to see, ok?\n\n199\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.290\nSo, here it is, I just showed\nthem the IP showed up here, ok?\n\n200\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.760\nAnd it was this command that\nactually did do that for\n\n201\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.510\nthem, which has at the beginning of\nthe line it should begin with IP but\n\n202\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.610\nyet, I just showed them right here and\n\n203\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.800\nI'm hoping that your eagle eyes will\nspot this is what I'm looking for.\n\n204\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.625\nSo I'm gonna try and line everything\nup to give you, well I'm gonna try.\n\n205\n00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.229\nSo I'm gonna try and lined it up and\nsee if you actually know what might be\n\n206\n00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:02.892\nmissing, why the IP address is not\nshowing, you may not be able to see\n\n207\n00:12:02.892 --> 00:12:04.062\n&gt;&gt; Do you see it?\n\n208\n00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:04.837\n&gt;&gt; I think I do.\n\n209\n00:12:04.837 --> 00:12:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Do you think it's because that line\n\n210\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.670\ndoes not begin with IP,\nit begins with a white space character.\n\n211\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.805\n&gt;&gt; Very good, Daniel.\n\n212\n00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:12.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You, this\n\n213\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.066\n&gt;&gt; Don't stop.\n\n214\n00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.156\n&gt;&gt; This question will not throw you,\nbut it quite\n\n215\n00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:18.167\nthrow me at the very beginning while\n&gt;&gt; You know\n\n216\n00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:19.350\nwhat\n&gt;&gt; at looking at it.\n\n217\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.352\nI can't believe this.\n\n218\n00:12:20.352 --> 00:12:23.150\n&gt;&gt; I probably would have gotten\ntaken by that question as well.\n\n219\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.627\n&gt;&gt; So, it's one of these things where\nyou're looking at it going wait a minute,\n\n220\n00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:29.067\nI know that there's IP lines up here,\nwe did see that.\n\n221\n00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:31.840\nThere's that IP set that it talked about.\n\n222\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.100\nBut why aren't the IP\naddresses showing up?\n\n223\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.830\nIt is because, right here,\nthere is a white space.\n\n224\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.880\nSo how do I account for\nthat to make everything show up,\n\n225\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.930\nin the way that I thought\nit was going to show up.\n\n226\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.370\nOnce again, we do our show,\nrunning-config,\n\n227\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.880\nand we pipe that right\nback into the include.\n\n228\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.980\nThen, I'm just going to say, look, I don't\ncare what shows up in front of itself.\n\n229\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.220\nI could try and use,\nwe didn't talk about this one,\n\n230\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:09.320\nbut I think it's Backslash lower case S or\nsomething for white space.\n\n231\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:09.990\nWhatever it might be.\n\n232\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.790\nI'm going to use the asterisk.\n\n233\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.160\nLook I don't care what\nit shows up right here.\n\n234\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.030\nBut at the very beginning here,\noops I need one more, okay.\n\n235\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.630\nSo let me do that first.\n\n236\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.760\nThe caret which is at the beginning,\nanything else, and\n\n237\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.880\nthen IP is what we're taking a look at.\n\n238\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.110\nAnd then, of course, anything after that.\n\n239\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.070\nRemember no space is key.\n\n240\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.350\nPress enter.\n\n241\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.030\nAnd now let's see, what did I, oops.\n\n242\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.116\nHold on, I did.\n\n243\n00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:41.776\nOops, I did too many commands\nwithout the space here.\n\n244\n00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:44.023\nSo, show running-config.\n\n245\n00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.280\nI got a typo here, it says.\n\n246\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.191\nThat couldn't be empty, so.\n\n247\n00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:51.990\nInclude and I need to do this and a space.\n\n248\n00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.170\nThat's what I needed.\n\n249\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.210\nAnd then anything that may follow IP.\n\n250\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.240\nThere we go, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.730\nIt was just me,\nmissing a space at this point.\n\n252\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.130\nAnd that brings us to another possibility,\nDaniel.\n\n253\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.940\nThat we may also see.\n\n254\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.080\nSo, here it is Daniel.\n\n255\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.080\nLet's take a look at these 2 right here.\n\n256\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.210\nSo, ignore the error in between.\n\n257\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.791\nThose are the ones that I caused here.\n\n258\n00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So on this one, they look identical,\n\n259\n00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:18.930\nDaniel.\n\n260\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.175\nIf I were looking at them, I would say\nthat they look exactly identical, but\n\n261\n00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:25.285\ndo you see the difference though?\n\n262\n00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:27.365\nOkay, do you see what's happening,\nthe first line,\n\n263\n00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:29.085\nand last line that I highlighted.\n\n264\n00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:29.745\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking Ronnie.\n\n265\n00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThis is not easy stuff right.\n\n266\n00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.899\n&gt;&gt; I know right, this is not easy stuff.\n\n267\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.340\nThere's a space.\n\n268\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.400\n&gt;&gt; There is a space.\n\n269\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.130\n&gt;&gt; There is a space.\n\n270\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.650\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n271\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.920\nIt's just as simple as that,\n\n272\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.380\nthat sometimes you might see that,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n273\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.540\na space is the difference between a right\nanswer and a wrong answer on the exam.\n\n274\n00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.980\n&gt;&gt; It's an actual character\nwithin the system, right?\n\n275\n00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.150\nIf I hit the spacebar, it makes a little\nwhite space that you don't see, but\n\n276\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:57.270\nthere is something there to the computer,\nthat signifies go over another one.\n\n277\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.990\nThere's something there.\n\n278\n00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.470\nYou just don't see anything.\n\n279\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's kind of another key\nelement that you could see where I think.\n\n280\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.354\n&gt;&gt; This killed me in coding.\n\n281\n00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:08.375\nOnce you start writing a program or\na script or something like that,\n\n282\n00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:10.230\nwhite spaces will murder you every time.\n\n283\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.480\nWhy isn't this running?\n\n284\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.160\nWhy isn't this working?\n\n285\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.510\nThere's a white space character,\nthat I didn't see was there.\n\n286\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.720\nAnd some editors will allow you to\nturn that on, and be able to see.\n\n287\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.440\nIt'll highlight the fact\nthere's a white space.\n\n288\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.340\nAnd that becomes very very helpful,\nespecially when you're trying to look for\n\n289\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.790\nthings like what Ronnie\nis showing right now.\n\n290\n00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.790\nSo if you are using an editor\nthat allows that, or\n\n291\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.480\na command line that does allow that,\ndefinitely take advantage of that.\n\n292\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Daniel,\nI've been promising this now for\n\n293\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.350\nthe last episode and\nthe beginning of this episode.\n\n294\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.270\nAs we move into the field of\nan analyst that would be working\n\n295\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.330\nat a security operation center,\nwhen in the world will we use this?\n\n296\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.010\nYou can use it with don't get me wrong,\n\n297\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.694\nthat's probably kinda\nthe most common thing.\n\n298\n00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:56.213\nAnd as your utilities come up, but more\nthan likely it's right here in something\n\n299\n00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:59.146\nlike Wireshark that we can\nalso see its benefit too.\n\n300\n00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:05.807\nInside of this play filter, if I know\nexactly what I'm looking for such as http.\n\n301\n00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:10.490\nIt is easy enough, I can pull that\ninformation up and there it is.\n\n302\n00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.749\nI am now ready to go and\nthat brings me at least to see a thing is.\n\n303\n00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:21.498\nYeah, so Daniel now I've kind of\neliminated all of the noise and\n\n304\n00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:24.902\nI am actually only displaying 1,052 rows.\n\n305\n00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:27.218\n&gt;&gt; You seem to be able to eat right\nthrough that Ronnie, good luck.\n\n306\n00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:30.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so we can see that this\n\n307\n00:16:30.092 --> 00:16:34.230\ngood, so I need to actually kind of\neliminate this a little bit more.\n\n308\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.610\n&gt;&gt; So if I were to do something like this,\nlet me go ahead and eliminate this also,\n\n309\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.230\nnot only using HTTP, but\nalso by a destination address.\n\n310\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.820\nSo here we're not using any\nregular expressions, so\n\n311\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:50.800\nnotice I can do the same thing ip.dst.\n\n312\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.082\nAnd then I know that there is 10.10.100,\nI see it right there, .139.\n\n313\n00:16:57.082 --> 00:17:01.763\nSo I'm picking on this one right here,\nI was just looking down like okay,\n\n314\n00:17:01.763 --> 00:17:03.520\nlet me use that okay?\n\n315\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.521\nSo let's say that I'm going\nto only look for those.\n\n316\n00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:10.912\nWell, that seems logical enough,\nokay, so I'm good.\n\n317\n00:17:10.912 --> 00:17:15.637\nOkay, so if I know the information\nthat's brought we down to 611,\n\n318\n00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:20.085\nthat is pretty decent here, okay,\nif I want to actually do this.\n\n319\n00:17:20.085 --> 00:17:23.460\nBut as I start looking, and one of the\nthings that of course you start looking\n\n320\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.790\nfor as an analyst, right,\nare patterns that are beginning to emerge.\n\n321\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.721\nNo big deal that everybody\nhits the same web server.\n\n322\n00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:35.350\nHow many IP addresses, could be hundreds,\ncould be thousands, for all that we know.\n\n323\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.620\nBut now if I start to look around and\nI start to see something here.\n\n324\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.382\nOkay, let's say that\nwe'll pick on this one.\n\n325\n00:17:42.382 --> 00:17:48.154\nOkay, 173.194.113.191.\n\n326\n00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:53.122\nOkay, I'm starting to see a pattern that\nthis guy is actually getting hit just in\n\n327\n00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:55.762\nmy frame so far, pretty decently, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:55.762 --> 00:18:01.528\nSo if I started to see a lot\nof those multiple things here,\n\n329\n00:18:01.528 --> 00:18:06.344\nI can now go ahead and\nalso add in, and ip.src.\n\n330\n00:18:06.344 --> 00:18:07.870\nLet me see if I can scroll in, sorry.\n\n331\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.247\nI didn't mean to leave you all in\nthe dark there, it's what happens.\n\n332\n00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:12.997\nThis thing is tiny, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:12.997 --> 00:18:20.034\nip.src::173.194.113, which\n\n334\n00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:28.132\nmy fingers won't allow me\nto type in [LAUGH] and 191.\n\n335\n00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:31.350\nAll right, hey, look at that, Daniel.\n\n336\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.610\nI've kind of pretty much\nisolated down pretty good now.\n\n337\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:40.350\nOn this one now,\nI can actually see probably, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.114\nNow don't get me wrong, it's not a lot but\nit was one that I had actually picked out,\n\n339\n00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:46.410\nthat would fit on screen,\nthat's what I wanna do.\n\n340\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I went from 1,000 whatever it was,\n\n341\n00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:49.977\n52, right?\n\n342\n00:18:49.977 --> 00:18:50.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n343\n00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:53.752\n&gt;&gt; Now down to, it says five,\nis what it actually says.\n\n344\n00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:58.170\n&gt;&gt; That may be more manageable-\n&gt;&gt; A little bit more manageable, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:03.160\nBut notice Daniel that that took\nme three searches [INAUDIBLE].\n\n346\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.314\nOkay, don't get me wrong.\n\n347\n00:19:04.314 --> 00:19:08.113\nIt works and it's faster than I\nwould be if I had manually gone,\n\n348\n00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:13.000\nlet me count these up one at a time and\ntry and figure this out here.\n\n349\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.530\nBut there's actually a better way and\nbecause it actually does take less,\n\n350\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.150\nat the same time it generates the same\ninformation for us that we want to.\n\n351\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.962\nBut this is why we want this, right?\n\n352\n00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:27.165\nThe point here is it works great,\nif we do this,\n\n353\n00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:31.100\nas long as we know exactly\nwhat we're looking for, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.552\nBut remember that in analysis sometimes,\n\n355\n00:19:33.552 --> 00:19:36.830\nwe don't know that it's\nexactly what we look for.\n\n356\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.810\nAnd now, let's say this one\ndoesn't lead us anywhere.\n\n357\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.846\nWell notice, Daniel,\ntake a look at this, I got an okay.\n\n358\n00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:42.904\n&gt;&gt; You got an okay.\n\n359\n00:19:42.904 --> 00:19:43.920\n&gt;&gt; I got something that's found.\n\n360\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:49.355\n&gt;&gt; I'm not really, probably analyst,\nprobably they're gonna waste tons of\n\n362\n00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:52.630\ntime doing this But\nit was an elimination process.\n\n363\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:57.240\nI tried, and now I gotta go back,\nessentially, kinda back\n\n364\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.980\nto the beginning and, what, start all\nover again and look for the next one.\n\n365\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.649\nAnd do that again and then, look,\nanother one, found okay, found, okay,\n\n366\n00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:07.197\nspurious transmission.\n\n367\n00:20:07.197 --> 00:20:09.091\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, let me go back and\n\n368\n00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:10.420\ndo another one.\n\n369\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.870\nSo what if we could eliminate\nthat a little bit more?\n\n370\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.460\nIf there is more uncertainty,\n\n371\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.520\nwhich is probably what an analyst\ndeals with more often that not.\n\n372\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.980\nIf there is more uncertainty for\nus to deal with,\n\n373\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.702\nthen we may wanna use a regular\nexpression, that will allow me to do what?\n\n374\n00:20:25.702 --> 00:20:27.660\nRemember that range that we talked about?\n\n375\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.090\nThat zero or one dash two?\n\n376\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:36.070\nAdding that in, now I can actually\nfind out multiple sources and multiple\n\n377\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:41.220\ndestinations if I need to and bring\nthat particular power in to help us out.\n\n378\n00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.750\nSo we're not gonna\na tone of examples here,\n\n379\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.130\nbut we want to do a few of them, okay?\n\n380\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.320\nOr at least two of them,\nthat's what I have.\n\n381\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.570\nSo I'm gonna get rid of that\nentire line that we have.\n\n382\n00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.030\nAnd now let's go ahead and\ndo this instead.\n\n383\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.880\nSo I'm not gonna even worry\nabout the HTTP at this point.\n\n384\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.560\nLet me put everything back here and\ntell it to run.\n\n385\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.350\nGet everything back before we start.\n\n386\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.410\nNow hopefully I'll be able\nto go into the filter.\n\n387\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:15.810\nAnd right now I'm just going to type\nin ip.src, okay, and I've already\n\n388\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:21.410\nkind of given a couple of them here, so\nwe'll just do that for right now, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.200\nSo let's take a look at what we have now.\n\n390\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.534\nNow if you're going, Ronnie, I'm not gonna\nbe able to build this particular match.\n\n391\n00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:32.443\nRemember that the exam doesn't\ncall you out to build it, it calls\n\n392\n00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:37.365\nyou to recognize what it is that we might\nactually end up wanting to do here, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:43.480\nSo at this point, I'm telling it that\nthe source host, the IP source address,\n\n394\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.850\nshould match one of two different\npossibilities here, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.543\nNotice it begins the same way,\nthe 173\\.194\\.113,\n\n396\n00:21:53.543 --> 00:21:56.423\nincluding of course the dots in between,\n\n397\n00:21:56.423 --> 00:22:01.381\nbut notice the last octet in which\nthere's a couple of different ones.\n\n398\n00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:06.369\nI have a 169 which actually does\nappear in here a little bit further\n\n399\n00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:08.340\ndown the line here.\n\n400\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.247\nAnd I also have the possibility of a,\n\n401\n00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:19.694\nit's actually probably 161 or\na 164, or a 191, or 194.\n\n402\n00:22:19.694 --> 00:22:22.387\nI have those different possibilities,\nokay?\n\n403\n00:22:22.387 --> 00:22:26.661\nSo let's take a look at what we\nmight be able to find from just\n\n404\n00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:28.290\nsomething like this.\n\n405\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:32.638\nAll right, so\nnow when we take a look at the source,\n\n406\n00:22:32.638 --> 00:22:37.610\nnow notice what it gives me and\nwhat's on display, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:42.493\nSo notice it gives me two different IP\naddresses that allows me to take a look\n\n408\n00:22:42.493 --> 00:22:45.370\nat a little bit more information.\n\n409\n00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.260\nLet's scroll on down.\n\n410\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.210\nI'm trying to see if there's another\nIP address in there, but nope,\n\n411\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.613\nthat actually does work, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:54.090\nSo those are the numbers\nthat we are getting.\n\n413\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.845\nSo instead of me doing two separate\nsearches just based on source, I was able\n\n414\n00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:03.472\nto essentially take the combination\nof information that we had learned.\n\n415\n00:23:03.472 --> 00:23:08.890\nYou do not have to type in these\nquotation marks up here at the top.\n\n416\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:16.170\nWhen you use Wireshark's expression\nbuilder, it will actually allow you\n\n417\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:21.510\nto do this, where you essentially pick the\nprotocol over here on the left hand side.\n\n418\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.281\nAnd then you say matches instead\nof an equal to or not equal to.\n\n419\n00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:28.210\nAnd then you type in\nthe value that you want.\n\n420\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.170\nAnd this is where you would\nenter your regular expression in\n\n421\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.200\nif you were doing this, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.173\nSo this is something that I did want to\nactually at least show you in terms of\n\n423\n00:23:37.173 --> 00:23:38.275\nthe output, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:38.275 --> 00:23:42.875\nNow it is possible where they may\nshow you a line like this, and ask,\n\n425\n00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:47.424\nwhat is the possible output on this\nthat you have available to you?\n\n426\n00:23:47.424 --> 00:23:52.268\nThe other thing is, remember that we can\nactually kind of eliminate this a little\n\n427\n00:23:52.268 --> 00:23:55.275\nbit more by simply adding\nin the protocol as well.\n\n428\n00:23:55.275 --> 00:23:56.912\nAnd now we are kind of down.\n\n429\n00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:59.796\nI added in TCP, so that we could see that.\n\n430\n00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:01.392\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n431\n00:24:01.392 --> 00:24:03.525\nAnd at this point, lets see.\n\n432\n00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:08.552\nYeah, so we're now to a little bit\nless in the numbers and the protocol.\n\n433\n00:24:08.552 --> 00:24:12.391\nSo, it also allowed us to do that.\n\n434\n00:24:12.391 --> 00:24:16.602\nSo, imagine as you keep adding this in and\npart of this is that filter.\n\n435\n00:24:16.602 --> 00:24:17.831\nWell, this is what you can do.\n\n436\n00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:23.143\nYou can go ahead and add this in and\nit helps you out by being able to do that.\n\n437\n00:24:23.143 --> 00:24:25.920\nSo, a little bit more fuzzy\nthan a direct search and\n\n438\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.451\nmaking sure that we know\nexactly what we want.\n\n439\n00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:30.714\nBut if I'm analyzing the capture,\n\n440\n00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:34.567\nI may not be pinpointing exactly\nright away which one I want.\n\n441\n00:24:34.567 --> 00:24:36.123\nBut I go on, these two addresses.\n\n442\n00:24:36.123 --> 00:24:39.190\nThey seem to be hitting this\nweb server pretty hard and\n\n443\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.529\nit's all part of the same\nsequence of events or it's all,\n\n444\n00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:46.702\nas I start looking at the port numbers,\nthey're all exactly matching.\n\n445\n00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:51.242\nThey're doing that I know this is part\nof the same stream, then it allows us\n\n446\n00:24:51.242 --> 00:24:55.081\nto do that with one search and\nthat's pretty much the key here.\n\n447\n00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:58.880\nSo, don't take regular expressions for\ngranted.\n\n448\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.583\nDon't take them for\ngranted on the exam, especially.\n\n449\n00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:02.513\n&gt;&gt; And don't take them lightly.\n\n450\n00:25:02.513 --> 00:25:04.399\n&gt;&gt; Don't take them lightly, either.\n\n451\n00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:07.150\nNow, I wanna point out one\nother resource for you.\n\n452\n00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.006\nIf I can find it again,\nsee if I can bring that.\n\n453\n00:25:11.006 --> 00:25:12.102\nThere we go.\n\n454\n00:25:12.102 --> 00:25:15.369\nSo, this is a good one for\nyou to begin with.\n\n455\n00:25:15.369 --> 00:25:18.595\nBut if you really want to\nget to using it regularly,\n\n456\n00:25:18.595 --> 00:25:23.411\nhere is kind of the one that I remember\nDon and I are talking about at one time.\n\n457\n00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:29.910\nAnd he said this on, I think our Linux\nplus show at some point, RegexOne.\n\n458\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.087\nI like this site.\n\n459\n00:25:31.087 --> 00:25:33.521\nIf you haven't gone through it,\nit's very readable.\n\n460\n00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:36.608\nAnd then at the bottom,\nit immediately tests you on it.\n\n461\n00:25:36.608 --> 00:25:38.791\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So notice like right here, if you go,\n\n462\n00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:40.813\nall right, we're working on letters here.\n\n463\n00:25:40.813 --> 00:25:42.702\nAbc, there you go.\n\n464\n00:25:42.702 --> 00:25:45.640\nIf they all turn green,\nyou know that it's actually worked.\n\n465\n00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.710\nBut the last thing that I also wanted\nto mention is case sensitivity matters.\n\n466\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.850\nNotice if I type in abc here,\nit's not going to work.\n\n467\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.766\nSo again,\nthings encountered that you might see and\n\n468\n00:25:57.766 --> 00:26:00.361\nthis one takes you\nthrough multiple lessons.\n\n469\n00:26:00.361 --> 00:26:04.208\nEach one of these that you see\nover here on the right-hand side,\n\n470\n00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:07.923\nall of these are individual\nlessons that can help you better.\n\n471\n00:26:07.923 --> 00:26:11.270\nSo whether you're using grep,\nwhether you're using Wireshark,\n\n472\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.204\nwhether you're using just about anything\nthat you can possibly do a search in,\n\n473\n00:26:15.204 --> 00:26:18.962\nyou can just about find a use of regular\nexpressions there to help you out that\n\n474\n00:26:18.962 --> 00:26:21.780\nwill give you the proper\nsearch that you want.\n\n475\n00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.954\nOn the CISCO exam,\nit is about interpreting them.\n\n476\n00:26:24.954 --> 00:26:30.582\nAnd so if you overlooked this, this is\na good chance that you're gonna miss some\n\n477\n00:26:30.582 --> 00:26:37.051\npoints just by overlooking it instead of\nspending an extra half and hour or hour.\n\n478\n00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:39.667\nI wanna be able to identify\nsome of these things and\n\n479\n00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:41.484\nmake sure that I feel good on them.\n\n480\n00:26:41.484 --> 00:26:43.922\nSo there's at least a few examples\nsamples that you've seen,\n\n481\n00:26:43.922 --> 00:26:46.232\nit just means that you've got\nto study a little bit harder.\n\n482\n00:26:46.232 --> 00:26:48.452\nI know you don't want to study\na little bit harder than you want.\n\n483\n00:26:48.452 --> 00:26:50.554\nBut at the same time, it's worth it.\n\n484\n00:26:50.554 --> 00:26:52.003\nThis can only help you in the future for\n\n485\n00:26:52.003 --> 00:26:54.327\neverything else that you're\ngonna be doing with security.\n\n486\n00:26:54.327 --> 00:26:57.120\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you hit the nail on\nthe head with that last statement.\n\n487\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.472\nIt says, it's a 100% true just\nlearning I know it's a bear.\n\n488\n00:27:00.472 --> 00:27:03.711\nWe've been kind of harping on that fact\nthat it can be extremely difficult.\n\n489\n00:27:03.711 --> 00:27:06.235\nThere's a lot to memorize\nwhen it comes to this.\n\n490\n00:27:06.235 --> 00:27:09.276\nAnd unfortunately,\nit can just end up being a lot of rote\n\n491\n00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:12.981\nmemorization just trying to hammer\nthat away inside of your brain.\n\n492\n00:27:12.981 --> 00:27:16.251\nBut if you do, if you get that down, man,\n\n493\n00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:20.654\nyou are definitely a man amongst\nmen as they like to say.\n\n494\n00:27:20.654 --> 00:27:21.928\nA step above the rest,\n\n495\n00:27:21.928 --> 00:27:26.167\nbecause you are in command of something\nthat a lot of people struggle with.\n\n496\n00:27:26.167 --> 00:27:27.829\nSo, definitely just hunker down.\n\n497\n00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:28.915\nBear with it and get through it.\n\n498\n00:27:28.915 --> 00:27:31.155\nAnd once you do,\nit's gonna help you out a lot.\n\n499\n00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:34.780\nRonnie, thanks so much for\nexplaining regular expression to us, so\n\n500\n00:27:34.780 -->

All right, greetings everyone, welcome\nback to another great episode of ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:17.775\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.295\nin today's episode we're back with\nmore on our Cisco SECOPS series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:24.555\nIt's been a very interesting series so\nfar and it's just gonna get more and\n\n7\n00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:25.985\nmore interesting, a lot of fun.\n\n8\n00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:29.585\nJoining us back in the studio, our good\nfriend and mentor Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:31.155\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you here again.\n\n10\n00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:31.825\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:33.715\n&gt;&gt; It is going well,\nthank you again, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.635\nAs we continue on in our\njourney through SECOPS and\n\n13\n00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:41.150\nnow I'm glad to have you along because\nwe are heading into that kind of really\n\n14\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.240\nexciting area of the nature of this,\nwhich of course are protocol headers.\n\n15\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.360\nAnd that means we are actually\nexamining some protocol headers.\n\n16\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.690\n&gt;&gt; Well you go ahead and start talking\nabout that, I left my oven on or\n\n17\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.600\nsomething, I'll be back, I swear.\n\n18\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.815\nJust if I'm not back,\njust finish up without me.\n\n19\n00:00:56.815 --> 00:00:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's a lot of details here, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.351\n&gt;&gt; And like you and I right,\nwe read so much information,\n\n22\n00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.076\nwe think that we can memorize everything.\n\n23\n00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:08.161\nBut when it comes down to it,\nwe can look at the same diagram, and\n\n24\n00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.691\nthen 30 minutes later go\n[SOUND] I don't remember.\n\n25\n00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:14.085\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Egyptian hieroglyphics wrapped\n\n26\n00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:15.341\nin Sanskrit.\n\n27\n00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.063\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And to me, that's what a lot of\n\n28\n00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:23.135\ninspecting and taking a look at protocol\nheaders really does end up looking like.\n\n29\n00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:24.715\nIt doesn't mean that we\ndon't understand it, but\n\n30\n00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:29.125\nit means it takes a lot of time and\nit takes that experience, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:33.450\nSo what we're about to show you today\nof course is not about you becoming\n\n32\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.270\nan expert in protocol header analysis.\n\n33\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.470\nBut it's actually about you\nlearning how to interpret\n\n34\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.580\nwhat you end up seeing from\nsome type of analysis of this.\n\n35\n00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.630\nSo that is what we're really focusing on.\n\n36\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.330\nNow just when I say that Daniel,\neverybody's going, Ronnie is about to\n\n37\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.318\nkind of really lecture which means it's\ntime to turn the channel right now.\n\n38\n00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:57.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's turn on to channel.\n\n39\n00:01:57.702 --> 00:01:59.172\nWe gotta do a little bit, I can-\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n\n40\n00:01:59.172 --> 00:01:59.973\nYou're jazzing it up, right?\n\n41\n00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:01.626\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Throw a little spice in it.\n\n42\n00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:05.507\n&gt;&gt; We're actually going to show you\na couple of the things which I hope will\n\n43\n00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:09.300\nhelp us out to understand at\nleast what we're looking at here.\n\n44\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.550\nAnd a lot of it actually comes down to,\nwell, different attacks that we're gonna\n\n45\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.815\nbe performing during this show,\nso we're gonna see this, and\n\n46\n00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:20.410\nthis may actually take us two or\nthree episodes for us to be able to do.\n\n47\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.899\nBut it is a lot of information,\nso I don't wanna rush through it,\n\n48\n00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.090\njust go, okay,, that's no big deal.\n\n49\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.686\nI want us to make sure that we take\na look at that inspection of it and\n\n50\n00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.305\nwe're also gonna be doing the attacks.\n\n51\n00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.553\nSo, some of the attacks that\nwe're gonna be doing, Daniel,\n\n52\n00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:39.760\nin at least this little miniseries\npart as we get started here, right?\n\n53\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.150\nWe're gonna take a look at the idea\nof a CAM table exhaustion.\n\n54\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.670\nWe're at least gonna\nshow you the attack side.\n\n55\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.417\nAnd the reason why is I can't virtualize\nan actual switch to make it work.\n\n56\n00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:52.570\nIf I could I would be making more money.\n\n57\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On this planet than anybody else\n\n58\n00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:56.353\naround here if I could ever figure\nout how to virtualize a switch.\n\n59\n00:02:56.353 --> 00:02:57.570\n&gt;&gt; You gotta get to work yeah.\n\n60\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.110\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, I'm not that smart so\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n61\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.370\nBut we are gonna show you at least the\nattack of it and show you the results so\n\n62\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.285\nthat we can analyze that.\n\n63\n00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:08.566\nWe're also gonna take a look of course\nat doing an ARP table attack or\n\n64\n00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:13.371\nan ARP spoofing attack, and then we're\ngonna take a look at DHCP exhaust and\n\n65\n00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.416\nwe'll show you how that works.\n\n66\n00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:18.950\nWe'll show you how to capture the\ninformation and then of course analyze it.\n\n67\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.360\nSo that you can identify\nthe traffic at the end and\n\n68\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.760\nunderstand the results of\nwhat you're seeing there too,\n\n69\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.390\nand that's kind of the key to\neverything that we're doing, right?\n\n70\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.351\nWhen it comes down to the SECOPS, it's not\nabout you being the master of everything,\n\n71\n00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.388\neven though that's your ultimate\ngoal of what you'll be doing.\n\n72\n00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:40.190\nEverybody, and I'm gonna throw\nDaniel into this as well as myself.\n\n73\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.960\nEverybody wants to grow\nup to be a Don Pezet.\n\n74\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.454\nThat's what we talk about in IT.\n\n75\n00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:46.704\n&gt;&gt; Man, I just look at that man in awe and\nwonder.\n\n76\n00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You wanna have that level of expertise.\n\n77\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's the ultimate goal.\n\n78\n00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.650\nBut can you get it?\n\n79\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.090\nYes, okay.\n\n80\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.455\nCan we help you at least get started and\nunderstand what you're looking at?\n\n81\n00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:57.260\nYes.\n\n82\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.450\nSo that's what this show is\ngoing to hopefully be about.\n\n83\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.284\nAnd that means us taking\napart the technology and\n\n84\n00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.610\nunderstanding what we're taking a look at.\n\n85\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.507\nSo remember that when we start off and\nwhat we're doing here, right,\n\n86\n00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:15.321\nis that we are talking about essentially\nstreams of data that come across devices.\n\n87\n00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.123\nAnd in those streams of data\nit comes across devices,\n\n88\n00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:22.168\nit has to know where it came from it, and\nultimately it has to know where to go,\n\n89\n00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:26.057\nhas to be able to divide up those\npackets that make logical sense somehow.\n\n90\n00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:29.460\nAnd the data itself doesn't do that for\nus, right, Daniel?\n\n91\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.910\nIf you go hey I'm gonna\nsend Ronnie a document,\n\n92\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.750\nthe document doesn't sit there and go,\n\n93\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.340\nI know I'm gonna go ahead as myself as\ndata I'm gonna add in my source address.\n\n94\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.120\nI'm gonna add in, Ronnie's IP address.\n\n95\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.996\nDaniel, what other information do I?\n\n96\n00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:45.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna do it onto to itself.\n\n97\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n98\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.803\nSo the devices that are sending and\n\n99\n00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:53.259\nreceiving add additional information\nonto the data that we have.\n\n100\n00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.680\nAnd that's what we're taking a look at.\n\n101\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.330\nSo when it comes down to\nanalysis a lot of times,\n\n102\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.130\neven though the payload is important,\nultimately it's what we're guarding,\n\n103\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.400\nit's what we wanna protect,\nthat's our asset.\n\n104\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.630\nIt's all those things that\nwe guard with the CIA, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.770\nIt's not what we're looking for.\n\n106\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.148\nWhat we're looking for\nis that data that surrounds it, which for\n\n107\n00:05:13.148 --> 00:05:15.545\nus comes down to well,\n&gt;&gt; Headers.\n\n108\n00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.100\n&gt;&gt; Headers, protocols, you name it.\n\n109\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.100\nThat's what it actually boils down to.\n\n110\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.907\nAnd at the beginning, yeah,\n\n111\n00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:26.998\nat the beginning it's kind of exciting\nto kind of understand and figure out.\n\n112\n00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:30.529\nBut then, figuring out the information and\nthen the information it gives you.\n\n113\n00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.931\nInterpreting the information, it means you\nhave to learn a lot of different stuff\n\n114\n00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.460\nbefore you can even understand\n&gt;&gt; Learn to like minutia.\n\n115\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.241\nThat's gonna help you out with\nthis type of understanding.\n\n116\n00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, learn to like minutia,\nlearn to look at lines of code.\n\n117\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.359\nAnd if you go, no,\nthat's fun, that's great,\n\n118\n00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:47.314\ncuz you're headed in\nthe right direction here.\n\n119\n00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:50.004\nIf you kind of are like me,\nokay, I get the big picture,\n\n120\n00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:51.810\nthat's all I really need to know.\n\n121\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.820\nNot as fun, but it is something that I\nfind that actually can be interesting.\n\n122\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.683\nSo where are we heading,\nat least at the beginning?\n\n123\n00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:03.860\nWell, we're gonna be talking, of course,\nabout the idea of the Ethernet header.\n\n124\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.441\nAnd let's take a look at my screen and\n\n125\n00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:08.204\nthat will help fill us in on what\nwe're normally talking about.\n\n126\n00:06:08.204 --> 00:06:12.740\nNow when we start to see this,\nremember that the data that I was just\n\n127\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.200\ntalking about is right here in this\narea that I marked as payload.\n\n128\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.242\nOkay, now even though this is more\nof your basic CCENT information,\n\n129\n00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:29.039\nit doesn't mean that they won't address\nit on the SECOPS information as well.\n\n130\n00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.261\nI would make sure that I know some of this\ndata, actually I'd make sure I know all\n\n131\n00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:37.190\nthis data is what I would make sure\nthat I understand and know here, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.160\nThe payload tends to be anywhere\nbetween 46 bytes and 1500 bytes.\n\n133\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.255\nAnd that is ultimately what\nwe hope to send to somebody.\n\n134\n00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:49.790\nIs what we normally have, or it's return\ntraffic, whatever it might be, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.290\nAlong with that, for it to be able\nto get from one place to the other,\n\n136\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.850\nit means we also need some\nother information, too.\n\n137\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.090\nAnd the rest of the information we that\nsee all over here on the left-hand side\n\n138\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.270\nand on the right hand side of the payload,\n\n139\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.930\nthat is the information that allows\nthe data to be able to leave your device.\n\n140\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.170\nAnd ultimately know where\nit's going to end up and\n\n141\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.915\nknow how this packet of information or\n\n142\n00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:21.605\nthis frame of information technically,\nokay, is gonna end up as well.\n\n143\n00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:24.095\nAlso remember that at layer 2, okay,\n\n144\n00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:29.262\nthe data is not technically called\na packet, at least in Cisco land.\n\n145\n00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:33.272\nNow do you read about it everywhere\nas being called an Ethernet packet?\n\n146\n00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:35.862\nYou're gonna find it everywhere\non the planet, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:40.225\nBut remember,\ntechnically this is called a frame, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.932\nSo, I know, small details.\n\n149\n00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:45.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But these are the details that really\n\n150\n00:07:45.335 --> 00:07:48.142\ncan get you, so\nwhenever you see the term frame,\n\n151\n00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:52.134\nyou also remember that it relates\nto layer 2 of the OSI model, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:52.134 --> 00:07:55.401\nNow all of that information\nis just cursory and\n\n153\n00:07:55.401 --> 00:08:01.268\nsurrounding what we're really talking\nabout, but it is important information So\n\n154\n00:08:01.268 --> 00:08:05.477\nwhen we start to take a look\nthen at the header information.\n\n155\n00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:08.604\nAnd we start talking about\nethernet header information,\n\n156\n00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:12.410\nwe're talking about layer two\ndata is what it comes down to.\n\n157\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.271\nAnd what we have to be aware of as well,\nokay?\n\n158\n00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:19.936\nAnd all of this essentially is the idea\nof all of the layer two information\n\n159\n00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:22.220\nthat we can actually see.\n\n160\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.120\nNormally, when we take\na look at the information\n\n161\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.830\neven inside the wireshark which we will\ntake a look at a little bit later on.\n\n162\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.830\nWe have a preamble right\nat the beginning here and\n\n163\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.620\nthis is all about the synchronization\nbetween the devices, okay.\n\n164\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.840\nSo when we have data we have eight bits\nof data, a lot of times what ends up\n\n165\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.330\nhappening here is that the, actually\nthis is supposed to be seven bytes.\n\n166\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.698\nI am lying to you guys.\n\n167\n00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:47.424\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look it up.\n\n168\n00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:48.239\n&gt;&gt; Don't start off wrong.\n\n169\n00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:49.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.\n\n170\n00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:50.604\nI absolutely started off right.\n\n171\n00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:51.730\n&gt;&gt; My trust is broken.\n\n172\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I started off at eight because\neverybody has a different opinion.\n\n173\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.110\nSo, some people combine together what\nthey call a preamble and the SOF, or\n\n174\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.960\nthe Start Of Frame together as one,\neight byte.\n\n175\n00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.390\nBut I was trying to figure out\nwhich one should I actually kind of\n\n176\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.900\npresent in this one.\n\n177\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.620\nSo I chose to, let me go and separate\nthis out, but I just didn't change it.\n\n178\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.800\nSo I added in this one\na little bit later on.\n\n179\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.620\nSo this is all about\nsynchronization information.\n\n180\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.520\nAnd then this is the Start Of Frame,\n\n181\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.430\nwhich just actually says look,\nwe need to synchronize.\n\n182\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.420\nBut here's the actual data that you need\nfor it to be able to be delivered, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.980\nSo that's what the Start Of Frame\nsection really is about.\n\n184\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.030\nYou of course have a destination and\nsource.\n\n185\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:37.010\nLet's make sure we pay attention this that\nat the frame, it's not destination and\n\n186\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.270\nsource IP address, it's destination and\nsource MAC address, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.510\nNow if you're going well, how I'm I\ngonna be able to tell the difference?\n\n188\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.950\nWell, make sure you notice the link.\n\n189\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.830\nIf you don't get any other information.\n\n190\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:56.200\nAnd they say hey, how long is the\ndestination address in the ethernet frame?\n\n191\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.210\nWell, you could pick four bytes which\nis only what we'd think about for\n\n192\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.700\nIP address, right?\n\n193\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.520\nFour octets, that's what we'll take.\n\n194\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.052\nBut remember that a MAC address is really,\nfor us here,\n\n195\n00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:11.520\nis actually gonna be 6 bytes\naltogether unless I'm lying too you.\n\n196\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.700\nYep, 24 bits and 24 bits, yeah.\n\n197\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.707\nSo I just wanna make sure.\n\n198\n00:10:14.707 --> 00:10:18.837\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:21.684\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll talk about this a little bit\n\n200\n00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:25.480\nmore, too,\nwhich we'll get into about the fact.\n\n201\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.240\nAnd I'm bringing some A plus up.\n\n202\n00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.080\nI'm trying to not get too far off.\n\n203\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.960\nBut just remember that the MAC address\nis divided into those two parts.\n\n204\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.510\nThat we have the OUI for\nthe vendor information, and then,\n\n205\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.779\nof course, the internally assigned\npart is also there as well, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.370\nSo all that is important.\n\n207\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.590\nOnce everything is kind of wrapped up,\nthen you have the frame check sequence.\n\n208\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.570\nAnd the frame check sequence\nat the end here, and\n\n209\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.570\nwe'll get back to the frame type for\na moment.\n\n210\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.000\nBut let's talk about this frame\ncheck sequence just for the end.\n\n211\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.230\nThis is where the NIC itself identifies\nthat there's transmission errors\n\n212\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.221\nthat have gone on between the sending and\nthe receiving device, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:10.616\nAnd one of the things that they\nwill get you on sometimes,\n\n214\n00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:15.600\nwhich is, on the Frame Type this is\nthe one that's reported in hexadecimal.\n\n215\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.110\nAnd these are the three most popular ones\n\n216\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.810\nthat you want to pay attention\nto right here, okay.\n\n217\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.986\nYour Frame Type will actually tell\nyou what's gonna follow inside of\n\n218\n00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:26.040\nthe Payload, okay.\n\n219\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.294\nIs this IP version 4 information?\n\n220\n00:11:28.294 --> 00:11:31.840\nAnd you're saying,\nwhat does that mean, IP4 Payload?\n\n221\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.903\nWell, we're just showing\nyou the layer two, right?\n\n222\n00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:37.150\nSo I'm not showing you layer three\nheaders inside of it and everything.\n\n223\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.790\nBut what it's saying is what\nshould follow then, right?\n\n224\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.735\nAt layer two, if I have this 0x800 here,\n\n225\n00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:47.629\nthen what should follow is my source and\ndestination IP addresses, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.925\nIf it's the 0x86 DD what should follow,\nmakes sense here,\n\n227\n00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:56.190\nsource and destination IPv6 addresses.\n\n228\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:02.700\nAnd notice if it's actually the 0x806,\nokay, what should follow essentially it's\n\n229\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.680\ngonna be ARP, address resolution protocol,\nbefore anything else gets through, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.530\nThis is the minutiae that\nDaniel has been talking about,\n\n231\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.120\nthat on the exams, will get you.\n\n232\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.890\nAnd there's no other way to put it\nexcept that you've got to memorize them.\n\n233\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.740\nI wish I could say, here's how you'll be\nable to easily identify that this is going\n\n234\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.530\nto be this way.\n\n235\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.494\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of great\nflash card apps out there.\n\n236\n00:12:26.494 --> 00:12:29.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Might I suggest you download one.\n\n237\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.450\nCreate some flashcards and\n\n238\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.630\nhammer this information into your\nbrain until it begs for mercy.\n\n239\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.897\nBecause, like Ronnie is kind of alluding\nto, you need to know each one of these\n\n240\n00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:42.470\ndifferent little portions cuz you never\nknow what they're gonna ask about.\n\n241\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.810\nYou got to be prepared for that.\n\n242\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.481\n&gt;&gt; And that's just the basic information\nthat we need to understand and know before\n\n243\n00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:52.822\nwe head into some of the details about\nwhat's going on at layer two as well.\n\n244\n00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:54.931\nEspecially when it comes\ndown to attacks and\n\n245\n00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:58.130\nsome of the intrusions that\nwe're trying to detect.\n\n246\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.448\nAll right so Daniel, let's talk about\nwhy layer two, just briefly here.\n\n247\n00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:06.293\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Why layer 2 might actually be a target\n\n248\n00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:08.650\nfor an attack, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.170\nSo let me start of with just\na trivial question and Daniel,\n\n250\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.300\nI'm assuming but I'm not gonna expect\nthat you know this or not, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.607\nSo I wrote this down to make sure,\nokay, that I'm telling you.\n\n252\n00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:22.419\nDo you know what layer,\nokay what on the OSI layer, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:27.882\nThat filtering, access control list,\nauthentication and applications controls,\n\n254\n00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:31.788\nprotect or what layers that they\nare actually protecting on?\n\n255\n00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:34.752\n&gt;&gt; Layer four, three, right?\n\n256\n00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:35.675\nI think they do that.\n\n257\n00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:37.113\nYeah, layer three and four.\n\n258\n00:13:37.113 --> 00:13:38.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you wanna know something?\n\n259\n00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:40.580\nIt doesn't matter because not layer two.\n\n260\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what is comes down to.\n\n261\n00:13:41.642 --> 00:13:43.063\n[LAUGH] Trick question.\n\n262\n00:13:43.063 --> 00:13:45.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As long as my answer was not\nlayer two, I was gonna get it right, yeah.\n\n263\n00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:46.754\n&gt;&gt; Trick question.\n\n264\n00:13:46.754 --> 00:13:48.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got me, it was good.\n\n265\n00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:52.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did that on purpose because that's\n\n266\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.202\nwhat we wanna focus in on right here,\nokay, is layer two.\n\n267\n00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:56.290\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n268\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.693\nLearning about all those others and\n\n269\n00:13:57.693 --> 00:13:59.711\nknowing where they occur\nis gonna matter later on.\n\n270\n00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:02.771\nBut for right now,\nwhat you have to know and\n\n271\n00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:06.220\nwhy layer two might be a point of attack.\n\n272\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.880\nWe don't normally get authentication here.\n\n273\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.560\nWe don't get authorization here.\n\n274\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.100\nWe don't get the idea of access control.\n\n275\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.890\nWe don't get application control, you name\nit, it doesn't occur at layer two and\n\n276\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.370\nthat is because its foundation right, is-\n&gt;&gt; Is the sharing.\n\n277\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all I'm really here to do\nis get it from point a to point b.\n\n278\n00:14:24.468 --> 00:14:27.440\nI don't care about protecting data.\n\n279\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.909\nI don't care about whether or\nnot it's controlled or not.\n\n280\n00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:33.741\nAll I'm supposed to do is report what,\nhere's where I am, or\n\n281\n00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:37.860\nhere's what I started with, and here's\nwhere it's ultimately supposed to go.\n\n282\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.588\n&gt;&gt; What's done with it afterwards?\n\n283\n00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:40.627\nNever mind.\n\n284\n00:14:40.627 --> 00:14:42.846\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least according to\nthe people that designed it.\n\n285\n00:14:42.846 --> 00:14:45.313\nSo look, it just needs to\ngo from point a to point b.\n\n286\n00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:46.810\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n287\n00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.585\nwith Kermit the Frog sipping tea it's\nlike, that's none of my business.\n\n288\n00:14:49.585 --> 00:14:52.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so it's very true.\n\n289\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.450\nSo it's right here that this is where\nyou have to come from the mindset of\n\n290\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.680\nthe attacker.\n\n291\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.100\nWe don't think about layer two\nattacks very often, especially when we\n\n292\n00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.310\nare security people because we normally\nthink what, it's always from the outside.\n\n293\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.840\nThat's just an assumption.\n\n294\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.500\nNow, I don't mean that for everybody.\n\n295\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.310\nI mean that at least for me when I think\nabout an attack, I don't think about it\n\n296\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.860\nfrom internally inside my network\noccurring and starting at layer two.\n\n297\n00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.570\nI normally think about from external\ncoming in across the router,\n\n298\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:29.320\ncoming in from the firewall,\nsomebody then bringing something inside.\n\n299\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.175\nWhen I plug in the USB device, yes,\nthose are things I should think about.\n\n300\n00:15:32.175 --> 00:15:36.445\nBut I hate to say it that might be third\non my list when I think about natural\n\n301\n00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:37.490\nattack.\n\n302\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.110\nAnd should it actually rise higher?\n\n303\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.420\nProbably, okay.\n\n304\n00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.310\nBut overall though, that's why we want to\nmake sure that we consider layer two here.\n\n305\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.457\nSo I didn't mean to put Daniel on, let me\nthink about this, make sure that I know.\n\n306\n00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:50.738\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I got some of that right.\n\n307\n00:15:50.738 --> 00:15:53.342\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel got them all right,\n\n308\n00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:56.433\nwhich is actually pretty darn cool here,\nthe only one he missed was layer seven,\n\n309\n00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:57.077\nbut [CROSSTALK].\n\n310\n00:15:57.077 --> 00:16:01.376\nYeah, it doesn't really matter\nbecause what we want to know is it\n\n311\n00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:04.200\ndoesn't happen at layer two every often.\n\n312\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.420\n&gt;&gt; That's the point\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the point.\n\n313\n00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.160\nSo that is why somebody\nmight go a layer two attack.\n\n314\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.180\nRonnie may not be suspecting\nsomething like this,\n\n315\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.820\nthat's why we want to emphasize\nsomething like this as well.\n\n316\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.230\nSo what are some of the attacks\nthat occur at layer two?\n\n317\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.160\nSo Daniel, I'm going to go through\njust a list of a few of them.\n\n318\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.570\nAnd you tell me whether or\n\n319\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:33.080\nnot you go, okay, I know what this one\nis about it and what's going on there.\n\n320\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.550\nCAM table exhaustion,\nhave you heard about that?\n\n321\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.640\n&gt;&gt; I have heard of it, I don't think\nI've seen it too much in the wild.\n\n322\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.490\nOr as something that a lot of people do.\n\n323\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's other avenues of attack.\n\n324\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWell, it's amazing, right?\n\n325\n00:16:47.188 --> 00:16:48.900\n&gt;&gt; But it's like a denial service.\n\n326\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.600\n&gt;&gt; It is a denial of service attack,\nis essentially what it comes out to.\n\n327\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.910\nAnd we're gonna see that,\nis what we're actually gonna end up doing.\n\n328\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.240\nSo we're actually gonna\nsee that attack end of it.\n\n329\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.300\nBut in a CAM table attack,\nthis is something in which\n\n330\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.640\nit requires what we think that\nwe've already protected against.\n\n331\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.190\nIn other words,\nit's already got a perimeter.\n\n332\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.400\nIf you can't get access to LAN,\n\n333\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.770\nthe idea of you carrying off a CAM table\nexhaustion attack, very difficult.\n\n334\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n335\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.448\nIf not, almost impossible.\n\n336\n00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:17.996\n[CROSSTALK] Remotely,\nit's just about impossible.\n\n337\n00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you have access to the LAN,\n\n338\n00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:21.665\nwell then you can do that.\n\n339\n00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:26.853\nAnd if you're like Daniel if I've got\naccess to LAN I'm not gonna spend the time\n\n340\n00:17:26.853 --> 00:17:31.631\nworrying about filling up a CAM table\n&gt;&gt; Well there's probably another switch\n\n341\n00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:35.165\nthat it's backing up,\nthat I'll switch the other switch and\n\n342\n00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:40.025\noff to the races\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this\n\n343\n00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:43.483\nis not the ultimate-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n344\n00:17:43.483 --> 00:17:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.330\nIt's not the one that's\nthe super exciting attack.\n\n346\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.920\nBut it is one that we can actually learn\nfrom the analysis of different devices\n\n347\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.870\nin which an attack can go through.\n\n348\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.140\nAnd this may be kinda one of\nthe first ones that we'll talk about.\n\n349\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.940\nSo we'll definitely hit that one.\n\n350\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.450\nARP spoofing.\n\n351\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.000\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah,\nman-in-the-middle attacks still occur.\n\n356\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.350\nThe whole goal behind\nthe man-in-the-middle attack is so\n\n357\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.540\nthat you don't really know that you're\nbeing attacked, hopefully, right?\n\n358\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.645\nSo, yeah, hopefully you're-\n&gt;&gt; That's the plan.\n\n359\n00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:20.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the plan is I'm attacking you,\n\n360\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.950\nbut you don't know about it.\n\n361\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.880\nSo the man-in-the-middle\nattack is pretty darn cool.\n\n362\n00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.870\nAnd we're actually gonna do\nan ARP spoofing attack as well.\n\n363\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.780\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Yeah, Rogue One.\n\n397\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.800\nWhich is another type of thing but.\n\n398\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.580\nYeah so fake access points or\n\n399\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.790\nrogue access points,\nhidden nodes that out there and available.\n\n400\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.154\nUsing some type of deauthorization,\ndeauthorize everyone.\n\n401\n00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:13.030\nThese are things that can happen but\nI don't have a wireless network for\n\n402\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:13.870\nus to attack and\n\n403\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.824\nif I attack everybody's wireless here\nat ITProTV I would be crucified.\n\n404\n00:20:17.824 --> 00:20:18.643\n&gt;&gt; The most hated man in the building.\n\n405\n00:20:18.643 --> 00:20:19.371\n&gt;&gt; I would be crucified, yeah.\n\n406\n00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:24.366\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\nthey'd be throwing stones at him.\n\n407\n00:20:24.366 --> 00:20:26.657\n&gt;&gt; Our wireless.\n\n408\n00:20:26.657 --> 00:20:29.100\nNow, I always joke about every show.\n\n409\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.730\nDaniel and I know.\n\n410\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.660\nI'm gonna say if you wanna get everybody\nupset, make sure that they don't get\n\n411\n00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.010\nemails, or make sure someone says\nthat they don't have emails.\n\n412\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.560\nThey can't get access to a printer.\n\n413\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.300\nWireless is starting to rise.\n\n414\n00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.550\n&gt;&gt; It's getting up there,\nmost of us have a wire at our desk.\n\n415\n00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.330\n&gt;&gt; No on the wireless.\n\n417\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n418\n00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:51.185\nI know, because as soon as\nthe wireless goes down, somebody says,\n\n419\n00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:51.994\nwireless is down.\n\n420\n00:20:51.994 --> 00:20:54.415\nI'm like what?\n\n421\n00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:56.069\nThey just yell it out.\n\n422\n00:20:56.069 --> 00:20:57.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm plugged in.\n\n423\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.330\n&gt;&gt; It's not like, Ronnie,\ndo you think wireless is down?\n\n424\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.060\nRonnie, wireless is down.\n\n425\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.840\nI'm like?\n\n426\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.750\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n427\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.700\n&gt;&gt; And so you do have that.\n\n428\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.750\nSo I'm starting to see that on\nthe rise in terms of attacks there.\n\n429\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.940\nBut all those to our layer\ntwo attacks as well.\n\n430\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.860\nSo just be aware.\n\n431\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.740\nThat list that I just put out there\nthat I can see something very\n\n432\n00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.020\nsimple as far as simple types of questions\ngo on the exam that you may think.\n\n433\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.580\nWhich of the following\nis a layer two attack?\n\n434\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.460\nI mean it makes sense to me, and\nthe one that might throw you off right,\n\n435\n00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.320\nis when we get into like\nthe DHCP exhaustion.\n\n436\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.185\nCuz that's when it starts playing tricks\nwith people's minds cuz I go, wait,\n\n437\n00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:42.190\nDHCP is an application.\n\n438\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.230\nAnd all of a sudden, that's like,\nthat's not a layer two attack, but\n\n439\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.290\nwe'll talk about it when we get to it.\n\n440\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.860\nSo lete's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n441\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.110\nAnd we will start the idea\n\n442\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.920\nof doing a CAM table exhaustion attack,\nis what we'll take a look at.\n\n443\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.220\nSo here's the ultimate goal, right?\n\n444\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.500\nSo when we start, let me move this up.\n\n445\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.610\nA normal operation, right?\n\n446\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.410\nA switch has a CAM table.\n\n447\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.190\nMac addresses essentially are linked\nto switch ports that make sense.\n\n448\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.700\nWhen devices communicate with the switch,\n\n449\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.450\nthey send their MAC\naddress table populates.\n\n450\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.278\nBut there's only a limited amount\nof spaces that are available\n\n451\n00:22:21.278 --> 00:22:22.744\nin that CAM table.\n\n452\n00:22:22.744 --> 00:22:27.795\nSo, the attacker can send many\ndifferent MAC address mappings\n\n453\n00:22:27.795 --> 00:22:32.572\nthat are essentially erroneous,\nfill-up the CAM table.\n\n454\n00:22:32.572 --> 00:22:35.258\nAnd when something like\nthis ends up happening,\n\n455\n00:22:35.258 --> 00:22:40.360\nlook at the ultimate result here Daniel is\nessentially the switch turns into a hub.\n\n456\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.100\nAnd that is because it starts to say,\nI don't know what to do.\n\n457\n00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou've confused it beyond all hope.\n\n458\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.920\nNow it says well,\nI don't want to stop service for you,\n\n459\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.210\nso I'll just allow packets to\ngo wherever they want to go.\n\n460\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:57.670\nAnd now we're opened up to listening\nto the network at that point.\n\n461\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's the ultimate goal, right,\n\n462\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.020\nbehind the idea of a CAM\ntable exhaustion attack.\n\n463\n00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.330\nIs that if they know that you're not\nrunning any type of protection on\n\n464\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.640\nyour switch.\n\n465\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.370\nThey ultimately know that if they send\nenough Mac addresses to that CAM table,\n\n466\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.460\nthey will essentially exhaust\nthe possible mappings that are out there.\n\n467\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.220\nAnd the switch has three\nbasic behaviors right?\n\n468\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.430\nIt forwards data from\none port to the other.\n\n469\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.390\nOr it floods data out\nof every other port or\n\n470\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.946\nit drops data if it's coming out\nthe same port it came in on.\n\n471\n00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:36.310\nSo here it's saying look,\n\n472\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.650\nI normally would actually forward it as\nlong there's a match in the CAM table.\n\n473\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.000\nBut if there is no place now that\nyou start sending those packets and\n\n474\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.900\nI can look up an address.\n\n475\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.430\nIt doesn't wanna stop\nthe traffic like Daniel says.\n\n476\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.530\nIt now just says let me just go ahead and\n\n477\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.900\nbroadcast this just in case that device\nis still out there and that works.\n\n478\n00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.930\nThat means that everybody else\nis also communicating broadcast.\n\n479\n00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.757\nDaniel can be sitting over\nthere with Wireshark.\n\n480\n00:24:00.757 --> 00:24:05.300\nOr whatever other device that he wants\nout there, and start doing them up.\n\n481\n00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.480\nLook at all this data, that looks\nlike a password that's coming back.\n\n482\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.980\n&gt;&gt; We can use clear FTP here\ninside of our own network cuz\n\n483\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.440\nno one's gonna be able to\nthrow on a switch network.\n\n484\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.809\nUntil this type of thing happens,\n\n485\n00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:19.610\nand now I'm seeing all those\ntypes of plaintext things.\n\n486\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.170\n&gt;&gt; And so this is important.\n\n487\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:26.710\nIt is important for us to understand and\nto know because it can happen.\n\n488\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:31.520\nNow this is where the for\nus on the analyst side right?\n\n489\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.430\nHow do we take a look at this,\n\n490\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:39.190\nhow do we see this that goes on and\nwhat do we do when this ends up happening?\n\n491\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.390\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n492\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.778\nI wanna show the attack Daniel.\n\n493\n00:24:44.778 --> 00:24:48.495\nAnd then I wanna show the analysis of\nthat attack afterwards when we capture\n\n494\n00:24:48.495 --> 00:24:49.151\nsomething.\n\n495\n00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:51.410\nAnd then I'm gonna show you where\nyou can get the information.\n\n496\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.570\nGo ,Ronnie I can't set that up.\n\n497\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.750\nI don't have enough equipment\non my end to do it.\n\n498\n00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.160\nI'll show you what can be done and\nhow you can actually view it that way.\n\n499\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.200\nBut for me to do that Daniel is\ngonna take more time than I have\n\n500\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.080\nright here at the end of this episode.\n\n501\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.240\nSo let's go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; Four minutes isn't enough?\n\n502\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.251\n&gt;&gt; No four minutes is\njust not enough here.\n\n503\n00:25:08.251 --> 00:25:10.139\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and stop right here.\n\n504\n00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:12.500\nAnd then let's pick up with\nthis as we continue on.\n\n505\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.125\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great and nice,\n\n506\n00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:16.080\nwe always love to leave you guys with\na nice little cliffhanger, right?\n\n507\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.863\nWill Ronnie be able to pull\nthis attack off, will he not?\n\n508\n00:25:17.863 --> 00:25:18.562\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.160\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and we're\nback with more in our SecOps series for\n\n8\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.350\nCisco.\n\n9\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.580\nJoining us, back in the studio again,\nwell, you'd never guess,\n\n10\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.170\nit was our good friend, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839\nFound him laying around,\nhow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.263\n&gt;&gt; It is going well,\nthank you again, Daniel, for\n\n13\n00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:32.414\nhaving me back as we continue to\ntake a look at Ethernet frames.\n\n14\n00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:37.415\nAnd now we're taking a look of course\nat the idea of demonstrating some\n\n15\n00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:43.293\nof the attacks that can occur at the layer\ntwo and the Ethernet frames that we have.\n\n16\n00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:48.227\nSo that's where we wanna jump into as\nwell, so right as we ended the previous\n\n17\n00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:53.760\nepisode, if you haven't checked that out,\nyou don't have to check that out.\n\n18\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.720\nBut if you wanna figure out,\nhow did he jump from here,\n\n19\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.440\nyou will actually find\nout in the first part.\n\n20\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.210\nBut we can pick up right here if you\nwant to, and we'll be ready to go.\n\n21\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.211\nRemember that the idea here is for\n\n22\n00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:10.153\nus to focus on the layer two type\nof attacks that we may encounter.\n\n23\n00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.825\nAnd as an analyst,\nwe need to be able to figure that out and\n\n24\n00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:14.660\nunderstand what can happen.\n\n25\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.250\nAnd one of these attacks that\nwe have talked about, of course,\n\n26\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.560\nis doing what we call a CAM table\nexhaustion, is what we end up seeing.\n\n27\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.880\nNow, the reason why CAM table exhaustion\nattacks are difficult to catch.\n\n28\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.661\nOne, it's not really violating\nanything on a switch, and\n\n29\n00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.490\nthat's normally what we're attacking,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.670\nSo Daniel, if you kinda remember,\nwe talked about the basic function of\n\n31\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.250\na switch, right, it forwards data from one\ntraffic to, or from one port to another.\n\n32\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.470\nIt essentially floods it when it goes,\nI don't know where that MAC address is,\n\n33\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.050\nlet me go ahead and\njust send it out to everybody,\n\n34\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.690\nbecause you may be out there and\nI just don't know about it.\n\n35\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.170\nOr it drops it, so if it goes in and it\nsays, hey the destination is back out that\n\n36\n00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.800\nsame port that it came in from, let me\njust drop it, there's no use to send out.\n\n37\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.725\nWell, a CAM table exhaustion, right,\n\n38\n00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:07.120\nthe goal behind it is to make\nit act like the second response.\n\n39\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.019\nWhich is, okay, let's just ford out data\nout of whatever ports that are coming in,\n\n40\n00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.676\nand we'll just broadcast it out\nacross the entire switch, and\n\n41\n00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:18.581\nnot worry about what a switch really does,\nokay.\n\n42\n00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:23.485\nSo it turns it into a basic connectivity\ndevice, everybody is still functioning.\n\n43\n00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.183\nMost people don't really even get\nan experience that something's happened,\n\n44\n00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:28.019\nright, Daniel?\n\n45\n00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, because it's like what\nyou kind of alluded to there when you\n\n46\n00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:32.995\nfirst started talking about it.\n\n47\n00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.154\nAnd describing,\n\n48\n00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.873\nwe are not really going outside\nthe boundaries of how it is meant to work.\n\n49\n00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:44.850\nWe're taking advantage of how it is\nmeant to work to perform this attack.\n\n50\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.850\nBecause everybody's still gonna get their\ntraffic, it's gonna get there eventually.\n\n51\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.390\nThe end computer is now making the\ndecision on whether or not it should be\n\n52\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.950\naccepted or rejected, instead of\nthe switch, based off of their CAM table.\n\n53\n00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.110\nSo no one is none the wiser, and yet\n\n54\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.870\nthe attacker is able to glean\na lot of information and\n\n55\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.980\nhave a big advantage over the network by\nperforming it, if they can pull it off.\n\n56\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.490\n&gt;&gt; And we also alluded to this\nall in the previous episode,\n\n57\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.170\nthis is kind of a short\nsummary of what we did before.\n\n58\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.764\nSo we also alluded to this too, and\nDaniel especially made the point that,\n\n59\n00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:18.432\nif you wanted to be on the network.\n\n60\n00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:22.227\nThen if everything is being broadcast,\nhe doesn't have to do anything special,\n\n61\n00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:23.881\nhe's just sitting on the network.\n\n62\n00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:27.414\nAnd now he can capture traffic\nthat's coming across, and\n\n63\n00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:32.042\nit's everybody's traffic because it's\nalso being broadcast out to him.\n\n64\n00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.058\nAnd if he's the attacker,\nit means he's got everything, so\n\n65\n00:03:35.058 --> 00:03:36.940\nthis is why it's difficult.\n\n66\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.733\nMost of us are probably not gonna spot\nsomething like this unless we notice\n\n67\n00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:46.779\nsomething is wrong, unless we're\npaying attention as an analyst, right.\n\n68\n00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.230\nIt also means that the place that we might\nspot it is the place we don't want to, but\n\n69\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.860\nit's necessary for us,\nwhich is after the fact, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.300\nSometimes what we might end up\ngetting where somebody says,\n\n71\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.130\nI captured what I think is\nsome unusual traffic, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.830\nBut I'm not exactly sure\nwhat I'm looking at here,\n\n73\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.970\nand that's what we wanna\ntake a look at as well.\n\n74\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.200\nSo let's see if we can at\nleast show you the attack side\n\n75\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.000\nof the CAM table exhaustion.\n\n76\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.058\nI would love to tell you\nthat I have a switch and\n\n77\n00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:16.345\nwe're gonna overload this thing,\nbut I don't.\n\n78\n00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.230\nAnd like I said before too,\nif I could emulate the switch to do,\n\n79\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.178\nI would do it in the heartbeat,\nbut I can't virtualize how our-\n\n80\n00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:22.848\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n81\n00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:25.915\nthen retiring to with your yacht [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:31.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and literally, I mean, that would\nbe the ultimate goal if this was possible.\n\n83\n00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:35.330\nAnd then I'd get sued by Cisco for\neight times more than I ever made off\n\n84\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.986\nthe product, and\nprobably thrown in jail, most likely.\n\n85\n00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:41.422\n&gt;&gt; They get really upset about their\nintellectual property [LAUGH].\n\n86\n00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:43.072\n&gt;&gt; Some way, some how, they do that,\n\n87\n00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:46.861\nthey don't like when you emulate\ntheir intellectual property.\n\n88\n00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:50.887\nSo let's at least show you the attacks,\nnow, the great thing is, it's not so\n\n89\n00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:52.180\ndifficult to attack it.\n\n90\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.488\nBut it does require you to have\nphysical access to the network itself,\n\n91\n00:04:56.488 --> 00:04:59.128\nthat's kind of the big requirement here.\n\n92\n00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:02.990\nSo if you're already an insider\nmaking the attack, no big deal.\n\n93\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.470\nWhen you're an outsider coming in,\n\n94\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.650\nthat's a little bit bigger of a deal at\nthis point, but it is still possible.\n\n95\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.280\nI'm running cali Linux on\none machine right now, and\n\n96\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.240\nthis is where it would be like\nme running this on my laptop and\n\n97\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.070\nplugging directly into that\nswitch network at this point.\n\n98\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.938\nAnd if everything is working,\nI can tell fairly easily,\n\n99\n00:05:26.938 --> 00:05:31.139\nby simply saying, hey,\nlet me see if I've got an IP address.\n\n100\n00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.783\nIf I can do that, yeah, I was trying\nto make sure I spelled it correctly,\n\n101\n00:05:35.783 --> 00:05:37.699\nI don't know why, but I was.\n\n102\n00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.390\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's a master of\nexecuting the attack,\n\n103\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.310\nhe just can't actually\nexecute the attack [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so here it is,\nso I got an IP address.\n\n105\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.320\nAnd you're saying well, Ronnie,\nyou're talking about layer two,\n\n106\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.340\nwhy does the IP address matter?\n\n107\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.290\nCuz most of the time, we're plugging in to\na switch, now, if I was able to plug in\n\n108\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.200\nand able to connect and talk to\nanother server, the switch is working.\n\n109\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.287\nAnd that's pretty much what we want to be\nable to see, that the switch is running,\n\n110\n00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:02.366\neverything is good.\n\n111\n00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:06.397\nNow we can begin to test out the fortitude\nof that switch in a couple of\n\n112\n00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:08.000\ndifferent ways.\n\n113\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.759\nAnd one of them, of course,\nis can I just go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.459\nrun this type of attack in which I\nexhaust all the possibilities of\n\n115\n00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.148\nwhatever the database is\nthat holds the CAM table?\n\n116\n00:06:20.148 --> 00:06:24.646\nWell, I can do that by using\na fairly a simple command for\n\n117\n00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:28.872\nus that's built into Kali,\nwhich is called macof.\n\n118\n00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:33.230\nNow the macof command will allow me\nto run this, now, before I do that,\n\n119\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.830\nI'm gonna type out the whole command.\n\n120\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.220\nThen I'm gonna run Wireshark so\n\n121\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.320\nthat we can see the capture of what\nthis actually does for us, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.257\nSo macof, I'm going to say the interface,\n-I for the interface.\n\n123\n00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:51.201\nThen I need the proper network adapter, so\n\n124\n00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:55.485\nthis is the one that I'm\ncopying from up here.\n\n125\n00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:59.517\nAnd one of the tricky things, I know\nDaniel, this is not so big news for you,\n\n126\n00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:03.486\nbut typing it in correctly [LAUGH] does\napparently help when you do something\n\n127\n00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:04.118\nlike this.\n\n128\n00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:05.729\nTyping in the letter O for\n\n129\n00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.727\nzero does not work the way that\nI think it was supposed to work.\n\n130\n00:07:09.727 --> 00:07:14.339\n&gt;&gt; The machine is gonna be like,\nI don't know what that is [LAUGH].\n\n131\n00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:15.779\n&gt;&gt; And that's the problem, so\n\n132\n00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:20.040\njust make sure you pay attention to\nthe commands as you type this in.\n\n133\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.751\nNow on the exam, I don't think so,\nI don't think they're gonna get this deep,\n\n134\n00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.110\nbut I wanted you to at least\nsee the attack working.\n\n135\n00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.107\n&gt;&gt; Also understand the theory and\neverything behind it when you get\n\n136\n00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:33.310\nsome tangible application, some context to\nit, so that's the whole purpose of today.\n\n137\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.705\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nlet's say now you have another analyst,\n\n138\n00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:40.200\nlet's say Daniel's the other analyst,\nand he says, I just can't\n\n139\n00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.980\npinpoint it exactly yet, but I'm just\ngonna go in and capture some traffic.\n\n140\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.823\nSo let's go ahead and turn this on, and\nI need to pick the right network adapter,\n\n141\n00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:52.114\nwhich is of course the eth0 adapter.\n\n142\n00:07:52.114 --> 00:07:55.214\nThen I'm going to run it,\nI can just double click on this and\n\n143\n00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:56.646\nthat will normally run it.\n\n144\n00:07:56.646 --> 00:08:00.003\nI wanna make sure that it starts and\nthat's what goes on there.\n\n145\n00:08:00.003 --> 00:08:05.281\nAnd now that I have this, I'm gonna\npress Enter, and there we go, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:05.281 --> 00:08:06.710\n&gt;&gt; But the hammer is down.\n\n147\n00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Notice that it is starting to\nsend a turn of information here\n\n148\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.590\nacross that network adapter\nheading into that switch.\n\n149\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.760\nAnd it doesn't look like it's ending at\nany point soon as we start to do this.\n\n150\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.449\nSo I'm gonna stop it, because I don't\nwanna crash my computer either.\n\n151\n00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.268\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and stop this, so\n\n152\n00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:29.166\nthat we can see what's happening here,\nokay?\n\n153\n00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:32.010\nNow, so the attacker went ahead and\nran this thing.\n\n154\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.748\nAnd let's say that he let it run for\na long time.\n\n155\n00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:35.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not for\n\n156\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.220\nthe measly amount of time that I ran it\nfor, but even the measly amount of time\n\n157\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.990\nI still don't know how many lines\nare there, so you can see that it's there.\n\n158\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.660\nLet's check out Wire Shark just for\na moment.\n\n159\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.530\nSo everything just about looks normal,\nDaniel.\n\n160\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.350\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit, so\n\n161\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.800\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n162\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.598\nI want us to really get into, there we go.\n\n163\n00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:01.860\nAll right, so the first one,\nthat's Dropbox that's from me.\n\n164\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.660\nBut you can start seeing some\nof these other ones here.\n\n165\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.060\nAnd notice that there's no information\n\n166\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.060\nin this column over here\non the right hand side.\n\n167\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.020\nBut now this is where it should kind\nof catch out attention a little bit.\n\n168\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.571\nSo depending on the version of Wireshark\nthat you're running you might get some\n\n169\n00:09:19.571 --> 00:09:22.329\ndifferent information,\ncuz they've updated some of them.\n\n170\n00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.230\nSome of them that haven't\nbeen updated here.\n\n171\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.350\nBut let's take a look at\nsomething here that begins.\n\n172\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.699\nI'm starting to see that\nit's kind of unusual.\n\n173\n00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:34.250\nAll right, Daniel, let's check out\nthis random pattern here for a moment.\n\n174\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.880\nNotice the source and\ndestination IP addresses here, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.770\nAnd notice that, it's just really\na single frame that comes through.\n\n176\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.080\nSource IP, destination,\n\n177\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.940\nnotice that none of them actually\nseem to be repeating at all.\n\n178\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.489\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; Every single one appears different,\n\n179\n00:09:55.489 --> 00:09:56.760\nokay?\n\n180\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.194\nAnd it not only appears different.\n\n181\n00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:01.580\nIt appears different all across,\nI mean every single one.\n\n182\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.595\nSo it doesn't look like that there's,\nI connected to a web server.\n\n183\n00:10:04.595 --> 00:10:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n184\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting traffic coming back,\nI'm connecting back to the web server,\n\n185\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.470\nI'm getting traffic coming back.\n\n186\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.190\nIt's just two different IP addresses,\nand the unusual thing,\n\n187\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.800\nDaniel, if I go back to the,\nlet me stop this.\n\n188\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.010\nLet me go ahead an stop this.\n\n189\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.332\nLet me see if I can get back to my,\n\n190\n00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:28.510\nI'm trying to get back to my terminal\nis what I'm trying to get back to.\n\n191\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.779\nSo if we remember IF config here.\n\n192\n00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:36.138\nWell, here's my IP address.\n\n193\n00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:39.374\n172.16.89.45.\n\n194\n00:10:39.374 --> 00:10:43.292\nWhen I take a look at Wireshark over here,\nnone of that actually was the source.\n\n195\n00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:47.723\nAnd that's coming directly from what,\nfrom this machine, so I'm going to\n\n196\n00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:52.308\nWireshark on this machine if the source\nis anything, it should be by address.\n\n197\n00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:55.459\nBut as I'm plugged in now,\nwhy would that be happening,\n\n198\n00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:58.110\nwhat in the world would be going on here?\n\n199\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.465\nIt is because that MAC off is\nliterally generating saying,\n\n200\n00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:03.957\nI'm just gonna generate random, random.\n\n201\n00:11:03.957 --> 00:11:07.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Random, random, random amounts of data.\n\n202\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.330\nAnd one of them of course is\ngonna be the MAC address.\n\n203\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.730\nNow, I said in the previous episode,\n\n204\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.720\nthat we also need to look at\nthe header two information too.\n\n205\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.340\nNow, here as I scroll in,\n\n206\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.010\nyou'll see it right here in the yellow at\nleast on this packet on this number here.\n\n207\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.906\nIf I go ahead and\nexpand that out, you can see.\n\n208\n00:11:26.906 --> 00:11:27.770\nHere it is.\n\n209\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.640\nSource and\nthe destination MAC address, and\n\n210\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.400\nthis is where you know that\nnothing is actually the same.\n\n211\n00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.050\nEverything is randomly generated, because\nit keeps changing source and destination.\n\n212\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.430\nMAC addresses as well.\n\n213\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.260\nAll across everything\nthat I actually captured\n\n214\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.020\nat that point where you can see\nevery single one of them doing that.\n\n215\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.380\nRemember that we also\ntook a look at the type.\n\n216\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.110\nAnd I told you one of the things that you\nmight actually want to make sure that you\n\n217\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.870\nnote here is that wants\nsomething like this.\n\n218\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.260\nSo that we know what it decided to do and\nat least in what MACAW said.\n\n219\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.760\nIs that it's going to use IP\naddresses also as being part of this.\n\n220\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.594\nLater on when we get into the ARP\nspoofing which I couldn't\n\n221\n00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:13.500\nremember what it's called ARP something.\n\n222\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.540\nLater on when we get\ninto the ARP spoofing,\n\n223\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.560\nwe're going to see that\nmaybe this is what changes.\n\n224\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.115\nSo imagine something like this here, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.706\nWhere you start to see some\nunusual information and\n\n226\n00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:27.340\ngive you a little bit like this.\n\n227\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.531\nAnd they tell you, hey, you know,\nwhat are you seeing here?\n\n228\n00:12:30.531 --> 00:12:32.420\nWhat is the pattern that you're seeing?\n\n229\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.121\nWell, this one is not as descriptive and\n\n230\n00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.279\nthat's why this one is difficult to catch,\nokay?\n\n231\n00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:37.220\nSo, very difficult.\n\n232\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.430\nBut, it's one of those that you want\nto take a look at and be able to do.\n\n233\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.390\nSo this is one of those things in\nwhich it is relatively expensive.\n\n234\n00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.310\nSo unless you have a switch\njust hanging out at home and\n\n235\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.150\nyou're willing to actually do this.\n\n236\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.480\nAnd then you're probably not gonna be, and\n\n237\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.300\nthat's why I only showed\nyou the attack side of it.\n\n238\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.060\nBecause I don't really have\none just hanging out here.\n\n239\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.870\nExcept for\nthe one that we're actually using.\n\n240\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.505\nThat would be a bad idea.\n\n241\n00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:04.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead, Ronnie, fire it off.\n\n242\n00:13:04.373 --> 00:13:06.427\n&gt;&gt; That would be a bad\nidea during our show.\n\n243\n00:13:06.427 --> 00:13:07.639\nFor me to do that.\n\n244\n00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.743\nBut, okay, so\nhow do I do this at home, Daniel, and\n\n245\n00:13:10.743 --> 00:13:13.226\nthen how do I look at something like this?\n\n246\n00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:16.757\n&gt;&gt; Does it require like\na high-end Cisco switch for this?\n\n247\n00:13:16.757 --> 00:13:21.630\nCould you get like a $20,\n$30 old 26 or 2960 or something?\n\n248\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a 2691 or\nsomething like that costs 50 bucks.\n\n249\n00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.318\nIt will probably end up\nworking just as well.\n\n250\n00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:29.682\nSo anything [INAUDIBLE] in the working,\nwhether the camtable size.\n\n251\n00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:33.960\nIf you were really good, right, and you\ngot, I know you want the switch model is,\n\n252\n00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.502\nyou don't have to generate one that\nsends a million MAC addresses.\n\n253\n00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:39.745\nYou can say, all right,\nthat maximum camtable, well,\n\n254\n00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.950\nafter looking up some research,\nit sends a whole 230 addresses.\n\n255\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.396\nI send 3201.\n\n256\n00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:45.012\n&gt;&gt; One.\n\n257\n00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:48.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then all the sudden it becomes a lot\n\n258\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.806\nmore efficient and\nyou start to see things like that.\n\n259\n00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:54.610\nBut just this is something\nthat can be done.\n\n260\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.822\nSo if you want to at least go,\nall right, Ronnie, I can't do that.\n\n261\n00:13:57.822 --> 00:13:59.475\nI don't have a switch at home.\n\n262\n00:13:59.475 --> 00:14:00.620\nI can't see the traffic.\n\n263\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.830\nI could do exactly what you did.\n\n264\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.623\nBut there's other things that you\ncan do as well to help you out.\n\n265\n00:14:05.623 --> 00:14:08.180\nAnd at least I'm hoping that\nI still have it up here.\n\n266\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.600\nThere we go, okay.\n\n267\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.230\nSo here's a more coloresque one\nas what I also showed you here.\n\n268\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.950\nSo this is a screen capture\nof one that I did as well.\n\n269\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.000\nAnd you can see it's the same information\nand that's what I wanted to point out.\n\n270\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.740\nNotice how the Source and Destination IP\naddresses are random as crazy, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.930\nSo, they are absolutely,\ntotally, 100% random.\n\n272\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.690\nOver here on the right-hand side, though,\n\n273\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.680\nthis is running on older\nversion of Wireshark over here.\n\n274\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.040\nNotice it says, Malformed Packet.\n\n275\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.496\nThat's normally a big indication right\naway on a lot of your networks as if\n\n276\n00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:55.845\nWireshark is starting to pick up malformed\npackets as well, okay, and a lot of them.\n\n277\n00:14:55.845 --> 00:14:59.451\nNotice how every single one\nof these that's showing in my\n\n278\n00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:02.960\nlist says malformed traffic, right here.\n\n279\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.880\nAnd so, if you start seeing this,\nit's a good indication.\n\n280\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.800\nThat at least something is happening and\nthis should actually indicate to you,\n\n281\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.260\nespecially if you open\nup your Ethernet header.\n\n282\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.120\nAnd then you start seeing your random\nsource and destination MAC addresses come\n\n283\n00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.470\nthrough as well that you might be\nunderneath this type of exhaustion attack.\n\n284\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.366\nFrom this point hopefully it\nleads you to the switch which can\n\n285\n00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:35.403\nallow you then to do\nthe show MAC-address table.\n\n286\n00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:36.890\nMAC, yeah.\n\n287\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.788\nShow MAC address-table.\n\n288\n00:15:39.788 --> 00:15:42.496\nI'm putting too many dashes there.\n\n289\n00:15:42.496 --> 00:15:47.337\nThat to make sure that you can see and\nthen all a sudden you realize,\n\n290\n00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:51.245\nwow, every single one of\nthese is beyond filled out.\n\n291\n00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.754\nAnd this is what happens.\n\n292\n00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:56.118\nSo how do we avoid something like this and\nwhy,\n\n293\n00:15:56.118 --> 00:16:01.297\neven though this attack is out there and\nwe're still talking about it,\n\n294\n00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:04.596\nWhy don't we hear about\nit as often anymore?\n\n295\n00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:09.123\nAnd that is because there's, well,\ncommands that really help us in the Cisco\n\n296\n00:16:09.123 --> 00:16:13.580\nworld, right, the ability to do\nport security is a big one, okay.\n\n297\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.130\nSo if we do port security we can\nactually limit the number of these\n\n298\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.130\nMAC addresses that are sent\nin at any one time so\n\n299\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.110\nit doesn't flood the MAC address table,\nthat's very important.\n\n300\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.620\nWe can essentially do basic,\nI shouldn't say basic.\n\n301\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.720\nWe can do authentication that only accepts\nfrom these devices that have those\n\n302\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.700\ncertificates on them,\nsuch as using 802.1X okay, that is another\n\n303\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.019\nthing that can also happen and then we\ncan just do some MAC address filtering.\n\n304\n00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:45.120\nNow you might, well, MAC address\nfiltering, why the heck would I care?\n\n305\n00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.429\nWell remember that the MAC address, right,\nis made up of those two parts that I kind\n\n306\n00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:53.061\nof tried to gloss over cuz I didn't\nwant to get into the A+ stuff here,\n\n307\n00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:54.189\nbut it helps, okay.\n\n308\n00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:58.641\nIf I wanted to say that I wanna\nmake sure that the first 24 bits,\n\n309\n00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.850\nin other words the first 3 bytes of\nthe MAC address, the vendor id, okay.\n\n310\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.298\nAll of the machines\nthat are on my network,\n\n311\n00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:10.990\nthey should have the same NICs from the\nsame vendor, I limit that, Daniel comes in\n\n312\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.342\nwith a super extra special NIC from\nwherever it actually is from, he tries to\n\n313\n00:17:15.342 --> 00:17:20.260\nhook it in, it goes I'm filtering that one\nout cuz it's not the same vendor address.\n\n314\n00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually the company I worked at\nwe actually employed that very technique.\n\n315\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.430\nNew people would come\ninto the business and\n\n316\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.640\nthey would bring their own computer and\nwe would have to approve it.\n\n317\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.280\nAnd everything was being captured and\ngoing hey, this is a new something,\n\n318\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.820\nwe don't have this in our database,\nso it would block,\n\n319\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.600\nthey would have to call and\nthen we would approve that.\n\n320\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.537\nHey, read me your MAC address,\nwe're gonna add that to our database and\n\n321\n00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:43.820\nthen you'll be able to\napprove through that.\n\n322\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.480\nOther than that, yeah, it keeps\nthis kind of thing from happening.\n\n323\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is good, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is really good stuff that happens\n\n325\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.220\nso we probably shouldn't\nsee this too often.\n\n326\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.540\nBut it's not saying it can't be done,\nokay, so\n\n327\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.010\nthis is why we are very careful about\nimplementing hardware on our networks.\n\n328\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.750\nBut now as an analyst, you can take a look\nat perhaps something very similar to this\n\n329\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:13.910\nand be able to see hey, this is pointing\nto something suspicious like that.\n\n330\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.720\nVery important not only as an analyst in\nunderstanding some of the information that\n\n331\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.575\nyou're seeing, but on the exam don't put\nit past them to say here's your output,\n\n332\n00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:25.600\nwhat's this indicative of?\n\n333\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600\nAnd I mean that, so\n\n334\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:34.270\ndo not let this kind of go, I'll never\nbe able to prepare for this exam, okay.\n\n335\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.456\nYou can always go out to your favorite\nsearch engine and do what I did,\n\n336\n00:18:38.456 --> 00:18:44.010\nWireshark capture of CAM table exhaustion,\n\n337\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.790\nokay, and that's what I did right here\non this last one that I showed you.\n\n338\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.260\nCuz I thought about it as I was doing\nthis, I was like this is great,\n\n339\n00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.010\nit'd be awesome that everybody can\nactually run this and make it work.\n\n340\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.590\nBut what if you go I really can't do that\ncuz I just don't have the equipment that's\n\n341\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:04.450\nthere, you can at least go out and\ndo that and examine that table.\n\n342\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.580\nDon't look at it and go Ronnie just\nsaid I just need to look at it,\n\n343\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.145\nokay I looked at it, I'm done.\n\n344\n00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:10.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I'm saying, right.\n\n345\n00:19:10.463 --> 00:19:14.125\nI'm saying look at it, analyze it,\nand go what's the pattern here,\n\n346\n00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:15.689\nwhat are we actually seeing?\n\n347\n00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:19.642\nWell the pattern here is actually that\nrandomization of just plain information\n\n348\n00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:20.886\nthat's coming across.\n\n349\n00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:23.564\n&gt;&gt; You start seeing a bunch\nof random IP to IP with-\n\n350\n00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:24.237\n&gt;&gt; And MAC addresses.\n\n351\n00:19:24.237 --> 00:19:27.277\n&gt;&gt; And MAC addresses, and 54 bit payload.\n\n352\n00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:29.608\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're like, hm,\n\n353\n00:19:29.608 --> 00:19:33.674\nit looks like some sort of\nrepetitive motion is happening in my\n\n354\n00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:37.460\nnetwork from random computers,\nwhat's going on?\n\n355\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.430\nShould lend your mind down to the fact\nthere's some sort of attack happening.\n\n356\n00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.040\nHopefully now that Ronnie's explained it\nyou will realize that is MAC exhaustion,\n\n357\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.030\nI know what that is.\n\n358\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we wanna get to,\nwe want you to feel comfortable with that.\n\n359\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:56.350\nOf course, ideally right,\nyou're spending time in Wireshark,\n\n360\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.010\nyou need to do that in getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n361\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.676\nThere is no other way that I can put that,\nDaniel.\n\n362\n00:20:03.676 --> 00:20:08.707\nThat if you think that I know\nthat Wireshark's out there and\n\n363\n00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.967\nyou go that's the tool\nthat I would use for\n\n364\n00:20:11.967 --> 00:20:17.394\ncapturing information you've gotten\na modicum of a way through it.\n\n365\n00:20:17.394 --> 00:20:22.509\nAt this point you need to be able to\nsay all right, here is this example.\n\n366\n00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:25.418\nIt's not that they're going\nto give you six examples and\n\n367\n00:20:25.418 --> 00:20:28.643\nsay which of the following is\nthe CAM table exhaustion attack?\n\n368\n00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:31.942\nCan they do that if they want, yeah,\nit's their exam, they could do that, but\n\n369\n00:20:31.942 --> 00:20:33.687\nthey're not trying to get you to do that.\n\n370\n00:20:33.687 --> 00:20:37.277\nThey're trying to say all right,\nso what is this showing you, or\n\n371\n00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:40.560\nwhat element of this shows you\nit's the MAC address table?\n\n372\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.210\nOr what are you seeing here,\nwhich of the following is keying this in?\n\n373\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.930\nSo take a look at those\ndifferent parts here.\n\n374\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.470\nOne other thing I wanna show right here\non the one that I captured on the screen.\n\n375\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.040\nIf you do happen to get something\nlike this, where you're seeing this\n\n376\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.620\nportion of the information as well and\nyou do end up with a malformed packet.\n\n377\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.880\nNotice that mine, the real live capture\nI did, had no info on it, okay.\n\n378\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.071\nSo this one, on the auto one,\n\n379\n00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:07.041\nthat actually tended to\nadd in a little bit more.\n\n380\n00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:10.946\nNotice the length here, so\nit knows it added in some information and\n\n381\n00:21:10.946 --> 00:21:14.658\nit dropped it right in there so\nit knew it was a malformed packet.\n\n382\n00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:18.754\nIf you tend to see that and all of\na sudden you also have where it says error\n\n383\n00:21:18.754 --> 00:21:22.988\nand malformed, it is another indication\nsomething is wrong with this and\n\n384\n00:21:22.988 --> 00:21:25.890\nrequires a little bit more examination.\n\n385\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.290\nBut our pattern for the CAM table\nexhaustion, though, is found right there,\n\n386\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:35.010\nthat kind of unusual randomized bit\nof information where it's every\n\n387\n00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:40.430\nsingle packet and none of them seem to be\nfrom my own source IP address that I had.\n\n388\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.290\nIt lets you know something\nelse is going on here, okay,\n\n389\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.340\nso that's what we're also seeing as well.\n\n390\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.854\nAll right, so enough about the CAM\ntable exhaustion, at least I think.\n\n391\n00:21:49.854 --> 00:21:50.670\n&gt;&gt; We're exhausted.\n\n392\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.229\n&gt;&gt; We're exhausted.\n\n393\n00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:52.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n394\n00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:53.410\n&gt;&gt; My side!\n\n395\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.550\n&gt;&gt; The pain, Ronnie!\n\n396\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.213\nWith that, okay, moving on.\n\n397\n00:21:56.213 --> 00:21:57.819\n&gt;&gt; So let's move on here and\n\n398\n00:21:57.819 --> 00:22:01.962\nthen we'll talk about our next\nattack as we start to take a look.\n\n399\n00:22:01.962 --> 00:22:07.780\nWe wanna get into this realm of ARP\nspoofing is what we want to be able to do.\n\n400\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.500\nSo let's get a basic fundamental\nunderstanding of the ARP spoofing\n\n401\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.770\nas well, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:18.070\nSo remember that this is more of a review,\nwe kind of really\n\n403\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.340\ndid a better breakdown of it inside\nof the security fundamentals exam.\n\n404\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.980\nBut just to get your\nhead back into the game,\n\n405\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.720\na little bit of a review, a warmup of\nwhat we're taking a look at here, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.290\nNotice here's our target,\nwhich is the switch itself, okay.\n\n407\n00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:43.000\nAnd here's our other target, which is the\nunsuspecting user over here on this side.\n\n408\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.610\nAnd our attacker right here in red,\nnotice his IP address and\n\n409\n00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.790\nhis MAC address here, which is the key.\n\n410\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.860\nAnd notice the target's MAC address,\n\n411\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.140\nnotice the target's MAC address as well,\nokay.\n\n412\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.300\nNow when we start to see this, and what\nthe MAC address spoofing essentially does,\n\n413\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.830\nit allows for the attacker to say hey,\nhere's what I am going to do,\n\n414\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:11.620\nI'm going to tell the switch\nthat the IP address of\n\n415\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:17.640\ntarget number two really belongs to me,\nokay.\n\n416\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.724\nSo the switch will go that's cool,\nI'll take that, no big deal.\n\n417\n00:23:21.724 --> 00:23:22.499\n&gt;&gt; Who am I to say you're wrong?\n\n418\n00:23:22.499 --> 00:23:23.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who am I to say it?\n\n419\n00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:26.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're telling me you're the source,\n\n420\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.307\nsure, sure thing, why not?\n\n421\n00:23:27.307 --> 00:23:28.443\n&gt;&gt; You look legit.\n[LAUGH]\n\n422\n00:23:28.443 --> 00:23:29.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, somehow,\n\n423\n00:23:29.414 --> 00:23:30.340\nyou look legitimate.\n\n424\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the same thing on the other end,\n\n425\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.769\nright, is that the attacker can also,\nof course, say all right, so\n\n426\n00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:43.184\nhere's what's gonna happen, target number\ntwo, the switch, is me once again.\n\n427\n00:23:43.184 --> 00:23:48.279\nSo now we have, well look, a man in the\nmiddle, he's in the middle of everything.\n\n428\n00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:49.081\n&gt;&gt; It's a con job.\n\n429\n00:23:49.081 --> 00:23:50.814\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's weird.\n\n430\n00:23:50.814 --> 00:23:53.888\n&gt;&gt; Your attacking machine becomes\na confidence man and says hey,\n\n431\n00:23:53.888 --> 00:23:57.078\nI'm the guy you're looking for,\nI can solve all your prayers and\n\n432\n00:23:57.078 --> 00:24:01.441\nwoes that you're trying to get into this\nnetwork, just let me handle that for you.\n\n433\n00:24:01.441 --> 00:24:06.144\nOkay Looks great, I'll do that, and\nso it forwards its data unto you, and\n\n434\n00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:07.150\nvice-versa.\n\n435\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.790\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like a great idea.\n\n436\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.646\nThis is exactly what can\nbe very problematic.\n\n437\n00:24:12.646 --> 00:24:14.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Daniel,\n\n438\n00:24:14.398 --> 00:24:18.516\nlet's talk about this just briefly,\nbecause if we're new to this,\n\n439\n00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:21.870\nwe may not understand, what's the problem?\n\n440\n00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.779\nTarget number 2 is still getting access\nto the rest of the network right?\n\n441\n00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:25.674\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n442\n00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:29.621\nit doesn't seem like his\ntraffic is hindering any,\n\n443\n00:24:29.621 --> 00:24:34.840\ncuz the attacker out here,\nhe's not interfering with the traffic.\n\n444\n00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.231\nHe doesn't really want you to\nknow that he's there right?\n\n445\n00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:39.232\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n446\n00:24:39.232 --> 00:24:41.248\nOkay, so what is the big harm for\n\n447\n00:24:41.248 --> 00:24:45.889\ntarget number 2 that he's able to\nconnect everywhere and this happens?\n\n448\n00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:50.089\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a great question, the harm\ncomes into when I'm signing into my bank\n\n449\n00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:50.974\naccounts-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:24:50.974 --> 00:24:52.396\n&gt;&gt; Or my Facebook account or\n\n451\n00:24:52.396 --> 00:24:55.784\nany other thing that requires\nany kind of authentication or\n\n452\n00:24:55.784 --> 00:25:00.135\nsensitive information that I'm sending it,\nbecause what's happening?\n\n453\n00:25:00.135 --> 00:25:02.960\nIt's passing through\nthe attacking machine, and\n\n454\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.820\nthe attacking machine goes, Wireshark on\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.660\n&gt;&gt; And capture, capture,\n\n456\n00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.190\ncapture, capture, and we can analyze\nto our little heart's content.\n\n457\n00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.716\nAnd look there's some usernames and\npasswords, fantastic, now I can log into\n\n458\n00:25:13.716 --> 00:25:15.714\nyour Wells Fargo account and empty it\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n459\n00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:17.894\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm a bad person.\n\n460\n00:25:17.894 --> 00:25:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's the great idea.\n\n461\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.160\nSometimes we don't understand\nthe impact of it, right?\n\n462\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.369\nWe take the look and go, okay so\nit's the man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n463\n00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:31.855\nBig deal, until you start to put\nit into terms that people go,\n\n464\n00:25:31.855 --> 00:25:35.153\nyou mean they could get\ninto my bank account?\n\n465\n00:25:35.153 --> 00:25:36.919\nDid you take a look at your\nbank account from that machine?\n\n466\n00:25:36.919 --> 00:25:37.783\nYes.\n\n467\n00:25:37.783 --> 00:25:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.930\n&gt;&gt; Then yes, it is very possible that your\n\n469\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.940\ntraffic is essentially getting\nfiltered through here.\n\n470\n00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.340\nAnd they are seeing all the information\nthat you're passing through.\n\n471\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.220\nAnd that's why we also need to\ntake a look at this as well.\n\n472\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:57.180\nThis is also hard to identify though, it's\nhard to catch it after the fact, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.591\nSo if Daniel were the attacker,\n\n474\n00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:01.740\nI'm gonna make Daniel the bad guy\nthrough the whole thing, I can tell.\n\n475\n00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.241\n&gt;&gt; What the heck.\n[LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:05.087\n&gt;&gt; If Daniel is the bad guy here, right,\n\n477\n00:26:05.087 --> 00:26:08.147\nDaniel, is there a possibility\nthat you could be doing this and\n\n478\n00:26:08.147 --> 00:26:10.767\nyou capture the information you want and\nthen leave?\n\n479\n00:26:10.767 --> 00:26:11.525\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n480\n00:26:11.525 --> 00:26:14.995\n&gt;&gt; And is there any real\ntrace that this has happened?\n\n481\n00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:19.846\n&gt;&gt; Nope, there's only one little trace,\nand you have to actively go look for\n\n482\n00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:21.390\nit, right?\n\n483\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.100\nWhich would be you check your ARP table,\nyour ARP cache, and\n\n484\n00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.185\nsee that I have two MAC\naddresses with the same IP.\n\n485\n00:26:28.185 --> 00:26:29.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that would be like,\n\n486\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.160\nhm, how's that happen?\n\n487\n00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.820\n&gt;&gt; And good luck at matching it down to-\n&gt;&gt; Down to the right one,\n\n488\n00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.670\nplus that machine is gone now,\nit's not even on your network.\n\n489\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.540\nAnd you'd have the have the where\nwith all to understand that that is\n\n490\n00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.300\nwhat's happening.\n\n491\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.570\nAnd hope that the ARP\ncache has not flushed\n\n492\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.600\nat all during the time in which you\nthought there was an attack occurring.\n\n493\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.080\nAnd by the time you actually look,\nit could be gone,\n\n494\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.700\nit could be just flushed out\nof the table at that point.\n\n495\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is almost\nthe very magical attack, right?\n\n496\n00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.641\nThis is the one-\n&gt;&gt; It's a great one.\n\n497\n00:26:57.641 --> 00:27:01.622\n&gt;&gt; That if the attacker can say,\nI got exactly what I wanted,\n\n498\n00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:06.510\nnot only did that, I did it the way\nthat I wanted, which is undetected.\n\n499\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.145\n&gt;&gt; Right, scot-free.\n\n500\n00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Scot-free, and he goes away, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.740\nUs being able to detect it afterwards\nis almost an impossibility, okay?\n\n502\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.223\nSo I'm not saying they can't,\nDaniel kinda just proved it,\n\n503\n00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:20.276\nyou can if you-\n&gt;&gt; Of course,\n\n504\n00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:22.042\nyou've gotta be Johnny-on-the-spot, man.\n\n505\n00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:24.090\nOtherwise they're gone like a ghost.\n\n506\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just about the only way to do\nit is to catch it during the attack.\n\n507\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.780\nAnd that is almost impossible to\ndo unless it is the proper timing.\n\n508\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.630\nBut now with today's networks and\nthe systems that are out there right?\n\n509\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.040\nIncluding something like\nCisco's Fire Power and\n\n510\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.130\ntheir advanced malware protocol stuff,\nand everything that they're doing, right,\n\n511\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.760\njust all that stuff that's out there-\n&gt;&gt; Those next-gen intrusion detection\n\n512\n00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.297\nsystems-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, they are pretty boss.\n\n513\n00:27:47.297 --> 00:27:50.333\n&gt;&gt; They are pretty boss.\n\n514\n00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:53.482\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are actively seeking stuff like\n\n515\n00:27:53.482 --> 00:27:55.577\nthis that's going on, okay?\n\n516\n00:27:55.577 --> 00:28:00.340\nBut for us though, it means we have to\nlearn from what we're learning here.\n\n517\n00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.220\nBut also go, hey,\nif it does happen, what can I do?\n\n518\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.460\nWhich is take a look at the analysis that\nhappens, and then go on and see that.\n\n519\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.520\nAnd that's what we're going to do,\n\n520\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.820\nDaniel, is we're actually going\nto do this MAC spoofing attack.\n\n521\n00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.590\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n522\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:17.260\nwe're gonna see that the capture that we\ntake a look at, and hopefully in the end\n\n523\n00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.750\nresult, be able to analyze and go, okay,\nI can see the pattern that's there.\n\n524\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.810\nThat way, I can try and detect it.\n\n525\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.010\nBut let me put a disclaimer, I hate to do\nthis, but let me put a disclaimer at this.\n\n526\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.347\nJust you watching this episode and seeing\nthose two screen captures or three or\n\n527\n00:28:32.347 --> 00:28:34.590\nfive that we do doesn't make an expert.\n\n528\n00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how else to explain it.\n\n529\n00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.490\nIt means you need to spend time, but\nat least you're showing the footprint\n\n530\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.770\nto follow, and hopefully you'll\ndevelop your skills after this.\n\n531\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.380\nBut that's the beginning of it right?\n\n532\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.940\nIs going okay,\nhere's a pattern for me to follow.\n\n533\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.050\nNow let me start to see it, now let me\ndo more research, let me figure it out.\n\n534\n00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Do you know where I learned how\nto actually perform this attack?\n\n535\n00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.887\nWas from Cisco's website.\n\n536\n00:28:55.887 --> 00:28:56.527\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n537\n00:28:56.527 --> 00:29:01.685\n&gt;&gt; Cisco has a wealth of knowledge,\ntheir website has a ton of great stuff.\n\n538\n00:29:01.685 --> 00:29:06.010\nAnd they will walk you step-by-step\nthrough defeating your switch.\n\n539\n00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:06.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n540\n00:29:06.756 --> 00:29:10.919\nperforming a man-in-the-middle attack,\nand it's a great write up.\n\n541\n00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:14.054\nSo if you wanna do that,\nthat resource is out there for you.\n\n542\n00:29:14.054 --> 00:29:17.348\nI don't remember it top of my head, it's\nbeen a while since I have to do this, but\n\n543\n00:29:17.348 --> 00:29:20.340\njust look for that,\nlike Ronnie's been talking about.\n\n544\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.440\nAnd start to try these things,\n\n545\n00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.590\ngrab you an old switch for\nvery little amount of money, play with it.\n\n546\n00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.000\nIt does help solidify this\nknowledge in your mind, on,\n\n547\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.470\nI know exactly how it's working\nbecause I've done it successfully.\n\n548\n00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:36.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, Daniel,\nwe should jump right into this lab.\n\n549\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go.\n\n550\n00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.400\n&gt;&gt; I would love to, except that I have\nrun out of time, which means that\n\n551\n00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.190\nwe probably need to go ahead and\nsave this for our next episode then.\n\n552\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.615\n&gt;&gt; This really is like an old time serial.\n\n553\n00:29:46.615 --> 00:29:47.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n554\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.700\nwhere everything's a cliff hanger.\n\n555\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.342\nIt never ends, it's Dragon Ball Z.\n\n556\n00:29:50.342 --> 00:29:52.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all it is,\n\n557\n00:29:52.197 --> 00:29:54.528\nevery show's a cliff hanger from now on.\n\n558\n00:29:54.528 --> 00:29:56.863\nAll right Ronnie, well we look\nforward to seeing that ARP spoofing,\n\n559\n00:29:56.863 --> 00:29:58.150\nit's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n560\n00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.370\nIt is, to do this stuff is fun.\n\n561\n00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.760\nSo definitely join us back for\nthat, see how it works.\n\n562\n00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.568\nLook at the stuff that we're gonna analyze\nand see what the tell-tale signs are, so\n\n563\n00:30:07.568 --> 00:30:09.475\nthat you can understand as well,\npass that exam.\n\n564\n00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:12.520\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by,\nwe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n565\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.379\nBut it does look like it is that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n566\n00:30:15.379 --> 00:30:17.334\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n567\n00:30:17.334 --> 00:30:18.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.022\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n569\n00:30:19.022 --> 00:30:27.194\n[MUSIC]\n\n570\n00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:29.821\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:07.854\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:11.513\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:13.326\nAll right greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:16.360\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.100\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.180\ntoday's episode we'll we're moving\nforward with more in our Cisco abstract.\n\n9\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.560\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto milk that excitement,\n\n10\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.020\nour good friend Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.970\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.850\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.150\nIt is going well, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.020\nThank you again for\n\n15\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.420\nhaving me back as we continue to take a\nlook at this idea of our ethernet headers.\n\n16\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.030\nAnd of course being able to spot some of\nthe things as an analyst should be able to\n\n17\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.120\nspot them.\n\n18\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.880\nSo, we are picking up\nhere in our part three.\n\n19\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.220\nWho would have guessed, Daniel, that I\nwould do a part three on a series here.\n\n20\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.249\nNo one would ever.\n\n21\n00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.814\nRonnie's very concise and short talk.\n\n22\n00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.402\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Soft-spoken man.\n\n23\n00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.654\nSo here we are in a part three, and\n\n24\n00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:02.860\nhopefully destined to\nactually finish this one out.\n\n25\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.780\nEnd of part three, that we've been taking\na look in our previous parts, right?\n\n26\n00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500\nWe've talked about a CAM table exhaustion,\nand we showed you how the attack\n\n27\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.110\ngoes there, and taking a look at\nthe analysis through Wireshark.\n\n28\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.960\nAnd then, we are now talking\nabout ARP spoofing, as well.\n\n29\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410\nSo we've kind of addressed those issues.\n\n30\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.010\nIf you want to start back through that\nwhole process which we discussed why ARP\n\n31\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.512\nspoofing or I shouldn't say important.\n\n32\n00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.520\nWhy it's damaging I should say.\n\n33\n00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.590\nAnd one of the reasons why we\nneed to keep an eye on it is\n\n34\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.970\nbecause it's very difficult for\n\n35\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.230\nus to be able to track after the occurence\nof something like this happening.\n\n36\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.430\nSo we were just about to pick up in our\nlab, and that is what we are going to do.\n\n37\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.870\nSo let me describe to you at\nleast what I have set up here.\n\n38\n00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.443\nThis is the diagram that we were actually\ntalking about a little bit earlier.\n\n39\n00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:55.797\nBut here it is,\nwe're gonna be on our Kali Linux box.\n\n40\n00:01:55.797 --> 00:02:00.209\nAnd what I have is a just\na Windows machine,\n\n41\n00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.640\nthat we are going to\nkind of ARP spoof here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.737\nSo currently, nothing is actually spoofed.\n\n43\n00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:11.562\nAnd on my Windows machine I can,\nI should have checked this before,\n\n44\n00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:14.099\nI can connect now- Yes.\n\n45\n00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.076\nTo the Internet, maybe,\nno I can connect that to the Internet and\n\n46\n00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:18.790\nyou'll see that right here.\n\n47\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.210\nLet me verify, ITPro.TV.\n\n48\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.250\nA shameless plug [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.170\nTo our own website,\nwhich is not, there it goes.\n\n50\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.530\nBrought to by ITProTV [LAUGH].\nSo, yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.770\nSo this proves it, right?\n\n52\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.560\nYeah.\nSo we are connected out to the Internet.\n\n53\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.100\nThe Kali Linux box is not in between.\n\n54\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.170\nBut what I want to do now in\nthis attack is essentially what\n\n55\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.185\nwe had described earlier.\n\n56\n00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:45.650\nIs, put the Kali Linux box in between\nthis machine and the Internet.\n\n57\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.636\nSo that traffic flows through it, and\n\n58\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:51.927\nat that point then I can use the Kai Linux\nbox to capture the traffic going through.\n\n59\n00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:54.564\nSo, the good thing is I've now\ntaken Daniel's account, and\n\n60\n00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:58.330\nI'm gonna have to that now, and we're not\ngonna do something like that [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.480\nYeah, you're gonna log out\nchange all my sessions.\n\n62\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.477\nWhich is continually capturing.\n\n63\n00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:06.191\nNow but that's what we're trying to do.\n\n64\n00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.520\nAnd then we of course,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.726\nrun Wireshark during the attack so\nthat we can see what happens and\n\n66\n00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:14.948\nhow that's set up and then take\na look at the analysis afterward.\n\n67\n00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:19.172\nAnd we'll show you two different captures\nhere that we'll take a look at, and\n\n68\n00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:22.948\nhopefully be able to learn some\ninformation from them as we continue to\n\n69\n00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:24.780\ndevelop our skills.\n\n70\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.204\nSo, this is essentially my target, this\nis my attacker machine, and off we go.\n\n71\n00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:33.254\nRight, that's pretty\nmuch what we are hoping,\n\n72\n00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.613\nis that everything will pretty\nmuch work at this point.\n\n73\n00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:38.365\nNow we can't do this by\njust going to do this.\n\n74\n00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:41.405\nI just go Kali Linux let's just\nrun the command, it'd be nice and\n\n75\n00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.019\neasy if everything could do that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.412\nBut we do have to change a couple of\nthings for me to route information back\n\n77\n00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:51.099\nthrough and through Kali and\nthen out to the Internet again.\n\n78\n00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.007\nDaniel did mention right before the show\nlike yeah, just put in the route,\n\n79\n00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:54.942\nit can be done that way.\n\n80\n00:03:54.942 --> 00:04:01.166\nBut I found a way that works for me,\nwhich is the easier way to make this.\n\n81\n00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.991\nAnd this works when I only have one NIC.\n\n82\n00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:09.634\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] NIC is what happens.\n\n83\n00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:14.070\nSo with one NIC I can essentially\nforward data that comes in, out of it.\n\n84\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.190\nAnd that's why we also want even though\nit comes from a different source.\n\n85\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.180\nSo from the command line here,\nI need to begin with an echo.\n\n86\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.616\nWhoops, that should be a single quote.\n\n87\n00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.824\nEcho, echo.\n\n88\n00:04:27.824 --> 00:04:31.610\n[LAUGH] It's so\nstrange on my screen right now.\n\n89\n00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.120\nIt's kind of doing a weird, unusual thing.\n\n90\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.300\nThat's why it's kind of\nbothering me a little bit.\n\n91\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.327\nThen I'm gonna pipe that\n\n92\n00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:47.892\ninto /proc/sys/net/ipv4,\n\n93\n00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:53.645\nat least that's what I'm hoping,\n\n94\n00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:57.340\nthen ip_ Forward.\n\n95\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.470\nSo that's all I'm doing.\n\n96\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.290\nThat's essentially going to do\nthe same thing that what Daniel said,\n\n97\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.430\nput a route in.\n\n98\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.175\nAnd Daniel can do that because he knows\nhow to actually route stuff in Linux.\n\n99\n00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:08.670\n[LAUGH] I can route\nstuff on a Cisco router.\n\n100\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.686\nYeah, you do a very good job of that,\nas well.\n\n101\n00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.130\n[LAUGH] And that's pretty much about it.\n\n102\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.780\nBut on the Kali Linux machine, I'm not\ngonna be able to route very easily.\n\n103\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.230\nYeah.\nSo this is what's gonna help me here.\n\n104\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.570\nNow, once I get that done.\n\n105\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.290\nWe're going to use of course,\na tool that is called.\n\n106\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.180\nThey named it kind of appropriately.\n\n107\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.210\nARP Spoof.\n\n108\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.860\nGo figure.\nWonder what that does?\n\n109\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.984\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n110\n00:05:28.984 --> 00:05:29.565\nIt's kinda weird.\n\n111\n00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:30.145\nWe'll see, right?\n\n112\n00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:33.540\n[LAUGH] The name doesn't\nactually kinda match.\n\n113\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.100\nNo, but this one actually does.\n\n114\n00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.160\nSo ARP Spoof.\n\n115\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.810\nIf I can actually type it in correctly.\n\n116\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.740\nThe first time I typed this in I\nkept doing two Fs instead of two Os.\n\n117\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.385\nArpspoff.\n\n118\n00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:48.950\n[LAUGH] And I was like, why isn't it\nworking, that's why is not working there.\n\n119\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.970\nSo, there it is.\n\n120\n00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.530\nArpspoof.\n\n121\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.841\nI tell it what interface I wanna cut for\nthis on and\n\n122\n00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:55.890\nit says I only have one interface.\n\n123\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.761\nWhich is gonna be eth0 or eth0.\n\n124\n00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:06.078\nThen I tell it the target and this one\nI'm gonna use IP addresses instead,\n\n125\n00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:11.164\nand that target is 172.16.89.200.\n\n126\n00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:18.335\nAnd then my machine as 172.16 89.145,\nall right?\n\n127\n00:06:21.817 --> 00:06:24.740\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n128\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.250\nAnd now it's actually sending some of\nthose ARP replys over into the machine.\n\n129\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.120\nSo you might leave this for a little\nbit of time, I don't know how long.\n\n130\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.700\nIt really depends on your\nmachine when it actually starts.\n\n131\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.090\nGetting over into the other machine.\n\n132\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.390\nSo if everything is actually working and\ndoing what we think it's doing.\n\n133\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.180\nLet's say that we believe\nwe've ran it long enough and\n\n134\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.490\nit's probably over in there\nthat we think we can stop this.\n\n135\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.160\nAt least I think I can stop it, maybe.\n\n136\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.575\nThere we go,\nI could say maybe I can stop it,\n\n137\n00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:02.430\nCtrl+C was starting to fail me\nI'm like no, don't fail me now.\n\n138\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.250\nSo now that we've stopped it this\nis what we have to do as well.\n\n139\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.010\nSo I need to now begin a capture window\n\n140\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.760\nthat will allow me to monitor some\nof the stuff that's coming in.\n\n141\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.690\nAnd the way that we do that is that there\nis another utility called driftnet.\n\n142\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.557\nTell it in the interface,\nI want it to capture on, which is F0 or\n\n143\n00:07:25.557 --> 00:07:27.120\nE0 and press Enter.\n\n144\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.600\nAnd you'll see it's actually up\nthere in the upper left hand corner.\n\n145\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.110\nI don't want to close this window out,\nI just want it to be there.\n\n146\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.860\nSo, there's a lot of stuff going on.\n\n147\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.790\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n148\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.260\nI forgot to actually turn on Wireshark.\n\n149\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.400\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n150\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.950\nAll the stuff I said that I needed to do,\nthat I didn't do.\n\n151\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.200\nSo we're only going to get portions of it,\nbut it'll work.\n\n152\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.653\nI won't look at it from this point.\n\n153\n00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:58.206\nAll right, so we'll let that one run\nkind of in the background as well.\n\n154\n00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:03.874\nI'm going to open up another terminal,\nat least I think I am.\n\n155\n00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.616\nHere, and once I do this,\n\n156\n00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:10.670\nI now want to start capturing\nwebsite information as well, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:17.194\nSo it is here that I can run urlsnarf,\n\n158\n00:08:17.194 --> 00:08:21.621\nfun names [LAUGH] and f0.\n\n159\n00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:25.326\nSo this should actually allow me to\ncapture the website information that I'm\n\n160\n00:08:25.326 --> 00:08:26.870\nlooking for.\n\n161\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.683\nAnd now it's listening on 8080, or 3128.\n\n162\n00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:33.290\nLet's see if this actually works here.\n\n163\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.310\nLet's see,\nif I just bring up a regular website.\n\n164\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.300\nGreat thing is,\nI know that it's going through here.\n\n165\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.217\nLet me go ahead and pull in our,\n\n166\n00:08:46.217 --> 00:08:51.041\nlet's do this one this time instead,\n\n167\n00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:55.564\nverify that I'm still connected,\n\n168\n00:08:55.564 --> 00:08:59.650\nforums.itpro.tv, I think.\n\n169\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.460\nOkay, so that gets us into our forums.\n\n170\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.360\nSo I know that we're connected, but\nam I going through the Linux machine?\n\n171\n00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.403\n&gt;&gt; That's the question of the day.\n\n172\n00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:07.895\n&gt;&gt; That's the question of the day.\n\n173\n00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:09.131\nAnd here you go, Daniel, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It definitely captured something.\n\n175\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit captured some of that information or\n\n176\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.310\nall of it at one time is\nwhat we start seeing.\n\n177\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.136\nAnd the other thing that it did, and\nyou can see here in this drift window,\n\n178\n00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:25.430\nit started doing some image captures,\ntoo, at the same time.\n\n179\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.940\nSo this one, I think, was on the front\npage of that MSN feed that we had.\n\n180\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.260\nBut it started to do it.\n\n181\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.930\nSo this is where I am sending\nthat information through.\n\n182\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.440\nAnd it is going through the Linux, and\nthen sending it out the router instead.\n\n183\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.623\nIt's a lot, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:45.753\nIt doesn't seem like it was that\nhard to actually make happen, but\n\n185\n00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:50.201\nat the same time, if you don't know\nhow it happens, this is kinda key.\n\n186\n00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:51.857\nSo I wanna go and turn this stuff off,\n\n187\n00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.840\ncuz this is probably not\nstuff that we really need.\n\n188\n00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.785\nNot that it matters so much, but\n\n189\n00:09:56.785 --> 00:10:01.049\nat the same time the goal here is not\nto show you how to hack everything.\n\n190\n00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:02.502\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n191\n00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.788\n&gt;&gt; But it is to show you some of\n\n192\n00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:05.440\nthe attacks that go on.\n\n193\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:11.600\nSo of course, attackers can use some of\nthe information that you might find here.\n\n194\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.345\nCome on, trying to get to this\npoint where I can do a Ctrl+C and\n\n195\n00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:17.085\nget out of that thing, too.\n\n196\n00:10:17.085 --> 00:10:19.235\nAll right, so basic attack,\n\n197\n00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:23.890\nexactly what we think hopefully\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n198\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:29.041\nBut now we can scroll down here and\nwe can start taking a look at some\n\n199\n00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:35.870\nof this information, and possibly seeing\nwhat we are looking for here, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:43.584\nNow if this one is not, cuz I'm trying to\nsee what I was exactly looking for here.\n\n201\n00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:44.262\nWow.\n\n202\n00:10:44.262 --> 00:10:44.989\n&gt;&gt; A lot of data there.\n\n203\n00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:47.481\n&gt;&gt; Man, yeah, I think,\nI scrolled back up to the top.\n\n204\n00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:49.805\nI was like, what the heck happened here?\n\n205\n00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:53.159\nLet me see if I can get all\nthe way down here somewhere.\n\n206\n00:10:57.942 --> 00:11:01.659\nThere's gonna be some of these which\nshould say repetitions somewhere, but\n\n207\n00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:03.380\nI've lost it at some point.\n\n208\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.395\nThat's fine, because that's why\nI also have the backup plan.\n\n209\n00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:07.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Me, too.\n\n210\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.270\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is what we're normally looking for.\n\n211\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.000\nSo again, our scenario is simple.\n\n212\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.840\nHere's the capture, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.580\nAnd now,\nwhat are we normally looking for, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.625\nWell, a lot of times,\nespecially with an attack like this,\n\n215\n00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:21.191\nhere is what we're taking on.\n\n216\n00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:23.450\nThis one's a little bit smaller, but\n\n217\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.360\nI want us to really focus in\non what Daniel was mentioning.\n\n218\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.790\nOne of the ways that this can be captured\nis that we start noticing what that idea,\n\n219\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.290\nthat MAC address, now being used\nby multiple IP addresses, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.720\nSo this is where you start to see some\nof that basic information that's coming\n\n221\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.020\nacross and notice the protocol as well.\n\n222\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.840\nUsing ARP,\nwe're seeing this protocol usage and\n\n223\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.310\nit's actually detected in\nthis particular version.\n\n224\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.658\nSo when you do see this, that is\na clear indication that somebody is\n\n225\n00:11:55.658 --> 00:12:00.630\nstarting to spoof that idea of your\nMAC address, and ARP is going on.\n\n226\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.932\nNotice down here at the bottom,\n\n227\n00:12:01.932 --> 00:12:07.155\nthey essentially did the very same thing,\nwhere you could also see,\n\n228\n00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:11.615\nthere's the duplicate addresses configured\nas well, and some of those frames.\n\n229\n00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:16.405\nAnd then this one doesn't actually\ngo any further, too much farther,\n\n230\n00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:21.580\nwhich is right here, too, which is the\naddress resolution protocol as well, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.020\nSo this one's a reply\nthat we end up seeing.\n\n232\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.210\nNow let's see if I can go back over and\n\n233\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.910\nsee if I can eliminate a lot\nof this by typing in ARP.\n\n234\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.950\nAnd let's see here.\n\n235\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.280\nNow this one looks like it filtered it\nout pretty well at this particular point\n\n236\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.010\nin what we're normally seeing.\n\n237\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.094\nBut because I only had one address,\n\n238\n00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:45.646\nI wasn't really kind of doing\na lot in terms of the spoofing.\n\n239\n00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:48.430\nBut this is where you start\nto tell on certain things.\n\n240\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.140\nSo this was probably not as successful\n\n241\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.260\nas a demo as I wanted it to be in terms\nof that, but right here is the key.\n\n242\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.500\nSo if I wanted to spoof this, I would\nactually be able to see it as a two-way\n\n243\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.480\ntraffic, going back and forth across.\n\n244\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.100\nBut at this point,\nI was just showing one, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.870\nCuz I only had one target address that\nI was really matching in between, but\n\n246\n00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.940\nthat's usually at least the information\nthat we're looking for.\n\n247\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.490\nSo you wanna slow down, at least take\na look at the art protocol, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.600\nVerify that it's here,\ntake a look at the information.\n\n249\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.900\nTake and see if you actually\nhave duplicate uses of this\n\n250\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.880\nmultiple IP addresses to\nthe same MAC address here.\n\n251\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.760\nDown at the bottom, once again it's\nconfirming this same information.\n\n252\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.220\nDuplicate IP address detected for\nthis IP address.\n\n253\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.880\nNotice it's in use for\ntwo different MAC addresses here.\n\n254\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.980\nAnd also, don't forget the protocol\ntype that comes in, too, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.620\nNow this one does not show\nus the protocol type.\n\n256\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.743\nI wonder,\nif I can get to that very easily here.\n\n257\n00:13:49.743 --> 00:13:50.447\nThere we go.\n\n258\n00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:55.700\nAnd I wanted to show you\nthe different protocol type up here.\n\n259\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.790\nSo the other one, with the screenshot\nit didn't expand this one out.\n\n260\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.865\nBut notice, there's that 0806,\nso this can also show you\n\n261\n00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:09.243\nthat information if, again,\nsimply asked about the frame type.\n\n262\n00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:13.230\nMake sure you pay attention to\ninformation like this as well, okay.\n\n263\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.439\nSo some of these, it does give you\nthe information that you're looking for,\n\n264\n00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:19.143\nthat you're looking to find.\n\n265\n00:14:19.143 --> 00:14:23.780\nAnd that's what you're hoping for as well\nis being able to find that particular type\n\n266\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.540\nof information that we need\nas we go on through it.\n\n267\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.010\nThis one a little bit simpler spot,\n\n268\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.010\ncuz it normally does tell you duplicate\nIP address to that same MAC address.\n\n269\n00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.855\nAnd that's what you're\nreally looking to see.\n\n270\n00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:40.740\nAll right, that brings us, of course,\nto our last situation here,\n\n271\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.299\nwhich is the idea of the DHCP starvation.\n\n272\n00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.233\nI'm trying to make sure that\nwe see everything else,\n\n273\n00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:51.440\nlet's focus in on the basics of\nthe normal operations of DHCP.\n\n274\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.979\nWe understand DORA, right, the discover,\nthe offer, the request, and\n\n275\n00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:58.660\nthe acknowledgment that we have.\n\n276\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.733\nWhen it comes down to it though,\nit's basically a layer 2 handshake.\n\n277\n00:15:02.733 --> 00:15:06.568\nYou take look at it inside of Wireshark,\nyou'll see it's actually using MAC\n\n278\n00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:10.490\naddresses going across to the broadcast\nMAC address and everything.\n\n279\n00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.104\nThat's how it's actually working.\n\n280\n00:15:11.104 --> 00:15:13.540\n&gt;&gt; That's because it hasn't\ngotten into IP quite yet, right?\n\n281\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.052\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So it has no other choice, so\n\n282\n00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:16.680\nwhat other address will it use?\n\n283\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's what we have.\n\n284\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.340\nSo at the very beginning,\n\n285\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.070\nit's the source is gonna be\nyour DHCP server's MAC address.\n\n286\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna send it to the broadcast\n\n287\n00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.660\nMAC address,\n\n288\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.020\nthe all Fs is what we normally will\nend up seeing right at the beginning.\n\n289\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:36.240\nSo that is a basic, and\nit is just an unauthenticated.\n\n290\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.709\nWow, that's a lot of syllables there.\n\n291\n00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:39.462\n[LAUGH] Unauthenticated handshake.\n\n292\n00:15:39.462 --> 00:15:40.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of vowels in that word.\n\n293\n00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:41.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:15:41.468 --> 00:15:43.263\n&gt;&gt; It was more than I thought, but\n\n295\n00:15:43.263 --> 00:15:45.824\ntrying to say it kind\nof tripped me up there.\n\n296\n00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:49.238\nRemember also, that when we start DORA,\n\n297\n00:15:49.238 --> 00:15:53.923\nright, it doesn't matter\nwhich DHCP server responds,\n\n298\n00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:58.428\nokay, whoever's actually\nbeginning the discover.\n\n299\n00:15:58.428 --> 00:15:59.475\nWhy can't I say it right?\n\n300\n00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:02.307\nWhoever's beginning to discover just says,\nthat's the first one,\n\n301\n00:16:02.307 --> 00:16:03.462\nI'll take that one, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:04.453\nIt has four offers.\n\n303\n00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:06.896\nIt's gonna take the first\none that it's given.\n\n304\n00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:11.990\nSo it doesn't care if the first\none's a rogue DHCP server.\n\n305\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.310\nIt doesn't care if it's\nnot a rogue DHCP server.\n\n306\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.910\nIt says, I need an address and\nyou have one, thank you.\n\n307\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Did this accidentally when I was\nin a Higher Learning Academy, right..\n\n308\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.920\nWe were learning about how to\nset up Windows DHCP service.\n\n309\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.620\nAnd a classroom and\n\n310\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:36.050\napparently we had not cut off that class's\naccess to the rest of the campus network.\n\n311\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.349\nAnd they came running in and\ngoing what's going on in here?\n\n312\n00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:39.445\nWell, we're setting up DHCP, why?\n\n313\n00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:41.611\nYeah, no one can get\naccess to the Internet.\n\n314\n00:16:41.611 --> 00:16:43.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just we were hitting them first,\n\n315\n00:16:43.772 --> 00:16:46.610\nand it was just causing craziness\nthroughout the network.\n\n316\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.205\n&gt;&gt; You are not the only\none that has happened to.\n\n317\n00:16:49.205 --> 00:16:52.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I also when I was teaching\n\n318\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.105\nMicrosoft classes.\n\n319\n00:16:53.105 --> 00:16:54.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Somebody would, inevitably,\n\n320\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.280\nsince we either were doing virtual\nmachines or a real machine at that point.\n\n321\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.072\nSomebody would inevitably say,\n\n322\n00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:04.431\nlet's take that network adapter and just\nput it on to the entire network and yes.\n\n323\n00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:06.600\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; They shut down everybody very quickly.\n\n324\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.062\n&gt;&gt; As Justin would say,\nthere's your problem.\n\n325\n00:17:08.062 --> 00:17:09.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the problem.\n\n326\n00:17:09.478 --> 00:17:13.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it took longer than I thought\n\n327\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.440\nthat would end up happening but\nyeah that's exactly what happens as well.\n\n328\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.660\nRemember, that what the attack\nessentially does is take\n\n329\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.090\nfull advantage of the fact\nthat this is unauthenticated.\n\n330\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:31.160\nOkay, and then every request,\nokay, that Sashi send in, remember\n\n331\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.500\nthat the DHCP server has a limited\nnumber of addresses that assigns out.\n\n332\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.755\nSo what happens then if we\nnow go to the DHCP server and\n\n333\n00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:47.800\nit actually has assigned out all of the IP\naddresses that are available in that pool.\n\n334\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.740\nAnd Daniel has disconnected his laptop in.\n\n335\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.420\nDaniel, are you gonna be able\nto connect out to the internet?\n\n336\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.956\n&gt;&gt; No, probably not, no.\n\n337\n00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:57.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really.\n\n338\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of any\n\n339\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.080\nreason I would be able to at that point.\n\n340\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo normally at least for\n\n341\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.750\nthe end user side,\nthey'll go I'm connected to network but\n\n342\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.010\nI can't get out to the internet.\n\n343\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.350\nYou check and\nthere's a one 169.254 address.\n\n344\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:14.050\nAnd most of us if we're just on that\ntier one support we'll just reboot\n\n345\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.680\nthe machine or let's do an IP config,\n\n346\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.660\nrelease, renew and we'll see what\nhappens and you get the address again.\n\n347\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.820\nThat's kind of a tell tale sign\nthat's not happening here anymore so\n\n348\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.700\nwe might need to go and\ncheck some place else as well.\n\n349\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.790\nAnd normally that, of course, would mean\nonly one other logical place which is\n\n350\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:38.440\nthe DHCP server, and that is what we\nare going to get to here too, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.490\nSo understand that those are kind of\nthe basics of this type of attack.\n\n352\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.100\nThis attack what it does is it\ntakes advantage of the fact\n\n353\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.750\nthat the DHCP Server say,\nI'm ready to hand out addresses and\n\n354\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.205\nthe attacker says great,\nhow many addresses do you have?\n\n355\n00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:55.060\nDHCP server is not telling.\n\n356\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.750\nSo the requestor just says,\n\n357\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.590\nall right, I'm gonna guess that\nyou have 10,000 of them, okay.\n\n358\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.426\n&gt;&gt; Possibility is more likely is that\nthey have 254 addresses [LAUGH] okay.\n\n360\n00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:08.390\nThat's usually the kind of requirements.\n\n361\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.120\n&gt;&gt; Just a nice little class C.\n\n362\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a little class C.\n\n363\n00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.120\n&gt;&gt; Nothing huge.\n\n364\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Most of us would do\nsomething like that.\n\n365\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.710\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou might get a class B.\n\n366\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.527\nAnd let's say that you do that,\nand I request 70,000 of them.\n\n367\n00:19:18.527 --> 00:19:21.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could do that as an attacker,\n\n368\n00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.940\nit can be done.\n\n369\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.280\nIt is quite amazing,\nnot only can it be done,\n\n370\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.520\nbut how quickly it can be done as well.\n\n371\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.092\n&gt;&gt; Man, computers do stuff fast,\ndon't they?\n\n372\n00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:32.871\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do stuff a smidge faster than\n\n373\n00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:35.270\nRonnie Wong, let me put it that way.\n\n374\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.001\n[LAUGH] So this is kind of\nneat because it doesn't take\n\n375\n00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:40.970\nlong before this attack takes place.\n\n376\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.599\nThe hard thing about that is that\nthe attack takes place immediately, okay.\n\n377\n00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:51.463\nThe unusual thing about it is that\nit has a saving grace in that too,\n\n378\n00:19:51.463 --> 00:19:55.490\ncuz you can spot something like\nthat happening very quickly.\n\n379\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.530\nYou go, how Ronnie?\n\n380\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:01.080\nWell, if I go and check my DHCP server and\ngo, I have 254 addresses and\n\n381\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.280\nit's showing that there's been 10,000\ndiscover requests in the last two minutes,\n\n382\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.390\nI may be a little suspect.\n\n383\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a little strange [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:11.448\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why that's happening,\nthat's none of my business.\n\n385\n00:20:11.448 --> 00:20:13.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right I have a frost [LAUGH].\n\n386\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.066\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that is your\nbusiness of using that admin [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:19.667\n&gt;&gt; So something like that could happen,\n\n388\n00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:25.500\nokay,so this is where we wanna put our\nunderstanding to the test as well, okay.\n\n389\n00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.192\nSo it's kind of neat and\nweird at the same time, right.\n\n390\n00:20:29.192 --> 00:20:34.134\nBecause we all get a little bit of\ntrepidation with taking new exams and\n\n391\n00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:38.825\nthe key behind you getting more\nconfident on the exam taking here is\n\n392\n00:20:38.825 --> 00:20:42.220\nknowing those fundamental things.\n\n393\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.590\nHow DHCP absolutely operates or\n\n394\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.390\nhow a switch functions\nhelps you out in the attack\n\n395\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.980\nthat they can do because you know what's\nsupposed to be normal operating function.\n\n396\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.520\nAnd if it's not operating that way,\nthen you know that there is an issue.\n\n397\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.100\nYou may not know exactly what the issue\nis right then, but it really does help.\n\n398\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.750\nSo if you're not familiar with some of\nthe technologies that we've been talking\n\n399\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.550\nabout, go back and make sure you have\na familiarity with those technologies too.\n\n400\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.160\nIt's gonna only benefit you.\n\n401\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.096\nIt might slow you down for\nan extra hour or two.\n\n402\n00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:16.025\nBut I'd rather slow you down now,\nthan in the future,\n\n403\n00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:20.673\nwhen all the sudden you're right there and\nyou're facing whatever the time limit is,\n\n404\n00:21:20.673 --> 00:21:22.662\ncuz you're on a ticket now, right?\n\n405\n00:21:22.662 --> 00:21:23.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n406\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.758\n&gt;&gt; You're on a time ticket.\n\n407\n00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:29.670\nYour SLA says, got four hours, Ronnie,\nyou just burned up three and half.\n\n408\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.170\nTrying to figure out whatever this was and\nyou still haven't\n\n409\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.520\ncome close cuz you didn't understand\ntechnology not good, okay?\n\n410\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.800\nSo I'd rather you burn it now okay,\nand take that extra time and learn it.\n\n411\n00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.860\nBut that's what you wanna get to as well,\n\n412\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.220\nis the that base knowledge of\noperation that will help you then.\n\n413\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.140\nFiguring out how the rest of this\nstuff gets put together, okay?\n\n414\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.710\nSo let's go ahead and\nrun that DHCP operation or\n\n415\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.070\nthat DHCP starvation\nattack as we get started.\n\n416\n00:21:58.228 --> 00:22:02.440\nAll right, so everything is now set up for\nus to go ahead and do this.\n\n417\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.560\nSo what do I have set up for us?\n\n418\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.600\nI've got a DHCP server running,\nI've done this on a router.\n\n419\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.870\nAnd the reason why is,\nit actually makes it easy.\n\n420\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.240\nAnd not only that, though,\n\n421\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.770\nWindows is very good at actually defending\ntheir particular starvation attacks here.\n\n422\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.380\nSo we're gonna actually\nrun it on a Cisco router\n\n423\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.230\nthat is not gonna be as good as defending.\n\n424\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.030\nWe're also, of course, gonna use Kali\nLinux to actually initiate the attack.\n\n425\n00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.990\nSo that we can see what it\ntakes to be able to do this.\n\n426\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.260\nSo that is what we're setting up.\n\n427\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.940\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nthat will help us out here, okay.\n\n428\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.690\nSo I've just set this up making sure\nthat everything is connected and\n\n429\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.350\nthat we are ready to go.\n\n430\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.162\nIf I now take a look at the configuration,\n\n431\n00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:49.635\nlet's do a show ip dhcp server stat for\nour statistics.\n\n432\n00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:54.685\nI can now see that, here it is, a couple\nor requests and discovers I have actually\n\n433\n00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:59.679\ngone on here, so there's two discovers and\nfour requests that have happened.\n\n434\n00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:04.370\nI can also see that there's one\naddress pool, one automatic binding.\n\n435\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.863\nAnd the reason why is that's the only\nmachine that's on the network, so\n\n436\n00:23:07.863 --> 00:23:10.341\nit makes sense that this\nis all I should see, okay.\n\n437\n00:23:10.341 --> 00:23:13.980\nSo some of that you have to\nlogically kind of remember, okay.\n\n438\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.193\nOn your network,\nit's gonna look a little different.\n\n439\n00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:19.157\nBecause not only do we have static\nmachines that are on them and\n\n440\n00:23:19.157 --> 00:23:22.691\nones that are always on them, but\nremember that because people come on and\n\n441\n00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:26.054\noff of your network using smart phones,\nand tablets and everything,\n\n442\n00:23:26.054 --> 00:23:30.430\nit's gonna be little bit more wild than\nwhat we're normally seeing here too.\n\n443\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.063\nSo at least here,\nthis ones gonna be insanely stable.\n\n444\n00:23:34.063 --> 00:23:37.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you do know your network as\nan admin who's setting this things up.\n\n445\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.160\nYou realize, we typically have x amount\nof machines at any given time plus or\n\n446\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.680\nminus so many.\n\n447\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.392\nYou got that margin of error.\n\n448\n00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:50.626\nWhen you see that that environment\nthat you set up to handle heavy load\n\n449\n00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:54.641\nbased on your average traffic,\nand it's completely wiped out,\n\n450\n00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:58.164\nthat's gonna raise some red flags or\nhopefully it will.\n\n451\n00:23:58.164 --> 00:23:59.111\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n452\n00:23:59.111 --> 00:24:01.262\nthat should be what ends\nup happening here, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:07.663\nSo you see one leased address I have\n154 excluded, 254 total, which is fine.\n\n454\n00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:11.500\nI wanted to set this up so we could\nsee it in relatively easily, as well.\n\n455\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.170\nAnd we've already showed you\nthat there's one address left.\n\n456\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.360\nSo now that this is set up, and\nit is ready to respond to DHCP,\n\n457\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.580\nhere is a machine that is\nreceiving DHCP right now,\n\n458\n00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:28.090\nthis Kali Linux Machine that I have and\nwe are going to start an attack here.\n\n459\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.670\nAnd we're gonna use a particular\nattack tool that is called yersinia.\n\n460\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.630\nYersinia has a command line\nutility that you can use.\n\n461\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.145\nBut if you're like me,\nyou're kind of Linux lite.\n\n462\n00:24:42.145 --> 00:24:47.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I am actually gonna do a -G,\n\n463\n00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.040\nwhich will launch for\nme, look, the graphical.\n\n464\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.000\nThe graphical interface,\n\n465\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.760\nwhich to me is actually very\nnice as we start to see, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.450\nSo using Yersinia then right here in\nthe center, I'm gonna select DHCP.\n\n467\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.720\nThat way we know what type of\nattack that we're taking a look at.\n\n468\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.740\nLet me move back out cuz it's not wanting\nme to do all this stuff at the same time.\n\n469\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.620\nThen I have actually picked something else\nout, what type of attack I want to run?\n\n470\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.808\nSo on this little warning box up here,\nit says, be careful,\n\n471\n00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:21.689\nthis is an alpha version of the GUI.\n\n472\n00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:25.380\nIn other words, don't expect\nit to work all the time, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:30.630\nClick OK, maybe, come on,\nwhere's the click?\n\n474\n00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.877\nWhere is that action again?\n\n475\n00:25:31.877 --> 00:25:34.970\nAll right, well, we'll just run it, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.250\nSo I'm gonna launch the attack,\nand there we go.\n\n477\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.250\nI don't know what happened to the little\nbox, I thought it was gonna go there.\n\n478\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.350\nWhat I want is the DHCP discover\npacket because this is doing\n\n479\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.790\na denial of service by me flooding\nthat particular DHCP server.\n\n480\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:54.220\nSo I'm gonna click okay cuz that's what I\nwant and then I'm gonna launch the attack.\n\n481\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.364\nAnd it doesn't look like\nit's doing anything.\n\n482\n00:25:56.364 --> 00:25:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\nPretty boring.\n\n483\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.499\n&gt;&gt; Nothing at all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n484\n00:25:58.499 --> 00:26:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Sounds kinda wimpy here.\n\n485\n00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.260\nYou know what I did forget to do?\n\n486\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.830\nI forgot to run Wireshark.\n\n487\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.360\n&gt;&gt; It does help for packet capture.\n\n488\n00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.150\n&gt;&gt; It does help for packet capture.\n\n489\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.440\nDaniel, if only I would have remembered\nto run Wireshark, we would kinda do.\n\n490\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.150\nAll right, let's try this again.\n\n491\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.219\nAll right, so I'm gonna set this up for\ngetting ready to go.\n\n492\n00:26:19.219 --> 00:26:20.980\nAt least I think I am.\n\n493\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.530\nAlright, Daniel,\nremind me to start Wireshark this time.\n\n494\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\nI will keep that.\n\n495\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.579\nLet me know when to remind you so much.\n\n496\n00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:32.994\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I know it sounds silly.\n\n497\n00:26:32.994 --> 00:26:34.050\nBut I do this.\n\n498\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:40.000\nSo DHCP and\nthen let me select launch the attack.\n\n499\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.570\nAlright.\n\n500\n00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:48.457\nSo before I launch the attack here-\nall right so how do I get to that?\n\n501\n00:26:48.457 --> 00:26:50.346\nThere it- I was like,\nwhere did the Wireshark go.\n\n502\n00:26:50.346 --> 00:26:52.260\nThis is where I need to launch Wireshark.\n\n503\n00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.125\n&gt;&gt; Ryan, your Linux skills are-\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's terrible.\n\n504\n00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:57.192\n&gt;&gt; -impressive and amazing all the same.\n\n505\n00:26:57.192 --> 00:26:58.282\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n506\n00:26:58.282 --> 00:27:02.718\nI hate to say this, full-screening on our\nlittle tiny laptop at the same time trying\n\n507\n00:27:02.718 --> 00:27:06.480\nto get everything done,\nnot exactly the best skills here.\n\n508\n00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.850\nSo now I'm running.\n\n509\n00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.440\nOkay, so there it goes.\n\n510\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.553\n&gt;&gt; Wireshark's on?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is actually running in the, or\n\n511\n00:27:12.553 --> 00:27:16.270\nit's supposed to be running\nin the background, okay?\n\n512\n00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.510\nSo let's see if it's actually\nrunning here, all right,\n\n513\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.552\nso, Let's check it out, all right.\n\n514\n00:27:24.552 --> 00:27:29.397\nWe will know something here in\na moment if I do a DHCP pool.\n\n515\n00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:34.354\nThere we go.\n\n516\n00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:36.550\nIt is actually working.\n\n517\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.170\nI was trying to make sure.\n\n518\n00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.310\nMaybe it didn't end up working.\n\n519\n00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.480\nBut notice right here.\n\n520\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.562\nSo I had to kind of slow down\nbecause my mind was racing after not\n\n521\n00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:47.800\nseeing what I was expecting\nto see in Wireshark here.\n\n522\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.000\nSo there we go.\n\n523\n00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.558\nUtilization mark is 100%, okay?\n\n524\n00:27:51.558 --> 00:27:54.394\n&gt;&gt; That's everything.\n\n525\n00:27:54.394 --> 00:27:55.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, within me just\n\n526\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.490\nclicking one, okay?\n\n527\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:02.640\nAt this point, it did release all\n100 addresses right away, okay?\n\n528\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.900\nWithout me having to do anything else.\n\n529\n00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.590\nIf I type in a show ip\ndhcp server stat for\n\n530\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.660\nthese statistics, I can see that\nthe number of requests went up a bit.\n\n531\n00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.370\nAnd just a little bit\nof time here as well.\n\n532\n00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.150\nSo, this-\n&gt;&gt; I think it probably noticed 3,000 extra\n\n533\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.138\nmachines coming in.\n\n534\n00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:25.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you hopefully you'rs not.\n\n535\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.930\n&gt;&gt; Now, on this one it's gonna\nactually do any binding.\n\n536\n00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.610\nCuz there's nothing else\nactually requiring it.\n\n537\n00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.020\nBut you do see where I've now\nessentially used up all the addresses\n\n538\n00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.390\ninside of that pool very easily, okay?\n\n539\n00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.614\nSo that is the basis of\nthis attack that we have.\n\n540\n00:28:42.614 --> 00:28:45.790\nI need to stop the attack\nis what I need to do.\n\n541\n00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.000\nSo let me find my cali box here.\n\n542\n00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.940\nAnd stop the attack before it goes nuts.\n\n543\n00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:57.000\nOn my machine and\ncauses everything else to crash, okay?\n\n544\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.700\nSo that's essentially the basic attack,\nokay?\n\n545\n00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:05.130\nNow, cuz this is what I was expecting\nto see, right away, and I don't know.\n\n546\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.760\nIt just either slowed down or\nI didn't catch it right in time.\n\n547\n00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.680\n&gt;&gt; As far as the live attack goes, but\nnotice all of the number of discovers and\n\n548\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.640\nrequests.\n\n549\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.110\nIf you get a huge amount of discovers\nlike what we're seeing down here, toward\n\n550\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:23.690\nthe bottom and just a few requests, the\ninitial ones and everything else that will\n\n551\n00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.480\ngo on, that is what you're looking for\nis that whole line of what you're seeing,\n\n552\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:35.500\nnotice the actual IP address once again\nis the broadcast address but if we were\n\n553\n00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.930\nto take a look at this in the layer two,\nit would be the alt S address as well.\n\n554\n00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.950\nAnd you'll also notice the source address.\n\n555\n00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:47.390\nNotice it doesn't actually tell you\nthe attacker source address either.\n\n556\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.550\nSo coming from the zeros, A as well.\n\n557\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.620\nAnd here's one that actually\ndoes come from another one.\n\n558\n00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.410\nBut you can see where all of this\nis actually in very good indication\n\n559\n00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.940\nthat a constant discover going on.\n\n560\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.760\nTake a look at your address pool as far\nas DHCP goes, if you don't have any.\n\n561\n00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.912\nAnd you're used to having 20% left or\n\n562\n00:30:07.912 --> 00:30:12.970\n50% left it may indicate another\naspect of what we're seeing it.\n\n563\n00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.680\nSo this is just the beginning like I said\nof everything that we can think up okay?\n\n564\n00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.780\nTo at least get you started here.\n\n565\n00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.820\nNow there's a lot more than of course\nlater two headers that we're gonna be\n\n566\n00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.520\ntaking a look at but at least this is\na foundational start that you can see\n\n567\n00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.310\nwhere that information's coming in.\n\n568\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.920\nWe've also talked about the idea here\non the exam which you're likely to see.\n\n569\n00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.420\nDo not say I don't have to\nworry about knowing the way\n\n570\n00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.480\nthe information actually appears.\n\n571\n00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.120\nYou're gonna need to know what\nthe information is showing you\n\n572\n00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.630\nbefore you can line them up to the types\nof attack that you're looking at.\n\n573\n00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.130\nBe able to differentiate\na Layer 2 type of attack.\n\n574\n00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.010\nIt's easy, based on Mac address.\n\n575\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.520\nThat's just kinda the easy thing.\n\n576\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.640\n&gt;&gt; It's what it boils down to.\n\n577\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.750\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n578\n00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.260\nBut those are things that,\neasy to forget under pressure.\n\n579\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's why we wanted to make\n\n580\n00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.970\nsure that you that you saw this show\non the idea of ethernet headers.\n\n581\n00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.530\nSo hopefully that will give\nyou a nice solid foundation\n\n582\n00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.090\nto what you're actually going\nto be preparing for on the exam.\n\n583\n00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.660\n&gt;&gt; All Right John Ronny nicely done.\n\n584\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.990\nWe appreciate your effort on this cuz\nwe got to look at some cool attacks and\n\n585\n00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:20.190\nhow to spot them as the blue team member\ntrying to defend against it, right?\n\n586\n00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.890\nVery cool stuff.\n\n587\n00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.370\nRonnie, we do appreciate you dropping by,\nbut\n\n588\n00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.000\nit looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n589\n00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.300\nSo perfect timing for you.\n\n590\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.510\nGood, thank you so much.\n\n591\n00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:30.070\nAnd thank you guys so\nmuch out there for joining us.\n\n592\n00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.655\nWe'll be back with more in our Cisco CyOps\nseries, but as for this episode,\n\n593\n00:31:33.655 --> 00:31:34.956\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n594\n00:31:34.956 --> 00:31:37.828\nThanks for watching, signing off for IT\nPro TV, I've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n595\n00:31:37.828 -->

episode of ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.977\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.068\nwe are back with more in\nour Cisco SecApps series.\n\n11\n00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:24.180\nIt's been an interesting series thus far.\n\n12\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.530\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto continue that conversation,\n\n13\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.350\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n14\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.020\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n15\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.930\nHow's it going today?\n\n16\n00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.530\n&gt;&gt; It is going great.\n\n17\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.580\nThank you, Daniel once again,\nfor having me back on the show.\n\n18\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.880\nAnd today, we are continuing on taking\na look at, of course, well, more headers.\n\n19\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.690\nWho would have guessed that headers would\nactually be such a gigantic field except\n\n20\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.859\nfor people in Cyber Ops?\n\n21\n00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.617\n&gt;&gt; There's a little bit of them.\n\n22\n00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's just a few of them [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.650\nAs we started taking a look at this,\n\n24\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.360\nwe began with talking about\nreally layer two headers.\n\n25\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.525\nNot transport layer,\nthat's layer 4, weird.\n\n26\n00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.120\nThe Ethernet headers that\nwe've been talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.460\nAnd now we're moving into\nwell a little bit of layer 3,\n\n28\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.350\nwhich of course are gonna\nbe our IP headers.\n\n29\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.765\nAnd we need to have a solid understanding\nof what we find in the IP headers\n\n30\n00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:17.638\nbecause that's where we can also spot\nsome of the attacks that go on there too.\n\n31\n00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:23.077\nSo in this one it's a lot more about\nus understanding the information\n\n32\n00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:28.290\nthat we find in the IP 4 headers\nas well as the IPv6 headers.\n\n33\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.270\nSo that we can spot where we might\nactually have to look as we continue to\n\n34\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.810\nmove forward in understanding more about\nthe analysis of what we have to do.\n\n35\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.100\nNow, there's a lot more,\nof course, to come after this,\n\n36\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.840\nwe still have layer 4 to go through\nas well as the application layer,\n\n37\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.750\nthe upper layer headers to go through.\n\n38\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.880\nBut at least kind of start right here.\n\n39\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.340\nNow, before we get started into\nthe IP headers themselves and\n\n40\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.790\nstart examining them, let's just do a bit\nof a refresher on the idea of IP itself\n\n41\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.320\nto make sure that we have an understanding\nof what we're taking a look at now.\n\n42\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.450\nSo if we start off with\nthe Ethernet headers that we\n\n43\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.540\nreally just took a look at\nin previous episodes here.\n\n44\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.940\nRemember that everything that we started\noff with there in terms of describing\n\n45\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.280\nall happens on layer 2 of the OSI model.\n\n46\n00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.210\nAnd that primarily deals around the fact\nthat what well we're using MAC addresses\n\n47\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.018\nas a source and\ndestination addresses that we use there.\n\n48\n00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:30.269\nAt layer 3, though, we start moving\ninto the IP addresses instead and\n\n49\n00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.696\nthat's what we need to\nfocus in on right here.\n\n50\n00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:38.456\nAnd there's a lot of information\nsurrounding layer 3 that we also have\n\n51\n00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:39.110\nto now.\n\n52\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.580\nBut let's start off with just making\nsure we have a fundamental understanding\n\n53\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.500\nof the IP address itself.\n\n54\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.190\nAnd this is kind of the main information\nthat really is significant to you and\n\n55\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.110\nI in terms of networking.\n\n56\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.900\nThe rest of the data that we're gonna\nlook at is significant in terms of\n\n57\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.220\nCyber Ops as well.\n\n58\n00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.812\nBut this is the one that's\nsignificant in networking and\n\n59\n00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:01.406\nis a solid foundation that we\nneed to have before we go on.\n\n60\n00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:06.000\nAnd we'll take a look at both IP version\n4 and IP version 6 as we see this.\n\n61\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.970\nSo, on my screen, this is just\na basic tier as we go through.\n\n62\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.340\nSo in IPv4, let's just kinda make\nsure that we understand something.\n\n63\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.180\nAt this point in your IT career, you and\n\n64\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.580\nI are gonna end up starting to\nuse IP version 6 more often.\n\n65\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.344\nDo you still need to know IP version 4?\n\n66\n00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:25.640\nYes.\n\n67\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.980\nWhy?\nBecause everybody is still using\n\n68\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.270\nit right now.\n\n69\n00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.540\nBut as the future continues to roll along\nat a pace that's it's rolling along,\n\n70\n00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.860\ncompanies are switching over and they are\nstarting to move faster towards that end.\n\n71\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.070\nBut there's millions and\nmillions of companies and\n\n72\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.180\nthere's millions of companies that\nare slow, kind of lagging behind,\n\n73\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.310\nbut there are also hundreds of thousands\nthat's moving forward with this idea.\n\n74\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.220\nSo it's still gonna take\na little bit of time.\n\n75\n00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.550\nSo you need to know both.\n\n76\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.034\nBut as you head into the future, the great\nthing is if you start off knowing now at\n\n77\n00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:59.575\nleast the basics, it's gonna help you as\nyou actually get into it in the future.\n\n78\n00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:04.360\nSo in IPv4, which is pretty much\nthe addressing that we've been using\n\n79\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.318\nall along at this point, remember\nthat this is a 32 bit binary address.\n\n80\n00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:13.676\nAnd when we take a look at,\nhere's an example that I went ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:18.450\ntyped out for us as well, is that it\nnormally ends up looking like this.\n\n82\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.200\nBinary, of course, is a string of 1s and\n0s, there's 32 of them.\n\n83\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.560\nAnd what we do to help us to separate\nthis out, to make it a little bit more\n\n84\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.800\nmanageable, is that we put in\na dot in between every eight bits.\n\n85\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.960\nSo that we end up with four chunks\nof eight bits, what we call octets.\n\n86\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.900\nEach one of these essentially is in\noctet of the actual address itself.\n\n87\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.880\nNow that's not super significant for\nnetworking, but what is significant though\n\n88\n00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.300\nis that this 32 bit number is\ndivided to 2 separate portions.\n\n89\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.960\nOne that tells us what\nwe call the NetworkID.\n\n90\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.660\nIn other words, the group that this\nparticular address belongs to.\n\n91\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.150\nAnd then of course,\nthen there is the HostID.\n\n92\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.770\nEssentially the individual\nmachine number that is assign\n\n93\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.500\ninside of that group to make\nit uniquely identified.\n\n94\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.640\nAnd that's actually very important for\nus because the differentiation of that,\n\n95\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.850\nof those two portions, only come\nbecause of the dots originally it did.\n\n96\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.160\nSo before we had what we called subnet\nmasks, the way that we actually did this\n\n97\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.890\nis according to those dots that we\nwould end up with these addresses.\n\n98\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.995\nSo we networked using classful\naddressing is what we did here.\n\n99\n00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:42.320\nThose is what we call class a,\nclass b, and class c addresses.\n\n100\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.370\nMakes sense.\n\n101\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.320\nAnd that's the way that it went.\n\n102\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.650\nBut after a while, we started realizing\nthat that was kind of wasteful and\n\n103\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.270\nnot everybody actually fell in line\non those particular boundaries.\n\n104\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.500\nSo for example, let's say that\nDaniel had a company and he said,\n\n105\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.130\nhey I have ten computers that need\nnetwork access to the Internet.\n\n106\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.540\nWell that's fine, but\nif I was an ISP during that early days,\n\n107\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.820\nthe early days during\nclassful networking here,\n\n108\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.570\nthe smallest address that I could give to\nDaniel, he would end up with 254 of them.\n\n109\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.030\nSo Daniel had 10 and I just said well,\n\n110\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.920\nDaniel you'll have to purchase or\nyou'll have to lease 254 of them.\n\n111\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.596\nNot exactly a gigantic, no it is\na gigantic waste, I'm lying to you.\n\n112\n00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.565\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nit even got worse as you moved into well,\n\n113\n00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:33.726\nokay, I've got 600 computers.\n\n114\n00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.560\nI'm a decent sized company, but\n\n115\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.940\nnow that little class C is\nnot gonna cut the mustard.\n\n116\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.259\nI've gotta go to class B and\nthere's like 16,000 some odd.\n\n117\n00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:41.987\n&gt;&gt; 65,500.\n\n118\n00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:42.988\n&gt;&gt; 65,000, yeah, that's right.\n\n119\n00:06:42.988 --> 00:06:43.512\nI'm sorry, yes.\n\n120\n00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:47.299\n&gt;&gt; 65,536 of those addresses\nof 34 technically.\n\n121\n00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:48.084\n&gt;&gt; Talk about wasteful.\n\n122\n00:06:48.084 --> 00:06:49.681\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, talk about wasteful and\n\n123\n00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:51.050\nthis is where it got worst.\n\n124\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.080\nWell, that's what they introduced\nwhat we call subnet masking instead.\n\n125\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.760\nSubnet masking is another\n32 bit number and\n\n126\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.880\nhere's an example of\nwhat you see right here.\n\n127\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.955\nThis is what helps us to separate\nout which portion of those 32\n\n128\n00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:12.048\nbits belongs to the NetworkID and\nwhich portion is the HostID.\n\n129\n00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.694\nAnd the way that this ends up working\nis through a process that's called\n\n130\n00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:17.415\nBinary ANDing.\n\n131\n00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:20.785\nAnd it is essentially binary\nmath is what it does.\n\n132\n00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:22.925\nSo we're not gonna go\ninto the details of that.\n\n133\n00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.735\nIf you want to learn more about it,\n\n134\n00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:29.200\nmake sure you check out inside\nof the ITProTV library.\n\n135\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.994\nYou'll find this at the CompTIA Network+.\n\n136\n00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:38.014\nYou'll find this in\nthe Cisco CCENT series that you\n\n137\n00:07:38.014 --> 00:07:43.160\nhave there as well as\nthe Cisco CCNA routing as well.\n\n138\n00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.340\nSo I think we you know in\nthe early days of ITProTV,\n\n139\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.750\nI don't know how many times we\nwe over this concept in one day.\n\n140\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.760\nIt just seem like we're constantly\ndoing it every single day.\n\n141\n00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.466\nBut just make sure you have good\nunderstanding that before you continue to\n\n142\n00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:59.033\nmove on cuz this is essential.\n\n143\n00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:03.101\nNow you probably will see that after we\ntalk of this you can tell Ronny you didn't\n\n144\n00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:04.567\ntalk about this ever again.\n\n145\n00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.192\nI know, but\n\n146\n00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:10.050\nif you don't know the foundations,\nit's really not gonna help you out.\n\n147\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.070\nNormally, when we get this, right?\n\n148\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.320\nThe report and the way that the IP\naddress is looked is fairly simple here.\n\n149\n00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.640\nSo, an IP address normally is reported and\n\n150\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.690\nwhen it looks like anything, it looks\nlight what I've highlighted right here.\n\n151\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.950\nAn IP address with the subnet mask always.\n\n152\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.280\nIf you get an IP address\nwithout the subnet mask,\n\n153\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.080\nit really does not help you out at all,\nespecially when you face an exam cuz you\n\n154\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.890\ndon't know what network that\nIP address may belong to.\n\n155\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.010\nSo it is very important that you always\nsee the IP address and the subnet mask.\n\n156\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.650\nToday, especially a lot in Cisco writings.\n\n157\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.480\nYou'll see it also reported in this\nnotation instead what you may hear\n\n158\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.520\nabout is what we call CIDR notations C-\nI- D- R, Classless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n159\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.430\nAnd it's just an abbreviation okay.\n\n160\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.060\nIt just tells us look\nthe first 16 bits and\n\n161\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.650\nwe go back up to this\nnetwork address up here.\n\n162\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.240\nIt's pretty much saying\nthis portion right here,\n\n163\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.140\nthose first 16 bits\nare the network portion.\n\n164\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.080\nThat's all it's telling you, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.330\nSo, with that in mind, just make sure\nthat you have that concept down and path.\n\n166\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.840\nSo, most of us start now yawning and\nI understand, but\n\n167\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.278\nlet's make sure that we get\nthrough this too, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:29.110\nIPv6, this has changed,\n128 bit binary address and\n\n169\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.440\nthat is because we started\nrealizing something in the mid 80s,\n\n170\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.260\nwe're gonna run out of IP addresses\nif we didn't do something about this.\n\n171\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.280\nSo, the subnet mask did help, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:46.515\nTo prevent the kind of complete downfall\nof the class full of routing that we had,\n\n173\n00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:50.367\nbut then they started\nworking on what we call IPv6\n\n174\n00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:55.252\nwhich change the address based\nto much larger, as what it did.\n\n175\n00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:59.469\nSo with 32 bits we have\na possibility of a little bit under\n\n176\n00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:04.630\n4.3 billion addresses with\nthis particular IP addressing.\n\n177\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.180\nWe have the potential\nof numbers that are so\n\n178\n00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.050\nbig that we cannot actually describe\nthem in any analogy that makes sense.\n\n179\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.610\nOkay and\nthat's literally how big this number is.\n\n180\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.210\nAnd you and\nI were to take a look at it in binary,\n\n181\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.400\nthat's what the number would\nlook like which is right here.\n\n182\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.100\nOkay?\n\n183\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.820\nSo the great thing is even though we'd\nhave to normally learn the binary and\n\n184\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.920\nthe infinite wisdom of the IEEE,\nthe guys who came up with this, said,\n\n185\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.740\nlook we can't do that to people.\n\n186\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.010\nWe can't make them learn this and\nit's not even octets,\n\n187\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.880\nit's 8 sections of 16 bits each.\n\n188\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.230\nSo it's a lot of digits that are in there.\n\n189\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.580\nInstead, it's gonna be Reported\nin Hexadecimal notation.\n\n190\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.070\nAnd make sure you know that as well, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.430\nHexadecimal means you're gonna see\ncharacters A through F and 1 through 9.\n\n192\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.850\nYou see the letters g through z in there?\n\n193\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.835\nIt's not a hexadecimal number.\n\n194\n00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So mark that out completely.\n\n195\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.520\nBut notice everything else\npretty much stays the same.\n\n196\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.240\nYou still have a network portion.\n\n197\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.130\nYou still have an host\nportion is what we have.\n\n198\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.100\nNow we no longer write\nout subnet masks though.\n\n199\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.470\nToday everything instead is done instead\nof what they call CIDR notation.\n\n200\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.450\nIt is what they call a prefix notation.\n\n201\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.050\nAnd the default standard, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.990\nAnother of the default.\n\n203\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.340\nNo matter what address you get, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.230\nIt's gonna be a /64.\n\n205\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.640\nSo half of this address that you\nsee up here, the first 64 bits.\n\n206\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Which is twice\nthe length though [LAUGH].\n\n207\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.600\n&gt;&gt; Which is twice the length\nof the entire IP version for\n\n208\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.840\naddressing space is gonna be\nconsidered your network and\n\n209\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.280\neverybody will be assigned at least that\nas the base standard at this point, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.510\nSo when it gets converted into hexadecimal\n\n211\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.160\nit's gonna instead look something\nlike this, fully written out.\n\n212\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.622\nNow if you take a look at it, that's\na much longer than 10.0.46.1, Ronnie.\n\n213\n00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:08.209\nBut even so, that's the full length of it\nwhich they allow us to also shorten it\n\n214\n00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:13.610\na little bit more and this is what\nyou'll end up seeing as well, okay.\n\n215\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.920\nSo you'll see that shortened abbreviation\nform so those are kinda basics.\n\n216\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.850\nBut the whole idea behind IP addresses and\n\n217\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.170\nwhat also comes along in this, for\nus as far as the headers go, right?\n\n218\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.250\nThis is the main idea is that\nwe have a source address and\n\n219\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.750\nwe have a destination address.\n\n220\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.940\nThis is how we deliver\ndata across machines and\n\n221\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.105\nrouters essentially as what happens here.\n\n222\n00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:40.885\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, I know you're a huge\nsticker for accuracy, you have\n\n223\n00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:45.207\nthe reported hexadecimals, A through F and\n1 through 9, technically 0 through 9.\n\n224\n00:12:45.207 --> 00:12:47.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are correct,\nsorry you were right.\n\n225\n00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:51.538\n&gt;&gt; We will see 0s, what makes you think\nthere won't be any 0s, there are 0s.\n\n226\n00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:53.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, you were right.\n\n227\n00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.852\nAbsolutely missed that one,\ncompletely there.\n\n228\n00:12:55.852 --> 00:13:00.270\nSo make sure you see 0 through 9 there,\ninstead of 1 through 9.\n\n229\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.691\nSo that's just me making\na gigantic typo right there.\n\n230\n00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:04.265\n&gt;&gt; Well we don't count zeros.\n\n231\n00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:04.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zeros.\n\n232\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.749\nThose are for real.\n\n233\n00:13:07.749 --> 00:13:09.064\n&gt;&gt; Who needs those?\n\n234\n00:13:09.064 --> 00:13:09.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n235\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.250\nlet's get into the idea\nof the IPv4 header.\n\n236\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.774\nWell, unlike what we saw on layer two\nwhich was relatively not that many fields,\n\n237\n00:13:18.774 --> 00:13:22.116\nIPv4 pretty much became a mess.\n\n238\n00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:25.267\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a lot going on in that\n\n239\n00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:26.375\ncake, Ronnie.\n\n240\n00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n241\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.910\nI don't mean to say that they messed up.\n\n242\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.720\nBut what essentially ended up\nhappening with IPv4 is simple, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.120\nYou know that the basic protocol.\n\n244\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.680\nRight Daniel?\n\n245\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.650\nIs about delivery, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.320\nMaking sure that it gets to the ultimate\nend machine that it gets to.\n\n247\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.370\nWe know that MAC addresses I can send\nfrom one machine to the other machine\n\n248\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.710\nas long as we're on the same network.\n\n249\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.700\nWe can see that.\n\n250\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.340\nBut if I go across a network\nboundary like a router, it does,\n\n251\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.710\nI can't see the MAC addresses over\nthere so I'm pretty much stopped.\n\n252\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.870\nI can't do anything past that.\n\n253\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:03.420\nWell, that's where IPv4 and\nthe headers actually did come in for us.\n\n254\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.670\nAnd really, kinda began with\nthe simplest idea setting.\n\n255\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.360\nWe really need what?\n\n256\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.000\nA source and destination.\n\n257\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.300\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n258\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.870\nThere's not a lot else that we need.\n\n259\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.870\nBut as networking got a little bit more\ncomplicated, what started happening?\n\n260\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.110\nWell, now that there's actually\ndifferent versions of IP addressing,\n\n261\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.760\nwe need a version header to separate out\nthat this is different than what we need.\n\n262\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.440\nHere's some other information\nbecause they never accounted for\n\n263\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.470\nthe variety of different types\nof packets that we would see.\n\n264\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.500\nIn the beginning, it was like you and\nme sending a document to each other.\n\n265\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.903\nWe didn't count for things like,\nyou know, the music that would go across,\n\n266\n00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:44.310\nthe videos.\n\n267\n00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.450\nEverything else that we would send.\n\n268\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.810\nApplications and\nthe streaming of all the data.\n\n269\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.180\n&gt;&gt; We use the mail\nsystem a lot as an idea.\n\n270\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n271\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.390\n&gt;&gt; Of sending information\ninside of a package, right?\n\n272\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.450\nAn envelope, it has a source and\na destination on it.\n\n273\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.800\nWell, when you start thinking\nabout different types of packages,\n\n274\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.280\nwell now I need a box for this,\nwell I needs a special shipping label.\n\n275\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.600\nWell, if it's priority mail,\n\n276\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.500\nI gotta put that specific stamp on that to\nlet the mail carrier know it's priority.\n\n277\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.440\nThe same kind of idea is applying here\nwith IP as those types of services\n\n278\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.940\nstarted to pop up it had to adjust to\nthe protocol to fit or the header fit.\n\n279\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is amazing here that,\nyou know, essentially it started off with\n\n280\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.619\na great idea of we just need to stop\nthat source and destination address.\n\n281\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.680\nAnd get it there.\n\n282\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.110\nThat works as long as everything\nfits into one envelope.\n\n283\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n284\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.600\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work if now, all of\na sudden, you're doing the priority mail.\n\n285\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.960\nNow like- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I've got a 10,000 page document that I\n\n286\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.860\nwanna mail to Ronnie\nin standard envelopes.\n\n287\n00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.640\nHow do I do that?\n\n288\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.200\nWell, I gotta put ten pieces of paper\nin this envelope and that's number one.\n\n289\n00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.810\nYou gotta start to\nmarking these things off.\n\n290\n00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.650\nAnd then I have to develop\na system that will allow for\n\n291\n00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:00.053\nthat, I didn't get envelope number 323,\ncan you resend that, you know.\n\n292\n00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:01.796\nThose kind of things come into play.\n\n293\n00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:05.817\n&gt;&gt; But that's why this header has\nkinda gotten the unusual, you know,\n\n294\n00:16:05.817 --> 00:16:08.258\nyou're probably saying Are you joking?\n\n295\n00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:10.191\nNo, really, we're not joking.\n\n296\n00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.700\nThere is a ton of information\nas you start seeing this.\n\n297\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.962\nIf you go lengthwise,\nhorizontally across, okay,\n\n298\n00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:20.937\nthis represents 32 bits\nof data going across.\n\n299\n00:16:20.937 --> 00:16:23.868\nAnd then you can see the layers\nas we go through that.\n\n300\n00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:27.533\nIt's a ton of data just in\nthe header information,\n\n301\n00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:30.867\nbefore data gets sent,\nI mean there's a ton.\n\n302\n00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:34.781\nThere's at least 192, so 32,\n\n303\n00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:39.325\n64, 96, 128, 160, 192,\n\n304\n00:16:39.325 --> 00:16:44.400\nmaximum of even 256, I think, of headers.\n\n305\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.424\n256 bytes, not bits.\n\n306\n00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:51.696\n256 bytes of information that can go,\nso you name it,\n\n307\n00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:54.570\nit is a ton that we can have there.\n\n308\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.850\nLet's talk about the headers cuz\nthat's what we really need to get to.\n\n309\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.523\nAnd then we'll show you,\n\n310\n00:16:58.523 --> 00:17:02.795\nhow the heck am I supposed to see\nsome of the stuff is what we'll do.\n\n311\n00:17:02.795 --> 00:17:05.953\nOkay, so right here at the very\nbeginning in the version number.\n\n312\n00:17:05.953 --> 00:17:09.500\nThis is very important here because\nthere's only two version numbers.\n\n313\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.682\nYou need to remember that because in\nan attack, okay, it shouldn't happen.\n\n314\n00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:17.718\nOkay, but there should only be a 4 or\na 6 here, okay,\n\n315\n00:17:17.718 --> 00:17:20.431\nfor the version,\nIP version 4 or IP version 6.\n\n316\n00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:25.757\nIn theory according to RFC 1122, not\nthat you need to know that number, okay.\n\n317\n00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:31.096\nBut any packet with an invalid IP version,\nokay, that arrives at a router.\n\n318\n00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:36.069\nSo not even at the destination, it arrives\nat a router, it's supposed to be dropped.\n\n319\n00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:41.031\nNo sign, no particular packet,\nno notification, nothing, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:46.289\nA router is supposed to see that and\ngo done, it's invalid on this network.\n\n321\n00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:51.218\nSo if you get something like this,\nhopefully this follows the logic, Dan.\n\n322\n00:17:51.218 --> 00:17:55.132\nAnd now all of a sudden it arrives at your\nmachine and you're running Wireshark.\n\n323\n00:17:55.132 --> 00:17:59.219\nAnd you go hey let me look at the version,\nIP version 7.\n\n324\n00:17:59.219 --> 00:18:02.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hm, what do you think Daniel?\n\n325\n00:18:02.444 --> 00:18:03.499\nDo you think somebody's manipulated that?\n\n326\n00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think someone's probably having\na little fun and some tomfoolery is afoot.\n\n327\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.164\nAnd we need to pay attention to it.\n\n328\n00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:12.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very fact is at least\nsomething happened that the RFC said\n\n329\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.630\nshouldn't happen, right?\n\n330\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.231\nWhich says, hey if it's not a 4 or\n6, the router says drop it.\n\n331\n00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:23.787\nSomehow they are able to take at\nleast that one field and say what, 7,\n\n332\n00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:25.830\nrouter doesn't drop it.\n\n333\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.728\nWell, that kind of lets you know\nsomething else may be happening here.\n\n334\n00:18:30.728 --> 00:18:35.399\n[LAUGH] So just even something that\nsimple could be what you want to also pay\n\n335\n00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:39.878\nattention to as you start seeing this in-\n&gt;&gt; Something is rotten in Denmark, Ronnie.\n\n336\n00:18:39.878 --> 00:18:42.314\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something is very rotten in Denmark as\n\n337\n00:18:42.314 --> 00:18:43.780\nyou start to see this.\n\n338\n00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.170\nThe other thing that we also have\nright next to it, of course,\n\n339\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.250\nis the header link field, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.820\nSo this is a 4-bit field on\nthe length of the IP header.\n\n341\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.290\nNow, this is important, as well, because\nwe told you what the limitations are.\n\n342\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.740\nSo if we start to take a look at it,\nright,\n\n343\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:05.180\nbecause of the way that this is going\nacross horizontally, it's the 32 bits.\n\n344\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.832\nAnd unless my math was\nwrong cuz I counted 32,\n\n345\n00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:14.133\n64, 96, 128, 160, 192 and\n\n346\n00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:18.221\nI think there is a possibility of 256.\n\n347\n00:19:18.221 --> 00:19:22.291\nIf you get a header length\nfield that says something,\n\n348\n00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:26.645\nwhat maximum of 256,\nthat should also tell you what?\n\n349\n00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:30.660\nSomebody else has added in additional data\n\n350\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.550\ninto the header that probably\nshouldn't be there, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.762\nSo if it was able to do that,\nnow this does have to have\n\n352\n00:19:36.762 --> 00:19:40.573\na minimum header length of 20,\nmake sure I'm telling you.\n\n353\n00:19:40.573 --> 00:19:45.569\nYeah, 20 bytes, but overall though,\n\n354\n00:19:45.569 --> 00:19:50.437\nokay, it should at least be 20 bytes.\n\n355\n00:19:50.437 --> 00:19:53.470\nBut it shouldn't be over 256\nif I remember correctly.\n\n356\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.990\nSo pay attention right there as well,\nthat is something else\n\n357\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.160\nthat could be taken advantage of too,\nif you start seeing that.\n\n358\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.580\nAnd that means you have to inspect\na little bit more closely.\n\n359\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.801\nAnd type of service,\nthis is the one that gets confusing,\n\n360\n00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:11.443\nbecause you'll see a couple of\ndifferent names for this as well.\n\n361\n00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:17.346\nSo you might end up where inside of\nWireshark it doesn't just say TOS or\n\n362\n00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:18.857\nType of Service.\n\n363\n00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:23.838\nYou end up seeing something that\nsays like this, DSCP or ECM, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:30.250\nThis stands for Data Service Code Point\nand Explicit Congestion Notification.\n\n365\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.065\nBoth of those are different types of\nservice, and what the heck is that about?\n\n366\n00:20:36.065 --> 00:20:40.535\nWell, remember that as I told you that\ndifferent types of data have different\n\n367\n00:20:40.535 --> 00:20:42.685\nrequirements that may have to go on.\n\n368\n00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:45.673\nAnd they use the IP address\nto help deliver that.\n\n369\n00:20:45.673 --> 00:20:50.404\nWell, this is just telling us the type\nof service literally that we might\n\n370\n00:20:50.404 --> 00:20:53.670\nneed according to what is told here.\n\n371\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.577\nSo for example let's take void traffic, or\n\n372\n00:20:56.577 --> 00:21:01.854\nwe can actually take just regular FTP\ntraffic, whatever we want to do, right?\n\n373\n00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:06.976\nWell, one we can say, take as long\nas you want to get there, okay?\n\n374\n00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:12.571\nSo if I'm transferring files\nover to Daniel over FTP, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:15.779\nWell Daniel just knows I just\nhave to wait for it to finish,\n\n376\n00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:18.010\nit takes however long time it is.\n\n377\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.051\nWell, that comes under that\ntype of service as well.\n\n378\n00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:22.830\nIt just says it's gonna\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n379\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.995\nBut if I wanted to prioritize\nthat service, okay,\n\n380\n00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:29.982\nI could change this here,\nexplicit congestion notification.\n\n381\n00:21:29.982 --> 00:21:32.609\nSaying, look as it goes\nacross these devices,\n\n382\n00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:35.510\nlet me say I've experienced\nsome congestion here.\n\n383\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.160\nAnd kind of wrap it around the right\nparticular path it needs to go\n\n384\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.860\nto do whatever else it needs.\n\n385\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.730\nSo it's right here that you also end up\nseeing this type of information as well\n\n386\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:53.358\ninside of that DSCP,\nthe data service code protection point.\n\n387\n00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:55.920\nWe don't tend to see a lot\nof manipulation here\n\n388\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.300\nas it is really not needed right here.\n\n389\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.800\nThe other one, of course, is the overall\ndatagram length or the packet length.\n\n390\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.150\nYou'll see both of those terms here.\n\n391\n00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.560\nI chose the more technical of the two.\n\n392\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.630\nRemember in the OSI Model,\nat layer three we call them packets.\n\n393\n00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.488\nAt layer two, we call them frames.\n\n394\n00:22:13.488 --> 00:22:16.062\nI don't know why I'm going in this order,\n[LAUGH] but\n\n395\n00:22:16.062 --> 00:22:18.118\nlayer four we call them segments, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:18.118 --> 00:22:21.951\nSo segments at layer four,\npackets at layer three, and\n\n397\n00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:25.670\nlayer two frames,\nas far as the OSI Model goes.\n\n398\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.209\nBut inside of the header itself, okay,\nyou may see where people describe this,\n\n399\n00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:33.744\nas like I said, what you call\nthe idea of the total length here,\n\n400\n00:22:33.744 --> 00:22:37.046\nof the entirety of everything\nthat it's sending, okay?\n\n401\n00:22:37.046 --> 00:22:41.769\nI just called it the datagram length\nbecause that's technically more correct at\n\n402\n00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:43.234\nthis particular point.\n\n403\n00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:48.342\nThis is tricky, okay, and\nthe reason why this is tricky,\n\n404\n00:22:48.342 --> 00:22:52.629\nlet's do a kind of exam suggestion hint,\nokay?\n\n405\n00:22:52.629 --> 00:22:55.990\nDaniel, so a little pop up should\nactually appear and then [SOUND].\n\n406\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here is an example that you should pay\n\n407\n00:22:58.781 --> 00:22:59.760\nattention to.\n\n408\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.900\nThere is what we should see.\n\n409\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.022\nSo if you see something like this and\nyou will get weird numbers, right?\n\n410\n00:23:05.022 --> 00:23:09.340\nSo let's go back to the diagram and let me\nkind of show you what I'm talking about.\n\n411\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.185\nRemember I just described header length,\nright, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:19.993\nDatagram length, those two,\nit sounds like it can be a bit confusing,\n\n413\n00:23:19.993 --> 00:23:24.780\nright, 4 bits here okay,\nand versus 16 bits.\n\n414\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.835\nBut the header length is really\ndescribing how long this header is.\n\n415\n00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:32.424\nWhereas the datagram describes this as\nwell as the payload that can be done.\n\n416\n00:23:32.424 --> 00:23:36.943\nSo we have a maximum of 16\nbits here that's actually just\n\n417\n00:23:36.943 --> 00:23:39.438\ndescribing the length, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:44.776\nNow, when we start to see that, if you\nactually start to take a look at that.\n\n419\n00:23:44.776 --> 00:23:51.425\nIt's very easy, okay, to kind of get\nnumbers confused a little bit, right?\n\n420\n00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:54.864\n4 bits here, okay, 2 to the 4th power,\n\n421\n00:23:54.864 --> 00:23:58.794\nyeah, you start to think\nabout stuff like that.\n\n422\n00:23:58.794 --> 00:24:04.000\nAnd then you start getting 16 bits\nhere and you start going 2 to that.\n\n423\n00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.809\nWhat is this actually about?\n\n424\n00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:10.756\nIs it 16, or is it 2 to the 16,\n\n425\n00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:17.079\n65,536 as far as the overall length?\n\n426\n00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:19.500\nAnd that's why you have to\npay attention to the MAC.\n\n427\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.920\nIf they ask you about the overall\nlength of the entire packet,\n\n428\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.270\nmake sure you know that this is 16 bits,\nhere, okay?\n\n429\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.810\nAnd that is what we want, because that's\nactually gonna be 65,000 bytes is gonna be\n\n430\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:40.860\nyour maximum IP data packet that\nyou'll also see right here, too.\n\n431\n00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.150\nDon't get confused.\n\n432\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.966\nDon't try and do this, which is what most\npeople do, go, Ryan actually did this.\n\n433\n00:24:45.966 --> 00:24:51.106\n32, 64, and you start adding up all\nof this stuff and go, all of that.\n\n434\n00:24:51.106 --> 00:24:53.320\nYeah, that's 192.\n\n435\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.180\nDon't do that.\n\n436\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.980\nPay attention to what they're looking for,\n\n437\n00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.330\nwhich is right here under\nthe datagram length itself.\n\n438\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:05.470\nThis particular field, not so\nmuch an attack field for hackers.\n\n439\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.240\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n440\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.670\nAll of a sudden somebody's gonna say\nit is an attack field, and that's fine.\n\n441\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.772\nBut, it's not really\nthe focus of most of them.\n\n442\n00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:16.200\nThis is just reporting what\nthe maximum size is possibly.\n\n443\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.770\nEverything else should be less than that,\nokay?\n\n444\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.750\nSo as we send chunks of data across,\nthe packets itself,\n\n445\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.370\nit shouldn't get any larger\nthan 65,536 bytes, okay?\n\n446\n00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.530\nSo if we start seeing abnormally\nlarge ones, called jumbos, okay?\n\n447\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.220\nAnd if we start seeing little\ntiny ones underneath the,\n\n448\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.740\nlike 42 bytes or so, whatever it is.\n\n449\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.440\nThey're called runts, something like that.\n\n450\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.380\nYeah, I can't remember the thing but\n\n451\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.980\nthey're fairly similar to\nwhat we see there, okay.\n\n452\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.086\nEvery single datagram that is sent\nacross must also essentially come up and\n\n453\n00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:55.270\ngenerate a unique ID number.\n\n454\n00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.640\nOkay, now this unique ID number,\n\n455\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.370\nalong with what we call these different\nflags here, and this fragment offset,\n\n456\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.310\nthese all work together and they all\nhelp us in a lot of different things.\n\n457\n00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.640\nBut, the unique ID number is to almost\nmake sure that we don't lose it in its\n\n458\n00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.290\ntransit as it goes across network and\nalso,\n\n459\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.265\nthese different frags,\nthese different, I keep saying frags.\n\n460\n00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:20.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fragments and\n\n461\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.410\nflags here also help us out, too, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.500\nThese ideas of different\nflags that you might have,\n\n463\n00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.070\nokay, there's what we call\na don't fragment frag.\n\n464\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.295\nDon't fragment flag.\n\n465\n00:26:31.295 --> 00:26:32.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna be able to say it.\n\n466\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a tongue-twister,\nRonnie, isn't it?\n\n467\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.170\n&gt;&gt; It is, my gosh.\n\n468\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.880\nDon't fragment flag, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.460\nAnd then you'll also have\na fragment more flag.\n\n470\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.540\nWell, what the heck is that about?\n\n471\n00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.681\nWell, the very fact is all\ndata is not the same size.\n\n472\n00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:48.775\nJust like what Daniel was describing\na little bit earlier, okay?\n\n473\n00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:54.190\nAnd that means that if now I am ready\nto send out a chunk of data that's\n\n474\n00:26:54.190 --> 00:27:00.110\nbigger than what my maximum datagram\nmay be, well, do I just toss it?\n\n475\n00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.550\nIs that my goal?\n\n476\n00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.040\nNo, the goal is to get it\ndelivered to the other side.\n\n477\n00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.500\nAnd well, how do I do that?\n\n478\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:11.000\nWell all of this information, it is about\nkeeping that identification, right?\n\n479\n00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.429\nSo Daniel's example of the ten page or\nten gig,\n\n480\n00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:18.046\nwhatever it was that we\nsaid a little bit earlier.\n\n481\n00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:22.918\nIf we have to divide that up, well,\nwhat do we actually also put there\n\n482\n00:27:22.918 --> 00:27:26.871\nthat will allow us to be able\nto get it all back together?\n\n483\n00:27:26.871 --> 00:27:31.176\nSo, dividing it all back up\nhere in the 16-bit identifier,\n\n484\n00:27:31.176 --> 00:27:36.062\nsaying where we are actually gonna\nallow for fragmentation to happen.\n\n485\n00:27:36.062 --> 00:27:38.412\nAnd we're saying,\nhere's where it's going to happen and\n\n486\n00:27:38.412 --> 00:27:41.702\nthis is where you're essentially gonna\nstamp every single one of those pieces, so\n\n487\n00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:44.477\nthat the other side's gonna be able\nto put everything back together.\n\n488\n00:27:44.477 --> 00:27:45.810\nThat's fine.\n\n489\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.870\nAnd then, there's also the do not\nfragment flag that can also happen, too.\n\n490\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:57.230\nThis can be a target of what we\ncall an insertion attack, okay?\n\n491\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.425\nInsertion attack essentially changes that,\n\n492\n00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:02.080\nit says look,\nwhat I'm gonna do is say this.\n\n493\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.545\nLook at how big it is,\nI'm not gonna allow it to fragment.\n\n494\n00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:07.450\nWell, what essentially happens\nis it gets larger than this.\n\n495\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.750\nIt's not allowed.\n\n496\n00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:13.135\nSo if I do a do not fragment flag.\n\n497\n00:28:13.135 --> 00:28:14.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna be able to say it.\n\n498\n00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:18.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna do [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna cause\n\n499\n00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:22.040\nsome issues where I might never\nreceive that particular packet.\n\n500\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.240\nSo, just kind of realize that\nthat is something else that can\n\n501\n00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.950\nalso be seen right here.\n\n502\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:34.530\nSo this whole 32 bits right across here,\nreally, it does help in making sure that\n\n503\n00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.140\ndata gets across to where it needs to go,\nespecially when it does need to fragment.\n\n504\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:44.320\nSometimes you do have these unusual\nthings that don't need to fragment, and\n\n505\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.780\nyou just have to take it as it, but\nthose devices also then must be set.\n\n506\n00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.360\nSay, I will accept these.\n\n507\n00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.000\nAnd you will see certain things like that,\n\n508\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.060\nespecially in things like\nsands that are out there.\n\n509\n00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.843\nThe jumbo frames,\nwhen you start doing stuff like that.\n\n510\n00:28:58.843 --> 00:29:00.217\nYou're essentially saying,\n\n511\n00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:03.806\ndon't fragment exactly where this actually\nis saying that needs to be done, but\n\n512\n00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:06.738\njust kind of realize that this is\npart of that stuff that happens.\n\n513\n00:29:06.738 --> 00:29:08.630\n&gt;&gt; But\nthis is a very controlled environment.\n\n514\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.470\n&gt;&gt; Very controlled environment.\n\n515\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.230\n&gt;&gt; We're doing that for\na specific purpose.\n\n516\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.990\nWe're not taking advantage of it for\nmaliciousness.\n\n517\n00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n518\n00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.080\nIf you're setting this,\nit's because you're changing it, and\n\n519\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.260\nnot a machine, normally.\n\n520\n00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A machine will actually be\n\n521\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.561\nthe one that says, and\n\n522\n00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:26.753\nthey'll actually make sure that everything\nelse works the way they want to.\n\n523\n00:29:26.753 --> 00:29:29.470\nBut, just kinda realize\nthat this is a part and\n\n524\n00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.846\nportion of what we end up seeing, okay?\n\n525\n00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:36.545\nNow there are a lot, well,\na few more headers for us to check out.\n\n526\n00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:40.910\nBut I'm realizing something, Daniel, as I\nlooked over my shoulder over here that I\n\n527\n00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:46.772\nhave once again been able to challenge\nthe clock and beaten it, again.\n\n528\n00:29:46.772 --> 00:29:47.380\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n529\n00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.720\n&gt;&gt; Guess it has ticked its last tock for\nthis episode, but\n\n530\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.270\nRonnie has a little bit more for\nus to go through.\n\n531\n00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.981\nAnd when I say a little bit, I probably\nmean probably two more episodes.\n\n532\n00:29:55.981 --> 00:29:56.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:29:56.506 --> 00:29:57.690\n&gt;&gt; So we will have to make room for\n\n534\n00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.770\nthat in a part two,\nmaybe even a part three.\n\n535\n00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.210\nSo definitely join us back for that.\n\n536\n00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.350\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by today.\n\n537\n00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.980\nI appreciate your time and effort.\n\n538\n00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.365\nWe do appreciate our audience out\nthere for as watching, as well.\n\n539\n00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:07.187\nAs for this episode,\n\n540\n00:30:07.187 --> 00:30:09.850\nand like I've said, we're gonna go\nahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n541\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.800\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n542\n00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.720\n&gt;&gt; And I am Ronnie Wong.\n\n543\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.603\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n544\n00:30:14.603 --> 00:30:20.974\n[MUSIC]\n\n545\n00:30:20.974 -->

00:00:08.195\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.040\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.005\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everybody.\n\n6\n00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.159\nWelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.892\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:21.372\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore in our Cisco SECOPS series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:24.788\nJoining us yet again in the studio\nright here for your viewing pleasure,\n\n10\n00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:26.420\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.788\nRonnie, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:30.275\n&gt;&gt; It is going well Daniel,\nthank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:33.042\nhaving me back as we continue\non in this part two.\n\n14\n00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:37.383\nIf not Daniel, you'd be the one that\nactually kind of talking about your\n\n15\n00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:39.173\nfavorite topic in the world.\n\n16\n00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:43.169\nNow, we understand all of us yeah,\nall of us kinda have our-\n\n17\n00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.692\n&gt;&gt; Our niche.\n\n18\n00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:44.251\n&gt;&gt; We have our niche.\n\n19\n00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:44.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:48.352\n&gt;&gt; And this is, I'm not gonna say that\nthis is the most exciting topic in\n\n21\n00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:51.947\nthe world, but it is one that we're\nlearning some good stuff about-\n\n22\n00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:52.748\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n23\n00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:56.355\n&gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of different\nattacks that go on and the things that we\n\n24\n00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.573\ndon't see in the background, and\nwe're kind of jumping into it.\n\n25\n00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:04.933\nYou do need to at least pay attention\nhere and get ready for the exam.\n\n26\n00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.507\nAnd that's kind of the big major\nportion of what we have to do.\n\n27\n00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:10.947\nSo that's where we're picking up from.\n\n28\n00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:14.937\nSo remember that last time we really\njust started diving into some of\n\n29\n00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:19.207\nthe different headers that you see at,\nof course their IP header here and\n\n30\n00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:21.867\nthat's where we will\npick up from right now.\n\n31\n00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.354\nSo let's go and take a look at my screen.\n\n32\n00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:28.972\nLast time we really did talk about pretty\nmuch these first two upper layers here.\n\n33\n00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:30.876\nAnd I wanted to go back for a moment and\n\n34\n00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:34.380\ntalk of the second layer just a little\nbit more because I realized as I\n\n35\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.907\nlooked down on my notes I was like,\nI skipped that completely.\n\n36\n00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:41.945\nSo let me go back and also make\nsure that we understand those, too.\n\n37\n00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:49.297\nBecause of the way that this particular\nlayer, the second one, right?\n\n38\n00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:54.206\nOn the 16-bit identifier,\nwe talked about is the way that it\n\n39\n00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:58.651\nhelps us to be able to identify\nindividual datagrams that\n\n40\n00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:03.297\nwill end up being put back\ntogether as one big piece of data.\n\n41\n00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:07.373\nThe flags,\nI have that Do Not Fragment flag.\n\n42\n00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:11.265\nAnd of course, even the more,\nDaniel's still laughing at me for that.\n\n43\n00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The more fragments as far as\n\n44\n00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:16.211\nthe offset,\nall these are combined together and\n\n45\n00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.461\nwork together very well to ensure that\nwe have smooth delivery of the data.\n\n46\n00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:24.978\nWhen it sends and knows exactly where\nto break it apart, when it gets at\n\n47\n00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:30.122\nthe receiving machine, it knows exactly\nhow to put everything back together.\n\n48\n00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:34.998\nThat is pretty much what this\nparticular 32-bits is about as well.\n\n49\n00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:40.912\nAll right, here in the flags,\nwhich again I'm gonna kinda mangle here.\n\n50\n00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:44.761\nRemember that we can actually have an\ninsertion tag where somebody actually does\n\n51\n00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.788\nchanges the values.\n\n52\n00:02:45.788 --> 00:02:52.361\nAnd one of the ones that could absolutely\nbe a kind of downfall of your network,\n\n53\n00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:57.556\nright, is if these D16-bit\nidentifier also get changed.\n\n54\n00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:01.908\nRemember that because this\nparticular flag itself, right,\n\n55\n00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:05.347\nis designed to help us\nreassemble information.\n\n56\n00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:08.542\nIf somebody is able to come in here and\nmanipulate it,\n\n57\n00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:12.945\nthey don't have to do a heavy\nmanipulation of the 16-bit identifier.\n\n58\n00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:16.488\nAll they have to do and actually do just\na little bit of the manipulation and\n\n59\n00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:20.046\nchange it to now where it doesn't know\nwhat particular piece goes where.\n\n60\n00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:24.975\nSo this is also subject to an attack of\nsomething like an insertion attack as\n\n61\n00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:27.412\nwell in which it can be manipulated.\n\n62\n00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:30.946\nSo be very careful about this, too.\n\n63\n00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:36.091\nThe other portion on the 13-bit\nfrag offset that we also\n\n64\n00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:41.131\nsee in these flags as well is\nthat it can end up helping with\n\n65\n00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:46.178\nsomebody trying to do what we\ncall an ICMP attack as well.\n\n66\n00:03:46.178 --> 00:03:49.935\nInside of this ICMP attack, right?\n\n67\n00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:55.222\nWe can get it to where this\nparticular type of fragment offset,\n\n68\n00:03:55.222 --> 00:04:01.031\ngives us this ability to have ICMP\ngenerate at the other end, right?\n\n69\n00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:06.627\nA reassembly time exceeded command\nwhen it's not really necessary.\n\n70\n00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:10.193\nAnd that just let's whoever\nactually sent it, the attacker,\n\n71\n00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.962\nknow that something else is going on here,\ntoo.\n\n72\n00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:16.674\nSo just pay attention to some of these\nother things that we'll also see.\n\n73\n00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:19.946\nThe Time-To-Live, hey,\nis exactly like it sounds.\n\n74\n00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:24.610\nThis is kinda the loop prevention\nthat we also have setup here, too.\n\n75\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.664\nEvery time a packet goes through a router,\nit has,\n\n76\n00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:33.109\nthe first time it sets\nwhatever the Time-To-LIve is.\n\n77\n00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.677\nSo usually whatever the maximum value is,\nlet's say,\n\n78\n00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:37.870\nI'm just making this up at this point,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.924\nLet's say it's 255, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:44.596\nAt the first router it says I'm setting it\n255, then it goes to another router, and\n\n81\n00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.422\nthen decrements to 254 and\ncontinues to go down.\n\n82\n00:04:47.422 --> 00:04:52.728\nSo we have it where it's 16, the next\none would go through 15, it makes sense.\n\n83\n00:04:52.728 --> 00:04:57.510\nAll right, so Daniel let's talk\nabout which type of attack could end\n\n84\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.981\nup happening here at this\nidea of the time to live.\n\n85\n00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:05.124\nI think about it and\ngo what's the big deal, so what?\n\n86\n00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:09.131\nIt just tells me it's not\ngonna loop forever, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:13.467\nSo I think about it, didn't sound like\nit is really a big deal, does it?\n\n88\n00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:18.017\n&gt;&gt; I would think that the fact that you\nsay, it's not going to loop forever, that\n\n89\n00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:22.325\nshould key something in our brains that\nsays, what if we made it loop forever?\n\n90\n00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.193\nOr we gave it no time at all.\n\n91\n00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:24.774\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n92\n00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:27.738\n&gt;&gt; That kind of thing, and these can\nstart playing havoc on a network,\n\n93\n00:05:27.738 --> 00:05:29.725\nmaybe lead to some sort\nof denial of service.\n\n94\n00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:33.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really can because\nultimately what it's helping\n\n95\n00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.234\nto do of course is get to the other end.\n\n96\n00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:39.586\nIf it never gets to the other end, well\nthen we're actually in a denial of service\n\n97\n00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.453\nagain in not being able to do that.\n\n98\n00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:46.439\nWith this idea of the Time-To-Live,\nwe can manipulate the TTL value to be\n\n99\n00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.013\ntoo low as well,\nbefore it reaches the destination.\n\n100\n00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:52.663\nAnd if you think about that, right?\n\n101\n00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:53.652\nThat's what Daniel is talking about.\n\n102\n00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:57.010\nWe set it too low,\nwell now no packets get there.\n\n103\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.308\nSo imagine that we could go\nto a router that'll say this,\n\n104\n00:06:00.308 --> 00:06:04.310\nmaybe two hops before the destination,\nbefore Daniel's network.\n\n105\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.444\nAnd I'm able to get in there and\nmanipulate something to where I'm saying,\n\n106\n00:06:08.444 --> 00:06:10.640\nI'm gonna change the TTL at this point,\n\n107\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.885\nanything that comes into one\nmaybe goes to this IP address.\n\n108\n00:06:13.885 --> 00:06:18.033\nWell, it's two hops away from Daniel,\nand that means at that router, though,\n\n109\n00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.534\nDaniel might not get data\nthat's coming back and\n\n110\n00:06:20.534 --> 00:06:24.630\nhas got this time limit, and says, no,\nit should make it to the end there.\n\n111\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.580\nAnd it's not gonna make it to the end.\n\n112\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.693\nSo this is where we have something like\nthis that can really kind of trip us up.\n\n113\n00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:34.895\nThe other thing that TTL\nalso helps us with, right?\n\n114\n00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:39.914\nYou take this and of course the IP\nidentity field up here at the top.\n\n115\n00:06:39.914 --> 00:06:44.532\nYou can use that to help spot\na spoofing attack too, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:44.532 --> 00:06:48.659\nNow the reason why is because\na long with the identity, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.019\nIf you start seeing the TTL value, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:55.562\nAnd it's all coming from\nthe same exact source.\n\n119\n00:06:55.562 --> 00:06:58.476\nIn other words the same\nidentifier is identical.\n\n120\n00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.464\nWell, remember that this is\nsupposed to be identical.\n\n121\n00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:02.206\nIf we chop up a block, right?\n\n122\n00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:04.265\nIt's suppose to be\nessentially a serial number,\n\n123\n00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:06.038\nso that you can go and\nkinda reassemble it.\n\n124\n00:07:06.038 --> 00:07:07.812\nBut what if it's identical?\n\n125\n00:07:07.812 --> 00:07:10.445\nLike 16,000 of them and is identical and\n\n126\n00:07:10.445 --> 00:07:12.818\nthe TTL is exactly\nthe same on all of them.\n\n127\n00:07:12.818 --> 00:07:16.675\nWell, they're sending repeating packets\nwhich shouldn't be repeating, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:18.795\nSo somehow this can help you go hey,,\n\n129\n00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:22.190\nsomebody is trying to spoof\nsomething else is going on here.\n\n130\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.968\nSo just kind of be aware.\n\n131\n00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:26.822\nAnd the other thing also in\nthese identifiers, right?\n\n132\n00:07:26.822 --> 00:07:31.067\nBecause of the way that they're also\nrandomly generated at times and\n\n133\n00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:35.166\ndoing what they need to,\nif you start seeing unusual sequencing or\n\n134\n00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:37.745\nvery minute sequencing of these things.\n\n135\n00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:40.770\nWhatever the regular interval is and\nall of a sudden it changes and\n\n136\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.079\nthese values tend to change,\nthen you know something else is going on.\n\n137\n00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:46.526\nNow you're going, Ronnie,\nif we're gonna have to look at that.\n\n138\n00:07:46.526 --> 00:07:47.978\nNot necessarily, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:47.978 --> 00:07:52.888\nBut just trying to let you know that this\nis what people are generally looking for\n\n140\n00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:57.138\nis some of the information that we're\nlikely to see there is that type\n\n141\n00:07:57.138 --> 00:07:58.255\nof information.\n\n142\n00:07:58.255 --> 00:08:00.744\nThe neat thing of course then,\n\n143\n00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:06.040\nalong with the TTL is the next\nvalue that we call protocol, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.370\nThis particular protocol field really\ndoes point towards what we are going\n\n145\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:17.100\nto end up seeing at least the majority\nof the time, TCP and UDP.\n\n146\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.380\nWhich means, it might be pointing to what\nwe're expecting to happen at layer 4.\n\n147\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.640\nBut notice the ICMP is set up here and\n\n148\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.700\nin that, we might assume\nthe ICMP as a layer for protocol.\n\n149\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.080\nBut it is not, ICMP is in an inherently\n\n150\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.740\ninternal portion of\nthe IP protocol itself.\n\n151\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.290\nSo there is a chance that you\nmight see ICMP messages go on or\n\n152\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.470\nyou might see where it says,\ngo to layer four here, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.790\nSo this is what the protocol also tells us\nis what we're normally expecting to see\n\n154\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:01.400\nnext is also what we'll see too, so that's\nthe information that we're likely to see.\n\n155\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.516\nSo there's a lot that we can tell in just\nthe information right there on those\n\n156\n00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:08.043\ndifferent headers that we've talked about.\n\n157\n00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:13.625\nThat may indicate that someone has\nmanipulated our IP packets and\n\n158\n00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.255\nthis could be bad.\n\n159\n00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:19.349\nNow this is the one that I want to get to\ncuz I wanna see Daniel's reaction to this\n\n160\n00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:23.207\ncuz I haven't shown him, I've been\nholding this off as a secret Daniel.\n\n161\n00:09:23.207 --> 00:09:24.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n162\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.120\n&gt;&gt; The checksum header, we know what\nchecksums are for right, Daniel?\n\n163\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's just to make sure that\neverything is what we expect it to be.\n\n164\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so at the beginning, we said\nsomething, we said, let me calculate this,\n\n165\n00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:40.895\nand we calculated, we assigned that value\nto it, I send it to you, and you do what?\n\n166\n00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:42.125\n&gt;&gt; I recalculate the value and\n\n167\n00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:44.695\nthen compare the values to make\nsure that everything is right.\n\n168\n00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:45.575\n&gt;&gt; And they should match.\n\n169\n00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:47.065\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; If they don't match,\n\n170\n00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:48.035\nwe know-\n&gt;&gt; Something's wrong.\n\n171\n00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:49.592\n&gt;&gt; Something is absolutely\nwrong somewhere or\n\n172\n00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:51.525\nsomething has actually changed in there.\n\n173\n00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:55.095\nThe checksum header says, I'm gonna take\na look at all this header information,\n\n174\n00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:58.720\nthat's exactly what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna calculate this.\n\n175\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.770\nAnd so if anything has changed\nbetween the source and destination,\n\n176\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.530\nwhen I send out here's what it should be,\nit arrives at Daniel's machine.\n\n177\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.480\nDaniel's machine says, here at the value\nthat I got and it should match.\n\n178\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n179\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:19.740\n&gt;&gt; Correct okay, what have I told\nyou that this doesn't have to match?\n\n180\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.140\n&gt;&gt; That's an interesting thing,\nthat doesn't even make sense [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.370\n&gt;&gt; And your machine may not\nbe able to figure it out.\n\n182\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.975\n&gt;&gt; That's even more terrifying.\n\n183\n00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:30.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the whole purpose of it is to\n\n184\n00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:34.200\nmake sure that it does match and\nthat your computer can figure that out.\n\n185\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have to dive into\nthis a little bit more then, right?\n\n186\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.242\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, yes?\n\n187\n00:10:38.242 --> 00:10:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Because it freaked me out too when\nI first saw it, I was like, what?\n\n188\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.595\nAnd it's because of the way that\nthe checksum is done, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n190\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.450\nthe way that we do the checksum here,\nlet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n191\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.332\nHere's the way that the calculation works\nat now this is not the same as the TCP\n\n192\n00:10:56.332 --> 00:10:58.920\nchecksum, so\nthat's a little bit different, okay.\n\n193\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.676\nBut at later three though,\nwe can do this here,\n\n194\n00:11:02.676 --> 00:11:08.550\nin TCP/IP,\nthe data is divided into 16 bit fields.\n\n195\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.126\nEach field does what we call\na ones complement operation and\n\n196\n00:11:12.126 --> 00:11:15.501\nthen complements are added together for\nthe checksum.\n\n197\n00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:19.321\nLet's make sure that we understand this,\nso this is where you and I map, you and\n\n198\n00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:23.100\nI are on agreement, it's not our best,\nit's not our strongest soup.\n\n199\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.487\n&gt;&gt; Two plus two is chicken\nif I'm not mistaken [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:29.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not that bad yet\nI'm gonna get there [INAUDIBLE],\n\n201\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.572\nI assume I'm gonna get there.\n\n202\n00:11:30.572 --> 00:11:32.270\n&gt;&gt; I can count to potato [LAUGH].\n\n203\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.098\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what is a compliment,\nwell let's just take look at these\n\n204\n00:11:37.098 --> 00:11:42.360\nfirst four bits, let me see if I can\nzoom in so that we can take a look.\n\n205\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.371\nSo what I've done is showed you\nessentially the [INAUDIBLE], Daniel,\n\n206\n00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.293\nnotice that here, let's say that\nthese are our hex values, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:48.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n208\n00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:51.447\n&gt;&gt; 5600, so the first 16 bits,\n\n209\n00:11:51.447 --> 00:11:57.230\nthe first four bits of it representing\nthe five, that's five in binary, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense?\n\n211\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.950\nOkay, the compliment to this is\nwhat essentially makes it all 1.\n\n212\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.752\nSo if we go over here\nto this yellow portion,\n\n213\n00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:06.820\nnotice it's essentially the opposite,\nright?\n\n214\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n215\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.127\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen let's take a look at the second one,\n\n216\n00:12:10.127 --> 00:12:14.895\nif this represents a six, that seems-\n&gt;&gt; They're doing\n\n217\n00:12:14.895 --> 00:12:17.786\nthe opposite thing of what we\nsee on the hex side of things.\n\n218\n00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:22.887\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so the way that that ends up\nworking out is that every value that\n\n219\n00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:28.362\ncomes across in the header, that we\ntake that data and we go ahead and go.\n\n220\n00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:31.943\nAll right, here's all the hex values,\nlet's change it to binary,\n\n221\n00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:34.850\nlet's pull out the complement of it.\n\n222\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.496\nAnd the way that we verify that in\nthe checksum is we do a binary ANDing,\n\n223\n00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:42.970\nnot on this but on the complement.\n\n224\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.011\nSo if we do that,\nhere is the value that we end up with,\n\n225\n00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:52.874\nremember that binary ending, a one and\none is the only thing that gives you one.\n\n226\n00:12:52.874 --> 00:12:53.719\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n227\n00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:55.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're good with that.\n\n228\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.231\n&gt;&gt; I'm following you so far,\nlet's see where you're going with this.\n\n229\n00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:05.293\n&gt;&gt; So we're good,\nnow notice the way that the value\n\n230\n00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:09.760\ncame in when we did that 5600 004D.\n\n231\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.855\nWhat happens though if I change it here,\nis that actually the same exact value?\n\n232\n00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:17.464\nI would say no.\n\n233\n00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:21.882\n&gt;&gt; No, you and I would agree, there's\nno way that this is the same value,\n\n234\n00:13:21.882 --> 00:13:24.545\nit is impossible that\nit is the same value.\n\n235\n00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:28.740\n&gt;&gt; That little light bulb just went off\nin my head because of the binary ANDing.\n\n236\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.212\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if we take a look at this,\nit is the same thing,\n\n237\n00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:37.796\nall I did is literally actually copied and\npasted it down.\n\n238\n00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:41.377\nBut then, when I do the complements here,\n\n239\n00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:46.165\ntake a look at these green numbers,\nthey are identical.\n\n240\n00:13:46.165 --> 00:13:48.733\n&gt;&gt; The same,\nbecause of the way the ANDing works.\n\n241\n00:13:48.733 --> 00:13:50.652\n&gt;&gt; Because of the way\nthat ANDing works and\n\n242\n00:13:50.652 --> 00:13:54.240\nbecause of the way it does a checksum\nwhich is on the complementary ones.\n\n243\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.590\nIt's not doing it based on the data and\nthe order that it received,\n\n244\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.370\nit's doing it based on the compliment and\nthe ANDing process between them.\n\n245\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.780\n&gt;&gt; I wonder who did not figure\nthis out the day they were, well\n\n246\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.116\nwe'll just make a compliment and binary,\nAND that and we're off to the races.\n\n247\n00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Bill, that's probably not gonna work.\n\n248\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.590\n&gt;&gt; It sounds scary.\n\n249\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.939\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It really does, but\n\n250\n00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:22.142\nthat's why we have layer four checksums,\n\n251\n00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:26.564\nthat's why we have other things like the\nframe check sequence, that's why we have-\n\n252\n00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:29.047\n&gt;&gt; Frame check sequence,\n\n253\n00:14:29.047 --> 00:14:31.658\nthat's sketchy [LAUGH].\n\n254\n00:14:31.658 --> 00:14:35.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a super\nsketch system right there and\n\n255\n00:14:35.228 --> 00:14:37.255\nis not worth a hill of beans.\n\n256\n00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:39.738\n&gt;&gt; But yet, you can see why somebody\nmight think that they could take\n\n257\n00:14:39.738 --> 00:14:40.766\nadvantage of this.\n\n258\n00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:41.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n259\n00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:45.936\n&gt;&gt; So taking advantage of this probably\nis not as, I'm gonna say this and\n\n260\n00:14:45.936 --> 00:14:49.400\nwe're gonna get emails about,\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n261\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.390\nIt's probably not as harmful as we think\nbecause of the other check sums that\n\n262\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.613\nare normally in place, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:53.613 --> 00:14:57.412\nBut if somebody were able to manipulate\nthat, what should end up happening, right,\n\n264\n00:14:57.412 --> 00:15:00.210\nis they go to layer four,\nthat should catch it, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.687\nAt layer two, the frame check should go,\nno, something else has changed in here.\n\n266\n00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:10.061\nBut if we get to this point where we can\nmanipulate this portion inside the IP\n\n267\n00:15:10.061 --> 00:15:15.715\nheader to do this, now don't get me wrong,\nthis is pretty darn interesting.\n\n268\n00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:20.872\nHow it's the same numbers as far\nas the individual 4 bits goes,\n\n269\n00:15:20.872 --> 00:15:23.450\nbut if you take [INAUDIBLE] that is\n\n270\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.819\na totally different number than-\n&gt;&gt; The order in which they're in makes\n\n271\n00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:31.220\na big difference especially when you\nget down in the machine language\n\n272\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, until it comes to ANDing [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, until it comes ANDing, [LAUGH]\nOn a complement, on the actual number.\n\n274\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.783\n&gt;&gt; On the complement, then yeah, this is\nwhere it gets a little bit more unusual\n\n275\n00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:44.049\nhere, so Daniel, what do you think?\n\n276\n00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:47.011\n&gt;&gt; Weird, to say at least.\n\n277\n00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:50.545\n&gt;&gt; That's putting it mildly all right,\nthat's putting it mildly.\n\n278\n00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:55.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, all of a sudden\nit's goes, no, what's going on here?\n\n279\n00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:58.069\nBut yeah, just inspect it and realize.\n\n280\n00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:02.949\nRemember that, people are always freaked\nout by this, and I know, it sounds like,\n\n281\n00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:03.513\nreally?\n\n282\n00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:09.979\nAnd then after talking with people and\nfinally being remind of history,\n\n283\n00:16:09.979 --> 00:16:14.539\nIP version 4 is not about security,\nit never was.\n\n284\n00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.971\n&gt;&gt; It's about moving data,\nthat's all it cares about really.\n\n285\n00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.265\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, in other words when we talk\nabout security and all the other things\n\n286\n00:16:21.265 --> 00:16:25.709\nthat we put on, VPN and all the other\nthings, that's stacked on top of this.\n\n287\n00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:29.486\nSo when we start looking,\nlike go, crud, you mean?\n\n288\n00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.358\nYes, yes I do.\n\n289\n00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:36.364\nBut at the same time it really wasn't\ndesigned with security in mind.\n\n290\n00:16:36.364 --> 00:16:39.583\nIt wasn't designed,\nsecurity was not integral part.\n\n291\n00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:41.968\nBecause they just thought,\nwe're just moving documents back and\n\n292\n00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:42.999\nforth across the Internet.\n\n293\n00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:48.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel wants RFC 1099 or\n\n294\n00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:54.144\nwhatever it is, okay,\nwell let's send it across.\n\n295\n00:16:54.144 --> 00:16:57.146\n&gt;&gt; Then it became, let's send this top\nsecret document across this new network\n\n296\n00:16:57.146 --> 00:16:58.312\nthing they've come up with.\n\n297\n00:16:58.312 --> 00:17:00.625\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what happened?\n\n298\n00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:05.457\nThey started going, well, it's not\ndesigned to carry secret information and\n\n299\n00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:09.291\nwe can't change it because that\nwould break everything else.\n\n300\n00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.155\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:10.666\n&gt;&gt; So what'd they do?\n\n302\n00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:14.011\nThey started stacking\nthe security on top of this.\n\n303\n00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:19.678\nAnd that's the position that we're in with\nIP version 4 is that that's exactly what\n\n304\n00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:24.890\nis happening here when we start to take\na look and see some of this information.\n\n305\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.571\nSo don't be super paranoid about this.\n\n306\n00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:31.328\nBut realize, everything that\nI showed you in IP version 4,\n\n307\n00:17:31.328 --> 00:17:34.299\nif there is a layer that you wanna\nstart off with as a beginner and,\n\n308\n00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:36.479\nwhat am I saying,\nI shouldn't be saying this.\n\n309\n00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:39.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, to look at simply,\n\n310\n00:17:39.869 --> 00:17:42.540\nit's right here, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.416\nAll of this stuff that we talked about,\nDaniel,\n\n312\n00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:49.149\ndid any of it sound like I told you\nyou gotta learn how to do this?\n\n313\n00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:52.182\nBabylonian mathmatic,\nline up the stars exactly perfect?\n\n314\n00:17:52.182 --> 00:17:53.365\n&gt;&gt; It's not quantum physics, right?\n\n315\n00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.093\nYeah.\n\n316\n00:17:55.093 --> 00:17:58.579\nBut it's easy enough to point out and\nit makes sense in everything that we\n\n317\n00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:01.678\ntalk about why it would be manipulated,\nwhy [INAUDIBLE] do that.\n\n318\n00:18:01.678 --> 00:18:06.012\nSo layer 4 is actually an easier one for\nus to be able to understand and\n\n319\n00:18:06.012 --> 00:18:07.451\ntake a look at as well.\n\n320\n00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:11.738\nSo understanding that is not\nthe same as actually going,\n\n321\n00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:15.147\nall right, so\nhow do I see this information?\n\n322\n00:18:15.147 --> 00:18:17.800\nHow do I know when we\nstart to take a look at?\n\n323\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.511\nWell, the great thing is\nwe can pull up Wireshark.\n\n324\n00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes we can.\n[LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.788\n&gt;&gt; And so in Wireshark I went ahead and\n\n326\n00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:25.438\nended a previous capture on our network.\n\n327\n00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.949\nWe have a lot of this P2P stuff,\nwhich is fine.\n\n328\n00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:32.316\nI'm just gonna put up just a regular\njust TCP stream packet here.\n\n329\n00:18:32.316 --> 00:18:34.377\nI don't care which one it actually is.\n\n330\n00:18:34.377 --> 00:18:37.071\nSo I'm just gonna select that first one.\n\n331\n00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:40.883\nAnd what I'm really concerned about\nis right here in the center details.\n\n332\n00:18:40.883 --> 00:18:44.932\nAnd the reason why is that remember\nthat what we can see here, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:48.131\nSo this is just kind of a reminder.\n\n334\n00:18:48.131 --> 00:18:53.552\nWhen we start to take a look at this and\nthe OSI model break down.\n\n335\n00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:58.056\nWhen we start talking about Frame and\nEthernet II, Frame is pretty much,\n\n336\n00:18:58.056 --> 00:18:59.885\nnotice how they describe it.\n\n337\n00:18:59.885 --> 00:19:01.150\nOn the wire.\n\n338\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.583\nWell, wire is what?\n\n339\n00:19:02.583 --> 00:19:03.549\nPhysical layer.\n\n340\n00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:07.927\nThey're saying, here's what it\nactually came across, 181 bytes.\n\n341\n00:19:07.927 --> 00:19:10.346\nBits and bytes,\nthat's what goes across the wire.\n\n342\n00:19:10.346 --> 00:19:12.938\nThat is just plain layer one information.\n\n343\n00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:17.377\nAnd it just tells you some layer\none details of stuff, makes sense.\n\n344\n00:19:17.377 --> 00:19:20.646\nLayer two, we kind of examined\nthis in previous episodes as well.\n\n345\n00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:23.925\nRemember that that's what we're\nlooking at here is layer two data.\n\n346\n00:19:23.925 --> 00:19:27.053\nSo if you want to follow along in\nthe OSI model and understand it better,\n\n347\n00:19:27.053 --> 00:19:28.110\nthis is the way to do it.\n\n348\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.785\nThe OSI model,\nit really is actually working in this way.\n\n349\n00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:33.980\nThere's layer one, there's layer two.\n\n350\n00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.883\nLayer three and now notice,\nDaniel, look at that first field.\n\n351\n00:19:38.883 --> 00:19:39.745\n&gt;&gt; IPV4.\n\n352\n00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:44.536\n&gt;&gt; There it is and\nlook at Version right here, Version 4.\n\n353\n00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:51.395\nAnything else that's different, tells me\nbesides 4 or 6, something else is wrong.\n\n354\n00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:55.941\nNotice also there's that header\nlink field that we can examine and\n\n355\n00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:57.570\nwe are taking a look at.\n\n356\n00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.941\nAnd remember I told you that the idea\nthat TOS, you may see it sometimes.\n\n357\n00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:06.531\nBut here, at least in the capture\nthat I did on my Mac right here,\n\n358\n00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:11.377\nit actually separated it out into\nthat Designated Services field.\n\n359\n00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.759\nAnd notice how they\nseparated it into these two.\n\n360\n00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:18.493\nAnd so even though this is\neight bytes all together,\n\n361\n00:20:18.493 --> 00:20:22.042\nECM is two bits, DSCP is six bits here,\n\n362\n00:20:22.042 --> 00:20:26.904\nthere's the total length\nthat we've talked about.\n\n363\n00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:32.216\nThe identification, remember this\nparticular number can also be manipulated.\n\n364\n00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:33.872\nAs well as these numbers too.\n\n365\n00:20:33.872 --> 00:20:38.298\nThere's those flags that I'm never\ngonna be able to say [LAUGH].\n\n366\n00:20:38.298 --> 00:20:42.686\nSo here you see that don't fragment and\nmore fragment bit,\n\n367\n00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.128\nreserved bits that are set\nif you don't need.\n\n368\n00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:48.495\nNotice that this one is actually\nset to not fragment and\n\n369\n00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:50.769\nthat's because it's\nprobably relatively small.\n\n370\n00:20:50.769 --> 00:20:53.144\nYeah, 181 in length all together.\n\n371\n00:20:53.144 --> 00:20:58.321\nSo this one's actually relatively small\nand it doesn't need to fragment it at all.\n\n372\n00:20:58.321 --> 00:20:59.473\nOoh, what did I just do?\n\n373\n00:20:59.473 --> 00:21:00.434\nOkay, there it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:21:00.434 --> 00:21:01.417\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, where'd I go?\n\n375\n00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:03.307\nFragment offset,\nwe didn't need any fragment offset.\n\n376\n00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:04.530\nEverything was fine.\n\n377\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.938\nTime to live, 64.\n\n378\n00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:09.321\nKind of a default for a lot of machine.\n\n379\n00:21:09.321 --> 00:21:12.360\nNot everyone, I don't think Windows is 64.\n\n380\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.191\nI could be wrong.\n\n381\n00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:16.303\nThere's the protocol, TCP here.\n\n382\n00:21:16.303 --> 00:21:19.889\nChecksum, right there\non the header checksum.\n\n383\n00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:23.039\nNotice that validation has\nbeen disabled on this one.\n\n384\n00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:23.727\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's garbage.\n\n385\n00:21:23.727 --> 00:21:26.595\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well on the header checksum it's\n\n386\n00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:29.413\nokay, it's on the other\npart that we worry about.\n\n387\n00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:34.239\nBut just kinda realize that there is a lot\nof information that you do end up seeing\n\n388\n00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:34.897\nhere too.\n\n389\n00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:38.336\nSource and destination IP, that's what\nwe still have left to talk about.\n\n390\n00:21:38.336 --> 00:21:42.889\nAnd that's what we want to make sure\nthat we also talk about right here too.\n\n391\n00:21:42.889 --> 00:21:46.276\nSo we might think, at this point, Daniel,\n\n392\n00:21:46.276 --> 00:21:50.943\nthat the idea of actually the IP\naddresses or the IP numbers,\n\n393\n00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:55.353\nwhat kind of attack can they\ndo with something like this?\n\n394\n00:21:55.353 --> 00:21:57.288\nWhy does it actually matter?\n\n395\n00:21:57.288 --> 00:22:00.047\nWell when you start inspecting this,\n\n396\n00:22:00.047 --> 00:22:04.107\nthis is one of those fields\nthat we call the five tuples.\n\n397\n00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:06.843\nOnce again I have no clue how they\npronounce it, I'll never will.\n\n398\n00:22:06.843 --> 00:22:10.418\n&gt;&gt; Justin did a whole dissertation\non is it tuples or tuples, and\n\n399\n00:22:10.418 --> 00:22:13.118\nhe had like pros and\ncons for both iterations.\n\n400\n00:22:13.118 --> 00:22:15.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think both are accepted.\n\n401\n00:22:15.024 --> 00:22:19.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very fact that there's\na dissertation on it let's you know that\n\n402\n00:22:19.578 --> 00:22:22.197\nnobody's really kind of decided on this.\n\n403\n00:22:22.197 --> 00:22:26.394\nBut there's five, essentially,\nfields of information that we need.\n\n404\n00:22:26.394 --> 00:22:31.416\nMake sure that everything is source and\ndestination IP address,\n\n405\n00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:35.263\nsource and\ndestination Mac address, protocol.\n\n406\n00:22:35.263 --> 00:22:39.989\nWhen you hear the term five tuples,\nsource, destination IP address,\n\n407\n00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:43.315\nsource and\ndestination Mac address, protocol.\n\n408\n00:22:43.315 --> 00:22:47.936\nThat should just be a bell ringer\nwhen you hear that term tuple,\n\n409\n00:22:47.936 --> 00:22:50.472\ntuple, whatever, bell ringer.\n\n410\n00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:52.446\nJust think about that, know that.\n\n411\n00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:54.281\nI don't know why I'm repeating it so\nmuch, Daniel.\n\n412\n00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:58.242\nIt's a possibility-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you're trying to emphasize.\n\n413\n00:22:58.242 --> 00:22:59.178\nMaybe, just maybe.\n\n414\n00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:00.577\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not.\n\n415\n00:23:00.577 --> 00:23:03.948\nThere is an emphasis there\nthat you want to make sure.\n\n416\n00:23:03.948 --> 00:23:05.631\nI don't know why we have\nto use those terms.\n\n417\n00:23:05.631 --> 00:23:07.709\nBut it's a good term cuz\nit actually tells me,\n\n418\n00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:10.120\nI have to keep repeating\nfive fields of information.\n\n419\n00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.864\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's using old Hebrewisms.\n\n420\n00:23:11.864 --> 00:23:12.376\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n421\n00:23:12.376 --> 00:23:14.272\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Truly, truly I say unto you.\n\n422\n00:23:14.272 --> 00:23:16.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:18.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, pretty much.\n\n424\n00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:19.992\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:23:19.992 --> 00:23:22.417\n&gt;&gt; So just make sure you know that.\n\n426\n00:23:22.417 --> 00:23:25.492\nBut this is kind of\nthe interesting information here.\n\n427\n00:23:25.492 --> 00:23:29.141\nRemember that from this\nparticular point here,\n\n428\n00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:34.041\nIP addresses from the same network\nentering in from the outside.\n\n429\n00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:37.842\nNot that that's a bad thing but\nbe careful.\n\n430\n00:23:37.842 --> 00:23:42.884\nIf you get the same one from the outside\nand you are not expecting it.\n\n431\n00:23:42.884 --> 00:23:46.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Things that make me go, hm.\n\n432\n00:23:46.315 --> 00:23:47.639\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n433\n00:23:47.639 --> 00:23:51.601\nit's okay if we know that\nwe know the majority of it.\n\n434\n00:23:51.601 --> 00:23:53.002\nIf I'm connecting to a partner,\n\n435\n00:23:53.002 --> 00:23:55.712\nI should know what their other IP\naddresses are that are coming.\n\n436\n00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:59.653\nIf I'm connecting to a particular website\nand that seems right I should go, okay,\n\n437\n00:23:59.653 --> 00:24:01.019\nI can kind of identify that.\n\n438\n00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:05.727\nBut if I start getting strange IP\naddresses that I'm really not recognizing,\n\n439\n00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:08.580\nand they are constantly\nhammering at the door,\n\n440\n00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.460\nsaying I should get into your network.\n\n441\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.740\nI'm going,\ndo we have a connection somewhere?\n\n442\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.150\nAnd you're what, I don't know that at all.\n\n443\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.580\nAt least that should kind of go,\nhey, something's wrong.\n\n444\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nespecially when it comes to the source, or\n\n445\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.300\nat least the destination port,\nwhether they're trying to get into.\n\n446\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.432\nI'm not a web service company, so\nwhy are they knocking on port 80?\n\n447\n00:24:32.432 --> 00:24:34.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have any SSH enabled for\n\n448\n00:24:34.918 --> 00:24:38.970\noutside forces, so\nwhy is SSH being nailed by this weird IP?\n\n449\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so yeah, all that stuff\nreally does kind of help us.\n\n450\n00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.830\nAnd we have to think about this, too.\n\n451\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.600\nSo just take a look at\nsomething like that as well.\n\n452\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.380\nThe other thing you should never see here,\nDan, it sounds logical enough when\n\n453\n00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.210\nwe think about it, but\nuntil you actually see it,\n\n454\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.726\nit doesn't because you and\nI know the loopback address, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:01.726 --> 00:25:02.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n456\n00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:03.177\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n457\n00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:04.833\n127 117.\n\n458\n00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1270.0.1, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.160\nWell, that sounds great.\n\n460\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.430\nAll of us use it at one point or\nanother for something, okay?\n\n461\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Testing usually.\n\n462\n00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Testing.\n\n463\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n464\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:22.320\nI should never see it as a source from\nthe outside of my network coming in.\n\n465\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.776\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should be an impossibility.\n\n466\n00:25:24.776 --> 00:25:25.742\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:25:25.742 --> 00:25:26.613\n&gt;&gt; Seeing as that\n\n468\n00:25:26.613 --> 00:25:28.935\nis the address of your local adapter,\n\n469\n00:25:28.935 --> 00:25:33.255\nI don't know how the heck it would\never be from outside of my computer.\n\n470\n00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:34.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n471\n00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.510\nif you start seeing this as being\nthe source of data that's coming in and\n\n472\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.000\nall this other stuff?\n\n473\n00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.260\nYeah, and it has a payload?\n\n474\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.380\nSomething else is wrong.\n\n475\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.280\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n[LAUGH] Again, things that make you go hm.\n\n476\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.430\n&gt;&gt; So we should never see 127.0.0.1,\n\n477\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:52.691\nour home address as being the source\nthat we're also getting as well.\n\n478\n00:25:52.691 --> 00:25:57.230\nInternet traffic, also Internet traffic,\nremember, that's key.\n\n479\n00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.900\nComing off the Internet,\n\n480\n00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.670\nit should never really come from\na private IP address as well, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.110\nSo if it's coming across the router and\n\n482\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.040\nit's still giving you those\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n483\n00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.723\nThey'll go no big deal, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:10.723 --> 00:26:11.391\nThat shouldn't be happening.\n\n485\n00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:12.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n486\n00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:15.085\nif you know anything about\nnetworking at all, you're like,\n\n487\n00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:16.319\nhow is that even possible?\n\n488\n00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:18.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not how this works.\n\n489\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.145\nThat's not how any of this works.\n\n490\n00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:23.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does mean that\nsomebody's comprised your network more\n\n491\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:23.630\nthan you think.\n\n492\n00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.370\nThat's what it really means.\n\n493\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.380\nBut just kinda realize,\nif you're getting traffic like that,\n\n494\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.090\nsomething else is going on from the way\nthat you shouldn't be worrying about.\n\n495\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.560\nAlso, traffic that is leaving, okay,\n\n496\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.240\nshould never have a different IP\nsubnet range than the one that you're\n\n497\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.540\nactually on from that thicker one or\nfrom a loopback.\n\n498\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.490\nYou shouldn't have to worry\nabout anything like that.\n\n499\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.510\nSo check that out as well.\n\n500\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.880\nIt should not actually be that way, too.\n\n501\n00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.710\nAnd then, of course, if you get broadcasts\nthat are coming through a router or\n\n502\n00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.920\nyou're actually sending out broadcasts and\nyour router is passing it on,\n\n503\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.240\nsomething else maybe happening as well.\n\n504\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.180\nSo just make sure that when you take\na look at it, it's not that all broadcasts\n\n505\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:11.330\nare bad, but at the same time unless you\nhave explicitly allowed for a broadcast\n\n506\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.850\nto go across your router, you're probably\nnot supposed to have it that way.\n\n507\n00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.640\nBecause the default is don't let\nbroadcasts go across the router.\n\n508\n00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.010\nAnd if you go, hey,\na broadcast has gone across my router.\n\n509\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.538\nI didn't think that that\nwas supposed to happen.\n\n510\n00:27:24.538 --> 00:27:26.642\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're right.\n\n511\n00:27:26.642 --> 00:27:29.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should kind of alarm you\n\n512\n00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.970\njust a little bit as you start\nto see the information, okay?\n\n513\n00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.808\nSo take some time.\n\n514\n00:27:35.808 --> 00:27:37.530\nOpen up Wireshark and\n\n515\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.300\njust take a look at these different\nvalues that you do see here.\n\n516\n00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.880\nAnd notice that we can see all of them,\nokay?\n\n517\n00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.390\nEach one of those headers, it's not\nthat you're learning a ton at this point\n\n518\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.020\nfrom this, but at least from\nthe descriptions that we gave you,\n\n519\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.420\nit will help you out to be able to\nunderstand this a little bit more, okay?\n\n520\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:00.050\nAll right, so Daniel, that is,\nat least at this point,\n\n521\n00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.220\neverything, at least the basics of\n\n522\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.500\ndoing a little bit of intrusion analysis\non the IP version 4 headers, okay?\n\n523\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.760\nBut we did begin with IP version 4 and\nIP version 6.\n\n524\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.660\n&gt;&gt; Don't leave them out.\n\n525\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna leave them out.\n\n526\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.814\nAnd I love that she jumped right in that,\nbut once again, Daniel,\n\n527\n00:28:17.814 --> 00:28:19.631\nI have raced the clock and\nI have won again.\n\n528\n00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n529\n00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:23.161\nI think we're gonna have\nto do a part three here.\n\n530\n00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The quick and nimble, Ronnie Wong,\n\n531\n00:28:25.263 --> 00:28:27.270\nladies and gentlemen,\nat your beck and call.\n\n532\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.512\nNo problem,\nwe'll definitely roll that part three in.\n\n533\n00:28:29.512 --> 00:28:32.346\nWe wanna make sure that all\nthe information necessary for\n\n534\n00:28:32.346 --> 00:28:33.999\nyou out there who are studying for\n\n535\n00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:37.677\nthis exam have it and are equipped with\nit so that you can go pass that exam.\n\n536\n00:28:37.677 --> 00:28:39.508\nRonnie, thanks so much for\ndropping by today.\n\n537\n00:28:39.508 --> 00:28:41.120\nAgain, we appreciate that.\n\n538\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.146\nWe appreciate our viewers for\nwatching as well.\n\n539\n00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:44.980\nI hope you have enjoyed this episode.\n\n540\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.392\nBut it is time for us to sign off.\n\n541\n00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:48.620\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n542\n00:28:48.620 -->

episode of ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:22.632\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and it's\nobserve back in our Cisco SECOPS series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:26.544\nJoining us back in studio yet again\nlending his expertise on this very topic,\n\n8\n00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:28.303\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:29.127\nRonnie, glad to have you again.\n\n10\n00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:29.995\nHow's it going sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:30.996\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.659\nThank you once again for\n\n13\n00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.740\nhaving me back as we now have trekked\nthrough a bit of the IP headers here.\n\n14\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have waded\nour way through it.\n\n15\n00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:41.747\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have,\nthere's a ton of information,\n\n16\n00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:46.632\nmake sure you check out the first two\nepisodes in this little miniseries here.\n\n17\n00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:51.323\nI cannot overemphasize that enough,\nespecially as you're preparing for\n\n18\n00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:55.499\nsome of the intrusion analysis\nportions of the Cisco SECOPS exam.\n\n19\n00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.988\nSo make sure you go back and\nwatch those as well.\n\n20\n00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:01.992\nNow IPV6,\nthat is what we're jumping into next.\n\n21\n00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:03.707\nWe've all ready talked about IPV4.\n\n22\n00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.540\nWe're moving into the realm of IPv6.\n\n23\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.102\nThis is where it gets,\n\n24\n00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:12.803\nmost people get a little bit scared\nbecause it does look different.\n\n25\n00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:16.702\nIt sounds insanely foreign\nto everything that we do.\n\n26\n00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.903\nAnd then we take a look at\nthe headers it even looks different.\n\n27\n00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:24.120\nLet me see if I can kinda do a side by\nside here but let our close as we can do.\n\n28\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.403\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat we're normally used to seeing.\n\n29\n00:01:27.403 --> 00:01:30.051\nSo here it is,\nin the IP version four header,\n\n30\n00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:34.379\nwe've already gone through this\ndescription in the first couple of parts\n\n31\n00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:38.177\nof this little mini-series here\nthat we've had on IP headers.\n\n32\n00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:38.973\nAll right,\n\n33\n00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:43.917\nthis is the typical IP version four\nheader when we take a look here, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:48.777\nIn IP version 6 the headers\nare simplified a lot more, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:52.583\nNow why are people so\nthen when we start talking about,\n\n36\n00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.824\nthey seem to treat as\na such of a foreign beast.\n\n37\n00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:59.033\nIt's still in the realm of IP,\nthe Internet protocol.\n\n38\n00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.435\nThe big differences here,\nreally happen to be of course the,\n\n39\n00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:07.668\nat least the main difference is\nthe size of the IEP source and\n\n40\n00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:12.764\ndestination address, which I'm\napparently not gonna be able to say.\n\n41\n00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:16.004\nBut those are kind of about\nthe two biggest ones,\n\n42\n00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.861\nas well as what we call extension headers.\n\n43\n00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.622\nAnd I've tried to make this to look\nwhere it's not actually a solid box.\n\n44\n00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:26.860\nSo the reason why is that that one\nis not exactly set in stone in\n\n45\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.364\nterms of how big it is, or\nhow many that we actually have to have.\n\n46\n00:02:31.364 --> 00:02:34.613\nBut it actually can be there as well,\nokay.\n\n47\n00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:38.960\nBut the other fields that we\nhave existing right here.\n\n48\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.187\nThis is what we also have to kind of pay\nattention to as far as identifying what\n\n49\n00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:43.794\nthey are.\n\n50\n00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:47.460\nThere's not a lot of attacks\nin a lot of the fields\n\n51\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.955\nthat we end up seeing up here at the top,\nokay.\n\n52\n00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:53.163\nThere are probably just a couple, but\n\n53\n00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:55.992\noverall though most of\nit we don't worry about.\n\n54\n00:02:55.992 --> 00:03:00.298\nSo it's right here where now we have\nsecurity kind of built into a couple of\n\n55\n00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:03.841\ndifferent things that IPV6 really\ndoes helps us out with and\n\n56\n00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.496\nthat's kind of the big difference, right.\n\n57\n00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:09.405\nIP version 4 was really not\nbuild with security in mind.\n\n58\n00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:14.325\nIPV6 though has the opportunity\nto really implement\n\n59\n00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:18.159\nsecurity inside of the protocol itself.\n\n60\n00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.540\nThe size of the headers, the ability\nthat you have these extensions,\n\n61\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.330\nthe flow labels, all this.\n\n62\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.178\nIt really can revolve around the nature\nof the issues of security in the way that\n\n63\n00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:29.769\nwe know.\n\n64\n00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.812\nSo that's what we wanna\npay attention to here.\n\n65\n00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:37.080\nEven so, like I said, people really\ndo talk about with some trepidation,\n\n66\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.879\nlike it is a foreign animal but\nit really isn't.\n\n67\n00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.408\nIt really is kind of a big but\na better replacement to IP version four.\n\n68\n00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:49.358\nAnd this is why it should be something\nwe feel comfortable in talking about and\n\n69\n00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:51.866\nworking with even though\nmost people will just.\n\n70\n00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:56.146\nAnd I've had multiple\nconversations where I said IPV6 and\n\n71\n00:03:56.146 --> 00:04:00.978\npeople are like well, what's- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's big and scary Ronnie.\n\n72\n00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:02.178\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's big and scary.\n\n73\n00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:04.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's x values man,\nhaven't you seen it?\n\n74\n00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:06.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's the scariest portion of it.\n\n75\n00:04:06.054 --> 00:04:06.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:07.294\n&gt;&gt; That's the weird thing.\n\n77\n00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:09.945\nIt really is the scariest portion\nof everything that we see.\n\n78\n00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:13.268\nNow let me try and ease your mind\non some of the things here, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:13.268 --> 00:04:16.933\nSo just as we described pretty\nmuch the major-, everything,\n\n80\n00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:18.464\nI'm gonna say majority.\n\n81\n00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:20.085\nWe described everything here, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:25.219\nUp here at the top we're gonna\nsee that even though all of these\n\n83\n00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:30.366\nlook like an insane mess of\nstuff that we've added in, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:33.695\nIPv6 didn't really take it,\nI switched the wrong.\n\n85\n00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:34.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The wrong way.\n\n86\n00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:39.038\n&gt;&gt; IPv6 didn't really take it away, but\nkind of reformed a lot of those fields and\n\n87\n00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:42.270\nreally kind of meshed them\ntogether a little bit, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.984\nSo notice the version field is still here,\nokay.\n\n89\n00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:50.083\nSo the version field still says IPv4,\nIPv6 according to RFC,\n\n90\n00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:56.703\nwe see anything different in other IPv6\nand we see IPv5 or, seven or nine come in.\n\n91\n00:04:56.703 --> 00:05:00.697\nOnce again,\nthe router is supposed to drop that, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:03.139\nIt don't even want to take\na look at the rest of it,\n\n93\n00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.719\nit just says you should drop it.\n\n94\n00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.578\nSo if it gets on your machine, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:12.364\nAnd now you're looking at it in Wireshark\nat the end result and you're saying,\n\n96\n00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:16.876\nit got to my machine with a version\nheader that was something besides this.\n\n97\n00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:20.574\nThat means someone was able to\nsuccessfully manipulate something that\n\n98\n00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:23.480\nthey should not have actually\nbeen able to manipulate.\n\n99\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.625\nAnd here they are, it's ready to go, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:31.235\nNow the other thing that we see that\nnow begins to frighten people has,\n\n101\n00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:33.670\nnot traffic class, traffic class.\n\n102\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.097\nBut when we start thinking about class and\nstuff like that,\n\n103\n00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:41.632\nI start thinking about the idea of what\ntraffic again and the class of service.\n\n104\n00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:45.491\nAnd the quality of service and\nthat's kind of the same thing.\n\n105\n00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:49.503\nWell, if we start to think about that way\nI keep proning this swipe all I need to do\n\n106\n00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:51.729\nis switch tabs here\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.381\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's just saying that's\n\n108\n00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.044\nthe really the majority of\nthe type of service field.\n\n109\n00:05:56.044 --> 00:06:01.221\nThey just changed the name and\nthey added in just a few more bits.\n\n110\n00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.153\nNotice that this is 8 bits all together?\n\n111\n00:06:04.153 --> 00:06:08.905\nWhereas in the IP version 4, it actually\nis, no actually it's the same 8 bits here.\n\n112\n00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:10.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now that I see it,\n\n113\n00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:14.524\nit says 4 to 11 bits,\nthat is about 12 bits all together.\n\n114\n00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:16.230\nNow what we could possibly end up with?\n\n115\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.342\nSo a little bit larger, but\nnot too much larger, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:23.222\nSo it gives you the ability to have more\ndifferent classes of traffic as we need\n\n117\n00:06:23.222 --> 00:06:23.947\nthem, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:26.815\nNow this is where a lot of\nthe stuff kind of disappears.\n\n119\n00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:27.789\nI'm swiping again,\n\n120\n00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.043\nthis is where a lot of the other\nthings have actually disappeared here.\n\n121\n00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:34.659\nBut notice this idea of flow labels, okay.\n\n122\n00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:38.802\nFlow labels for\nus is a 20 bit IETF field, but\n\n123\n00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:44.444\nthat the way that the IETF kind\nof says is they're flow labels.\n\n124\n00:06:44.444 --> 00:06:48.010\nThey are essentially for\nwhatever you need them to be for.\n\n125\n00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.735\nSo you need added stuff\nin terms of security,\n\n126\n00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:53.184\nyou can use those flow labels to do that.\n\n127\n00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:54.710\nWhatever you want,\n\n128\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.560\nthis particular field is not strictly\ndefined at this point for what we have.\n\n129\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.060\nSo, but it doesn't actually have\nany specificity about management or\n\n130\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.039\nthe process, or how flow labels\nare supposed to be processed.\n\n131\n00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.875\nSo that's where it becomes a little\nbit more unusual on our end.\n\n132\n00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.776\nWe're used to everything\nbeing strictly and\n\n133\n00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:21.367\nclearly defined in these smaller sections,\nand these specific bits.\n\n134\n00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.770\nBut here in the flow labels they're\nsaying you can use them for\n\n135\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.411\nwhatever you need to, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:29.497\nSo it allows you to do that.\n\n137\n00:07:29.497 --> 00:07:34.964\nPayload length again still pretty much\nthe same thing as the entire IP link.\n\n138\n00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:38.147\nThis one is changed here the next header,\nokay.\n\n139\n00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:43.637\nThe next header is what tells us\nwhat occurs at layer four, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:48.489\nAnd this also something that ends up\nfeeding into what comes into the extension\n\n141\n00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:49.824\nheaders right here.\n\n142\n00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:55.395\nSo this two fields are connected,\nhop limit has changed.\n\n143\n00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:58.792\nThe TTL essentially is the same\nas the hop limit here, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.517\nHop limit, notice, is eight.\n\n145\n00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:03.754\nEight as the maximum in\nterms of the number of bits.\n\n146\n00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:08.830\nSo you have 256 bit,\n256 hops essentially is the maximum or\n\n147\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.797\n255 is the maximum that you can go.\n\n148\n00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:14.250\nThey're the same thing with the headers,\nokay.\n\n149\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.009\nThese particular.\n\n150\n00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:19.096\nWhat, [INAUDIBLE] I can't\nbelieve it there it is, look.\n\n151\n00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:20.213\nI talked the whole time\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n152\n00:08:20.213 --> 00:08:22.108\n&gt;&gt; And I didn't even spot that there so\n\n153\n00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:23.123\nthat was my fault.\n\n154\n00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:26.240\n128 bit source and destination addresses.\n\n155\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.970\nThat would have been really bad if,\n\n156\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.424\nIce has 32 bit for [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay Ronny we're all aware of your\n\n157\n00:08:31.424 --> 00:08:33.887\ndifficulties with the typing,\nthe whole keyboard thing,\n\n158\n00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:37.293\nand the making- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Typing, reading, yep, talking and\n\n159\n00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:38.917\nreading at the same time.\n\n160\n00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:39.856\nYou name it.\n\n161\n00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:43.836\nYeah, I pretty much run the gamut of\nfailing on all of them very easily.\n\n162\n00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:44.760\n&gt;&gt; And so masterfully.\n\n163\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.215\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n164\n00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:48.430\nSo it's very neat.\n\n165\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.860\nAt this point, notice that I didn't really\ndescribe a lot of, tons of attacks here.\n\n166\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:59.400\nIt's not saying there are attacks but\nthere is a lot fewer that are by default\n\n167\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.340\nof the attacks,\nthen what we saw in terms of IP version 4.\n\n168\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, is that due to a more\ninherent security nature of IPv6 or\n\n169\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.440\nis it because of the lack\nof ubiquity of IPv6.\n\n170\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.410\nIt may be both.\n\n171\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point it's both, right?\n\n172\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.740\nOne, not everybody's doing it.\n\n173\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.400\nThere are security issues with IPv6\nthat are available on there but\n\n174\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.080\nit's not actually part of\nthe protocol that's built in.\n\n175\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.210\nIt is what they chose to do,\nalong with these flow labels, and\n\n176\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.690\nthen these extension headers, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.180\nThis is where the manipulations\ncan come in, and\n\n178\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.970\nthis is really what we're talking about\nthat we have to be careful of right here,\n\n179\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.750\nokay, in these types of extension headers.\n\n180\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.400\nAs long as everything that's processed\nin the order that it actually\n\n181\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.650\nneeds to be processed in,\nthis is kinda the key and\n\n182\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.670\nthere's a couple of other things\nthat have to be followed as well.\n\n183\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.490\nSo, let's kinda step back for\na moment before we move ahead and\n\n184\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.870\nsee in the next portion.\n\n185\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.550\nEssentially, all of IPv6 in it's\nstandard has pretty much stabilized for\n\n186\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.790\nprobably the first 15 to 20 years.\n\n187\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.800\nEverybody kept adding in stuff,\ntapping away stuff, kept doing anything.\n\n188\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.200\nIt's particular format is probably\nas finalized as it's gonna get right\n\n189\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.530\nnow which is great, okay.\n\n190\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.795\nJust when I say that.\n\n191\n00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:22.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that everybody though\n\n192\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.890\nimplements the same exact thing\naccording to the actual official source.\n\n193\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.974\nSo, you might see where\nCisco might say the routers.\n\n194\n00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:37.731\nWe're gonna follow this IET or\nRFC [COUGH] [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:38.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:39.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but whatever it is,\n\n197\n00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:43.980\nthis RSC exactly the way that\nit's supposed to follow.\n\n198\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.800\nBut it doesn't mean that\neverybody chooses to do that.\n\n199\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.100\nSo in other words you might find\nthat certain operating systems say\n\n200\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.430\nhere's what makes ours work a little\nbit better than what Daniel's running.\n\n201\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:03.040\nAnd they say, because we have a little\nbit of freedom here we can manipulate and\n\n202\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.530\nchange that up.\n\n203\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.870\nAnd because it's not exactly clearly\ndefined, this is where we can run in to\n\n204\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.160\nsome issues in terms of security because\nthat's where people start playing around\n\n205\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.870\nand start looking and go, well,\nit's not exactly, so what is different?\n\n206\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.550\nAnd now, I can see that I can\ntake advantage of this and\n\n207\n00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.980\nbe able to get access\nin to those machines.\n\n208\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.280\nAnd that's what we wanna\npay attention to here,\n\n209\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.540\nin terms of the idea of these\nextension headers as well.\n\n210\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.759\nOkay?\nWith the idea of extension headers the key\n\n211\n00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:42.260\nhere, in understanding of why it\nmatters so much, is that the source and\n\n212\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.844\nthe destination are the only\nones that calculate or\n\n213\n00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:50.803\ndo anything with the extension headers..\n\n214\n00:11:50.803 --> 00:11:54.645\nSo in other words, all those devices\nthat it goes in between, right?\n\n215\n00:11:54.645 --> 00:11:58.377\nSo my computer, when I send\nsomething over to Daniel's computer,\n\n216\n00:11:58.377 --> 00:12:02.636\nthat is essentially me setting up\nwhatever are those extension headers are.\n\n217\n00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:05.813\nAs it leaves my computer and\nit goes in to the switch,\n\n218\n00:12:05.813 --> 00:12:09.920\nthe switch doesn't take a look\nat the router or the firewall.\n\n219\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.240\nDoesn't take a look or\nmanipulate it, it doesn't need to.\n\n220\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.650\nAll the routers across the internet it\ngoes through, it doesn't do that as well.\n\n221\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.090\nBrian's on his end it doesn't\nlook at all that stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:25.010\nThe only time that anything's actually\ndone is at the destination end as well.\n\n223\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.370\nSo that's where the processing comes in.\n\n224\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.340\nSo imagine that, Daniel,\n\n225\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.660\nif somewhere in the middle,\nthat I can do a man in the middle attack.\n\n226\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.630\nI can take your packets and\n\n227\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.215\nthen I can load up those extension\nheaders with, I don't care.\n\n228\n00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:41.984\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter, junk.\n\n229\n00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Like the malicious\npayload of some sort.\n\n230\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah like the malicious payload.\n\n231\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.650\nI mean something okay.\n\n232\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.330\nIt doesn't matter, whether it's the\npayload not right, it's inside the gutter.\n\n233\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.946\nI can load it up with something and\n\n234\n00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:53.255\nthere's no device out there that\nsays nope, not getting through.\n\n235\n00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:55.970\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what's in there,\nmaybe I should check that.\n\n236\n00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.750\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't check it and so\n\n237\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.790\nthe only time it checks it is\nwhen it gets to your computer.\n\n238\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.270\nWow that sounds like a pretty rich field,\n\n239\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.180\nit is the true nature of like\nthe Trojan horse, literally, right?\n\n240\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n241\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.810\nAlong the way,\n\n242\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.120\nI'm just gonna load up just a few extra\nthings that when Daniel opens this, tada!\n\n243\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Surprise!\n\n244\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.335\n&gt;&gt; Surprise!\n\n245\n00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's why it's important for\n\n246\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.460\nus to understand.\n\n247\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.300\nSo it doesn't seem like\na lot of attacks but\n\n248\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.560\nthe attacks that can happen that way where\nthere's nothing in between that goes\n\n249\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.310\nlet me look at this cuz it's malformed\nthis way or it's doing that.\n\n250\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n251\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.670\nIt's not gonna do it.\n\n252\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.690\nThere's nothing along the path that\nsays it's gonna end up doing this.\n\n253\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.940\nSo it's not actually examined the process\nuntil it reaches it's destination.\n\n254\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.990\nThe other thing that we also\nneed to pay attention to\n\n255\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.610\naccording to RFC 2460 is that\nthese extension headers and\n\n256\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.365\nthe way that they appear,\nthey're only, according to the RFC,\n\n257\n00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:54.770\nthey're only supposed to appear one time,\nin those extension headers.\n\n258\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.750\nSo if you see multiple extension\nheaders that are identical.\n\n259\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n260\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.910\n&gt;&gt; Something is wrong, normally, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.830\nThe reason I say normally is remember\nwhat I said, operating systems can go,\n\n262\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.468\nyou wanna know something, I might\nneed it to appear more than one time.\n\n263\n00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:13.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.956\n&gt;&gt; So my machine might send out and\n\n265\n00:14:14.956 --> 00:14:16.722\ngo, I need it to appear six times.\n\n266\n00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:17.483\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n267\n00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:18.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n268\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.920\nI'm guessing at that point that's where we\nreally have to put our investigators hat\n\n269\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.990\nand go, okay, let's break this down.\n\n270\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.580\nLet's take a look at what's happening and\n\n271\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.592\nbecause there's no checks happening by the\nsystem itself, that job is left up to us.\n\n272\n00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:33.470\n&gt;&gt; It is and that's why it's important.\n\n273\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.760\nSo that's why we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand that this is where it happens\n\n274\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.890\nwithin that idea of\nthose extension headers.\n\n275\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.448\nAnd when we start talking about the idea\nfragmentation this is what's gonna end up\n\n276\n00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:45.051\ngoing on.\n\n277\n00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:49.746\nIt is because of the very fact we're gonna\nfind some operating systems don't exactly\n\n278\n00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:53.996\nfollow the same exact way of implementing\nwhat they believe is the right way.\n\n279\n00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:58.119\nAnd it's because it makes their system\nwork better, or makes it more efficient,\n\n280\n00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:00.223\nor does whatever they think it does here.\n\n281\n00:15:00.223 --> 00:15:05.283\nAnd at that point, well, you know, we\nhave to still deal with it, so we have to\n\n282\n00:15:05.283 --> 00:15:10.530\nbe on a better look in the analysis of it\nto understand what is also happening too.\n\n283\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.450\nThe other things that make this difficult,\n\n284\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.490\nof course, is that there's no\nparticular set length to these errors.\n\n285\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.230\nOkay?\n\n286\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.605\nAnd the reason why that's actually\nimportant as far as these extension\n\n287\n00:15:20.605 --> 00:15:24.450\nheaders go, is we can't do like\nwhat we saw in the fields about,\n\n288\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.158\nlike in the traffic class,\nfour to 11 bits.\n\n289\n00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:31.450\nI can't tell you if it's 25 bits,\nor 64 bits, something's wrong.\n\n290\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.555\nSo there's no easy calculation, we have\nto kind of manually go in there and go,\n\n291\n00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:40.510\nthere's something wrong here and\nactually start looking for\n\n292\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.440\nthose duplications, start looking for\nthe information that may\n\n293\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.370\nkind of set us off in that one that\nwe also have to worry about, as well.\n\n294\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like IPv6 may actually benefit\nfrom a little more standardization.\n\n295\n00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.841\n&gt;&gt; It can and it usually does.\n\n296\n00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:57.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But once again, it's up to,\n\n297\n00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:02.604\ndepending on what and usually it's\nbased around the operating system And\n\n298\n00:16:02.604 --> 00:16:05.944\nhow they're implement IPV6 and\nwhat works best.\n\n299\n00:16:05.944 --> 00:16:10.560\nAnd we've seen that, especially in\nthe Windows protocols with IPV6.\n\n300\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.817\nSometimes you turn it on and\neverything works, no big deal.\n\n301\n00:16:14.817 --> 00:16:16.659\nBut sometimes there's things\nyou add on and all of a sudden,\n\n302\n00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:17.630\nit doesn't work at all..\n\n303\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.441\nAnd all you have to do\nis check uncheck IPV6.\n\n304\n00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:20.383\n&gt;&gt; And off to the races.\n\n305\n00:16:20.383 --> 00:16:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Everything works, and It doesn't make\nsense except that you realize that you're\n\n306\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.840\nconnecting to something that it may not,\nat least that IPv6, right, not be jiving.\n\n307\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.260\n&gt;&gt; You know Microsoft, their MO is to\nlet's do it our way and we'll push it.\n\n308\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.360\nAnd that way, everyone will do it our way,\nand then nobody does it their way.\n\n309\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.700\nAnd you get these conflicts so\nyou have to shut it off.\n\n310\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.125\nStuff that it actually working correctly\nor implemented the other style of\n\n311\n00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:49.297\npolicies that you can get\nthe stinking thing to work.\n\n312\n00:16:49.297 --> 00:16:51.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's just been my experience.\n\n313\n00:16:51.004 --> 00:16:53.373\nLike I said, for all I know,\nit could be happening on Oracle or\n\n314\n00:16:53.373 --> 00:16:55.252\nsomething else that's\nactually running on it.\n\n315\n00:16:55.252 --> 00:16:59.007\nBut just kind of realize that these\nare things that we definitely want to pay\n\n316\n00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:00.508\nattention to as well, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:00.508 --> 00:17:05.181\nThere's also this possibility of what's\ncalled nested fragments that can also be\n\n318\n00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:06.590\nin there as well, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.184\nAnd when that happens, that essentially\nsays that one of these extension headers\n\n320\n00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:12.333\ncan hide another extension\nheader inside of it.\n\n321\n00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:15.626\nIn other words, delivering that whatever\nmalicious thing that we might have, and\n\n322\n00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:18.000\nwe might not be able to\ntell right away as well.\n\n323\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.310\nAnd then malformed packets delivering\npayloads in those fragments.\n\n324\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.840\nNow this is key.\n\n325\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.570\nWe can't take the very first packet\nof information that we send in IPv6\n\n326\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.100\nfrom my machine over to Daniel's and\nmake anything malformed there.\n\n327\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.890\nBut once I established that connection,\nnotice the term flow labels?\n\n328\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.070\nRemember that in the headers?\n\n329\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.190\nOkay, flow labels essentially\nsays Ronnie has established what?\n\n330\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.210\nEverything is good,\nthat's essentially what it says.\n\n331\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.450\nDaniel's machine says flow labels,\nI agree.\n\n332\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.930\nWell from that point,\nthose extension headers,\n\n333\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.440\nright, it just says we don't\nhave to redo that again.\n\n334\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.720\nWe'll just use that same exact flow label.\n\n335\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.420\nPost it right on there,\nshould go through pretty easily, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.330\nSo that's why this stuff is, again, one of\nthose things where we have to pay a little\n\n337\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.470\nbit more attention in that one as well.\n\n338\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.840\nYou can also end up with overlapping\nIPv6 extension headers too.\n\n339\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.660\nAnd this can end up creating\na new attack vector\n\n340\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.380\nthat we haven't even thought about too.\n\n341\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.250\nSo this can be starting of\nzero day attacks as well when\n\n342\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.590\nsomebody overlays something like this,\nokay?\n\n343\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.450\nThe other thing that may end up happening,\n\n344\n00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.970\nespecially with the operating systems,\nthey may not process\n\n345\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.230\nthose headers in the way that the RFC\nsays that they should process them.\n\n346\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.120\nSo let's go over that order,\nbecause that's actually important for\n\n347\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.390\nwhat we want to be able to do.\n\n348\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.377\nLet's take a look at from the left hand\nside moving over to the right, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:45.430\nSo it's essentially just a basic\nflow chart of what we have, okay?\n\n350\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:52.010\nAccording to the RFC, okay, you cannot\nprocess anything out of order, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.900\nSo if the next header says hey, you're\nto look into the extension headers to do\n\n352\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.440\nthis, okay, then that first extension\nheader says yes, process me, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.070\nNow if there isn't one,\nit just says all right,\n\n354\n00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.510\ngo to the transport layer, makes sense.\n\n355\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.520\nThat absolutely makes sense.\n\n356\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.830\nWhat it shouldn't be able to\ndo is from the next header,\n\n357\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.840\nokay, when it says all right, there's some\nextension headers up here that you need to\n\n358\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.090\ntake a look at Is that it goes, I don't\ncare about extension header number one.\n\n359\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.660\nI want to process extension\nheader number two, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.720\nSo all of this is actually\nchained together.\n\n361\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.699\nIf I do not process extension header\nnumber one, okay, then I should not be\n\n362\n00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:38.376\nable to process extension header\nnumber two, okay, and that is key.\n\n363\n00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:40.861\nIf I only have one extension header,\nthen from that point,\n\n364\n00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:42.980\nwe go on to the transport layer, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:48.320\nSo each of these has to fall in\nline like dominoes I cannot skip.\n\n366\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.180\nBut do some operating systems go,\nthat doesn't work for\n\n367\n00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.450\nme because I'd rather process this\nparticular extension header first,\n\n368\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.170\nand then do it in this order.\n\n369\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.224\nThere are operating systems\nout there that do that, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:06.330\nAnd, yeah, and\n\n371\n00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.380\nthat's because they're saying it's\nokay because we're at the end machine.\n\n372\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.530\nWell, that doesn't matter.\n\n373\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.330\nWell, it matters if somebody knows\nthat that's the way your machine's\n\n374\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.480\ngonna process it.\n\n375\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.110\nWhere do you tend to stick\nyour particular malicious\n\n376\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.580\nstuff that you want to when you go,\nall right, I know something.\n\n377\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.320\nIt's not gonna process the first one,\nit's gonna jump and\n\n378\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.730\nprocess the second or\nthe third one that it finds instead.\n\n379\n00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.390\nI know that I don't have\nto worry about this guy.\n\n380\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.940\nI just go and I do what?\n\n381\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.210\nI add in that overlapping or\nI add in that little fragmentation or\n\n382\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.700\nthat atomic bit that I want to in here,\nand\n\n383\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.410\nthen it processes through the layer\nfour and I am on the machine again.\n\n384\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.140\nSo very important that we can pay\nattention to just some simple and\n\n385\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.240\neasy things like that as well.\n\n386\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.042\nIPv6 not as detailed in\nterms of the attack,\n\n387\n00:20:58.042 --> 00:21:00.780\ncuz it really isn't that\nmuch of an attack surface.\n\n388\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.656\nIt really is doing what\noriginally IPv4 was supposed to.\n\n389\n00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:08.870\nAll that delivering, but it added in\nthat ability to add in more security,\n\n390\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.490\nand to make it native inside instead\nof adding in the upper layers instead.\n\n391\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.990\nSo we can use those flow labels\nthose to help us do that.\n\n392\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.444\nUnderstanding this particular\ninstance is we have to be\n\n393\n00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:23.924\ncareful of those extension headers,\nokay, and be able to go all right,\n\n394\n00:21:23.924 --> 00:21:28.552\nI understand the processing order here\nthat if I follow number one, okay,\n\n395\n00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:31.930\nthen that's when number\ntwo can be processed.\n\n396\n00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:37.590\nSo if they're saying hey, when can\nthe third extension header be processed?\n\n397\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.340\nWell, it has to follow extension\nnumber two and extension number one.\n\n398\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.965\nSo, Daniel, I'm gonna go back to exam tip-\n\n399\n00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:47.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mode again.\n\n400\n00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Warning.\n\n401\n00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, warning, right?\n\n402\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.730\nSo if you do, it is fairly simple, right?\n\n403\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.078\nIf they give you something like this where\nyou're saying, do I know this order or\n\n404\n00:21:56.078 --> 00:21:56.802\nnot, right?\n\n405\n00:21:56.802 --> 00:22:00.786\nAnd they say, all right, so\naccording to what we're saying here, okay,\n\n406\n00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:04.340\nI say when is process or\nextension header number three processed?\n\n407\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.850\nIt's not gonna have these lines,\nit's just gonna have these boxes or\n\n408\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.100\nit's just gonna have this, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.730\nDo you know what order to set them on, or\n\n410\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.080\ndo you know you have to go through all,\nboth of them?\n\n411\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.570\nOr, do you actually put them\nnot in the right order?\n\n412\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.830\nWhatever it might be,\n\n413\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.590\njust make sure when you start to\ntake a look at this information.\n\n414\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.670\nSo you can learn more about\nthis in RFC 2416 as well.\n\n415\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.465\nAnd there will be a link in our show notes\nso that you can click right on it and\n\n416\n00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:31.133\nbring that RFC up if you want to.\n\n417\n00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:35.269\nAnd that will help you out to get that\nconcept In your mind and ready to go for\n\n418\n00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:36.870\nthe exam as well.\n\n419\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.920\nSo Daniel, with that in mind and\neverything else that we've talked about in\n\n420\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.030\nIPv6, that is pretty much all that I have\nand that should get us a good start and\n\n421\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.120\nget us starting at getting prepared for\nwhat we'll see on the sec ops.\n\n422\n00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie,\nit's been a long an arduous journey, but\n\n423\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.670\nwe have made it here to\nthe end of IP headers.\n\n424\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.940\nHopefully, they're not as mystical\nto you as they maybe once were.\n\n425\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.190\nWe have removed the veil that\n\n426\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.855\nyou will see-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:23:00.855 --> 00:23:02.770\n&gt;&gt; What you should expect when it comes to\n\n428\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.980\nthe exam and what you should just know as\na security practitioner in general when\n\n429\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.520\nit comes to network type security,\nspecifically in that IP header realm.\n\n430\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.100\nRonnie, thanks so much for joining\nus today, and thanks for so much for\n\n431\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.060\nspending so much time and\neffort into creating this content so\n\n432\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.938\nthat our viewers out there\ncould benefit from it.\n\n433\n00:23:18.938 --> 00:23:21.820\nWe know we really appreciate that, and\nwe appreciate you guys out there for\n\n434\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.330\nwatching.\n\n435\n00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.280\nWe love these shows to make them for\nyou, and hopefully,\n\n436\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.593\nyou were entertained and\neducated at the same time so\n\n437\n00:23:27.593 --> 00:23:30.450\nyou can go out there and\npass that exam with confidence.\n\n438\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.290\nThat being said,\nwe are at the end of today's episode.\n\n439\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.770\nWe do appreciate you for watching.\n\n440\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.440\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n441\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.327\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n442\n00:23:37.327

00:00:11.788\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:13.266\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.336\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.302\nin today's episode we're back\nwith more in our what is this?\n\n8\n00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:22.140\nCisco SecOps, that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.361\nI can't remember which show\nI am in half of the time.\n\n10\n00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.275\nJoining us back in the studio, yet again,\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n11\n00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:29.944\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:31.538\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.392\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel,\nonce again, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:38.169\nhaving me back as we continue our\njourney together through Cisco SEC OPS.\n\n15\n00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:41.305\nRemember that the whole goal behind this,\nright, is so\n\n16\n00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:44.908\nthat we can work at a security\noperation center, a SOC, an SOC,\n\n17\n00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:47.602\nhowever you wanna pronounce\nit is fine with me.\n\n18\n00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:51.270\nAs an analyst that may just be\ncoming in for the first time.\n\n19\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.339\nSo you're not gonna become\nthe senior analyst.\n\n20\n00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.299\nBut it is, at least, giving you some of\nthe steps, some of the different things\n\n21\n00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.274\nthat you may end up seeing or\nbe asked to be able to do as well.\n\n22\n00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.911\nAnd that's what we're hoping to do.\n\n23\n00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:07.265\nAt least provide the tools and a little\nbit of familiarity with the concept.\n\n24\n00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:11.141\nAnd here, we've been taking a look,\nat least at this portion of the exam\n\n25\n00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:15.611\nobjectives, at the idea of intrusion\nanalysis is what we've been talking about.\n\n26\n00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:20.039\nAnd we also had a gigantic section,\nwhich we're pretty much in the middle of,\n\n27\n00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.872\nwhich is header inspection\nis what we're doing.\n\n28\n00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.163\nAgain, a favorite of Daniels, I know.\n\n29\n00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:26.263\n&gt;&gt; So much-\n&gt;&gt; To-\n\n30\n00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:26.866\n&gt;&gt; Fun.\n\n31\n00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.451\n&gt;&gt; To no end.\n\n32\n00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\n\n33\n00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:29.482\nwe are still continuing on here.\n\n34\n00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:34.227\nNow Daniel, we're gonna hit\nan insanely interesting topic today.\n\n35\n00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:40.577\nWhich is the idea of ICMP intrusion here,\nokay?\n\n36\n00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:43.217\nSo let's talk about ICMP for a moment.\n\n37\n00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:48.318\nDaniel what are your most familiar with\nwhen you think about the terms ICMP?\n\n38\n00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:53.298\n&gt;&gt; I think of the thing utility because\nwe use it for connectivity testing.\n\n39\n00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:57.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to basic\nnetworking, right, one of the very first\n\n40\n00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.800\nthings that we learn in networking is,\nwell, if you want network,\n\n41\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.714\nthe other device has to be listening\nin also of course had to be responding.\n\n42\n00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:09.398\nSo somebody says all right, make sure\nthat they're connected together and\n\n43\n00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:12.266\nthen ping the other's device's IP address.\n\n44\n00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.308\nThat way we actually get\nsomething that goes out and\n\n45\n00:02:15.308 --> 00:02:18.221\nwe also normally get\na response that comes back.\n\n46\n00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.635\nAnd that is what we are familiar with.\n\n47\n00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:23.768\nSo Daniel,\nthat should be the end of the show.\n\n48\n00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:24.962\nWe should be ready to go, right?\n\n49\n00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:25.880\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching, everyone.\n\n50\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.564\nIt's been great, signing out now.\n\n51\n00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's more to it than\n\n52\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.363\nthat, obviously.\n\n53\n00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:31.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a bit more to it.\n\n54\n00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:35.457\nIt is amazing that at the beginning\nthat's pretty much all that we're shown.\n\n55\n00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:40.228\nAnd the majority of the time,\nthat's pretty much the only time that I\n\n56\n00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:44.359\nreally end up using ICMP,\nas far as me actively using ICMP.\n\n57\n00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.780\nThe other one of course is using\nsomething like traceroute, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.160\nSo traceroute also uses ICMP when we\ncan't get connectivity sometimes.\n\n59\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.693\nSo right here at ITPRO.TV Studios, Daniel,\nwe've had this happen a couple times since\n\n60\n00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:01.758\nwe've been in this building where all\nthe sudden we couldn't stream anymore.\n\n61\n00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:05.733\nAnd we had to actually figure\nout where that particular-\n\n62\n00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.865\n&gt;&gt; Break in the connection.\n\n63\n00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:09.142\n&gt;&gt; Break in the connection went down.\n\n64\n00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:12.137\nICNP helps us.\n\n65\n00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.201\nWe can use traceroute, and\n\n66\n00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.386\nthen we can find where those\npackets are being dropped.\n\n67\n00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:19.137\nAnd then at that point, we can go\nall right, let's call the ISP and\n\n68\n00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:22.433\nsee if they can figure out how\ndo we get past this point too.\n\n69\n00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.744\nSo two good utilities.\n\n70\n00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:29.835\nSo once again, Daniel, that's kind of\nthe extent and knowledge that most of us\n\n71\n00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:35.012\nwould go all right, that's about all I\nwould really think about using ICMP for.\n\n72\n00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:38.378\nIt returns to me packets,\nso I should be done.\n\n73\n00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:43.351\nExcept that is not originally\ndesigned just for that, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:47.295\nThe idea is the basic idea that\nwe get from both of them, right?\n\n75\n00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:51.305\nSo let's talk about the idea of\nerror messages for a moment.\n\n76\n00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:56.156\nBecause when you and I get error messages\nfrom application, if we take that OSI\n\n77\n00:03:56.156 --> 00:04:01.247\nmodel, right, the seven layer OSI model,\nit comes from the application layer.\n\n78\n00:04:01.247 --> 00:04:05.489\nSo I try to connect, it says Ronnie,\nyou're not supposed to connect here,\n\n79\n00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.233\nforbidden.\n\n80\n00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:11.188\nWell, that starts at layer 7, ends up on\nmy machine at layer 7and it comes through.\n\n81\n00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:13.867\nAnd so that way,\nI know that I'm not supposed to\n\n82\n00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:17.828\nconnect to that application and\nwhatever it might be, that's fine.\n\n83\n00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:22.883\nBut remember that sometimes though,\nwhat we also need is whether or\n\n84\n00:04:22.883 --> 00:04:27.866\nnot those devices are actually\ndoing the job that they're doing.\n\n85\n00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:33.563\nICMP messages start at layer 3, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:38.454\nAnd this is important because it means I\ndon't have to depend or guess whether or\n\n87\n00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:40.291\nnot that application's up.\n\n88\n00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:44.355\nSo Daniel, in the idea of the error\nmessage that we just talked about there is\n\n89\n00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:47.994\nmultiple possibilities right why\nthat error might be coming back.\n\n90\n00:04:47.994 --> 00:04:50.418\nOr let's just do a non-responsive instead,\n\n91\n00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:53.037\ncuz I'm kind of being too\nspecific at this point.\n\n92\n00:04:53.037 --> 00:04:54.218\n&gt;&gt; Specific so, yeah, no response at all.\n\n93\n00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:57.203\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say I think I'm connected,\nI'm supposed to connect, and\n\n94\n00:04:57.203 --> 00:04:58.417\nI'm not connected, okay.\n\n95\n00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:02.689\nSo at this point, it could be that\nmy computer is not connected.\n\n96\n00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.274\nIt could be the firewall's blocked me.\n\n97\n00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:06.737\nIt could be the router's not connected.\n\n98\n00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:08.033\nIt could be somewhere out on the internet.\n\n99\n00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:09.844\nCould be the server at the other end.\n\n100\n00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:11.973\nCould be the application at the other end.\n\n101\n00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:15.693\nWhatever it might be,\nit's one of those possibilities.\n\n102\n00:05:15.693 --> 00:05:19.836\nBut if I wanna test for\ntrue device device connectivity okay?\n\n103\n00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:26.313\nICMP messages really help us out because\nit says I'm gonna hit, just up to layer 3.\n\n104\n00:05:26.313 --> 00:05:31.777\nAnd at layer 3, remember that in the OSI,\nno, Ronnie, you're doing Network+.\n\n105\n00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:33.792\nI know, but it has to be done, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at layer 3, Daniel,\n\n107\n00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:38.571\nam I supposed to be able to\ninterpret anything at layer 3?\n\n108\n00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.330\nLayer 3 is really about what?\n\n109\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.589\n&gt;&gt; Just sending packets, that's it.\n\n110\n00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:43.154\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n111\n00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:45.197\n&gt;&gt; Just transferring them\nfrom one network to another.\n\n112\n00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:47.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I have a source address,\ndestination address\n\n113\n00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:49.329\n&gt;&gt; Should be able to get it there if\n\n114\n00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:52.500\neverything is connected correctly\nas far as the IP addresses and\n\n115\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.687\nwhere they are, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.561\nBut how do I know then?\n\n117\n00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.794\nThat one of those devices in\nbetween is causing the issue?\n\n118\n00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:00.930\nOr the device on the other\nend is causing the issue?\n\n119\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.597\nI need to get messages to come back so.\n\n120\n00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:07.165\nThe only way that right\nnow that I've setup is for\n\n121\n00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:11.379\na scenario that goes is messages come\nback is really at the application, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.401\nWell, ICMP is built into IP itself.\n\n123\n00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:19.159\nSo it is integral part of IP.\n\n124\n00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.425\nAny place that you run IP,\nICMP is added right on top of it, or\n\n125\n00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.205\ninternal to it, whatever it might be.\n\n126\n00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:33.042\nAnd it is designed to essentially\nprovide messages at layer 3.\n\n127\n00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:37.743\nThis is very, very important\nbecause it also means that even\n\n128\n00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:41.429\nthough we don't worry\nabout a TCP connection or\n\n129\n00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:46.237\nanything like that,\nit allows us to be able to send messages.\n\n130\n00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:49.972\nAnd it doesn't require somebody\nelse to program it in there.\n\n131\n00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:53.266\nIt doesn't require somebody else\nto have an application running,\n\n132\n00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:54.834\nit doesn't require anything.\n\n133\n00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:57.902\nIt requires for\nthose devices to only do what?\n\n134\n00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:01.268\nUse at least layer 3 on those devices.\n\n135\n00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:07.003\nSo Daniel any networking\n\n136\n00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:11.100\ndevices, okay,\n\n137\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.834\nthat you think about that\n\n138\n00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:22.032\ngoes across network.\n\n139\n00:07:22.032 --> 00:07:23.878\nWithout me going, all right, Daniel,\n\n140\n00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:26.431\nnow that we've established\nconnectivity at layer 3,\n\n141\n00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:30.581\nwe put IP addresses on, don't forget,\nyou've gotta add in this messaging module.\n\n142\n00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:33.308\nWhich means you've gotta add\nthis layer 4 protocol and\n\n143\n00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:36.165\nyou gotta add this in there and\ndo all that and make it work.\n\n144\n00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:39.305\nNo, everything that we're\ntalking about works at layer 3.\n\n145\n00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:42.910\nAnd I'm emphasizing layer 3 for a reason.\n\n146\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.779\nIf you're saying, I have repeated layer\n3 14 times in the last 35 seconds.\n\n147\n00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:47.949\n&gt;&gt; Is it on layer 3, Ron?\n\n148\n00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:48.980\n&gt;&gt; It may be on layer 3.\n\n149\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.343\nThat may be why.\n\n150\n00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:55.074\n&gt;&gt; If I had to discern, maybe,\nyour hieroglyphics and sanskrit,\n\n151\n00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:56.747\nI'd go with layer 3.\n\n152\n00:07:56.747 --> 00:07:58.037\n&gt;&gt; You should go with layer 3.\n\n153\n00:07:58.037 --> 00:08:01.856\nBut it's very easily confused,\nbecause you think that well if\n\n154\n00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:06.410\nit's really riding directly on top of IP,\nyou might think it's Layer 4.\n\n155\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.843\nIt's very easy to get that confused,\nbut it is a Layer 3 protocol.\n\n156\n00:08:11.843 --> 00:08:15.641\nAnd that's what we want to make\nsure that we get to as well, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:20.260\nSo it is a built-in messaging\nsystem that works at Layer 3.\n\n158\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.287\nNow Daniel,\nif it's a built-in messaging system,\n\n159\n00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:29.395\nits native thought is not to say,\nyou don't need to send messages.\n\n160\n00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:34.518\nIts native thought is, well,\nI'm gonna send messages, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:39.477\nSo if some hacker, some attacker,\nokay, thinks about this idea,\n\n162\n00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:45.140\nit can transmit messages without the need\nof an application at the other end.\n\n163\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.711\nIt can transmit maybe\na payload of something,\n\n164\n00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.280\nmaybe a few bits of information.\n\n165\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.221\nWhat do you think, Dan?\n\n166\n00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.734\nYou think an attacker might be\ninterested in something like this?\n\n167\n00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.721\n&gt;&gt; I guarantee they would\nbe interested in that.\n\n168\n00:08:56.721 --> 00:09:01.643\nAny way I can get malicious payload\nfrom my machine to yours without being\n\n169\n00:09:01.643 --> 00:09:05.127\ndiscovered, or\nyou just left the door open for me.\n\n170\n00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:07.114\nThat's exactly what I'm gonna try to use.\n\n171\n00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:11.471\n&gt;&gt; So this is one of those protocols that\nkind of, all of a sudden, opens up more.\n\n172\n00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:12.666\nWe're used to pings.\n\n173\n00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:16.202\nWe like it when we send out a ping,\nand we get those replies.\n\n174\n00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:17.488\nLook, that worked good.\n\n175\n00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:18.218\n&gt;&gt; We're talking.\n\n176\n00:09:18.218 --> 00:09:19.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking.\n\n177\n00:09:19.027 --> 00:09:20.510\nSo I'm glad about that.\n\n178\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.050\nBut imagine if something else could\nbe delivered along with that.\n\n179\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.995\nOr just a system that is already set\nup there, that it takes advantage of,\n\n180\n00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:33.198\nusing whatever the defaults are, and\njust manipulating enough to make it work\n\n181\n00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:36.782\nthe way that they want it to,\ninstead of the way it's supposed to.\n\n182\n00:09:36.782 --> 00:09:39.784\nSo that's what we'd normally\nworry about here, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:39.784 --> 00:09:44.281\nMost of what we're talking about in\nterms of attacks or intrusions isn't\n\n184\n00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:48.792\nnecessarily where it's delivering\na gigantic type of malware payload.\n\n185\n00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:53.317\nBut what it's doing is it's taking\nadvantage of the way that the protocol\n\n186\n00:09:53.317 --> 00:09:54.781\nalready works, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:54.781 --> 00:10:00.442\nSo it can take advantage of it by doing\nthings that we don't want it to do.\n\n188\n00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:03.806\nAnd so that's what we're gonna take\na look at at least a little bit here,\n\n189\n00:10:03.806 --> 00:10:05.470\nwhen we talk about ICMP intrusion.\n\n190\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.875\nSo, let's talk about\nthe headers just briefly.\n\n191\n00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.942\nAnd this one, even though we're\nfocusing in on header analysis,\n\n192\n00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:15.362\nthis one is really not that difficult,\nin terms of the number of headers.\n\n193\n00:10:15.362 --> 00:10:17.376\nSo, let's take a look here, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:21.024\nNow, on my screen, when we take\na look at the computer screen here,\n\n195\n00:10:21.024 --> 00:10:23.720\nlet me see if I can move\nthat over just a little bit.\n\n196\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.809\nWe're focusing in, of course,\non the blue down here at the bottom.\n\n197\n00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:31.886\nI wanted to show you where it normally\ndoes end up adding in here, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:37.065\nWhere we would normally see other\ninformation, okay, such as the data pay\n\n199\n00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:42.507\nload as well, I just instead substituted\nthe internal workings of ICMP here.\n\n200\n00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:47.258\nDo not forget that this\nalso works In conjunction,\n\n201\n00:10:47.258 --> 00:10:51.462\nokay, with another field\nup here at the top.\n\n202\n00:10:51.462 --> 00:10:55.201\nNow, this is where it is\nactually one of these kind of\n\n203\n00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:58.524\nexam things that you\nwant to pay attention to.\n\n204\n00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.651\nSo, make sure you understand this,\nas well, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:06.365\nDaniel, as we take a look at what we\nsee up here at the header for IP, okay,\n\n206\n00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:11.006\nof all these fields that we see here,\nI'll eliminate the two easy ones,\n\n207\n00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:13.010\nDaniel, and see what we have.\n\n208\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.520\nActually, I'll eliminate\na lot of the easy ones.\n\n209\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.234\nThat way, Daniel can pick from the harder\nones, now that I've got you here.\n\n210\n00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:23.031\nOkay, so, Daniel I'm gonna eliminate\nsource and destination addresses.\n\n211\n00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:24.519\n&gt;&gt; Those are out of the choosings.\n\n212\n00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.942\n&gt;&gt; Yep, out of the choosings.\n\n213\n00:11:25.942 --> 00:11:27.431\nHeader Checksum, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:27.431 --> 00:11:28.645\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you're eliminating that one.\n\n215\n00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:29.590\n&gt;&gt; I'm eliminating that one.\n\n216\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.569\nI'm gonna eliminate these\nfirst four up here for us.\n\n217\n00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:38.397\nSo that kinda only really leaves us\nwith about five fields here, right?\n\n218\n00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:42.340\nThe 16-bit Identifier, the Flags,\nthe Fragment offset that we have.\n\n219\n00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.859\nThe Time-To-Live, that one, we should\nbe able to eliminate that one, but\n\n220\n00:11:45.859 --> 00:11:47.550\nlet's just throw that one in there.\n\n221\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.657\nAnd then protocol, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:54.844\nSo, when we start to take a look at\nwhat type of information we might see,\n\n223\n00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:58.016\ncoming across even something\nlike Wireshark, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.243\nWell, I'm looking for\nsomething that might show me it's ICMP.\n\n225\n00:12:01.243 --> 00:12:04.698\nNow, you can look over to the righthand\nside where we see info, and\n\n226\n00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:06.946\nit normally says, I see a b, very easily.\n\n227\n00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:08.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n228\n00:12:08.768 --> 00:12:10.570\nwe also see another field up there,\nthat says what?\n\n229\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.327\n&gt;&gt; Protocol.\n&gt;&gt; Protocol, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:15.095\nAnd that is the one we also\nwanna pay attention to.\n\n231\n00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:20.476\nIt is this one right here that will\ntell us whether or not this is actually\n\n232\n00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:25.426\ngonna be ICMP information that follows,\nor TCP, or UDP, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:28.921\nTake a look and make sure you understand.\n\n234\n00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:32.529\nSo let's do an example that\nbefore we move on, okay?\n\n235\n00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:34.797\nOver here on my Windows machine,\nI went in and\n\n236\n00:12:34.797 --> 00:12:37.686\ndid some pings to make sure\nthat we could see some things.\n\n237\n00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:41.878\nBut let me bring up good old Wireshark\nhere on my Windows 10 machine,\n\n238\n00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:45.657\nand in a moment here, I think,\nI'm running on ethernet zero.\n\n239\n00:12:45.657 --> 00:12:47.719\nYep, there we go.\n\n240\n00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:50.741\nSee if I can get that one to run for\na moment.\n\n241\n00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:55.823\nNow, I'm going to issue out some pings, so\nthat we can capture just a few of them.\n\n242\n00:12:55.823 --> 00:12:58.406\nSo I'm gonna send it out to\nmy default gateway, just so\n\n243\n00:12:58.406 --> 00:12:59.932\nthat we can get a few pings here.\n\n244\n00:12:59.932 --> 00:13:05.465\nThat's enough for us, we don't have to go\ntoo hefty into this, and stop the capture.\n\n245\n00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:09.050\nWhen I stop the capture,\nI'm gonna take a look at ICMP.\n\n246\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.056\nAll right, so the great thing is,\nI can do it in a couple of ways, right?\n\n247\n00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:18.423\nI can see it right away, but\nI'm just gonna filter it out here, ICMP.\n\n248\n00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:25.175\nAnd then we're gonna zoom in just enough\nso that we can see the ICMP information.\n\n249\n00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:28.510\nNotice that I'm getting information back,\nwhich is exactly what I want.\n\n250\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.663\nThere's that protocol field, Daniel,\n\n251\n00:13:30.663 --> 00:13:33.924\nthat you kind of eliminated to\nmake sure that we could see that.\n\n252\n00:13:33.924 --> 00:13:37.836\nBut if I select that, then I can\ntake a look at the middle section,\n\n253\n00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:40.766\nwhere now you start seeing,\nlook, there it is.\n\n254\n00:13:40.766 --> 00:13:43.341\nVersion 4, so\nthat we know that this is the Layer 3, and\n\n255\n00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:44.589\nthis is where it fools you.\n\n256\n00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:47.035\nYou might go, that means it's Layer 4.\n\n257\n00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.695\nIt is not.\nIt is internal.\n\n258\n00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:53.843\nSo if I expand that out, notice that\nright here, internally here, oops, okay.\n\n259\n00:13:53.843 --> 00:13:58.111\nWe start seeing some other good\ninformation right off the bat over\n\n260\n00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:59.052\nhere, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:59.052 --> 00:14:03.229\nSo that is what we're pretty\nmuch taking a look at.\n\n262\n00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:07.620\nNow if I expand out the frame, this is\nwhere I should, no, not the frame, the IP.\n\n263\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.019\nI was gonna say, which one am I supposed\nto be looking at, IP Version 4.\n\n264\n00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:17.579\nThis is where I'm looking at the protocol,\nand notice protocol here, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:20.878\nSo let me kind of squeeze this up here for\na moment, so\n\n266\n00:14:20.878 --> 00:14:23.432\nthat we can see this as well, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:28.968\nLet's just say, for example, Daniel,\nif we do not have the benefit,\n\n268\n00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:35.454\nright, of the upper window, where you can\nsee this protocol field up here, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:40.060\nBut, you do have the benefit\nof taking a look at, well,\n\n270\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.697\nlet's say this is kind\nof closed out there.\n\n271\n00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:45.505\nLet's say it's actually even right here.\n\n272\n00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:48.505\nAnd you were to see something and\nsay, hey,\n\n273\n00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:52.658\nhow can I find out what information\nis supposed to be on this?\n\n274\n00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.054\nWell, I can go to Internet Protocol.\n\n275\n00:14:55.054 --> 00:14:56.349\nI can look up the protocol field.\n\n276\n00:14:56.349 --> 00:15:00.690\nThen I know what type of traffic\nis coming across here, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.487\nSo, let's compare that with another field.\n\n278\n00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:08.804\nHopefully some other things\nhave come into my line here.\n\n279\n00:15:08.804 --> 00:15:10.740\nI don't think I've actually\nconnected anything else.\n\n280\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.067\nSo let's do this again, let's run\none more and then do a comparison.\n\n281\n00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:20.277\nAnd I'm going to open up a web browser,\nthis time.\n\n282\n00:15:20.277 --> 00:15:24.081\nThere we go, we're gonna take this site\nthat, apparently, I've been on before.\n\n283\n00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:26.185\nMalware Traffic Analysis, this is great.\n\n284\n00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:27.084\nThis is a great site.\n\n285\n00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.922\nI haven't mentioned it as well.\n\n286\n00:15:28.922 --> 00:15:32.034\nBut the nice thing about this,\nDaniel, on this site,\n\n287\n00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:36.566\nif you wanna learn how to use Wireshark\nbetter, you don't have to go out and go,\n\n288\n00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:39.904\nI don't wanna really capture\nmalicious traffic, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:41.531\nGreat thing is,\nthey already caught it for you.\n\n290\n00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:42.942\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n\n291\n00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.968\n&gt;&gt; But when they do that,\nit gives you the PCAP, right,\n\n292\n00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:48.205\nwhich is the file that Wireshark uses.\n\n293\n00:15:48.205 --> 00:15:51.725\nAnd that way you can actually examine it,\nand try and figure it out on your own.\n\n294\n00:15:51.725 --> 00:15:55.308\nSo this is a great site for\nyou to kind of take a look as a resource.\n\n295\n00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:57.463\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good and those resources.\n\n296\n00:15:57.463 --> 00:15:58.719\nLet me go ahead and stop this.\n\n297\n00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:02.946\nAnd now let's take a look\nat http It would be,\n\n298\n00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:06.741\nis it S here, or maybe I'm lying to you.\n\n299\n00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.952\nLet's just do a TCP,\nbecause that's probably easier.\n\n300\n00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:12.695\nTCP, there we go, that will make\nit a little bit easier on me.\n\n301\n00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:16.346\nLike, why isn't HGGBS working,\nI don't know, but I will select that one.\n\n302\n00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:20.931\nLet me select packet number 6 up here,\nthat looks like it is\n\n303\n00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:25.809\nactually connecting in on the protocol,\nand what I want here.\n\n304\n00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:31.694\nAnd let's take a look at the protocol\nfield once again, okay, that's better.\n\n305\n00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:34.575\nI don't know why the ICP wouldn't\nlet me do it, this is more like it.\n\n306\n00:16:34.575 --> 00:16:36.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:41.723\n&gt;&gt; So now, if I were to scroll in on\nsomething that looks like this, And\n\n308\n00:16:41.723 --> 00:16:44.970\nthey were to ask you which\ntype of packet would this be,\n\n309\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.641\nyou should be able to examine this and\ngo, this is going to be a TCP packet.\n\n310\n00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:53.575\nOf course, the other side will be UDP,\nICMP, you name it,\n\n311\n00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:55.555\nthe general census, right?\n\n312\n00:16:55.555 --> 00:17:00.368\nDaniel, I'm hoping that you get what I'm\ntrying to get to [LAUGH] in the display.\n\n313\n00:17:00.368 --> 00:17:03.715\n&gt;&gt; That we can find\nthe protocol that's being used,\n\n314\n00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:06.272\njust looking at the header protocol.\n\n315\n00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:09.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah without actually\nlooking at all the other-\n\n316\n00:17:09.604 --> 00:17:11.184\n&gt;&gt; Like extraneous things,\n\n317\n00:17:11.184 --> 00:17:12.555\nat that point anyway.\n\n318\n00:17:12.555 --> 00:17:14.859\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nbeing able to find something like that,\n\n319\n00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.275\nit may be helpful in the future,\nthat's all I'm saying.\n\n320\n00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:19.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; So just things like that that you need\n\n321\n00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:24.412\nto be able to do, so don't just go,\nRonnie's giving me the exam, I'm not.\n\n322\n00:17:24.412 --> 00:17:27.855\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the horse is being\nsufficiently flogged for\n\n323\n00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:29.624\nthe purposes of emphasis.\n\n324\n00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:35.177\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, it is about the idea of\nemphasizing that you can't just go,\n\n325\n00:17:35.177 --> 00:17:39.835\nall right, well,\nwhich field indicates that this is ICMP?\n\n326\n00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:43.588\nYou've got to know, it's the protocol\nfield, it's the protocol field, and\n\n327\n00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:44.157\nit's TCP.\n\n328\n00:17:44.157 --> 00:17:47.732\nAnd they say, which of the fields,\nand they show you something like,\n\n329\n00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:51.440\nwhich of the following fields emphasizes\nTCP, or says that this is TCP?\n\n330\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.935\nYou gotta know this,\nit's right here in the protocol,\n\n331\n00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:56.390\nit seems logical enough\nuntil the time limit, right?\n\n332\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.751\nOnce you hit the time limit, then all of\na sudden, all bets are off, and you and\n\n333\n00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:02.821\nI have seen that even on other shows.\n\n334\n00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:06.028\nWhere, I'm a 32 year master of doing this,\nand time limit comes on,\n\n335\n00:18:06.028 --> 00:18:08.334\nand they're like,\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n336\n00:18:08.334 --> 00:18:10.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who am I, this is hard.\n\n337\n00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:14.148\n&gt;&gt; But it's the same thing, that time\nlimit just messes with our head a little\n\n338\n00:18:14.148 --> 00:18:18.198\nbit, and now we're looking at it and\ngoing, I don't have a clue what those\n\n339\n00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:21.502\nfields are, let me try, version-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:22.589\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, but\n\n341\n00:18:22.589 --> 00:18:27.449\nyou get that idea that something\nlike this could be important for us.\n\n342\n00:18:27.449 --> 00:18:30.755\nIf we wanted to focus in, this is\nwhat we would end up focusing in on,\n\n343\n00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:33.254\nwhich is this right here,\non the different types.\n\n344\n00:18:33.254 --> 00:18:37.967\nWe're gonna talk about the idea of types\nbecause this is, once again, important for\n\n345\n00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:39.157\nus to get on the exam.\n\n346\n00:18:39.157 --> 00:18:42.338\nI'm gonna talk about code,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n347\n00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:47.597\nthese are the only two that we really need\nto focus in on to help us out with ICMP.\n\n348\n00:18:47.597 --> 00:18:50.415\nBecause they help us to determine, okay,\n\n349\n00:18:50.415 --> 00:18:54.265\nwhat we normally end up getting here,\nokay, at the ICMP.\n\n350\n00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:58.809\nRemember that with ICMP you're willing\ngetting two particular types of\n\n351\n00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:02.247\nmessages here, one,\nof course, is error messages.\n\n352\n00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:06.514\nThose, believe or not, are more\nhelpful to you than you think about.\n\n353\n00:19:06.514 --> 00:19:12.243\nBecause they really do tell us from that\ndevice, whichever device that sends it,\n\n354\n00:19:12.243 --> 00:19:16.577\nsomething is wrong, and\nthat's a good, good, good thing.\n\n355\n00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:20.554\nThe other side is what you send,\nwhich essentially are query messages for\n\n356\n00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:21.203\nthese two.\n\n357\n00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.089\nSo it is set up without you and\n\n358\n00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:27.343\nI having to add in any additional\napplication to do this, okay.\n\n359\n00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:30.886\nSo that is what we are going to do,\nbut it is a means for\n\n360\n00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:33.716\nthese devices to be able to communicate.\n\n361\n00:19:33.716 --> 00:19:38.280\nAnd the heart of it, what we normally do\nis just take a look at error messages.\n\n362\n00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.307\nBut overall, though, the idea of\nactually understanding the code and\n\n363\n00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:45.080\nthe message type is key.\n\n364\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.319\nAnd also another point for\njust getting ready for\n\n365\n00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:53.054\nthe exam, ICMP does not use ports, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:53.054 --> 00:19:57.221\nKey uses type, uses code, but\nnot ports, do not get fooled into this,\n\n367\n00:19:57.221 --> 00:20:01.180\neven though you see a list of port\nnumbers, and it says echo, echo,\n\n368\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.483\nreply, and it shows you a port number.\n\n369\n00:20:03.483 --> 00:20:05.685\nDon't get me wrong, people can associate\nthem with ports that they choose to.\n\n370\n00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:09.620\nBut, at least on this one in\nterms of intrusion analysis and\n\n371\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.598\nwhat we have to know here, it is about\ntype and code, and not port numbers.\n\n372\n00:20:14.598 --> 00:20:17.038\nVery key element for us to do this,\n\n373\n00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:22.341\nwhenever we start taking a look at\nan idea of intrusion, okay, with ICMP,\n\n374\n00:20:22.341 --> 00:20:28.088\nit normally happens in two phases or\nthree depending, on how old you are, okay.\n\n375\n00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:33.844\nSo the older guys used to of course do\nit in the same hacking process, right.\n\n376\n00:20:33.844 --> 00:20:38.601\nThere's always the idea of reconnaissance,\nthe scanning, and then of course the idea\n\n377\n00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:42.796\nof doing the exploitability, and\nthen of course, the ultimate intrusion.\n\n378\n00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:46.289\nOnce you do the exploit, and\nthen how you do the intrusion.\n\n379\n00:20:46.289 --> 00:20:50.044\nBut today, most people just round it\nup to, all right, here's how you do\n\n380\n00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:54.179\nthe reconnaissance, and the exploit\nessentially is the same as the intrusion.\n\n381\n00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:57.734\nSo they don't tend to separate it\nout as detailed as they once did,\n\n382\n00:20:57.734 --> 00:20:59.013\nin what they want to do.\n\n383\n00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:06.776\nSometimes, it's not always about just the\nidea of delivering some malicious packet.\n\n384\n00:21:06.776 --> 00:21:10.427\nMost of the time,\nin the early days of ICMP,\n\n385\n00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:14.880\nthe idea of the intrusion\nwas always something like.\n\n386\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.092\nIf I can ever remember, denial of service\nstuff, of all the things I can't remember,\n\n387\n00:21:19.092 --> 00:21:20.376\ndenial of service stuff.\n\n388\n00:21:20.376 --> 00:21:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the old ping of death.\n\n389\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.019\n&gt;&gt; Ping of death,\nstuff like that, it was really-\n\n390\n00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:24.674\n&gt;&gt; Popular.\n\n391\n00:21:24.674 --> 00:21:28.480\n&gt;&gt; Very popular like that, but\nonce they started massaging around and\n\n392\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.952\nrealizing, we can do a lot more\nthan just preventing things,\n\n393\n00:21:31.952 --> 00:21:35.379\nwe can do some other things that\ncan really trip up a network.\n\n394\n00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.590\nThis is what can start to happen here, so\n\n395\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.162\nwe definitely wanna take a look at some of\nthe different things that can start here.\n\n396\n00:21:42.162 --> 00:21:47.121\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of an intrusion, so Daniel,\n\n397\n00:21:47.121 --> 00:21:51.830\nlet me see if Daniel can guess\nwhat I'm trying to do here, okay.\n\n398\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.579\nSo Daniel, I am putting it on to your-\n&gt;&gt; Conserving the screen [LAUGH].\n\n399\n00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:57.190\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna try and clear the screen.\n\n400\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.205\n&gt;&gt; CLS in Windows\n&gt;&gt; Which apparently I cannot do.\n\n401\n00:21:59.205 --> 00:22:02.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel if I, I know this is another\n\n402\n00:22:02.286 --> 00:22:06.745\nthing, as an attacker, I probably would\nnot be using a Windows 10 machine.\n\n403\n00:22:06.745 --> 00:22:09.863\n&gt;&gt; Unlikely, not impossible, but unlikely.\n\n404\n00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:15.006\n&gt;&gt; But I'm going to use it anyways, it\nmakes for novelty more than anything else.\n\n405\n00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:19.951\nSo Daniel, if I were to say, all right,\nhere it is, I've got myself to this point\n\n406\n00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:24.289\nwhere I need to start doing something,\nso how do I start going, right?\n\n407\n00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:31.632\nI'm getting a reply there,\nnot getting a reply there.\n\n408\n00:22:31.632 --> 00:22:34.078\n&gt;&gt; So you're basically looking for\n\n409\n00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:38.630\nconnected machines that you can\nactually make contact with.\n\n410\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.308\n&gt;&gt; Right, I may not get connections,\nI may get something like this.\n\n411\n00:22:41.308 --> 00:22:44.935\nAnd notice that I'm actually getting some\ndifferent responses that are going on\n\n412\n00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:47.510\nhere, right, but\nit's telling me something, right?\n\n413\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:52.100\nSo this right here is a manual process,\nit's not the way Daniel would do this.\n\n414\n00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.281\n&gt;&gt; It is what we'd call a manual ping\nsweep, a very slow manual ping sweep.\n\n415\n00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:01.885\nWith 254 in this network,\nit would take me a half a year, [LAUGH].\n\n416\n00:23:01.885 --> 00:23:05.089\n&gt;&gt; It might take you awhile, yes sir.\n\n417\n00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:10.516\n&gt;&gt; But you get the idea, okay, so\nwe know that this is a tool that yeah,\n\n418\n00:23:10.516 --> 00:23:13.586\nit doesn't seem like it's harmful.\n\n419\n00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:17.666\nBut Daniel, this at least tells\nme at least something here,\n\n420\n00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:19.914\nthe first one, that guy is what?\n\n421\n00:23:19.914 --> 00:23:20.904\n&gt;&gt; He's alive and talking.\n\n422\n00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:23.836\n&gt;&gt; He's alive and talking,\nthis second one here,\n\n423\n00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:26.491\nI don't know, I didn't wait enough time.\n\n424\n00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:30.484\nSo I got a little bit impatient cuz I was\nhoping it would come through a lot faster,\n\n425\n00:23:30.484 --> 00:23:32.446\nbut that one's down, I know for sure.\n\n426\n00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:37.723\nBut notice this third one here,\nokay, notice that all three of these\n\n427\n00:23:37.723 --> 00:23:42.553\nare different replies that we get,\nand it all comes from ICMP.\n\n428\n00:23:42.553 --> 00:23:47.051\nThe great thing is, if I were to do this,\nlet's say that, I know this is silly,\n\n429\n00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:49.216\nbut my network is five machines here.\n\n430\n00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:52.376\nI at least can tell you\nsomething at this point, okay,\n\n431\n00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:54.790\nthat this guy definitely may be a target.\n\n432\n00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.624\nThis one, possibly,\nif I were to wait a little bit longer.\n\n433\n00:23:58.624 --> 00:24:01.678\nBut more than likely if doesn't request\ntime out, let's just say it's down.\n\n434\n00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:02.502\n&gt;&gt; It's just timed out, yeah.\n\n435\n00:24:02.502 --> 00:24:03.871\nHe's probably not gonna be a target, okay?\n\n436\n00:24:03.871 --> 00:24:04.632\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n437\n00:24:04.632 --> 00:24:06.810\n&gt;&gt; This one here though,\nthis is my own machine I think yeah,\n\n438\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.598\nI think it's my own machine,\nwe're looking.\n\n439\n00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:11.921\n&gt;&gt; It's called firewall.\n\n440\n00:24:11.921 --> 00:24:14.704\n&gt;&gt; Firewall, some sort,\nsomething that started to go,\n\n441\n00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:18.999\nI don't want this to happen whatever might\nbe, but destination host unreachable,\n\n442\n00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.944\nokay, so that's actually another.\n\n443\n00:24:20.944 --> 00:24:26.261\nIt's a type of ICMP message that we\nget and there are a lot of different\n\n444\n00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:30.954\nones that are out here depending\non what we were trying to do.\n\n445\n00:24:30.954 --> 00:24:33.496\nNow, if I were a smarter man,\nwhich I wasn't.\n\n446\n00:24:33.496 --> 00:24:35.018\nNo, I still got it going, don't I?\n\n447\n00:24:35.018 --> 00:24:36.824\nYeah, it looks like it's still running.\n\n448\n00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:38.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; Cool, okay, so that\n\n449\n00:24:38.574 --> 00:24:39.507\n&gt;&gt; It stopped.\n\n450\n00:24:39.507 --> 00:24:40.024\n&gt;&gt; Did it?\n\n451\n00:24:40.024 --> 00:24:40.791\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Awe, it did stop.\n\n452\n00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:42.511\n&gt;&gt; The fin is blue, which means start..\n\n453\n00:24:42.511 --> 00:24:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Awe, well, let me do this again, okay.\n\n454\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.041\nSo let's run those again.\n\n455\n00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:48.751\nThis time I'm gonna get\nall different results,\n\n456\n00:24:48.751 --> 00:24:49.966\nwhich is gonna be weird right now.\n\n457\n00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:50.526\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n458\n00:24:50.526 --> 00:24:54.570\n&gt;&gt; So the one that I'm really,\nlet's start at the 2 again.\n\n459\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:00.024\nSo there we go, we've got a nice ping\ngoing on there, so I know that one's up.\n\n460\n00:25:00.024 --> 00:25:01.710\nAnd we'll do this one again.\n\n461\n00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.369\nThere we go.\n\n462\n00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:04.610\nSo that will give us what we want here.\n\n463\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.845\nAnd now I'm starting to see maybe\nthe firewall is actually gonna be,\n\n464\n00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:12.799\nlet me skip over four and\nsee if I could request, no, all right.\n\n465\n00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:16.633\nSo everything at least on this machine I\nwas hoping to get a request timed out at\n\n466\n00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:19.418\nthis point but\nI'm not actually getting one right now.\n\n467\n00:25:19.418 --> 00:25:22.002\nSo anything that I'm doing,\nthat's fine, but\n\n468\n00:25:22.002 --> 00:25:25.470\nwe want to take a look at these\nmessages in particular because this\n\n469\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.880\nparticular type is very interesting for\nus.\n\n470\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.753\nSo let me stop that as well.\n\n471\n00:25:29.753 --> 00:25:31.873\nSo we think about something like this,\nright?\n\n472\n00:25:31.873 --> 00:25:35.369\nThe idea of an ICMP pink suite\ngives us the beginning and\n\n473\n00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:37.968\nthat is me doing a query type of message.\n\n474\n00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:42.481\nQuerying those devices and if they reply,\nI know that that's a possible target.\n\n475\n00:25:42.481 --> 00:25:46.204\nThere you go, you have reconnaissance\nat this point and what's being done.\n\n476\n00:25:46.204 --> 00:25:48.923\nNow the next thing that we can also do is\n\n477\n00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:53.616\ntake a look at those messages that\nwe are getting and I can do ICMP.\n\n478\n00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:02.127\nAnd now let's see what else we are,\nwait, it only caught a few of them.\n\n479\n00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:06.018\nWhy did it catch the,\nI was hoping it would actually catch the,\n\n480\n00:26:06.018 --> 00:26:08.162\nit did not catch the destination.\n\n481\n00:26:08.162 --> 00:26:09.356\n&gt;&gt; The one destination [CROSSTALK].\n\n482\n00:26:09.356 --> 00:26:11.137\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat was the ones that I was hoping for,\n\n483\n00:26:11.137 --> 00:26:13.020\nwas to catch the destination\nunreachable ones.\n\n484\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.870\nBut this will at least give\nus a little bit to work\n\n485\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.093\nwith when we start to take\na look at some stuff, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:19.093 --> 00:26:22.171\nSo, a couple things I want to point out so\n\n487\n00:26:22.171 --> 00:26:26.713\nthat we can see this as well,\nDaniel, especially in here.\n\n488\n00:26:26.713 --> 00:26:29.879\nI was trying to think of\nthe operating system.\n\n489\n00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:35.943\nMy mind is going crazy, okay.\n\n490\n00:26:35.943 --> 00:26:36.723\nThe winders.\n\n491\n00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:39.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 32 bytes.\n\n492\n00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of data, and\n\n493\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.274\nthat can go across.\n\n494\n00:26:43.274 --> 00:26:46.055\nDaniel, do you know what\nthose 32 bytes actually are?\n\n495\n00:26:46.055 --> 00:26:47.879\nI've never looked at them really.\n\n496\n00:26:47.879 --> 00:26:50.673\n&gt;&gt; I can't say that I've ever\nreally dove into that stuff.\n\n497\n00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:55.494\nI know that there is some interesting\ninformation that deals with the type of\n\n498\n00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:56.484\nICMP traffic.\n\n499\n00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:59.426\nIf your look at the RFC,\nthere are multiple types.\n\n500\n00:26:59.426 --> 00:27:04.409\nWe've seen, I think, type 8 is the\nstandard for ping, and there's 14, there's\n\n501\n00:27:04.409 --> 00:27:06.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot.\n\n502\n00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:07.372\nAnd we're gonna go over some of them.\n\n503\n00:27:07.372 --> 00:27:09.868\nWe're not gonna go over all of them, but\nwe'll go over at least some of them here.\n\n504\n00:27:09.868 --> 00:27:12.362\n&gt;&gt; I assume maybe there's something\nto do with that, it's a payload.\n\n505\n00:27:12.362 --> 00:27:13.962\n&gt;&gt; It is part of the payload.\n\n506\n00:27:13.962 --> 00:27:16.749\nSo let's talk a look at this here,\nright here, Daniel.\n\n507\n00:27:16.749 --> 00:27:19.563\nSo I've selected the very\nfirst one that I have.\n\n508\n00:27:19.563 --> 00:27:25.146\nAnd now as I scroll down through here,\nokay, I want us to take a look at ICMP.\n\n509\n00:27:25.146 --> 00:27:31.620\nAnd when you hover over this,\nnotice that as I select that,\n\n510\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.670\npay attention to the bottom\nof the screen where\n\n511\n00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:41.090\nthe highlighting is actually going on.\n\n512\n00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.230\nSo, when we talk about the idea of\nthat information of the 32 bytes,\n\n513\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.614\nremember that the hexadecimal\ncode that we are looking.\n\n514\n00:27:48.614 --> 00:27:52.990\nEach one of these essentially is\nwhat eight bits of information.\n\n515\n00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.686\nEach of those two numbers, okay?\n\n516\n00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:56.450\nIt's eight bits of information.\n\n517\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:01.083\nSo, if I wanted to figure out what that\nactually was, Daniel, take a look right\n\n518\n00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:06.013\nover here in the alphanumeric output, let\nme see if I can, well, let me highlight.\n\n519\n00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:07.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit does look like it's the alphabet.\n\n520\n00:28:07.917 --> 00:28:12.327\n&gt;&gt; It is the alphabet, okay, and\non the alphabet the only way that I\n\n521\n00:28:12.327 --> 00:28:15.756\nactually was able to,\nnow, I'm not a genius, so\n\n522\n00:28:15.756 --> 00:28:20.520\nit took me a little bit longer,\nI was like why is the alphabet in here?\n\n523\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.554\nWell then I was like,\nwhat are those 32 bytes?\n\n524\n00:28:23.554 --> 00:28:28.589\nIf you count up the highlighted numbers,\nbeginning with 161 there,\n\n525\n00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:34.548\nokay, all the way over to 69 down at the\nbottom, that is 32 bytes of information.\n\n526\n00:28:34.548 --> 00:28:39.071\n&gt;&gt; So then they're just using the alphabet\nas a standard payload to see if it got\n\n527\n00:28:39.071 --> 00:28:41.413\nthere and to give us some information.\n\n528\n00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:44.200\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, and\nthat is what they're using.\n\n529\n00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.944\nHow do you know if there's something maybe\ngoing on there with something like this?\n\n530\n00:28:48.944 --> 00:28:51.241\nIt's not impossible, okay?\n\n531\n00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:53.305\nBut it is highly improbable\nthat it can happen.\n\n532\n00:28:53.305 --> 00:28:56.266\nBut if all of a sudden you start seeing\nthis is becoming a string of z's.\n\n533\n00:28:56.266 --> 00:28:57.701\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds like a fuzz.\n\n534\n00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:59.973\n&gt;&gt; Somebody, yeah, there you go.\n\n535\n00:28:59.973 --> 00:29:02.153\nOkay, Daniel, spot on.\n\n536\n00:29:02.153 --> 00:29:03.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are the man.\n\n537\n00:29:03.637 --> 00:29:06.214\n&gt;&gt; I've done a few things when\nit comes to attacking networks.\n\n538\n00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:07.809\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n539\n00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:08.879\nYou are the man here.\n\n540\n00:29:08.879 --> 00:29:11.448\nSo if all of a sudden you\nstart looking at this and\n\n541\n00:29:11.448 --> 00:29:14.480\nyou go why are these pings\nstarting to appear like this?\n\n542\n00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.416\nWell, It doesn't mean that this is gonna\ntell you exactly what's happening, but\n\n543\n00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:21.613\nif you get a sentence that says haha.\n\n544\n00:29:21.613 --> 00:29:26.003\nIt's actually repeated\nH-A H-A H-A all the way down,\n\n545\n00:29:26.003 --> 00:29:29.727\nyou might be going,\n&gt;&gt; They're trying to crash the protocol,\n\n546\n00:29:29.727 --> 00:29:32.832\nthey're trying to crash the program\nthat's running those things\n\n547\n00:29:32.832 --> 00:29:35.894\nby just hammering it with information,\nmore than it can handle.\n\n548\n00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.752\nAnd seeing what happens if it crashes,\n\n549\n00:29:37.752 --> 00:29:41.032\nthere's a good possibility that\nthey have like an overflow attack.\n\n550\n00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:43.894\n&gt;&gt; It at least shows you something\nlike that the machine didn't generate.\n\n551\n00:29:43.894 --> 00:29:47.478\n&gt;&gt; And it didn't know how to handle\ninformation that it was given..\n\n552\n00:29:47.478 --> 00:29:50.761\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it'll at least show\nyou something like that, so\n\n553\n00:29:50.761 --> 00:29:54.590\nthis is something, is not the most\nsignificant thing in the world.\n\n554\n00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.420\nBut it is something that you can point and\nat least be able to see.\n\n555\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.003\nThe other part of this that we\nalso will pay attention to and\n\n556\n00:30:01.003 --> 00:30:04.867\nthen we'll actually have to come back cuz\nI'm realizing I'm very short on time here.\n\n557\n00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:08.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once again I wonder how in the world I\n\n558\n00:30:08.494 --> 00:30:10.583\ncould actually talk about ICMP this long,\nI can.\n\n559\n00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:15.591\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is what happens too,\n\n560\n00:30:15.591 --> 00:30:23.286\nis if I select this, notice that\na request is actually an echo ping,\n\n561\n00:30:23.286 --> 00:30:27.344\nbut it's a type 8 request, okay?\n\n562\n00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:33.240\nAnd that is key because that is different\nfrom if I select the reply maybe.\n\n563\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.735\nSelect the reply.\n\n564\n00:30:35.735 --> 00:30:38.814\nI can't tell what the\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n565\n00:30:38.814 --> 00:30:39.477\n&gt;&gt; The eight and\n\n566\n00:30:39.477 --> 00:30:43.283\nthe zero with the slash through it,\nI was like, they look pretty similar.\n\n567\n00:30:43.283 --> 00:30:44.322\nThat looked like an eight.\n\n568\n00:30:44.322 --> 00:30:45.567\nI was about to say, I'm wrong.\n\n569\n00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:47.215\nIt's actually an eight again.\n\n570\n00:30:47.215 --> 00:30:48.407\nNo, it's a zero.\n\n571\n00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:55.329\nSo two basics here that we have\nthe ability to see as far as ICMP goes.\n\n572\n00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:58.689\nWe're typing code, we haven't got\nthe code yet but we definitely need to.\n\n573\n00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:03.841\nBut I can't really go any farther, Daniel,\ncuz there's a lot more right here.\n\n574\n00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:06.179\nAnd I need to save that for\npart two because if not,\n\n575\n00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:08.811\nthis show will actually go\nway longer than it should be.\n\n576\n00:31:08.811 --> 00:31:09.902\n&gt;&gt; It will go long, long, long.\n\n577\n00:31:09.902 --> 00:31:11.455\nThat's right, not a problem, Ronnie.\n\n578\n00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.171\nWe'll do that,\n\n579\n00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:15.304\nrolled us right into one of our famous\nparts his will be a lot of fun to see.\n\n580\n00:31:15.304 --> 00:31:17.282\nWhere Ronnie is taking us with this.\n\n581\n00:31:17.282 --> 00:31:18.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz he's already kind of\n\n582\n00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:22.572\nhinted at some of the horizons that are\nyet to come, it's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n583\n00:31:22.572 --> 00:31:24.724\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by,\nwe'll see you in part two.\n\n584\n00:31:24.724 --> 00:31:27.924\nHopefully we'll see you good folks out\nthere as well in that part, but as for\n\n585\n00:31:27.924 --> 00:31:29.528\nthis one, we're gonna call it a day.\n\n586\n00:31:29.528 --> 00:31:32.305\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n587\n00:31:32.305 --> 00:31:33.252\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n588\n00:31:33.252 --> 00:31:35.077\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:31:35.077 --> 00:31:41.752\n[MUSIC]\n\n590\n00:31:41.752 --> 00:31:47.050\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.478\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:11.045\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:12.969\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.540\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.730\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.706\nAnd in today's episode, we're back\nwith more in our Cisco SecApps series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:26.230\nThen joining us back in the studio yet\nagain our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.610\nRonnie we're glad to have you again today.\n\n11\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.660\nHow's it going, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for having me\non the show as we continue on in taking\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.800\na look at ICMP vulnerabilities and\nattacks that we can see there.\n\n14\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.937\nSo we are picking up in a part two where\nwhat we've talked about of course is\n\n15\n00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:42.607\nthe ICMP header as being\nable to analyze them and\n\n16\n00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:44.833\nunderstand what's actually in them.\n\n17\n00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.471\nSo, let's make sure that we do a brief\nlittle review cuz it might have been\n\n18\n00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.420\na couple of days before you have\nactually taken a look at it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.501\nWe are picking back up here.\n\n20\n00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.580\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nwe will jump right into it.\n\n21\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.970\nRemember that ICMP itself is\nnot a layer four protocol.\n\n22\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.785\nIt is a layer three protocol.\n\n23\n00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:06.744\nAnd so even though you see right here\nwhere we have the IP headers up there\n\n24\n00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:10.080\non the top, ICMP is really a part of that.\n\n25\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.370\nSo a lot of times we do tend to think that\nbecause we stack at the right near there,\n\n26\n00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.030\nthat we believe that it\nturns into layer four.\n\n27\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.580\nIt doesn't, it's really\ninternally a part of layer three.\n\n28\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.870\nSo we of course are gonna focus\nin on these four headers here.\n\n29\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.390\nSo if we just focus in on those four\nheaders, and we also talked about\n\n30\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.520\nthis in the previous episode as well,\nthat really what we are concerned about\n\n31\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.160\na lot of times is gonna be right\nhere in the type and the code.\n\n32\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.970\nBecause we get different messages and\n\n33\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.550\nwe also described why ICMP\nworks the way that it does.\n\n34\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.470\nSo make sure you go back and\n\n35\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.260\ncheck out part one if you\nare not as familiar with ICMP.\n\n36\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.193\nBut if you are, this little review as well\nas part one you are probably going okay,\n\n37\n00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.580\nI know that stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.828\nWe also of course showed you\nthe beginnings of some type of\n\n39\n00:01:55.828 --> 00:01:58.584\nan attack that you can use with ICMP.\n\n40\n00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:02.666\nAnd normally with ICMP the attacks\nkinda come in two stages or\n\n41\n00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.610\nthree depending on how old you\nare in the networking world, right.\n\n42\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.970\nWe used to talk about the idea\nof reconnaissance and\n\n43\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.800\nthen there would be a brief bit\nof exploitation and figuring out\n\n44\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.650\nthe true vulnerability that you could get\nand then of course the ultimate attack.\n\n45\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.410\nToday they just kind of go,\nall right, there's reconnaissance,\n\n46\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.328\nthere's scanning, and\nthen there's the vulnerability and attack.\n\n47\n00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:29.255\nSo everybody has kind of truncated things,\nmove them all together and\n\n48\n00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:31.060\ntried to make into two.\n\n49\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.000\nSo it doesn't really matter\nwhether it's two or three but\n\n50\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.200\njust kind of get the idea that it normally\nhappens in a couple of different stages.\n\n51\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.999\nThe reconnaissance stage or the scanning\nstage really gives us a ton of information\n\n52\n00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.959\nbecause that's what ICMP is built around,\nokay?\n\n53\n00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.860\nIt's built around returning\nthose types of messages.\n\n54\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.850\nSo we did show you like we said\nthe ability here to do something like\n\n55\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.360\na simple or a manual type of what\nwe call ICMP sweeping attack.\n\n56\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.850\nWhere we can just start pinging\nsequentially those IP addresses\n\n57\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.580\nto see what type of response that we get.\n\n58\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.540\nSo any type of response that we get, that\ncomes back is an ICMP type of message.\n\n59\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.050\nAnd if it shows anything besides real,\n\n60\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.079\na lot of times where the request\ntimed out or the host timed out,\n\n61\n00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.662\nwhatever the message normally is,\nthen we know that that device is on.\n\n62\n00:03:20.662 --> 00:03:23.244\nEven if we're not getting\nany other information,\n\n63\n00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.607\nwe know that that's a possibility\nof a connection at that point but\n\n64\n00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.084\nthere's other things\nthat are also happening.\n\n65\n00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:33.311\nSo today we want to jump in to\nthose particular types of messages\n\n66\n00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.139\nthat are a little bit just\nbeyond what we see sometimes and\n\n67\n00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.070\nwe don't understand what they are.\n\n68\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.870\nAnd talk about why they may be\nimportant to us as well and\n\n69\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.000\nwhat they can help us to be able to do.\n\n70\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.930\nAnd show you what attacks or\nthe idea of what\n\n71\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.860\ninformation is given to the attacker\nwhen they run stuff like this, okay.\n\n72\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.950\nSo the first one is kind of grouped\ntogether in what we call some type of\n\n73\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.420\ndestination unreachable attack, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.161\nRemember that with ICMP, there is no\nport number normally assigned to ICMP.\n\n75\n00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:10.791\nYou will see certain programs that\nwill show you something like,\n\n76\n00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:14.860\nif you go into a firewall and\nyou say hey I'm gonna deny this.\n\n77\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.720\nYou'll see where you can\npick the protocol and\n\n78\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.880\nright beside it they'll have a little in\nparentheses a number, okay, of some sort.\n\n79\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.482\nAnd we automatically assume that's the\nport number because if you scroll on down\n\n80\n00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:29.147\nand go to HTTP port 80,\nyou'll see HTTP or www on the say 80.\n\n81\n00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:32.971\nSo we automatically assume that this\nis gonna be that same idea of the port\n\n82\n00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.050\nnumber, but it really isn't, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.111\nIn ICMP,\nthere's no real port number attached but\n\n84\n00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.540\nthere are what we'll call types, and there\nis also what we call a message or a code.\n\n85\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.194\nSo that's why these two\nfields are important, okay.\n\n86\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:52.328\nWith that type of information, okay,\nif I can identify the message and\n\n87\n00:04:52.328 --> 00:04:58.232\ncode, I might be able to understand along\nwith the functioning of how ICMP works,\n\n88\n00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:02.490\nhow far someone can get and\nalso some of the information.\n\n89\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.610\nSo for example, notice that I'm\njust kind of eliminated a lot.\n\n90\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.717\nThere's a lot more code than\nwhat I put up here, and\n\n91\n00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:11.460\nthere's really a lot more\ncodes than what I put up here.\n\n92\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.240\nBut really these are the ones that we're\ngonna focus in on for the exam, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie, I actually came across\nthis as a red team member, right,\n\n94\n00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.920\ntrying to look into and\nbreak into networks.\n\n95\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.895\nI discovered this in Nmap.\n\n96\n00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:25.409\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people they block ping, right?\n\n97\n00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.225\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They don't want you to find out whether\n\n98\n00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:28.138\nor not something is,\n\n99\n00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.253\nat least they don't want you easily\ndiscerning what's on the network.\n\n100\n00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:34.074\nNmap has an ability to use\none of the different types or\n\n101\n00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:37.090\ncodes because that's\ntypically not being blocked.\n\n102\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The time stamp or the time, yeah,\n\n103\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.390\nI think there's a time stamp.\n\n104\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of different\nthings that we may go, no,\n\n105\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.430\nlet's just turn off ICMP totally.\n\n106\n00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.500\nWell, remember there is other devices\non your network that heavily depend\n\n107\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.210\non these messages saying that\nthings are up and operating.\n\n108\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.340\nNow you may not outside of your network\nwant to actually return anything, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.340\nAnd that's up to you, and\nthat's fine for the majority of things.\n\n110\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.175\nBut if you are having testing going on,\nif you're connecting to a cloud service\n\n111\n00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.693\nsometimes, or\nif you're connecting to a partner,\n\n112\n00:06:06.693 --> 00:06:09.290\nyou may go ahead and\nturn that particular feature on.\n\n113\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.616\nJust so that you can establish that\nthose devices can see each other and\n\n114\n00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.532\nthat they are communicating.\n\n115\n00:06:15.532 --> 00:06:18.669\nBut there are some times you actually\nhave more that happens here, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.515\nSo these particular messages that we\nget really do correspond to a type and\n\n117\n00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:28.908\na code and what you and I at least want to\nunderstand as the basic functioning here,\n\n118\n00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:32.502\nbecause that may help to reveal\nthe idea of the attack or\n\n119\n00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:36.488\nanalysis that we can take if we\nget these types of messages and\n\n120\n00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:39.960\nwe're not expecting to get these messages,\nokay?\n\n121\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.510\nSo that's what we want to focus in on.\n\n122\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.880\nOkay, now we're gonna do where we'll\nshow you how this actually comes across,\n\n123\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.420\nWireshark.\n\n124\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.302\nSo that's gonna go, Ronnie you're\ngonna talk through the whole thing.\n\n125\n00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:52.875\nHopefully not, okay but\nyou can't count me out on that,\n\n126\n00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:56.380\nI can talk a little bit on\na lot of different things here.\n\n127\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.620\nSo, but let's go ahead and\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n128\n00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.830\nSo here's kind of the basic three.\n\n129\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.925\nI just wanna go as and\ngraphical understanding that way,\n\n130\n00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:07.805\ncuz me I just go all right, I'm issuing\na ping here's a response on it.\n\n131\n00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:08.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay great.\n\n132\n00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.994\nNice, I've seen ping before Ronnie,\nyou're not impressing me.\n\n133\n00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:15.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It just kinda help to account\na break down the process to us so\n\n134\n00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:19.010\nwe can better solidify in our\nminds what is actually happening.\n\n135\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we want.\n\n136\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.530\nWe want you to kind of go in,\nnot only for the exam but\n\n137\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.174\nas you see the information to understand,\n\n138\n00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:30.630\nget an understanding of what is happening\nwhen you get these messages here, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.980\nSo the common one that you and\nI generally end up doing,\n\n140\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.300\nright, is that we just ping\nsome end user device out there.\n\n141\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Whether it's across the Internet,\n\n142\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.010\nwhether it's inside our network, we ping.\n\n143\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.155\nWhen we do so, we normally send\nwhat we call an echo-request,\n\n144\n00:07:44.155 --> 00:07:49.010\nand that echo-request is at layer\nthree because it is an ICMP message.\n\n145\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:54.378\nThe other side takes it and they send\nback automatically and echo reply, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:57.866\nWhen they do so, we of course get\nthat response that comes back.\n\n147\n00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:02.846\nAnd depending on the operating system,\nright, we know that by default, okay,\n\n148\n00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:06.453\nWindows does Four,\n[SOUND] I can't count anymore, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:09.460\nFour ICMP messages that\nnormally come back.\n\n150\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.710\nIf you're on a Cisco router,\nit choose five.\n\n151\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.430\nSo we don't see that-\n&gt;&gt; On a Linux machine,\n\n152\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.335\nit just keeps going until\nyou tell it to stop.\n\n153\n00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:18.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n154\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.300\nI don't know what the difference or\nwhy some people chose four, five, or-\n\n155\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.924\n&gt;&gt; I think it's just a preference thing.\n\n156\n00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:26.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a preference thing depending\non what we need that's available.\n\n157\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.209\nBut apparently, according to Windows,\nthey're saying look, if you got four,\n\n158\n00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.396\nthat means you're connected.\n\n159\n00:08:30.396 --> 00:08:31.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n160\n00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:35.820\n&gt;&gt; What happens 10 or 15 down the line and\njust goes none [LAUGH]?\n\n161\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.580\nSo you kind of see that idea.\n\n162\n00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.492\nWith Cisco routers because ideally, right,\nyou're connecting to other Cisco routers,\n\n163\n00:08:42.492 --> 00:08:45.247\nthey're saying they should\nrespond within five.\n\n164\n00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:49.488\nAnd normally, you drop the first one, so\nyou normally get an 80% the first time,\n\n165\n00:08:49.488 --> 00:08:52.505\nsecond time,\n100% because the first time [CROSSTALK].\n\n166\n00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:55.210\nYeah, it's too hard is\nwhat we're doing there.\n\n167\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.031\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny how as a network\nadministrator, you use ping a lot.\n\n168\n00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:02.045\nI used to have two or\nthree ping sessions just scrolling by.\n\n169\n00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:06.770\nOkay, I gotta make sure that switch is up\nbefore I pull the plug on the old switch.\n\n170\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.330\nAnd you're watching to make sure\nall the connectivity's right.\n\n171\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.640\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you're hoping for,\nright?\n\n172\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.549\nA lot of times, we also, now we're\nkind of move, but let's go ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:14.516\ndo this cuz it's cool.\n\n174\n00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:15.700\n&gt;&gt; We digress [LAUGH].\n\n175\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's cool, right?\n\n176\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.540\nIf you're new to the idea of\ndoing network infrastructure and\n\n177\n00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.090\nset up, it is doing what Daniel said.\n\n178\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.090\nYou kind of turn on a ping and\ngo all right, so I know it's working now.\n\n179\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.366\nWhat happens when I change\nthis configuration?\n\n180\n00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:29.684\nLook, the pings dropped.\n\n181\n00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:31.039\n&gt;&gt; That was wrong [LAUGH].\n\n182\n00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:31.539\n&gt;&gt; Let me put that back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:33.617\n&gt;&gt; Let me put that back right away, here.\n\n184\n00:09:33.617 --> 00:09:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully no one noticed that,\n\n185\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.818\ncuz I just took down the network [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And so you're kind of,\n\n186\n00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:42.560\nthat's the goal is to see\nstuff like that as well.\n\n187\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.050\nSometimes you'll see it in just\ndifferent things in the way that\n\n188\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.890\nwe respond to them as well.\n\n189\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.810\nSo let's take, for an example,\n\n190\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.390\nwe're setting up something\nlike a fail over, right?\n\n191\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.680\nThe idea is that device fails,\nthe other one picks up.\n\n192\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.736\nWhat do we want to see\nthough in terms of ping?\n\n193\n00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:01.082\nWell, we wanna see-\n&gt;&gt; No ping loss at all, That's ideal.\n\n194\n00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:07.030\n&gt;&gt; That's 100% ideal, so\nwe can see how helpful ICMP really can be.\n\n195\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.299\nEven though most of us, at the beginning,\neven if we have a little network\n\n196\n00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:14.840\nknowledge, it's okay, I pinged it, I got\nreplies back, I know connectivity is up.\n\n197\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.244\nDon't get me wrong, that's what\nwe do the majority of the time.\n\n198\n00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:19.134\n&gt;&gt; It's like a carpenter without\na hammer it's weird [LAUGH].\n\n199\n00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:23.014\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time, we can see where\nit can be very useful in those types of\n\n200\n00:10:23.014 --> 00:10:24.860\nsetups and what we want to do.\n\n201\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.190\nEven if you only drop one, you'll probably\njust go okay, I'm gonna lose one ping.\n\n202\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.570\n32 bytes?\nThat's gonna recover really quickly.\n\n203\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.927\nBut all of a sudden you connected up,\nand now you setup your VPN tunnel and\n\n204\n00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:38.051\nyou go none.\n\n205\n00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:40.040\nSomething's wrong [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.040\nSo, yeah, it makes sense.\n\n207\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.361\nNow the other one that you may\nalso see but not as common,\n\n208\n00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.930\ncuz most of us don't tend\nto do this too often here.\n\n209\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.753\nBut if I send out a ping, and let's say\nit's to this particular address here,\n\n210\n00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.666\n192.168.30.2.\n\n211\n00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:59.656\nAnd let's say that this is\nthe 30.2 network over here, but\n\n212\n00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:04.090\nlet's say it's not,\ncuz I'm gonna get confused if I do that.\n\n213\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.083\nSo it goes in here and\nthe routing table, it looks for what?\n\n214\n00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:10.818\n192.168.30.0 for the network.\n\n215\n00:11:10.818 --> 00:11:13.990\nAnd it doesn't find it\nin the routing table.\n\n216\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.500\nNotice that the end user device here,\ncuz I'm getting confused with this one and\n\n217\n00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.200\nthe last one here.\n\n218\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.630\nThe end user device doesn't\nactually come in play.\n\n219\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.360\nThe router goes,\nit's not in the routing table, well,\n\n220\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.230\ndoes it really need to try and\nforward a ping?\n\n221\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.450\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, It doesn't need to do that at all.\n\n222\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.760\nInstead, the router replies back and what\nwe normally get, network is unreachable,\n\n223\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.210\nand that means it's not\nfound in the routing table.\n\n224\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.940\nSo really useful information for\nsomebody trying to troubleshoot.\n\n225\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.990\nBut at the same time,\nit may also help out the attacker knowing\n\n226\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.300\nsomething else is going on here, or I can\ndo some of this if I actually change.\n\n227\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.038\nIf I know that I can mess around with\nthis, I can get some information.\n\n228\n00:11:54.038 --> 00:11:58.408\nThe other one that is fairly common\nthat we tend to see more and\n\n229\n00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:03.930\nmore in these days here is gonna\nbe this host unreachable instead.\n\n230\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.780\nNow, host unreachable,\nnotice I send to the same thing.\n\n231\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.230\nAnd let's say that it is on the other\nside of this router, we get a reply back.\n\n232\n00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.510\nI tried to show this by putting\nit on the other side, or\n\n233\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.270\noriginating from the other\nside of the router.\n\n234\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.530\nGuess I could have done\na better job at that.\n\n235\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.490\nLet me just put it out here like that.\n\n236\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.010\nSo it actually originates from the other\nside, but what is going on here?\n\n237\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.430\nIt's the router again\nreplying saying yeah,\n\n238\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.420\nyou've got to the right network, but\nI can't find that host to deliver it to.\n\n239\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.750\nSo this is where we might\nhave an IP address that is on\n\n240\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.650\nthat remote side, and this is important.\n\n241\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.480\nThis is our local side for us.\n\n242\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.838\nThis side represents\nanother network over here.\n\n243\n00:12:49.838 --> 00:12:52.640\nSo it could be that it\ndoesn't find it over here.\n\n244\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.019\nThis could be a router or\ntwo or three routers away.\n\n245\n00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:59.400\nBut the goal is for us to understand\nthat it's actually the remote router at\n\n246\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.580\nthe other end that you're\ntrying to ping to.\n\n247\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.223\nTheir default gateway,\ntheir router interface,\n\n248\n00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:08.619\nthat router is the one\nthat is coming back to yo.\n\n249\n00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:12.781\nSo this is not the one, your own router or\nyour own default gateway saying this,\n\n250\n00:13:12.781 --> 00:13:14.700\nthis is at the other end.\n\n251\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.340\nThis gives an attacker some\nuseful information as well.\n\n252\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.930\nI know that what?\n\n253\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.540\nThat the network is out there.\n\n254\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.610\nI know that that IP address\nthough isn't responding.\n\n255\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.030\nBut the very fact that I got\na reply back that says host\n\n256\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.052\nunreachable says there\nis a network out there,\n\n257\n00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:38.293\nbut right ,now that IP\naddress is not available.\n\n258\n00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:42.301\nBut are there other IP addresses that\nI can now start maybe possibly going\n\n259\n00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:44.254\nI wonder if I can ping those out there?\n\n260\n00:13:44.254 --> 00:13:46.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do one of those\nfancy little ping sweeps\n\n261\n00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:46.840\nwe talked about [LAUGH].\n\n262\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.000\n&gt;&gt; There you go, and\nit really does now start to\n\n263\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.500\nkinda show you a few different things that\nyou might actually want to pay attention.\n\n264\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.760\nAnd we'll see these when we get\nto our little demo here on ping,\n\n265\n00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.150\nwhich you're gonna say,\nokay, I've seen it.\n\n266\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.580\nBut we'll make sure that\nwe can show you this again.\n\n267\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.820\nAll right, the next one that we want\nto make sure that we address here,\n\n268\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.010\nonce again, let's kind of emphasize\nthe important things as well.\n\n269\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.180\nRemember that any destination unreachable\n\n270\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.230\nis going to give us a type\nas well as a different code.\n\n271\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.580\nAnd I showed you essentially\nthese three examples here\n\n272\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.933\nthat were actually the first two examples.\n\n273\n00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:31.160\nAnd last, you even see the protocol\nunreachable as well in there, too.\n\n274\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.590\nSo we'll see probably the first three or\n\n275\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.070\nfour examples inside of our\nlittle lab that will do.\n\n276\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.043\nAll right, so let's talk about this idea\nof source quenching, or the idea, yeah,\n\n277\n00:14:42.043 --> 00:14:46.194\nwe'll just call it source quench\nat this point, ICMP source quench.\n\n278\n00:14:46.194 --> 00:14:52.060\nICMP source quench is a good thing,\nbut in really early networks.\n\n279\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.540\nIt's not a good thing anymore, and\nthere is a reason behind that.\n\n280\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.040\nAnd that is because RFCs have\nnow deprecated this thing.\n\n281\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.291\nAnd it's not that we don't do this\nany more, but networks have became so\n\n282\n00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:08.394\ngood at handling a lot of the packets that\nwe end up getting that we really don't\n\n283\n00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:11.838\nneed to tell the source device to\nstop any more, but at one point.\n\n284\n00:15:11.838 --> 00:15:13.856\nIn source quenching,\nthe whole idea was simple.\n\n285\n00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:20.051\nWith very slow bandwidth or anemic types\nof bandwidth that we would consider 56k,\n\n286\n00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:24.937\nheck today, 256 would even be\nconsidered relatively anemic,\n\n287\n00:15:24.937 --> 00:15:27.910\ndepending on where you live.\n\n288\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.199\nHeck, even a DSL line is\nconsidered pretty anemic at times.\n\n289\n00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:35.505\nBut it was where the receiving\ndevice would essentially get\n\n290\n00:15:35.505 --> 00:15:40.380\noverwhelmed by the amount of\ndata that was being sent to it.\n\n291\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.650\nAnd because it didn't want to\ndrop as many packets as it could,\n\n292\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.280\nit just said, let's do this.\n\n293\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.110\nLet's slow down the rate,\n\n294\n00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.870\nlet's slow it down to the possibility\nthat I can now process the data through.\n\n295\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.310\nAnd then we'll let\nthe sending machine get this.\n\n296\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.560\nSo Daniel, that sounds like\na good idea is to say hey,\n\n297\n00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.975\nwe're not gonna drop that many packets,\nlet's slow everything down, right?\n\n298\n00:16:01.975 --> 00:16:05.848\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie, it's a very good protocol\nthat they brought forth into light because\n\n299\n00:16:05.848 --> 00:16:09.242\nthere are times when people just don't\nhave that great of a connection.\n\n300\n00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:10.661\nEspecially back in the day.\n\n301\n00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:13.704\nSo there was a good reason for\nthem to develop this and implement it but\n\n302\n00:16:13.704 --> 00:16:16.329\nwe're probably not just using\nit as much anymore because of\n\n303\n00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.450\nhigh speed band width propolation.\n\n304\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, high speed band width along with\nthey very fact that we're really using\n\n305\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.180\nprotocols a lot differently then\njust the originals here, right.\n\n306\n00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.660\n&gt;&gt; This was good because it\nset it up inside of IP, right?\n\n307\n00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.570\nI don't need another,\nthe application saying slow down.\n\n308\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.750\nThis allowed those devices\nthat had IP addresses on it\n\n309\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.885\nto really set that pace between\nthem if they needed to.\n\n310\n00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:44.150\nTo say, I'm getting too much data, let me\nsend these messages that says slow down\n\n311\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.580\nuntil I tell you to, and\nthen you can speed back up to do this.\n\n312\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.540\nToday, though, really for\nus, flow control and\n\n313\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.420\nall the different things that\nwe add into that is layer four.\n\n314\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.450\nAnd we have a lot more information\ninstead that we want to stop like that.\n\n315\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.780\nAnd the reason is because we\ncan have more granular control.\n\n316\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.920\nInstead of just saying, you,\nyour IP address out there, stop,\n\n317\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.370\nslow down, do not send.\n\n318\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:14.490\nWe're now able to say okay your IP address\non this particular port, slow it down.\n\n319\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.180\nLet's control the flow in that way\na little bit better so it makes sense.\n\n320\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.220\nNow you might be saying, okay, Ronnie, so\nyou're talking about something that is\n\n321\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.740\ndeprecated and\nyou don't have to know this.\n\n322\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.500\nBut just as a, if you want to find\nout more about the interesting\n\n323\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.760\nnature of where in the world protocols,\nwhat happens, something like this here.\n\n324\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.152\nMake sure you know it's Type 4 but\nyou can refer to RFC 1812 and\n\n325\n00:17:38.152 --> 00:17:39.890\nRFC, the weird numbers.\n\n326\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.068\nI remember these kind of weird numbers.\n\n327\n00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:42.695\n&gt;&gt; The War of RFC 1812.\n\n328\n00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:44.848\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1812 [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n329\n00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:46.968\nI don't know why but\nthat one stuck in my mind and\n\n330\n00:17:46.968 --> 00:17:49.689\nthen the other one that actually\nfinally says stop using it.\n\n331\n00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:54.490\nOkay, so RFC 1812 says,\nyou shouldn't need to use this.\n\n332\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.226\nOkay that's essentially what it says.\n\n333\n00:17:56.226 --> 00:18:03.625\nBut then RFC 66 33 says stop using\nthis just pointing it out stop.\n\n334\n00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:09.300\nSo, Daniel in your logic and\nyou knowing me now, okay,\n\n335\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:15.290\nwhy would I sit there and\nemphasize something that's deprecated and\n\n336\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.660\nwhy would an attacker be interested\nin a deprecated protocol?\n\n337\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.480\nDo you have any idea?\n\n338\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, a,\ndeprecated things just means that, right?\n\n339\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.640\nIt's still there, just no one uses it.\n\n340\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.110\n&gt;&gt; Bingo.\n&gt;&gt; So because no one uses it we forget all\n\n341\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.500\nabout it and it becomes a very good avenue\nof attack cuz nobody's looking for it and\n\n342\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.535\nit's wide open.\n\n343\n00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:34.837\n&gt;&gt; Spot on, Daniel.\n\n344\n00:18:34.837 --> 00:18:35.677\nCool.\n\n345\n00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:36.235\n&gt;&gt; I'm a hacker, Ronnie.\n\n346\n00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:37.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n347\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.812\nSo this is something we don't think about,\nokay?\n\n348\n00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:43.420\nI get a quench message.\n\n349\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.130\nThat happened.\nI go, okay ICMP quench says what?\n\n350\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.690\nJust slow down.\n\n351\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.850\nThe device is not able to handle it.\n\n352\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.250\nI don't even think about it.\n\n353\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.120\nI move on.\n\n354\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.750\nI look at it, I scan it, big deal.\n\n355\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.960\nBut now start seeing more and\n\n356\n00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.910\nmore of it but if I now understand that\nRonnie said or you go and look it up,\n\n357\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:05.240\nyou should, don't say Ronnie said,\nbut when somebody asks you, right?\n\n358\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.590\nSo here it is, you're working as the\nanalyst and somebody says, hey, so what?\n\n359\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.052\nWhat's the big deal about\nthese source quench messages?\n\n360\n00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:13.859\n&gt;&gt; Say, well, Ronnie said [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:18.257\n&gt;&gt; No you instead go, well ,RFC 1812.\n\n362\n00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:25.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And RFC 6633 says stop using it.\n\n363\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.890\nIt's not supposed to be on our network.\n\n364\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.720\nBingo.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n365\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay, easy enough to think about.\n\n366\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.954\nBut you don't know that unless you kind of\nknow that it's not supposed to be there.\n\n367\n00:19:37.954 --> 00:19:39.730\nIs it in violation of anything?\n\n368\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.430\nNot really, it's just that it\nshouldn't show up anymore.\n\n369\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.910\nAnd now in RFC says you shouldn't use it.\n\n370\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.530\nDoes it mean exactly what Daniel said?\n\n371\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.480\nThat it's eliminated, it's gone?\n\n372\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.450\nNo, it's just, stop using it, guys,\ncuz it's really not necessary.\n\n373\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.850\nWe really shouldn't see this\ntype of traffic on a network.\n\n374\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.800\nThat's perfect for someone like Daniel go,\nthey're not even looking for\n\n375\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.190\nthis type of attack.\n\n376\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:09.464\nLet's go ahead and start sending these\nfragment bits and start doing this.\n\n377\n00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:10.910\nLook at that.\n\n378\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.100\nIt's kind of neat.\n\n379\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.304\nI'm able to slow down all the traffic\nthat Ronnie wants to happen or\n\n380\n00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:17.743\nwhatever that may be.\n\n381\n00:20:17.743 --> 00:20:23.873\nIt is neat to think about this\nbecause that means that as a security\n\n382\n00:20:23.873 --> 00:20:31.458\nanalyst I not only have to be able to spot\nthings that are really right on the tack.\n\n383\n00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:36.260\nBut to actually go, I need to think\nabout the things that might be useful to\n\n384\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.180\nsomebody and\nalso take a look at it from that point.\n\n385\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.630\nNow most of the time when we start to\nunderstand that aspect of analysis, right?\n\n386\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.402\nRemember that the whole goal of\nthe way that we're talking about\n\n387\n00:20:49.402 --> 00:20:51.210\ncybersecurity okay.\n\n388\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.690\nIs that we're not only talking\nabout the idea of prevention and\n\n389\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.920\ncompliance in terms of security.\n\n390\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.540\nWe not only want to stop attacks\nduring their live time attacks, right?\n\n391\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.720\nIn real mitigation cuz that's\nabsolutely cool, it's always neat.\n\n392\n00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.810\nI love to be a part of a team that says,\nI stopped this.\n\n393\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.550\nYou know I was part of the team\nthat stopped this particular attack\n\n394\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.720\nfrom going on.\n\n395\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.380\nBut one of the things that you and\n\n396\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.450\nI can do as an analyst a lot of times\nis to learn from the attack afterwards.\n\n397\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.900\nAnd to be able to get better so\nthat next time it doesn't get us.\n\n398\n00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.780\nOkay, the analysis part it may be\nsomething that you look at afterwards\n\n399\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.506\nas an examination,\nas a forensic examination,\n\n400\n00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:33.720\nin terms of going,\nthis shouldn't be here and it's here.\n\n401\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.200\nAnd that way it might be that.\n\n402\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.140\nOr it might be just simply you're just\ndoing this as an analyst to say here's\n\n403\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.851\nthe after effect report and\nyour lessons learned and\n\n404\n00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:45.299\nthis is what we should have spotted\nthis time and let's go ahead and\n\n405\n00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:49.910\nmake sure that we understand that this\nis what we're gonna also end up seeing.\n\n406\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:55.227\nSo don't think that it's not possible\nwhen you start to take a look, okay.\n\n407\n00:21:55.227 --> 00:22:00.202\nThe other one that we also want to\ntalk about is just one that we call\n\n408\n00:22:00.202 --> 00:22:01.473\ntime exceeded.\n\n409\n00:22:01.473 --> 00:22:06.174\nTime exceeded is one that we see more\noften than we think, but we only see it in\n\n410\n00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:10.214\nuse a lot, or most of the time,\nas far as in real practical usage,\n\n411\n00:22:10.214 --> 00:22:15.450\nis when we do a trace route and all of\na sudden it stops going anywhere, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.930\nSo normally that means that that\nparticular router has kind of spent its\n\n413\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.242\ntime and saying, yeah,\nI'm not sending it any further than this.\n\n414\n00:22:22.242 --> 00:22:25.890\nBut when you see that idea of\nthe TTL expired here, okay.\n\n415\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:31.340\nSo let's pay attention before, just\nbriefly I did a little bit of a review.\n\n416\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.500\nEspecially on this numbers cuz I kinda\nbreezed through them a little bit\n\n417\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.750\nquickly here, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.450\nOn the destination type,\n\n419\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.100\nokay, make sure you understand\ndestination unreachable types 3s.\n\n420\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.930\nThere are gonna be a few different codes.\n\n421\n00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.640\nThere's more than this, okay?\n\n422\n00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.510\nDon't get me wrong, for\n\n423\n00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:52.530\nthe exam focus in on these that are gonna\nbe relatively easy to recognize, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.400\nWhen we talk about source quench,\n\n425\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.824\nwe don't have to worry about\nthe message code anymore, okay.\n\n426\n00:22:57.824 --> 00:22:59.350\nYou do wanna know that this is a type 4.\n\n427\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.759\nSo if you start seeing type 4s, okay,\n\n428\n00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.485\nthen we know it's probably not\nsupposed to be there, okay.\n\n429\n00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:10.510\nType 11, time exceeded or\nthe TTL has expired.\n\n430\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.078\nNotice that there's a couple of them here,\nokay?\n\n431\n00:23:13.078 --> 00:23:17.298\nIf you get a 0, the TTL is\ndefinitely expired, if you get a 1,\n\n432\n00:23:17.298 --> 00:23:20.820\nthe fragment reassembly\ntime has exceeded as well.\n\n433\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.875\nAnd that means, I tried to fix it,\ncouldn't, there you go.\n\n434\n00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:25.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What you gonna do, right?\n\n435\n00:23:25.955 --> 00:23:27.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are actually\n\n436\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.680\ngonna end up happening here?\n\n437\n00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.550\nSo that is what we are essentially talking\nabout when we start to see this, okay?\n\n438\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.070\nSo, those are kind of the big\nones there when you take a look.\n\n439\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.460\nSo make sure you understand the type 3,\nthe type 4,\n\n440\n00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.710\nand the type 11s at\nleast at the most basic.\n\n441\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.720\nThose are kinda the attacks,\nnot attacks, but\n\n442\n00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.620\ntypes of ICMP messages that we should\nbe relatively familiar with here.\n\n443\n00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:02.437\nAll right, Daniel, we absolutely want to\ntake a look at these in live time traffic.\n\n444\n00:24:02.437 --> 00:24:05.133\nBut I just noticed something\nas I peered over at the clock,\n\n445\n00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:07.058\nI've got about four minutes left here and\n\n446\n00:24:07.058 --> 00:24:10.660\nI don't think I'm gonna be able to\ncomplete that lab in four minutes.\n\n447\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.590\nSo Daniel, I think we're gonna have\nto move into a part three here.\n\n448\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\n\n449\n00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.940\nI'm shocked that you think that you can't\ndo a 30 minute live in four minutes.\n\n450\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.465\nIt just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:24:18.465 --> 00:24:19.835\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't make any sense.\n\n452\n00:24:19.835 --> 00:24:20.513\n[LAUGH] No, it's totally fine.\n\n453\n00:24:20.513 --> 00:24:24.285\nWe'll move right into part three and\nwatch you do this cool demo.\n\n454\n00:24:24.285 --> 00:24:25.530\nWe look forward to that.\n\n455\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.870\nThanks for dropping by today so far and\ncontinuing that conversation on these\n\n456\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.060\ntypes of codes that we might need\nto pay attention and be aware of.\n\n457\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.752\nOld survey time, right.\n\n458\n00:24:35.752 --> 00:24:38.690\nAll right, that being said, it looks\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n459\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.020\nDefinitely join us in part three so\nwe can continue this conversation.\n\n460\n00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.846\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n461\n00:24:44.846 --> 00:24:45.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n462\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.425\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n463\n00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:54.240\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n464\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.922\nThank you for

and\n\n8\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.280\ntoday's episode we're back with\nmore in our Cisco Sec-Op series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.685\nJoining us yet\nagain to continue our conversation on,\n\n10\n00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:29.876\nwell we've been talking a lot about ICMP\nand I don't see that wining anytime soon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:31.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

It's going great, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.430\nThank you again for having me back.\n\n16\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.096\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna probably wear out my\n\n17\n00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:41.480\nwelcome with the part threes and\nfours that we're ending up doing.\n\n18\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.560\nBut it's good information for us to make\nsure that we understand a little bit more\n\n19\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.960\nabout the analysis of\nthe some of the details and\n\n20\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.730\nprotocols that we have to\nbe able to understand.\n\n21\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430\nAnd that's what we are jumping into,\nright.\n\n22\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.048\nSo on our previous episodes we've gotten\nto this point where we've just talked\n\n23\n00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:58.432\nabout a lot of the different\nunreachable messages.\n\n24\n00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:01.470\nAnd now we want to see\nthem in action as well.\n\n25\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.170\nRemember for exam purposes, make sure\nyou pay attention to the types and\n\n26\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.175\nthose code numbers and understand that,\nat least at a minimum,\n\n27\n00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.150\nright, ICMP works on layer three.\n\n28\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.847\nHopefully that's emphasized enough.\n\n29\n00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:15.959\n&gt;&gt; Been drilled into your brain.\n\n30\n00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nhopefully it's been emphasized enough.\n\n31\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.115\nDon't go, I know Ronnie said layer four.\n\n32\n00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:23.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure he said layer four.\n\n33\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.248\nYou're gonna go back and\nwatch the video and go-\n\n34\n00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:26.301\n&gt;&gt; That was nine.\n\n35\n00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.787\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna come back and\n\n36\n00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.959\nwatch the videos after thinking that and\ngo, no,\n\n37\n00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.833\nhe clearly said three at least 65 times.\n\n38\n00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:32.839\n&gt;&gt; We're going to go back and\n\n39\n00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:35.043\noverdub every time you said\nlayer three with four [LAUGH].\n\n40\n00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:36.301\n&gt;&gt; You'd get tired.\n\n41\n00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you would, you would.\n\n42\n00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:40.852\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're taking a look at.\n\n43\n00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:42.717\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n44\n00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:45.723\nsee then some of the different\nexamples that we have.\n\n45\n00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:48.967\nOkay, remember pay attention to\nthese codes and these types.\n\n46\n00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.670\nAnd we're gonna see them live and\nhow, hopefully,\n\n47\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.890\neverything works out as I've got this up.\n\n48\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.690\nSo let me tell you what my\nset up is currently, okay?\n\n49\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.760\nI've got two machines on the same network,\nthis Kali Linux box and\n\n50\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.700\nalso a Windows 7 box as well, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.550\nThe other thing that I also have is both\nof them are connected to a router, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.220\nThat will, of course, give them\naccess to well, networks unknown.\n\n53\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.510\nNow don't get me wrong,\nI've isolated this, not that ICMP is so\n\n54\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.047\ndamaging, from that I couldn't\ngive Internet access or anything.\n\n55\n00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:23.467\nBut just as an example, right,\n\n56\n00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.376\nI wanted to control the networks\nthat I wanted us to be able to see.\n\n57\n00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:31.220\nI've also added in a second router,\nokay, beyond my gateway.\n\n58\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.150\nAnd added in networks over there so\nthat we could also\n\n59\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.000\nsee some of the other messages that\nwe would normally see as well, okay?\n\n60\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.790\nSo this should help us to be able to see\na few different types of the messages\n\n61\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.350\ninstead of just one type,\nwhich is what I don't want to show you.\n\n62\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.780\nAnd you go, all right, Ronnie, so cool,\n\n63\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.435\nyou showed me the idea that a request\nfailed, or it timed out or whatever it is.\n\n64\n00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.683\nYeah, Ronnie,\nI've done that before myself.\n\n65\n00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:59.123\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we wanna make sure that you\n\n66\n00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:00.940\ncan see how we can control this.\n\n67\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.636\nAnd also this way it's a proof of concept,\n\n68\n00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:04.910\nsomething that you can do\non your own as well, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.620\nSo that's the way that it's happened\nis both those routers are out there.\n\n70\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.011\nSo now I have a router that is my\ngateway and I also have remote router.\n\n71\n00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:15.822\nBecause that's what we also need to be\nable to see some of this information.\n\n72\n00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:22.090\nSo let's start it off using, of course,\nwell, our Kali Linux box to help us out.\n\n73\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.776\nOne of first thing that I need to do,\nwhich I heavily forget, I don't know why,\n\n74\n00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.385\nI shouldn't be forgetting this.\n\n75\n00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:31.210\nBut is to simply turn on, well, Wireshark.\n\n76\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.238\nSo I told Daniel right\nbefore the show I was like,\n\n77\n00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:36.840\nif I don't turn on Wireshark make sure-\n&gt;&gt; That you turn on Wireshark.\n\n78\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.790\n&gt;&gt; That I turn on Wireshark.\n\n79\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.060\nBecause if I capture, if I do all that\nstuff, I'm gonna have to just do it again.\n\n80\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n81\n00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.870\ninstead that's what's going to happen.\n\n82\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.830\nAlso, pick out, of course,\n\n83\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.010\nthe network adapter in which\nthe network you wanna capture.\n\n84\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.420\nSo if I hover over eth0 I can see that\nthat's the network that I want to capture.\n\n85\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.690\nSo I'm simply gonna turn that on and\nwe're gonna leave that in the background.\n\n86\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.415\nThen we'll kinda do some analysis in\nbetween as we do some pings to show some\n\n87\n00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:04.965\nof the different responses that we get.\n\n88\n00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:06.762\nI've now launched the terminal.\n\n89\n00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:09.890\nAnd inside of the terminal\nhere let's just go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.109\nshow some of the regular things that\nwe normally would end up seeing here.\n\n91\n00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.623\nHopefully you all can see that as far\nas the size goes, that looks okay.\n\n92\n00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:25.763\nPing 172.168.89.150, okay.\n\n93\n00:04:25.763 --> 00:04:29.570\nSo I know that this is a ping\nto the Windows 7 machine, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.806\nAnd that looks like it's working fine,\nI see the response coming back.\n\n95\n00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:36.120\nThe times in terms of the milliseconds and\n\n96\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.865\nthe bytes that I'm sending across here,\nokay.\n\n97\n00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:41.895\nSo now we can see a few different things.\n\n98\n00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:46.225\nAnd if we remember even\nback from the episode,\n\n99\n00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:49.135\nactually I think the first\nepisode we started in the series.\n\n100\n00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:52.795\nWe talked about the information\nthat's found in those pings.\n\n101\n00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:56.458\nSo Daniel, if you remember,\nit's just a couple of shows ago now.\n\n102\n00:04:56.458 --> 00:05:00.324\nBut where we showed you it was 32\nbytes when we pinged from Windows.\n\n103\n00:05:00.324 --> 00:05:01.688\nMm-hm.\nNotice that this one,\n\n104\n00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:05.410\nI know it's a little bit harder to see,\nlet me see, I can't move that over can I?\n\n105\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.820\nNow I can, okay, there you go.\n\n106\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.430\nNotice that this one is 64 bytes instead,\nso we do get a little bit\n\n107\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.396\nof difference depending on the operating\nsystem that we're on as well, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:18.728\nSo the other thing that I also want to do,\nof course, is verify that,\n\n109\n00:05:18.728 --> 00:05:23.390\nlike anything else, if we start off\nwith ping, we wanna ping inside out.\n\n110\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.794\nSo I'm gonna do that same process and\nthere's my default gateway.\n\n111\n00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:32.790\nSo I know that both of those are up and\nthat's pretty much what I want to see.\n\n112\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.040\nIf I just start to take\na look at Wireshark now,\n\n113\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.060\nI can see kind of the very simple\nthings that I wanted to see, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.630\nSo I know that those pings\nare going across and\n\n115\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.840\nthat's pretty much what\nwe start to see here.\n\n116\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.660\nAnd we're also starting to\nsee a few other things.\n\n117\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.939\nSo notice that right here, okay,\nright in the center of everything,\n\n118\n00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.792\nwe are also seeing something\nelse that's happening here too.\n\n119\n00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:02.700\nWhich, according to the info and the link,\nis this Destination unreachable message.\n\n120\n00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.322\nHey, that's a type three I believe,\ncan I prove that?\n\n121\n00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:09.290\nWell yeah, definitely can prove something\nlike that but, we'll come back and\n\n122\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.282\ndo that in just a moment.\n\n123\n00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:12.684\nLet me capture all the stuff that\nI want to and then we'll go back.\n\n124\n00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:14.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if not I'll get stuck in every one\n\n125\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.270\nand want to talk about everything.\n\n126\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.800\nSo let me not lose my train of thought.\n\n127\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.169\n&gt;&gt; Don't get bogged in the mire, right.\n\n128\n00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.444\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's just so\n\n129\n00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.410\neasy cuz it's like, I wanna show this one.\n\n130\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.550\nNo, it's live data, people would\nkinda crucify me for, no not really.\n\n131\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you kind of get the idea, right,\n\n132\n00:06:28.383 --> 00:06:31.590\nis that we wanna do everything first and\nthen that way we can come back and\n\n133\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.459\nsee this, right?\n\n134\n00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:37.152\nNow there's a network that's out there\nthat I know that is pretty much right\n\n135\n00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:38.858\noutside of my own gateway.\n\n136\n00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:43.499\nSo there's 4.2.2.,\nlet me make sure I'm telling you right, 1.\n\n137\n00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:48.630\nAnd let's see if I can ping this guy.\n\n138\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.397\nWell, this one is actually\nnot exactly working here.\n\n139\n00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:56.310\nSo let's see what's happening on that one.\n\n140\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.918\nAll right, so\nthat guy is not responding at all.\n\n141\n00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:04.196\nI think I actually know\nwhat problem is here.\n\n142\n00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:07.235\nI don't think that that's\nactually the right number.\n\n143\n00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:08.112\nSee here, there we go, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:08.112 --> 00:07:09.533\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, why isn't that working?\n\n145\n00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:10.748\nThat should be-\n&gt;&gt; Because it doesn't work.\n\n146\n00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:11.803\n&gt;&gt; Right on that router.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:13.795\n&gt;&gt; I know that I actually put that into\n\n148\n00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:16.415\nthe Cisco router,\nI know it should be there.\n\n149\n00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:19.190\nSo that's actually working,\nso that's good.\n\n150\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.400\nBut now I want to go and connect to what I\nknow is off of the other router instead.\n\n151\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.340\nSo it's here,\nI know that there's a 172.16.90.1\n\n152\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.850\nis actually the other router on the other\nside so I know I can get to that.\n\n153\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.990\nBut what about routes on\nthe other side of this thing?\n\n154\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.446\nWell, this is where we know that\neverything is actually working the way\n\n155\n00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:42.378\nwe that we want to.\n\n156\n00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:47.000\nSo here I know this is actually off\nof the router two that's outside.\n\n157\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.310\nSo I know that I'm connecting all\nthe way through, which is great.\n\n158\n00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.806\nThat's exactly what I normally want to\nsee, is all of this type of information.\n\n159\n00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:58.209\nSo everything seems to be good.\n\n160\n00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:02.916\nNow what if we actually start pinging\nthings that are not actually out\n\n161\n00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:04.560\nthere instead.\n\n162\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.730\nAnd that is where we want to get to.\n\n163\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:13.114\nSo, there is a route that is,\nthere is a network that's out there,\n\n164\n00:08:13.114 --> 00:08:20.180\nwhich is 192.168.1.0 but\nactually did 1.1 on that router.\n\n165\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.840\nBut now notice I'm getting a destination\nhost unreachable as well, okay.\n\n166\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.230\nSo I am starting to get\nsome different aspects\n\n167\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.900\nof some of the different things\nthat I'm choosing to see here.\n\n168\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.860\nAll right, so that's at least enough from\nwhat we can actually be able to do at\n\n169\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.490\nthis point and see some things.\n\n170\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.420\nLet's go back to our Wireshark here and\n\n171\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.356\nsee some of the different messages\nthat we also get coming across.\n\n172\n00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.660\nStop our Wireshark capture and\n\n173\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.450\nnow I'm going to filter out the ICMP and\nsee some of the information.\n\n174\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.598\nSo let's go back and just take a look\nat kind of the common ones here.\n\n175\n00:08:57.598 --> 00:09:01.191\nI just picked one randomly, an ICMP, and\n\n176\n00:09:01.191 --> 00:09:06.120\nthen let me do this,\nlet's do it this way, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.500\nSo if I were to take a look\nat the idea of ICMP.\n\n178\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.440\nAnd now talk about just a couple\nof different things, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.210\nI should be able to take a look\nof course at the source and\n\n180\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.450\ndestination address of\nwhere I actually pinged.\n\n181\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.294\nSo notice that this is between my machine,\nwhich I know is .145, and\n\n182\n00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:29.510\nthis is the Windows 7 machine,\nwhich is .150, which is good.\n\n183\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.360\nSo I know exactly where I pinged.\n\n184\n00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.850\nBut in the ICMP message,\nnotice there is the type eight here.\n\n185\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.690\nAnd this is just a basic normal\nregular response that we get and\n\n186\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.840\nthe code is 0, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.879\nSo that's a good normal response.\n\n188\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.200\nNow, Daniel, if we're going to exam\nmode for a little bit of time, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.240\nAnd we start to see information.\n\n190\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.780\nWe can't put it past those guys\nthat write exam things to go right.\n\n191\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.360\nMost of us can spot because of\nthe information that we get\n\n192\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.430\nover here in info very easily,\nwhat this might be.\n\n193\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.920\nBut what if I were to just show you\n\n194\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.760\ninformation like this and maybe we don't\n\n195\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.870\nactually see some of the other\nhelpful information that we might see.\n\n196\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.100\nInstead, you just see like type and code.\n\n197\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.108\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We would need to be able to spot stuff\n\n198\n00:10:30.108 --> 00:10:31.020\nlike that.\n\n199\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.750\n&gt;&gt; I should.\n\n200\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.850\n&gt;&gt; And then way be your goal.\n\n201\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.930\nNo, no, that's a host unreachable.\n\n202\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.480\nSo let's try one of those and\nlet's see, and\n\n203\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.400\nnow I notice that the code and\nthe type also change as well.\n\n204\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.470\nSo this is a type 3, which is that\ndestination unreachable message,\n\n205\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.820\nwhich is the only one we had.\n\n206\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.500\nBut now notice that we've got\na port unreachable message instead.\n\n207\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.060\nAnd that also allows us to be\nable to differentiate a couple of\n\n208\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.380\nthings there too.\n\n209\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.004\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, they're not gonna\nnail us with every type and\n\n210\n00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:02.871\ncode that's under the sun for the ICMP.\n\n211\n00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.500\nIt's just gonna be s specific set of them,\ncorrect?\n\n212\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nyou'll actually end up seeing them,\n\n213\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.500\nI'm trying to see if I can find\nanother one that's right down here.\n\n214\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.680\nThere we go, okay.\n\n215\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.410\nSo I went ahead and\nscrolled down a little bit further, so\n\n216\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.970\nthat we can see another one.\n\n217\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.430\nSo now, Daniel, there's three\ndifferent types on the screen, okay.\n\n218\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.590\nSo of course,\nthere's the regular one in the pink.\n\n219\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.860\nBlack here, notice this one in\nthe parenthesis as port unreachable.\n\n220\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.480\nNow notice there's another one that\nsays host unreachable as well.\n\n221\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.230\nSo, we know that this one may actually\nindicate something different.\n\n222\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.970\nSo let's check that one out instead.\n\n223\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:46.700\nAnd now notice that there is a type 3 but\nthere's a Code: 1 this time instead.\n\n224\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.817\nAnd that allows me to be able to\nfigure that one out too, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.170\nSo do not take a look.\n\n226\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.893\nNow, okay, Wireshark,\ncan spot ICMP messages?\n\n227\n00:11:55.893 --> 00:12:00.340\nWe know that you can, but\nin terms of analysis, if you were given\n\n228\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.930\ndifferent frames instead,\nwhich we might overlook very easily,\n\n229\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.310\nsuch as the host unreachable and\nthe port unreachable.\n\n230\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.840\nBut you were given\nthe actual details of it,\n\n231\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:16.150\nyou should be able to take a look at that\ninformation and see that as well, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.990\nSo those are some of the different common\nthings that we might also put up with too.\n\n233\n00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.520\nNow, let's also take a look at\nanother one that didn't show up here,\n\n234\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.090\nand that's because I didn't make\nit show up right here right now.\n\n235\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.850\nSo let's start this over again,\nlet me get this off.\n\n236\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.140\nAnd then let's turn Wireshark back on.\n\n237\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:43.590\nAnd at this point I need to at least\nsee a time exceeded message, okay?\n\n238\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.900\nSo, let's do a just a traceroute.\n\n239\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.692\nI know that I can do a traceroute all\naway over through two routers away.\n\n240\n00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:52.870\nAnd so you can see here were my gateway.\n\n241\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.290\nAnd then the second router just out there.\n\n242\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.510\nAnd then actually got to the 10.0 network,\nokay.\n\n243\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.640\nWhat we want,\nwhich is great that we can see that.\n\n244\n00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.843\nAnd then let's do this to the route that\nis actually not in the routing table.\n\n245\n00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:12.590\nWhen I say that, but\nnotice this one, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.522\nNow, notice what it did here.\n\n247\n00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:18.980\nI'm gonna keep using the word notice until\nsomebody notices that I'm saying it.\n\n248\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.660\n&gt;&gt; I noticed that.\n\n249\n00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nApparently,\n\n250\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.990\nI've come up with a new verbal\npause that I've taken here.\n\n251\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.682\nLook at this, Daniel, notice that\nthere is this, see I said it again.\n\n252\n00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Take a look at this.\n\n253\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.620\n&gt;&gt; Set your gaze upon [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at this.\n\n255\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.310\nHere we go.\n\n256\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.890\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe got an exclamation point with an H.\n\n257\n00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exclamation point with an H,\ndo you have any idea what that is?\n\n258\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at the top of my head no,\nI can't say.\n\n259\n00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.350\n&gt;&gt; Right now, we'll just kind of go,\n\n260\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.750\nit's saying something and\nit's given me another code here.\n\n261\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.780\nThis is a great time for\nus to go back into Wireshark and\n\n262\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.440\nlet's stop the capture, then ICMP,\n\n263\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.170\nand now let's see some of the other\ninformation that we are also seeing.\n\n264\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.576\nIt looks like that the router and\n\n265\n00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:20.125\n.150, which is a Windows 7 machine.\n\n266\n00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.910\nI don't know what's going on here.\n\n267\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.000\nWhy in the world the router is constantly\nreporting to Windows 7 that it is not,\n\n268\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.559\nbut whatever.\n\n269\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.410\nHere's a new one that we haven't seen\ninside of our Wireshark capture yet,\n\n270\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.880\nwhich is this one.\n\n271\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.640\nTime to live exceeded.\n\n272\n00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.320\nNow, pay attention then to line number 19,\nwhich I've highlighted here.\n\n273\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.477\nAnd see who sent this message, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; This is weird, Daniel.\n\n275\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.420\nI told you that really our default\ngateway, here's the IP address to it.\n\n276\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.580\nSo, this is the router\nclosest to my Kali Linux box.\n\n277\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n278\n00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.180\n&gt;&gt; But if we go back to kind of\nwhat we were talking about in\n\n279\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.660\nthe previous episode,\nthe time exceeded though normally happens\n\n280\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.090\nfrom the guy that says I expired it, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.390\nI expired it, so\nI ran this down as zero at me.\n\n282\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:16.560\nWell, the zero came from not this guy, but\n\n283\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.400\nactually at the other end,\nthe second router, router number two.\n\n284\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.693\nThat's where it came from, but notice what\nthe sources are saying, again, dang it.\n\n285\n00:15:23.693 --> 00:15:26.248\nSee what the source is saying here.\n\n286\n00:15:26.248 --> 00:15:31.171\n172.16.89.2, which is closest to me.\n\n287\n00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:33.350\nYou might be wondering what,\nwhy is it doing that?\n\n288\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.000\nWhy isn't it reporting like this one here?\n\n289\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.720\nNotice this one that she does report\nthe other router at the other end.\n\n290\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:46.465\nAnd that is because well, he's\nactually being told by 90.1 that what?\n\n291\n00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:47.753\nTime's exceeded.\n\n292\n00:15:47.753 --> 00:15:51.071\nRouter number one,\nwhich is the one that is my gateway,\n\n293\n00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:54.326\nis now telling me, so\nit's actually coming from him.\n\n294\n00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:56.678\nThat's the reason why it's\nactually happening that way.\n\n295\n00:15:56.678 --> 00:16:01.465\nSo it's kinda weird as you start to see\nthe way that the message is generated on\n\n296\n00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:02.100\nthree.\n\n297\n00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.130\nYeah, you do have unusual stuff here.\n\n298\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.030\nThere it is.\n\n299\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.690\nSo there is our Type 11.\n\n300\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:14.320\nSo we've seen Type 3s, we've seen Type 8s,\nwe've seen Type 11s here.\n\n301\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.610\nRemember that the original ones that\nwe have, just the regular responses.\n\n302\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.820\nMake sure you take a look\nat those in Wireshark.\n\n303\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.260\nIt's gonna be very important that\nwe do something like this, so\n\n304\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.600\nthat we can see the different types and\nunderstand what it may be.\n\n305\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.230\nNow remember that on the exam they're\nnot gonna be this helpful where they're\n\n306\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.520\ngonna say, I know what this is because\nlook what's in the parentheses there,\n\n307\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.000\nas you're taking the exam.\n\n308\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.100\nWhat may be missing?\n\n309\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.980\nParentheses stuff.\n\n310\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.510\nCould be I don't know for sure,\n\n311\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.090\nbut it's one of those possibilities where\nit might be something just assembled out.\n\n312\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.203\nOr it may just be simple\nknowledge based questions, right?\n\n313\n00:16:53.203 --> 00:16:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Type 11 represents what type of\n\n314\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.620\nICMP message?\n\n315\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.218\nAnd you've got to know those things.\n\n316\n00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.490\nSo don't just go,\nI know enough for the exam.\n\n317\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.000\nIt's not gonna be helpful for you as you\nget into the field of analysis here.\n\n318\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.970\nYou've got to be able to take a look at\nthe information that you're given, and\n\n319\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.090\nanalyze and understand what\nelse may be happening here.\n\n320\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:16.430\nSo that's why we've kind of taken\naway the actual live data, or\n\n321\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:22.180\nthe data capture that was coming across so\nthat we can inspect and do the other two.\n\n322\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.650\nNow this is neat cuz it actually\nsays time exceeded in transit.\n\n323\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.710\nSo it's one of those neat messages\nthat we come across and do that.\n\n324\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.750\nAll right, so Daniel, that gives us at\nleast enough information to go on in some\n\n325\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.190\nways that we can analyze the different\ntypes of responses that are out there.\n\n326\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.926\nAnd make sure that we do pay attention to\nthis as well as we start to continue to\n\n327\n00:17:43.926 --> 00:17:48.526\nsee a little bit more information,\nwhich is what we need to see now, too.\n\n328\n00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:53.360\nNow the other thing that we also need to\nmove on to and to talk about, of course,\n\n329\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.805\nare some of the other types of\nattacks that we may see such\n\n330\n00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:59.010\nas the idea of a firewalk here.\n\n331\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.080\nNow Daniel, firewalk,\nfamiliar with that concept?\n\n332\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's basically trying to\nmap out the rules of a firewall,\n\n333\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.170\nsee what's being blocked, what's not being\nblocked so that you get a really good idea\n\n334\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.490\nof the topology and\nthe lay of the land to specific devices.\n\n335\n00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's really a very neat way, right,\n\n336\n00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:21.280\nto get a lot of information without\ndisturbing and alarming and\n\n337\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.840\ntriggering a lot of different\nsecurity things that go on.\n\n338\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.030\nThe reason why, majority of the time,\nnot every time,\n\n339\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:34.660\nright, is that we tend to monitor\nwhat devices that we want to secure.\n\n340\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.100\nWe know that the Internet\nis the Wild West and\n\n341\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.190\nwe don't tend to monitor what every\ndevice that may possibly attack us.\n\n342\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.003\nSo we go, all right,\n\n343\n00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:46.090\nthe firewall's pretty much gonna feed\nall that we expect to be scanned.\n\n344\n00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.760\nWe expect to have stuff like that happen.\n\n345\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.180\nBut this is also something else that\nwe want to be able to do as well\n\n346\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.300\nand understand.\n\n347\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.730\nIn a firewall type of attack,\n\n348\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.640\nwe might start off with just this idea\nof initial, traceroute to the firewall.\n\n349\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.410\nSo here I put two routers in place.\n\n350\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.530\nNow we know that that hop is\ngonna be three, or two, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:12.440\nSo if you leave this router, it's actually\ngonna be one, two, which is great, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.380\nThen you might start doing\nyour regular scanning,\n\n353\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.150\nfiguring out what ports are open,\nwhat you want to be able to get into.\n\n354\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.590\nAnd if now you figure out which one is\nvulnerable for your particular instance\n\n355\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:29.170\nhere, then you might send a packet,\nokay, that has a time to live.\n\n356\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.890\nI don't know why I can't spell\nthe word greater, or I might have and\n\n357\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.270\ndidn't even realize it here,\nokay, there we go.\n\n358\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.380\nYou might actually send a packet\nthat has a TTL with at least\n\n359\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.650\none greater than the firewall in terms of\nthe way that the traceroute showed you.\n\n360\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.780\nNow why is that important?\n\n361\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:52.680\nBecause it was an ICMP package,\nright, it automatically does what?\n\n362\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.830\nIt sends it through,\nit's not gonna really scanned by this.\n\n363\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.230\nFIrewalls tend to work at layer III and\nabove which is great.\n\n364\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.157\nBut most ICMP packages, it doesn't\ntend to take a look unless literally\n\n365\n00:20:05.157 --> 00:20:09.210\nset your rules like,\ndo not return ICM pista, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.600\nNow yeah, you kinda defeated me.\n\n367\n00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.600\nBut at the same time, if you haven't,\nyou aren't allowed to go through.\n\n368\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.420\nIf I send one and it replies back to me,\nI'm sending one to a network, or\n\n369\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.500\nto some device back here.\n\n370\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:26.310\nSo if I get some type of message at\nthis point, such as the destination\n\n371\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.800\nhost is unreachable, but I know that\nthe TTL means it made it past what?\n\n372\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.740\nThe firewall.\n\n373\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n374\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.220\n&gt;&gt; And it's here that it replied, so\n\n375\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.780\nI know that I have somehow,\nsomeway, gotten past your firewall.\n\n376\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.990\nAnd that may indicate some type of\nopening that could be taken advantage of.\n\n377\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.860\nSo this is why most of the time,\n\n378\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.580\nwhen we talk about the idea of using ICMP,\nwe don't let everything in.\n\n379\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.440\nWe may allow for echos and echo replies.\n\n380\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.410\nWe might allow for stuff like that.\n\n381\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.700\nBut we don't allow for, you know,\n\n382\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.390\nlike all the other stuff that\nwe've been talking about.\n\n383\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.210\nWe might go no, no,\nwe're definitely not gonna do that and\n\n384\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.130\nsome of the other types\nthat are out there.\n\n385\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.235\nSo just pay attention.\n\n386\n00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:14.080\nFirewalks, again, are another type of good\nreconnaissance attack that can give us\n\n387\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.210\nsome information on what we might be able\nto see here once we map out other things.\n\n388\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.720\nRight, some of the other ones that we\nalso want to talk about, of course,\n\n389\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.300\nis something like the operating\nsystem fingerprinting here.\n\n390\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.840\nAnd some of the information\nthat we can get.\n\n391\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.150\nThe great thing is there's a couple\nof I wanna go back to the actual\n\n392\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.000\ndeck here that I was using.\n\n393\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.980\nAnd let's take a look at\nthis just briefly as we get\n\n394\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.060\nback to the idea of OS\nfingerprinting here, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.170\nThere is a field here\nthat really does help us\n\n396\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.500\nas we start sending data through, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:57.730\nICMP also depends on that field as well\nwhen we start to use this especially.\n\n398\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.180\nIt depends on the operating system.\n\n399\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.980\nIn the type of service\nfield right in here, okay,\n\n400\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.850\nthis can indicate what type of\noperating system is in here, okay?\n\n401\n00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.710\nAnd we can use ICMP to\nhelp us to determine that.\n\n402\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.920\nIf we can send a UDP packet that sets\n\n403\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.730\nthe do not fragment, okay,\nbit the way that we need it to,\n\n404\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.770\nit can return to us the type\nof service bit that shows us\n\n405\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.500\neven what version of Linux\nkernel that is running.\n\n406\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.410\nOkay, so it can show us that version.\n\n407\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.250\nIt can show us any OS\nkernel that's running.\n\n408\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.720\nAnd it's just a specific hexidecimal code\nthat when you take a look in the hex\n\n409\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.970\nvalues you can actually find out here,\nokay.\n\n410\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:54.520\nSo the type of service normally indicates\nthe machine that it left as it sends off\n\n411\n00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.760\nhere, and that means ICMP can then go\nahead and look for that if we need it to.\n\n412\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.990\nNow that takes a little bit more scanning,\n\n413\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.010\na lot of other information\nthat we want to get in there.\n\n414\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.979\nAnd that's because that field's not\nnormally one that is out there is what we\n\n415\n00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:12.810\ncall a precedent's field\nthat we see today.\n\n416\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:17.130\nWe really wanna talk about thet\nhe data service code point and\n\n417\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.400\nthe explicit congestion notification\nthat's in the service type, but it can\n\n418\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.620\nalso be that precedence field that's\nalso part of the service field as well.\n\n419\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.660\nSo we can take that and\n\n420\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.410\nthen send that information to\nICMP which means it can do what?\n\n421\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.160\nIt can reply.\n\n422\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.500\nIt can send a message back saying, yeah,\n\n423\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.900\nhere is the type of device\nthat requested this, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.310\nAnd here is what we can do.\n\n425\n00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.530\nSo, it can be identified.\n\n426\n00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.791\nBut there's other ways\nthat we can also use it.\n\n427\n00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:48.660\nNow this is not the 100% tried and\ntrue way, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.723\nBut it does seem to be\na general rule of thumb.\n\n429\n00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:54.205\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about here, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:54.205 --> 00:23:57.924\nSo just as I mentioned this\na little bit earlier So\n\n431\n00:23:57.924 --> 00:24:02.550\nif I ping my Windows 7 device from here,\njust taking a look at\n\n432\n00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:07.630\nthe information that's going\nacross the screen right now.\n\n433\n00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.040\nThere are a couple of values that\nwe're actually seeing here, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.110\nFirst, I can tell what machine,\na lot of times,\n\n435\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.200\njust because of how much data I'm\nsending across in a ping, okay?\n\n436\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.030\nSo I know that, just by usage,\nright, that Windows has\n\n437\n00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.540\nalways sent four bytes of information,\n32 bits okay?\n\n438\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.523\nOr 30, yeah, so when we do that, right,\n\n439\n00:24:30.523 --> 00:24:33.840\nthose 4 packets of 8 bits each,\nso 32 bytes.\n\n440\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.568\nSo I know it can do it, but notice that\nthis one, that generates 64 bytes,\n\n441\n00:24:37.568 --> 00:24:38.460\nand it came back.\n\n442\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.980\nSo it requested 64 and it came back, and\n\n443\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.460\nthe TTL 128 tells me it also\ncame from a Windows machine too.\n\n444\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.240\nSo at this point I can tell\na couple of different things, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.910\nThat, more than likely, that means\nthe Kali Linux machine is actually\n\n446\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.480\nrequesting 64 bytes, okay,\nwhen it sent the ping.\n\n447\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.030\nAnd it's getting that,\nbecause that's what the Linux boxes do.\n\n448\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.418\nAnd then the TTL is the one that,\nof course when it replied back,\n\n449\n00:25:06.418 --> 00:25:09.524\nWindows actually replied back with 128.\n\n450\n00:25:09.524 --> 00:25:14.020\nAll right, now, let's come over\nhere to our Windows 7 machine.\n\n451\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.120\nAnd let's run the command prompt here.\n\n452\n00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:23.380\nOur ping here,\nat the command prompt, ping.\n\n453\n00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:36.420\nAnd when we see this,\nnotice there's the four 32 bytes here.\n\n454\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.470\nSo there's four different packets\nthat we see, each one with 32 bytes.\n\n455\n00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.772\nSo I might have mangled my math there,\nwhatever.\n\n456\n00:25:42.772 --> 00:25:44.332\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said I can't remember.\n\n457\n00:25:44.332 --> 00:25:47.030\nBut notice the TTL at this point, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:52.030\nSo the reply from that particular box,\nokay, notice it tells me TTL and\n\n459\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.530\nusually this is a Linux kind of thing.\n\n460\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:59.010\nThat says Windows requested 32 bytes,\ninstead.\n\n461\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.490\nSo it was able to actually\nsend back what it requested.\n\n462\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.030\nSo simple things like this,\n\n463\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.610\nwhere we can see something like\neven the TTL values is enough.\n\n464\n00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.690\nAnd sometimes even\nthe amount of information,\n\n465\n00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.780\nyou cannot always count on that.\n\n466\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.735\nThe reason why is that there are options\nthat you can run with ping, okay,\n\n467\n00:26:15.735 --> 00:26:20.310\nto actually, say, send more than\nyou actually want to, or send less.\n\n468\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.760\nSo you can actually make it do some other\nthings, but just kind of realize that\n\n469\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.080\nnormally the combination of\nthose can also help out as well.\n\n470\n00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.941\nThere's also something called\nan ICMP error quoting size, okay?\n\n471\n00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:35.530\nThat are also different for\neach operating system.\n\n472\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.226\nMost of us are never gonna get that deep\ninto it, okay, but if you're hacking,\n\n473\n00:26:39.226 --> 00:26:40.176\nyou probably will.\n\n474\n00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:44.491\nBut at this point, in terms of spotting,\nand spotting quickly, okay,\n\n475\n00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:47.038\nthese are kind of two\ntypes of machines that\n\n476\n00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:50.540\nyou may want to take a look at\nthe information as it goes by.\n\n477\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.750\nAnd see, hey, which one's requiring what,\nand what's the TTL values?\n\n478\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.220\nThat usually helps us out more than\nanything to spot something very quickly,\n\n479\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:05.840\nokay, for something like just a basic OS\nfingerprinting analysis that we can do.\n\n480\n00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.790\nAll right, let's see, what are some of\nthe other ones that we also have here?\n\n481\n00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.820\nI'm trying to look, and,\nI'm noticing something here on time.\n\n482\n00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:19.300\nLet's talk about just a one more,\nbefore we get too much further, okay?\n\n483\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.768\nThere is also what is called\na redirect message, okay?\n\n484\n00:27:23.768 --> 00:27:28.280\nA redirect message normally is a router\nredirect, and this is a type 5.\n\n485\n00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.823\nNotice that code 0 is obsoleted, and\n\n486\n00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:35.780\nthat means we're probably not\ngonna see a code generally.\n\n487\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.910\nBut notice the code 1, though, and\nthe way that it's described here.\n\n488\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:47.328\nRedirects all future datagrams for\nthe original destination address, okay?\n\n489\n00:27:47.328 --> 00:27:52.211\nThe reason why this one is important\nis because it can actually be a part of\n\n490\n00:27:52.211 --> 00:27:54.520\na spoofing attack here.\n\n491\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.840\nWhere what I can do is, I can redirect\npackets, and then tell every packet\n\n492\n00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:06.210\nafter the original one that was sent,\nto go where I want it to go, okay?\n\n493\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.600\nAnd that is a key one for\nus to actually think about, okay?\n\n494\n00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.460\nNow I don't have that,\nwhere I can do this in lab in easy time,\n\n495\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.680\nbut I kinda tried to walk us through\nat least a portion of it, okay?\n\n496\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.464\nAn attacker over here on\nthe left-hand side first,\n\n497\n00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:28.367\nwhich is step number 1,\nit takes over control of this router okay?\n\n498\n00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:35.059\nWhen it does that, okay, what it's wanting\nto do of course, then, is it's wanting,\n\n499\n00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:39.560\nthen, at this particular point,\nto be able, now that it's got control of\n\n500\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:45.140\nthe router,\nto send to its target here, okay?\n\n501\n00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.070\nActually what it wants to become a proxy,\nto say look, here's what's gonna happen.\n\n502\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:55.993\nI am gonna become your new proxy address,\nokay?\n\n503\n00:28:55.993 --> 00:28:58.757\nNow, once it does that,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n504\n00:28:58.757 --> 00:29:00.854\nthat's exactly what we want it to do.\n\n505\n00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:04.865\nBecause PC1 will then respond and\ngo, sure thing,\n\n506\n00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:09.159\nlet me make sure that all my\npackets get sent back to you.\n\n507\n00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:15.290\nNow, when it sends it from this\nstep number 2 here as the router,\n\n508\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:21.096\nit's actually putting this as\npretending to be PC2, okay?\n\n509\n00:29:21.096 --> 00:29:25.509\nIt's just sending a reply back, so this is\nwhere it's actually redirecting something.\n\n510\n00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:28.629\nAnd saying yeah, just,\nif you need something on router number 2,\n\n511\n00:29:28.629 --> 00:29:30.700\nsend it to me over here instead.\n\n512\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.820\nThis guy thinks he's replying and says, no\nproblem, I'll send it over to you, okay?\n\n513\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.130\nAt the same, he now starts crafting\n\n514\n00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.480\nwhat his particular response\nis to take this over, okay?\n\n515\n00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.510\nSo, now what happens is, every time\nrouter number 2 thinks that he's\n\n516\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.530\nsending something out to this default\nrouter, or his default gateway here,\n\n517\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:55.410\nhe really is actually sending\nit back to PC number 1.\n\n518\n00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.088\nPC number 1 is actually\nforwarding it over to router, and\n\n519\n00:29:58.088 --> 00:29:59.629\nwho's in control of the router?\n\n520\n00:29:59.629 --> 00:30:00.770\nRight here.\n\n521\n00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.166\nSo, it is all because of using\nthose redirect messages, and\n\n522\n00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:07.130\nhe's saying,\nsend this as a redirect over here.\n\n523\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.670\nAnd this guy's saying, sure thing.\n\n524\n00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:13.140\nSo, every single message that comes\nfrom PC2 will eventually end up\n\n525\n00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.240\ngetting over to router number 1.\n\n526\n00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.662\nEven though its default gateway is\nsupposed to be router number 2.\n\n527\n00:30:18.662 --> 00:30:22.680\nHe just acts like this is just\nanother guy in the stream of the data.\n\n528\n00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.690\nSo even though it's all on\na different network, he just goes,\n\n529\n00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.880\nfine, I'll just treat that as another one,\nand allow that path to go on.\n\n530\n00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.711\nSo this is why we shouldn't\nsee these messages.\n\n531\n00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:35.377\nIf you ever get a redirect with number\n1 on it, a lot of times and you go,\n\n532\n00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:37.820\nI don't know those IP addresses.\n\n533\n00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.450\nIt's probably a sign that somebody\nis redirecting you to their box,\n\n534\n00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.092\ninstead of the one you think\nit's supposed to be going to.\n\n535\n00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:48.744\nJust realize,\nthis one is pretty hefty and it takes-\n\n536\n00:30:48.744 --> 00:30:49.354\n&gt;&gt; Insidious.\n\n537\n00:30:49.354 --> 00:30:49.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n538\n00:30:49.854 --> 00:30:50.744\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty hefty,\n\n539\n00:30:50.744 --> 00:30:54.540\nit does take a lot to set it up,\nand I just did not have.\n\n540\n00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.410\nWhen I think about it, I don't think I\nhad the wherewithal to actually bring up\n\n541\n00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.840\nall the utilities that normally is\nalso required in doing this, and\n\n542\n00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.900\nto get it up and running.\n\n543\n00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.270\nBut you can kind of see the idea,\nthey're not gonna, but you kinda know.\n\n544\n00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.614\nIf you see this, especially code 1s,\nyou know something else is going on.\n\n545\n00:31:10.614 --> 00:31:14.324\nAll right, Daniel,\nit looks like I have done this once again,\n\n546\n00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:16.190\nwhere I have outran the clock.\n\n547\n00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm!\n\n548\n00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.240\n&gt;&gt; And it means that I've\nstill got a bit more to go.\n\n549\n00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.454\nSo we're gonna have to actually\ndo a part four here Daniel.\n\n550\n00:31:22.454 --> 00:31:23.106\n&gt;&gt; Well who-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n551\n00:31:23.106 --> 00:31:24.953\n&gt;&gt; Would have thought there would be so\n\n552\n00:31:24.953 --> 00:31:28.970\nmuch information about ICMP, and\nattack vectors associated with it.\n\n553\n00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.520\nSo it's a good thing that we continue on,\n\n554\n00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.170\nwe wanna make sure that you're fully\naware of these attack vectors.\n\n555\n00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.060\nSo that you understand how to spot\nthem and maybe even mitigate them.\n\n556\n00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.520\nAnd at least be aware of them\nif they're happening, and\n\n557\n00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.860\nset up your network, and\nprepare for that SecOps exam.\n\n558\n00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.522\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today,\nwe do appreciate it.\n\n559\n00:31:44.522 --> 00:31:46.825\nAnd we would look forward\nto seeing you in part four.\n\n560\n00:31:46.825 --> 00:31:50.654\nWe do thank our audience for joining\nus as well, but it is that time for\n\n561\n00:31:50.654 --> 00:31:51.520\nus to sign off.\n\n562\n00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.945\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n563\n00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.005\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n564\n00:31:55.005 --> 00:32:00.842\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

00:00:05.748\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:08.211\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:11.994\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:13.743\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:16.431\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:19.094\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.259\nif I can get that out of my mouth-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.090\n&gt;&gt; Is our Cisco Sec Op series.\n\n11\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.640\nJoining us back, as Ronnie laughs\nhysterically at me fumbling my words,\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.710\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.730\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.054\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Daniel, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:36.972\nAnd I remember, the last episode I said\nnotify at least 66 times in five minutes.\n\n16\n00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:41.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice, notify, something like that.\n\n17\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.540\nBut I do understand this is a long\ntopic for us to be covering,\n\n18\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.375\nand we are still taking a look at ICMP.\n\n19\n00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n20\n00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:51.413\nthat means that [LAUGH] we have a bit more\nto cover, just a little bit more to cover.\n\n21\n00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:53.628\n&gt;&gt; It's like the Transformer series,\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n22\n00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:54.136\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:55.720\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those where it's like keep\n\n24\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.530\nmaking money, keep doing it.\n\n25\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, keep extending that.\n\n26\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.921\nNo, that's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We'll get\n\n27\n00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.268\nMichael Bay to produce the next one.\n\n28\n00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.040\n&gt;&gt; That would be true.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be the way to go.\n\n30\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.380\nBut for us, we are now taking a look at\njust a few more attacks that we should be\n\n31\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.370\nfamiliar with, of course with ICMP, and\nthat is what we're heading into now.\n\n32\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.460\nWe don't talk a lot about IPv6 and\nICMP's types of information, but\n\n33\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.920\nwe are gonna talk at least one particular\nattack that can be done as well.\n\n34\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.430\nAnd the attack, remember, is not so much\nthat they're doing something malicious\n\n35\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.980\nwith it as much as taking advantage of the\nnature and the way that ICMP works, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.060\nSo what we're talking about now,\nof course,\n\n37\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.566\nis the idea of what we call router\ndiscovery messages that are out there.\n\n38\n00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:48.030\nIn IPv6, when you start putting IP\naddresses on devices, especially\n\n39\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.630\nlike routers, they normally start to do\nwhat they call a router advertisement.\n\n40\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.034\nThat's an ICMP message that's\nessentially going out over IPv6 as well.\n\n41\n00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.192\nAnd that one, of course,\nis just saying hey, I'm out here.\n\n42\n00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:02.959\nAnd then,\nother devices that are ICMP enabled,\n\n43\n00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.009\nthey of course will respond to that and\nassign themselves, normally,\n\n44\n00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.520\nan IP address within that range and\nthere we go.\n\n45\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.840\nSo, we can do that as well.\n\n46\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.640\nBut other times,\nif it's looking for that router,\n\n47\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.620\nit can send out what we call\nrouter solicitation messages.\n\n48\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.410\nSo an advertisement,\nof course, is from the router.\n\n49\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.110\nThe router advertisement, it makes sense.\n\n50\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.850\nA router solicitation message\nis when some device says hey,\n\n51\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.220\nI need to find the nearest router near\nme and let's take a look at that.\n\n52\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.657\nSo here's how the attack plays out,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:36.660\ntake a look at my diagram to\nhelp us at least a little bit.\n\n54\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.640\nSo let's say that PC1,\n\n55\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.530\nright here, it starts to put out a router\nsolicitation message out on that.\n\n56\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.390\nNow of course,\n\n57\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.420\nthat means the router itself is gonna\nreceive that router solicitation message.\n\n58\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.540\nAnd when it does that, it can also send\nout a router advertisement saying, yes,\n\n59\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.440\nI'm out here and I'm ready to go.\n\n60\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.250\nBut remember, every other device\nalso is going to be listening and\n\n61\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.850\nlet's say the attacker listens, too.\n\n62\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.280\nWell when the attacker listens,\nif he is active and\n\n63\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.510\nhe is absolutely waiting for\na reply like this, he can then spoof\n\n64\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.650\nthe router's reply to try and\nget the message down\n\n65\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.220\nto PC 1 before PC 1 knows that it's\nnot really the router over here.\n\n66\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.240\nAt that point,\nhe can say I am the default route.\n\n67\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.405\nSo instead of everybody\nsending anything or\n\n68\n00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:35.900\nPC1 sending outbound to router over here,\nrouter one.\n\n69\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.770\nIt instead believes that the attacker\nnow becomes the default gateway,\n\n70\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.829\nand he can then start proxying and\nforwarding data the way that he wants to.\n\n71\n00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:45.905\n&gt;&gt; It's a man in the middle attack.\n\n72\n00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:47.090\nClassic.\n&gt;&gt; Man in the middle attack.\n\n73\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.550\nVery much a classic.\n\n74\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.740\nBut very simply done, not because we\nhad to set up anything a lot, right?\n\n75\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.930\nThe only thing that the attacker\nreally did actively\n\n76\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.079\nis to really spoof the reply that\na router would normally send out.\n\n77\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.320\nNow, I went ahead and captured some\nof this data a little bit earlier,\n\n78\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.290\nright before the show.\n\n79\n00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.160\nAnd this one's a little bit harder,\n\n80\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.090\ncuz I had to remember to\ngenerate a few different things.\n\n81\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.770\nCuz I was wondering why it wasn't working,\nand\n\n82\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.240\nthat's because I had not set an IP\nversion 6 address on the router itself.\n\n83\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.210\nI was like, yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.510\nIf I'm gonna do this,\nI need to set a router,\n\n85\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.070\nan IPv6 address on the router that of\ncourse can communicate with our network.\n\n86\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.310\nWell, you can now see that what it does,\nof course, this major communication uses\n\n87\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.810\nlink local addresses, but notice that\nneighbor solicitation and neighbor\n\n88\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.890\nadvertisement and messages, and that's\nwhat we're looking for at this point.\n\n89\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.850\nSo, this is when you do have something\nlike this where you solicit something, but\n\n90\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.980\nyou don't have a clue who this\nneighbor actually is at this point.\n\n91\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.840\nSo, it could be that it is a router,\nusually it is a router, because routers\n\n92\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.120\nare insanely quick at responding\nto a solicitation message.\n\n93\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.150\nWhereas, if you were the attacker you\nreally have to, I really wanted to try and\n\n94\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.140\nsee if I could beat the router here.\n\n95\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.950\nSo, just kinda realize that you\nmay see stuff like that as well.\n\n96\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.752\nNow on this one, it's not that it's not\nthe most interesting thing in the world,\n\n97\n00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:19.223\nbut it's probably not a big one\nthat we're gonna see heavily.\n\n98\n00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:22.889\nBut you can see,\nlet me see if I can zoom in a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.390\nThere's the IPv6 information\nthat we've talked about.\n\n100\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.720\nAnd then ICMP, and notice even though\nit says neighbor, there it is.\n\n101\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.780\nIt's right there.\n\n102\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.097\nSo this one, it has a type of 136 but\nnotice in IPv6,\n\n103\n00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:38.287\nthey actually just call it\nneighbor advertisement.\n\n104\n00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:42.244\nAnd it looks like the type number\nis actually, it's the description.\n\n105\n00:05:42.244 --> 00:05:45.306\nSo, they have it a little bit backward\nthan the way we would normally see\n\n106\n00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:47.080\nsomething like this as well.\n\n107\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.153\nAnd then, of course,\nthe solicitation message is 135.\n\n108\n00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:54.726\nBut we're probably not have to worry\ntoo much, but understand that ICMP or\n\n109\n00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:59.009\nas far as a router discovery type of\nattack, it could be something just\n\n110\n00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.091\nas simple as that where they get\nthe information that they need to.\n\n111\n00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:09.434\nSo not difficult, but it is one that\nyou might end up seeing too, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:12.697\nNow, another one that we\nwant to talk about, and\n\n113\n00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:17.200\nthis is kind of really the one\nthat I wanted to show here.\n\n114\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.500\nSo this was good, let me get rid of,\njust kind of do it this way.\n\n115\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.640\nLet me continue without\nsaving at this point, and\n\n116\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.480\nthen we'll kind of start this right now.\n\n117\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.920\nAll right, so no packets,\neverything is live, and that's fine.\n\n118\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.052\nWe'll start seeing some\ninformation a little bit later.\n\n119\n00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:38.630\nWe wanna talk about the idea\nof using ICMP as a tunnel,\n\n120\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.690\nas a covert tunnel, is what we want to do.\n\n121\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.010\nNow, this is interesting.\n\n122\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.720\nIt's not so\nmuch of a tunnel like a VPN tunnel but\n\n123\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.425\nit is a tunnel in the very fact\nthat it encapsulates data.\n\n124\n00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:52.540\n&gt;&gt; It reminds me of GRE, right?\n\n125\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.250\nIt's just that General or\nGeneric [CROSSTALK]\n\n126\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty similar.\n\n127\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.265\nThe same idea, but the hard part is this\nis something that WireShark can't see.\n\n128\n00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:04.364\nSo, you and I get pings.\n\n129\n00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:07.668\nWe see it on WireShark, and\nwe go okay, somebody's pinging.\n\n130\n00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:09.903\nWe know that there's some\nactivity going on, but\n\n131\n00:07:09.903 --> 00:07:13.250\nwe probably don't think twice\nabout it because we go all right.\n\n132\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.630\nSo what, it's sending the alphabet, right?\n\n133\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.350\nThat's what we saw.\n\n134\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.640\nIt's sending the alphabet.\n\n135\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.190\nBig deal, you know?\n\n136\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.685\nWhat's the big to-do?\n\n137\n00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:25.750\nWell, what if I told you I can actually\ntake that and then tunnel data\n\n138\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.185\ninside of that and even if you were to run\nWireShark, you'd see nothing but pings.\n\n139\n00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:32.921\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] And\nthat's what it would show up as.\n\n140\n00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:34.150\n&gt;&gt; It would just show up as pings.\n\n141\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.200\n&gt;&gt; Get yourself a ping.\n\n142\n00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.740\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n143\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.890\n&gt;&gt; And are we able to even, we saw\nthe alphabet that was being sent before.\n\n144\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.930\nAre we able to dive in to that depth and\n\n145\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.180\nsay there's a PHP reverse\nshell payload going on?\n\n146\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.080\n&gt;&gt; And Daniel, so really it's just\nalphabets, and so what's the big deal?\n\n147\n00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.730\nWe're sending the alphabet back and forth.\n\n148\n00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.780\nNo harm in that.\n\n149\n00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.640\nSounds good, right Daniel?\n\n150\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.178\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n151\n00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:59.654\nexcept when you change that alphabet\nto be my PHP reverse shell payload.\n\n152\n00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:03.684\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that there can be\ndangers to it, but Daniel, what have I\n\n153\n00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:07.844\ntold you that when I send those pings I\ninstead can really take those pings and\n\n154\n00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:10.071\nthen traffic data through those pings.\n\n155\n00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:11.530\nAnd you're not gonna even notice it,\n\n156\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.497\neven if you're looking at\nit inside of Wireshark.\n\n157\n00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:16.638\n&gt;&gt; So even if we break this down inside\nof Wireshark and take a look at it,\n\n158\n00:08:16.638 --> 00:08:19.417\nwe're not really even gonna be\nable to see what that data is.\n\n159\n00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now don't get me wrong,\n\n160\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.497\nif somebody that's really\nan expert at Wireshark, they can.\n\n161\n00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:28.322\nBut you'd have to take apart so many of\nthose messages to get the information\n\n162\n00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:29.052\nback out-\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n163\n00:08:29.052 --> 00:08:31.917\ndoing a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle with\nclear blue sky, that's the picture, right?\n\n164\n00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:36.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot, so instead of\nus seeing the alphabet, a through z,\n\n165\n00:08:36.138 --> 00:08:40.430\nyou'll see bits and scattered pieces\nof it, but it will be coming through.\n\n166\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.399\nAnd you'll see, even in the end result,\nit will be slow,\n\n167\n00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:46.383\nit will look kind of like\na jigsaw puzzle coming into play.\n\n168\n00:08:46.383 --> 00:08:48.196\nBut once you see the data coming across,\nand\n\n169\n00:08:48.196 --> 00:08:50.070\nyou'll see how much\naccess I really do have.\n\n170\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.278\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n171\n00:08:51.278 --> 00:08:54.840\nset this thing up and make sure that we\nunderstand what's gonna happen here, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.540\nSo at this point what's gonna happen is,\nI'm gonna take this machine,\n\n173\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.960\nand I'm gonna need to run ICMP SH on it,\nyou can download this from GitHub.\n\n174\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.310\nMake sure that you get the entire package\nthat you need to go and extract it,\n\n175\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.860\nand that will be on Wireshark here.\n\n176\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.236\nAnd then there's also\nthe second component of this,\n\n177\n00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:16.419\nwhich is gonna be at the other end.\n\n178\n00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:19.490\nThe only thing that we're really doing is,\n\n179\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.394\nwe're setting up, my Kali Linux box\nreally has a proxy, just about.\n\n180\n00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:29.976\nTo where I do information here, anything\nthat is now connected to this box,\n\n181\n00:09:29.976 --> 00:09:35.170\nI can get a copy over on, well,\nmy Kali Linux box as well, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.950\nSo on this end,\nyou also need to have a client running,\n\n183\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.480\nwhich is going to also be\ndownloaded from GitHub.\n\n184\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.240\nAnd everybody knows however\nyour favorite attack to get\n\n185\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.110\nthat running on the machine, you can do.\n\n186\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.660\nI'm simply going to download it and\n\n187\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.080\ninstall it on here and make it\nactually work, so it's an .exe file.\n\n188\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.800\nYou go to GitHub, find the .exe file,\ndownload it, and make it run, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.060\nSo when we set this up, I'm gonna\nstart off with the Kali Linux machine,\n\n190\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.690\ncuz that seems more logical to me,\nto start off this way.\n\n191\n00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.590\nI need to go to that location\nwhere I download this, and\n\n192\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.650\ntype in a few different things.\n\n193\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.409\nSo it should be inside of my Downloads\nfolder, then when I'm actually inside my\n\n194\n00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:16.110\ndownloads, I gotta remember the name here,\nand I need to go inside of ICMPSH.\n\n195\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.245\nI should master, and\nlet’s see Shift+Ctrl, let's do that,\n\n196\n00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:27.480\nand get that a little bit larger so\nthat we can see that.\n\n197\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.230\nSo I need to go inside of that folder, and\n\n198\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.520\nthen notice that there's a whole\nlist of different things.\n\n199\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:40.430\nAnd this is where the original ICMP shell\nthat was in there, somebody ported it\n\n200\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.710\ninto Python, which I couldn't remember\nthe name of that programming.\n\n201\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.611\n&gt;&gt; Apparently Perl as well.\n\n202\n00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:48.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Perl,\n\n203\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.580\nbut Python is kind of the big one and\nthe one that's most widely used here.\n\n204\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.140\nThe original one still even includes\na run.sh, which you can do, but\n\n205\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.560\nit is strictly for Linux.\n\n206\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.590\nThey wanted to make sure it was portable,\nso\n\n207\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.880\nthat's why they wanted\nto port it into this.\n\n208\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.120\nNow, once we get this into this location,\nwe're fine, but\n\n209\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.420\nwe also want to hide a little\nbit more information.\n\n210\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.480\nSo now I'm gonna turn off my machine\nfrom answering, well, ICMP messages.\n\n211\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.990\nI know that sounds strange, but\nI wanna create a lot of traffic,\n\n212\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.185\nI want to actually just make sure that\nI am ready and accepting to do this.\n\n213\n00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:25.830\nSo let me make sure I type\nthis in correctly this time,\n\n214\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.457\nwhich is gonna be here.\n\n215\n00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:31.754\nI always do typos, I mean Daniel knows it,\nif there's a typo, I will find it, okay,\n\n216\n00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:33.942\nand that will pretty much-\n&gt;&gt; If one doesn't exist,\n\n217\n00:11:33.942 --> 00:11:34.462\nhe'll invent it [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:11:34.462 --> 00:11:39.346\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I will invent it, that is true, so\n\n219\n00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:44.808\nwe will see, icmp _echo and then _ignore,\n\n220\n00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:50.127\ni should do more underscores here, _all,\n\n221\n00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:57.643\nand do an =1, and\nthat's what we're hoping to see, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:57.643 --> 00:12:02.555\nIs that we should see the line repeated,\nthis is what we've done is, we turned it\n\n223\n00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:07.560\non to ignore all these echoes, and\nwe will be fine and we are dandy to go.\n\n224\n00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.210\nNow once I do that, I'm going to\nturn on Wireshark at this point so\n\n225\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.350\nthat we can capture the traffic\nthat is going on here.\n\n226\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.470\nSo let me stop the one I had\nbeen running previously, and\n\n227\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.810\nlet's start up Wireshark and\ncontinue without saving for right now.\n\n228\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.440\nSo I know I had it running in\nthe background a little bit, but\n\n229\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.350\nlet's go ahead and do this and let it run.\n\n230\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.810\nAnd nothing really unusual happening,\nwe do see these destination unreachable\n\n231\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.840\nmessages, and I got a little\nbit curious during the break.\n\n232\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.197\nAnd I found out that these are just\nDNS things that are happening in\n\n233\n00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:44.058\nthe background with the Windows 7\nmachine running, that's no big deal.\n\n234\n00:12:44.058 --> 00:12:48.150\nBut let me close that out for a moment and\nthen get the rest of this ready.\n\n235\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.380\nSo once I've got that set up,\nnow I need to run this,\n\n236\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.106\nI'm just gonna follow\nthe same command here.\n\n237\n00:12:55.106 --> 00:13:00.166\nI'm gonna do sudo python or sudu python,\n\n238\n00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:05.804\nicmpsh _m.py, and\nnow I need to tell it the IP\n\n239\n00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:11.587\naddress of my machine,\nmy attacking machine,\n\n240\n00:13:11.587 --> 00:13:17.246\nand then the IP address\nof the target machine.\n\n241\n00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:20.844\n&gt;&gt; That sudo is actually unnecessary\nbecause you're logged in as root, but\n\n242\n00:13:20.844 --> 00:13:23.756\nif you were not,\nthat sudo is absolutely necessary [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:24.936\n&gt;&gt; I just do it anyway.\n\n244\n00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:26.546\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n245\n00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:32.620\nI am gonna hit everything that I possibly\ncan, and leave that up and running.\n\n246\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.480\nNow, nothing looks like\nit's happening right now,\n\n247\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.670\nthat's fine because the other side\nI haven't actually connected yet.\n\n248\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.190\nOver here on this side,\nif I also now go to downloads and\n\n249\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:52.010\nI do a dir here, there's that icmpsh\nhere that you can see very easily.\n\n250\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.349\nThen I just need icmpsh,\ntell it in the target,\n\n251\n00:13:56.349 --> 00:14:03.192\nwhich is gonna be the attacking machine,\nand 45, 45 that would help.\n\n252\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.800\nAnd simply do that,\nnotice what has appeared, Daniel?\n\n253\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.041\n&gt;&gt; It does look like a reverse shell has.\n\n254\n00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.431\n&gt;&gt; Has [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; Successfully connected.\n\n255\n00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now a reverse shell?\n\n256\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds cool.\n\n257\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is cool.\n\n258\n00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:22.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it sounds awesome,\nas I start now,\n\n259\n00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:26.075\nlet's see what I can get into.\n\n260\n00:14:27.156 --> 00:14:29.344\nCan I actually get down to the root.\n\n261\n00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.931\n&gt;&gt; The system32?\n\n262\n00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, can I get into system32?\n\n263\n00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:38.346\n&gt;&gt; Do a whoami.\n\n264\n00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:42.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can I do a whoami?\n\n265\n00:14:42.998 --> 00:14:45.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you've gone, okay,\n\n266\n00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:48.081\nRonnie I'm not blown away.\n\n267\n00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:52.862\nNow, let's take a look at Wireshark here,\nand let's stop it, because now we've typed\n\n268\n00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:56.780\nin a lot of information, [CROSSTALK]\nwe've gotten a lot of information.\n\n269\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.402\n&gt;&gt; You've given a lot of stuff.\n\n270\n00:14:57.402 --> 00:15:00.440\n&gt;&gt; A ton of information's come back,\nbut look at this, Dan.\n\n271\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.860\nSo now that I've stopped it,\n\n272\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.050\nlet's just be impressed by\nthe sheer number of pinks, okay.\n\n273\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.060\nThat's a lot of pinks, look, there's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.059\n&gt;&gt; There's an ARP.\n\n275\n00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:14.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but mostly pinks.\n\n276\n00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.834\n&gt;&gt; There's a loop coming in,\n[LAUGH] Daniel, where is,\n\n277\n00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:22.670\ncuz let's talk about the information,\nright, that came across.\n\n278\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.003\nThat's my machine talking\nto the other machine.\n\n279\n00:15:26.003 --> 00:15:27.251\n&gt;&gt; Using ICMP.\n\n280\n00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but in reality,\nit should be TCP, right?\n\n281\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.382\n&gt;&gt; Typically that's what you do, but\nyou're injecting the information into\n\n282\n00:15:34.382 --> 00:15:37.632\nthose ICMP packets, so\nthat it's not being caught by a firewall.\n\n283\n00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:41.872\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's the problem, right,\n[LAUGH] not being caught by the firewall.\n\n284\n00:15:41.872 --> 00:15:44.469\n&gt;&gt; What happens if you follow,\nI guess you, can you do that,\n\n285\n00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:45.856\nyou have to follow TCP stream.\n\n286\n00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:46.808\n&gt;&gt; Well let's see.\n\n287\n00:15:46.808 --> 00:15:48.656\n&gt;&gt; Is there any way to?\n\n288\n00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.805\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n\n289\n00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:50.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing.\n\n290\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:56.065\n&gt;&gt; So here is where to me it's amazing,\nall that traffic, cuz that's a lot\n\n291\n00:15:56.065 --> 00:16:01.877\nof information that's, and you can see\nhow much it was, it slowly painted it on.\n\n292\n00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:02.974\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was slow.\n\n293\n00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:06.208\n&gt;&gt; It was slow, but it's because breaking\nit apart across what all of these\n\n294\n00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:07.969\ndifferent things that are happening.\n\n295\n00:16:07.969 --> 00:16:13.352\n&gt;&gt; But at this point you would just Do\na user app and create administrative user.\n\n296\n00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:13.932\n&gt;&gt; Username?\n\n297\n00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:14.673\nYep, there you go.\n\n298\n00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.549\n&gt;&gt; And group Adam to\nthe administrations group, and\n\n299\n00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:17.985\nthen log in through RDP or something.\n\n300\n00:16:17.985 --> 00:16:20.954\n&gt;&gt; But now imagine that this is all\nyou're seeing is you're seeing pings.\n\n301\n00:16:20.954 --> 00:16:21.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n302\n00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:22.500\n&gt;&gt; And what do we say at the beginning?\n\n303\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.545\nWho notices pings?\n\n304\n00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:24.136\n&gt;&gt; Nobody.\n\n305\n00:16:24.136 --> 00:16:24.823\n&gt;&gt; What's the big deal?\n\n306\n00:16:24.823 --> 00:16:28.802\n&gt;&gt; This might be a bit suspect that\nyou have a gazillion pings happening.\n\n307\n00:16:28.802 --> 00:16:32.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they all have random sizes.\n\n308\n00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:35.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are different random.\n\n309\n00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:35.661\n&gt;&gt; Or seem.\n\n310\n00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.813\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNot too badly, but-\n\n311\n00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:38.378\n&gt;&gt; Not too randomly, but different.\n\n312\n00:16:38.378 --> 00:16:38.937\n&gt;&gt; The same one.\n\n313\n00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:40.784\nThis is where it should start to notice,\nright?\n\n314\n00:16:40.784 --> 00:16:41.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:45.330\n&gt;&gt; So if you saw random pings it's no big\ndeal as long as they're different ones.\n\n316\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.583\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Different sources,\n\n317\n00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.283\ndifferent destinations, but all the same.\n\n318\n00:16:48.283 --> 00:16:49.850\nThis is part of something.\n\n319\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.653\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n320\n00:16:50.653 --> 00:16:51.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's part of a stream.\n\n321\n00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:56.158\nThis is what we're expecting, well not\nnormally what we're expecting, but\n\n322\n00:16:56.158 --> 00:16:59.111\nyou can kind of see why this is so\nfairly effective.\n\n323\n00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:04.316\nBut today, of course people don't just\ndo it here, you can use DNS to do this.\n\n324\n00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:05.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:17:05.188 --> 00:17:06.070\n&gt;&gt; You can use HTTP to do this.\n\n326\n00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:11.386\nYou name it, it's really just\nthe beginning, but to show you ICMP.\n\n327\n00:17:11.386 --> 00:17:17.130\nRemember that this, unlike what\nwe're just talking about HTTP and\n\n328\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.890\nall that, this doesn't have\nto happen at layer seven.\n\n329\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.595\nThis happens at layer three, and I've\njust showed you that I can actually send,\n\n330\n00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:29.109\nessentially, the TCP traffic over layer,\nI know we can, but\n\n331\n00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:31.678\ninside, within, tunneling through ICMP,\n\n332\n00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:36.024\nthat is something that you do want to\nmake sure that you can pay attention to.\n\n333\n00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.717\nSo how do you stop something like that?\n\n334\n00:17:37.717 --> 00:17:38.683\nIt's deep packet inspection.\n\n335\n00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.205\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n336\n00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:40.331\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\nJust like what we were talking about.\n\n337\n00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:44.525\nYes, if you can do depack\ninspection this stuff, then again,\n\n338\n00:17:44.525 --> 00:17:46.910\ngets readily noticed all the time.\n\n339\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:52.823\nBut just as an example of what happens\nhere, no TCP information going on here.\n\n340\n00:17:52.823 --> 00:17:57.132\nNot going across it,\nit's all pings, and I may not pay\n\n341\n00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:59.797\nattention to it all unless I-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n342\n00:17:59.797 --> 00:18:02.652\nif somebody had a filter in Wire Shark for\njust looking for TCP connections,\n\n343\n00:18:02.652 --> 00:18:04.046\nthey wouldn't even see this at all.\n\n344\n00:18:04.046 --> 00:18:04.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:07.078\nSo that, look, look at that.\n\n346\n00:18:07.078 --> 00:18:08.193\nIt's blank.\n\n347\n00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:11.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you start to see some of\n\n348\n00:18:11.562 --> 00:18:14.359\nthe information and some of\nthe different things that can happen.\n\n349\n00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:18.970\nBut just realize, yes,\nICMP, it seems easy enough.\n\n350\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.932\nWe're not focusing in too much on a lot\nof information, but there you have it.\n\n351\n00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:27.790\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat just a couple of other things,\n\n352\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.597\nwhich we're not gonna\ndive too deep into this,\n\n353\n00:18:30.597 --> 00:18:34.971\ncuz we did talk about this in the security\nfundamentals a little bit more.\n\n354\n00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:41.776\nBut ICMP can be, if you really choose to\nuse some type of denial-of-service attack.\n\n355\n00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:45.579\nRemember that if you talk about\ndenial of service attacks that go on,\n\n356\n00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:50.103\nICMP flooding is just a way to overwhelm\na device, essentially is what we have, so\n\n357\n00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:52.420\nthere's a couple of different methods.\n\n358\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.986\nYou send enough to actually overwhelm,\nlet's say, a router's interface.\n\n359\n00:18:54.986 --> 00:18:58.290\nIt happens, okay, so\nyou can do the attack.\n\n360\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.600\nYou can, of course, have thousands, if\nnot hundreds of thousands of people send\n\n361\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.390\nenough data to overwhelm the attack,\nit makes sense.\n\n362\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.771\nYou can do this with pings,\nnot as easy anymore.\n\n363\n00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:08.356\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.580\n&gt;&gt; But it can be done, cuz you can craft\ndifferent packet size if you need to.\n\n365\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.260\nIf you do that idea of a SMURF attack,\nremember you're saying essentially right\n\n366\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.420\nhere, like look, here it is,\nI'm gonna actually send let's say a ping,\n\n367\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.470\nbut I want the reply to go this guy, but\nyou actually send it to everybody here.\n\n368\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.150\nThat's what you end up doing.\n\n369\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.630\nSo you send it to everybody in this\nnetwork right here, and when they actually\n\n370\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.650\nreply, they reply back to this guy up\nhere, and now he gets overwhelmed as well.\n\n371\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.455\nSo not exactly the hardest and\nmost difficult concept to understand.\n\n372\n00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:46.595\nRealize that this is a part of the ICMP\nattacks that you can also see.\n\n373\n00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:51.148\nSo Daniel, right there,\nin a nutshell, and four episodes\n\n374\n00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:51.809\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n375\n00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:54.540\n&gt;&gt; We uncovered ICMP.\n\n376\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.570\n&gt;&gt; ICMP.\n\n377\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I definitely will not,\n\n378\n00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:02.580\nI am more respecting of the ICP\nprotocol and it's danger vector.\n\n379\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.695\nThis is definitely a legitimate attack\nsurface that you have to be aware of and\n\n380\n00:20:06.695 --> 00:20:09.353\nhave to prepare for,\nstart looking at that kind of\n\n381\n00:20:09.353 --> 00:20:13.022\ndata to make sure it's not being used\nas such as an attack vector, and\n\n382\n00:20:13.022 --> 00:20:15.849\nnow that we're aware of it\nwe can do that very thing.\n\n383\n00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.111\nRonnie thank you for\nmaking us aware of it, but\n\n384\n00:20:18.111 --> 00:20:20.210\nit does look like we do\nhave run out of time.\n\n385\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.529\nFor this episode we do appreciate you for\ndropping by.\n\n386\n00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:26.236\nWe appreciate our audience for\nwatching, but signing off for ITProTV,\n\n387\n00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:28.368\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n388\n00:20:28.368 --> 00:20:29.553\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n389\n00:20:29.553 --> 00:20:37.198\n[MUSIC]\n\n390\n00:20:37.198 --> 00:20:40.043\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.862\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:08.522\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.290\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.645\n&gt;&gt; All right\n&gt;&gt; Hi, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.645\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.405\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're coming back at you\n\n9\n00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:24.315\nwith more in our Cisco sec-ops series,\nand say that six times fast if you dare.\n\n10\n00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a lot of\n\n11\n00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.407\nwords going on in there.\n\n12\n00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:31.847\nBut joining us back in the studio to\nattempt that very tongue twister,\n\n13\n00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:32.947\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n14\n00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:34.467\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.437\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n16\n00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:37.627\nThank you once again for\nhaving me back on the series.\n\n17\n00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:40.567\nI'm kinda surprised with my four and\nfive partners.\n\n18\n00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.747\nThat seemed to be happening more and\nmore often.\n\n19\n00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:44.477\nI think you would abandoned me by now.\n\n20\n00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.342\n&gt;&gt; I'm in it to win it,\nRonnie, that's right.\n\n21\n00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:46.844\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n22\n00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:50.158\nthe great thing is today we're actually\nmoving to a different subject, but\n\n23\n00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:52.430\nwe're still in your\nfavorite grouping though.\n\n24\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.225\nHeaders.\n&gt;&gt; Headers.\n\n25\n00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:54.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so.\n\n26\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.890\n&gt;&gt; Never ending.\n\n27\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.820\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nIt seems like\n\n28\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.570\nthere's a lot of headers in here and\nthere are.\n\n29\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.450\nOkay?\nAnd that's why we're\n\n30\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.250\nactually taking it a little bit of time,\nmaking sure that we take a look at it.\n\n31\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.950\nNow, if you're gonna like, are you joking?\n\n32\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.405\nThis is like the 19th episode.\n\n33\n00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:09.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know how many.\n\n34\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.125\nBut let's say it's close.\n\n35\n00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:11.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're around that.\n\n36\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's say it's close here.\n\n37\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.010\nAnd you're probably saying,\nwhy does he keep doing that?\n\n38\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.620\nWell remember that part of\nthe idea of being a good analyst,\n\n39\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130\nalso starts with some fundamental\nskills and understanding networking.\n\n40\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.750\nAnd if you take a look at the idea here,\nwhat we've covered in terms of headers.\n\n41\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.060\nSo, Daniel you have to help out\nif I can remember everything here\n\n42\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.990\non the OSI module,\n\n43\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.000\nwe talked about ethernet which essentially\ncovers layer one and layer two.\n\n44\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.920\nNow, in ethernet and what we've talked\nabout in headers it's really layer two.\n\n45\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.170\nBut, it does have a layer one component\nif you kind of break it apart.\n\n46\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.130\nIt does also communicate and\nput things onto the wire itself.\n\n47\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.445\nBut we're really focused in on layer two.\n\n48\n00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.543\nThen we spent a good bit of\ntime taking a look at layer 3.\n\n49\n00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:59.385\nTalked about IPs, the IP header itself,\nand then spent a good\n\n50\n00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.865\nbit of time even on another\nprotocol inside of there, the ICMP.\n\n51\n00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:08.905\nSo there's layer 3, so logically then,\nthis particular section and\n\n52\n00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:13.750\njust at least a few more after this,\nis gonna be involving headers which\n\n53\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.270\nmeans that we'll cover the upper\nheader layers as well.\n\n54\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.430\nSo today and describing transport headers,\nor transport layer headers, I should say.\n\n55\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.680\nWe are really going to cover kind of\nthe basics of the layer for headers.\n\n56\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.800\nAnd for most of us,\nthat really divides up into,\n\n57\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.420\nwell two particular protocols,\nTCP and UDP.\n\n58\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.110\nThose are kind of the two major headers,\nas far as different\n\n59\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.980\nprotocols go that we want to focus in on\nand pay attention to some of the details.\n\n60\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.810\nA great thing is we pay attention to more\nTCP, a lot more headers in there than UDP.\n\n61\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.490\nAnd in the UDP, where I'm kinda fudging or\nsandbagging a little bit,\n\n62\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.770\nDaniel, because there's a lot\nmore to come in that later on,\n\n63\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.800\neven when we get up to\nthe application layer.\n\n64\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.500\nBut because there is a lot of that to go,\nwe're gonna kinda do a brief overview of\n\n65\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.220\nthat one too, in at least just\na little episode that we're doing,\n\n66\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.070\nmaybe a couple of episodes that we'll\ndo here, is what we'll take a look at.\n\n67\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.010\nSo let's start off with just a primer,\n\n68\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.820\nin terms of the way that TCP\nnormally ends up working.\n\n69\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.835\nSo Daniel,\nwhen we start to talk about this,\n\n70\n00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:29.380\nthere's a couple of things that are going\non here that we want to take a look at.\n\n71\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.560\nBut the easiest thing as we begin,\n\n72\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.260\nis that we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand what TCP provides for us.\n\n73\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.130\nTransport Control Protocol.\n\n74\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.050\nOr Transmission Control,\nI keep saying transport.\n\n75\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n76\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.862\nI will get that wrong every time,\nand I don't know why [INAUDIBLE].\n\n77\n00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:47.709\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Didn't it used to be called\n\n78\n00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.720\nthe transport control protocol?\n\n79\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.982\n&gt;&gt; People have said it more\nregularly that way, but\n\n80\n00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:53.310\nit's actually transmission\ncontrol protocol.\n\n81\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760\nI know that if I don't say it, somebody\nwill actually go, Ronnie you got that one,\n\n82\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.920\nI did get that one wrong because I\nsaid it multiple times here, but\n\n83\n00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.010\nit is transmission control protocol.\n\n84\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.690\nNow in the transmission control protocol,\nwhat does it really provide for\n\n85\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.040\nus that we need?\n\n86\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.081\nAnd that's why this comes about.\n\n87\n00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.365\nRemember that really at the beginning,\n\n88\n00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:15.201\nthe idea of just simply sending down\nfrom one location to the other.\n\n89\n00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:20.250\nIt really doesn't involve much more\nbesides us saying, all right I need\n\n90\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.630\na source IP address and a source Mac\naddress sorry, destination address,\n\n91\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.874\nI can deliver from one location to\nanother, that's pretty much about it.\n\n92\n00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:32.719\nDon't really need anything else.\n\n93\n00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.654\nBut if you are going to be communicating,\nthen you are probably going to be using\n\n94\n00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.122\nsome kind of application\nin that communication,\n\n95\n00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:41.705\nwhich now means we have to be\nable to take that data and\n\n96\n00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:44.500\nattach it a little bit higher\ninto the [INAUDIBLE] model.\n\n97\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.500\nAnd the way that we do that is\nof course using the TCP here.\n\n98\n00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.710\nSo when we do this, what does TCP\noffer and why do we actually need it?\n\n99\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.890\nWe need it because it does\nconnect us to the application.\n\n100\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.440\nSo it takes that ability to send data,\nand really relay it on to those upper\n\n101\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.550\nlayers which attaches it to\nthe application that we need.\n\n102\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.700\nThe other things that it provides,\ngenerally,\n\n103\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.730\nare things like what we call reliability.\n\n104\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.409\nAlso the idea here of flow control and\nproviding for\n\n105\n00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.895\nstateful communication as well.\n\n106\n00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:20.521\nNow, let's make sure that we kind of\nbreak that down and understand that.\n\n107\n00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:25.690\nSo using that and understanding\nthe idea of something like reliability.\n\n108\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.431\nWell, what in the world is reliability\nabout, and why is it so important?\n\n109\n00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:38.034\nIt is absolutely probably the key feature\ninside of TCP that we want to talk about,\n\n110\n00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:42.929\nbecause it does require what\nwe call a connection oriented.\n\n111\n00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:44.960\nIt's actually a connection\noriented protocol.\n\n112\n00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.040\nIt requires both sides of that\ncommunication, really do establish and\n\n113\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760\ntalk to each other as what it does.\n\n114\n00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.220\nSo at the beginning here,\n\n115\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.550\nlet me see if, I don't think I\nactually have the dive down there.\n\n116\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.359\nThat'll work.\n\n117\n00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:01.264\nSo let me move this off to a side for\na moment here.\n\n118\n00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:03.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Put them back.\n\n119\n00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.900\nHopefully, do not pay attention to that.\n\n120\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.730\nAnd we'll start with this.\n\n121\n00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.550\nSo, remember there's actually what we\ncall a three way handshake to begin,\n\n122\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.670\nand kind of get everything set up.\n\n123\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.990\nThe way that we want to.\n\n124\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.520\nSo the initial side is,\n\n125\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.980\nof course, is what you designing to\ncommunicate with the other side.\n\n126\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.241\nSo let's just mark this and make it easy.\n\n127\n00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.829\nWe'll say, A and then.\n\n128\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.090\nWe'll make this one B over here.\n\n129\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.710\nSo when we want to do that,\nbefore any data is transmitted back and\n\n130\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.620\nfourth across these two devices,\nwhat A will do is it will send\n\n131\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.820\na synchronization or\na SYN header, is what it will do.\n\n132\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.820\nA SYN pack,\nis what it will end up sending.\n\n133\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.778\nWhen it does so,\nit includes a sequence number.\n\n134\n00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:54.050\nWe're not gonna get into\nsequence numbers right now, but\n\n135\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.520\nit will go ahead and send that.\n\n136\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.106\nWhat it's telling B is,\nI want to send data to you.\n\n137\n00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:05.040\nIt is sort of like going into a room for\nthe first time, and you're meeting people.\n\n138\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.590\nWhen you walk into, I hope.\n\n139\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.140\nThere's two types of people,\nright, Daniel?\n\n140\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.050\nThere's the one that walks in the room and\ngoes, hello, my name is.\n\n141\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.290\nAs soon as they walk in the room,\nthey see you.\n\n142\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.060\nThat's essentially what TCP does.\n\n143\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.200\nIt walks in and goes,\nI need to communicate with Daniel,\n\n144\n00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.050\nwalks right up and goes,\nhey, my name is so-and-so.\n\n145\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.570\nAnd normally, what is expected back,\nof course then,\n\n146\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.280\nif this were Daniel, if Daniel was B,\nis that there would be a response.\n\n147\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.000\nNow, if Daniel just walks away,\n\n148\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.990\nthen we kind of know something\nelse may be going on.\n\n149\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.040\nBut let's say that it\nactually works that way.\n\n150\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.780\nSo what does Daniel do?\n\n151\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.899\nDaniel, essentially acknowledges\n\n152\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.470\nthe very fact that A tried to communicate.\n\n153\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.836\nNow Daniel,\nin this nice traditional reading,\n\n154\n00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:55.726\nthe guys very formal,\nhello, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n155\n00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.058\nI would like to communicate with you,\nand Daniel, of course,\n\n156\n00:07:58.058 --> 00:07:59.694\ngives his customized customary greeting.\n\n157\n00:07:59.694 --> 00:08:00.526\nWhat's up?\n\n158\n00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:02.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking.\n\n159\n00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:05.290\n[LAUGH] Now, he's-\n&gt;&gt; Just a head nod.\n\n160\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.336\n&gt;&gt; Just a nod, or the bro nod.\n\n161\n00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do I have to pop out\n\n162\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.330\nmy collar when I do that?\n\n163\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.350\n&gt;&gt; You may.\nPut a little product in the hair and\n\n164\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.475\nyou'll be off and ready to go.\n\n165\n00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:15.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At this point though,\n\n166\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.350\nit's just a simple acknowledgment.\n\n167\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.670\nIt's saying you want to\nsync up with me that fine.\n\n168\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.450\nBut there's something else\nthat has to happen, right.\n\n169\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.680\nThe idea of acknowledging is perfectly\nfine, but there's another portion of this.\n\n170\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.560\nIf he wants to communicate, which is\nnormally what happens here, he is also\n\n171\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.170\ngoing to send his own synchronization\nmessage like this, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.310\nSo when A says, hey,\nI'd like to make this synchronization so\n\n173\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.190\nthat I can start communicating with you,\n\n174\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.260\nB automatically assumes then that\nwe will start a conversation.\n\n175\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.230\nBut for him to start, he has to say.\n\n176\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.900\nSo I'd like to synchronize\nwith you as well.\n\n177\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.760\nSo he essentially does the same thing and\n\n178\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.860\nhe acknowledges that\ninitial synchronization.\n\n179\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.840\nOnce that's done, this is where\nI kind of jumped a step here.\n\n180\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.410\nI forgot to, oops.\n\n181\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.096\n&gt;&gt; Oopsie daisy.\n\n182\n00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:09.650\n&gt;&gt; Because I can't move stuff\nas quickly as I want to.\n\n183\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:17.070\nAnd then finally, we get to this point,\nwhere it's just a simple acknowledgement.\n\n184\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.598\nAnd once we get past this,\nwe now can begin to transmit data, okay..\n\n185\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.470\nSo, both sides essentially\nhave to be synchronized up and\n\n186\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.960\nready to go before any data\nis really transmitted.\n\n187\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.580\nWhy is that important?\n\n188\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.960\nIt is important because we\nstart to learn something.\n\n189\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.060\nIn very small networks where\nwe're just transmitting a few\n\n190\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.150\nbytes of information at a time,\nit was no big deal.\n\n191\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.280\nAs long as the information\nwas of a certain size.\n\n192\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.050\nBut as documents, or files, or\n\n193\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.540\nwhatever it is that we're\ntransferring got larger and larger.\n\n194\n00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.290\nWell, this is what we talk about\nthe idea of fragmenting packets, right?\n\n195\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:04.480\nBreaking enough into chunks, into sizes\nthat the networks could handle, okay.\n\n196\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.970\nAnd so, Daniel, now that we're\nspread across the Internet and\n\n197\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.070\nwe are now sending multiple\npackets even between you and me.\n\n198\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.391\nIt is a possibility that\nif I sent you a large file,\n\n199\n00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:16.564\nthat that file is going to be broken up,\nokay.\n\n200\n00:10:16.564 --> 00:10:20.722\nAnd then it's gonna arrive at\nyour particular machine, but\n\n201\n00:10:20.722 --> 00:10:26.620\nwhen it arrives at your machine, it is\npossible that it can arrive out of order.\n\n202\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.992\nOkay, it is possible, not highly likely,\nanymore cuz of how quickly things are,\n\n203\n00:10:30.992 --> 00:10:34.400\nbut it is possible that it\ncan arrive out of order.\n\n204\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.650\nSo now you have a bunch of pieces and\nthings that are going on.\n\n205\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.200\nAnd when something like that happens,\nwell,\n\n206\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.790\nthat means you have be able to reassemble\nthem and put them back together.\n\n207\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.220\nWell, how do you know?\n\n208\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.790\nWell, you just kind of look and go, well,\nI'll just kind of open every box and\n\n209\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.480\njust try and\nfigure out what goes together.\n\n210\n00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.440\n&gt;&gt; That seems efficient [LAUGH].\n\n211\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.927\n&gt;&gt; It seems insanely efficient.\n\n212\n00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:57.380\nIt starts to slow down\njust a tad bit here, okay?\n\n213\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.630\nSo once we get everything back together.\n\n214\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.170\nBut no,\ninside of TCP we have the elements then,\n\n215\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.090\nnot only to be able to do\nthe synchronization that we need, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.790\nNot only to do that and\nactually now have a reliable connection.\n\n217\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.300\nWe don't send data before we have\nthat reliability established.\n\n218\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:21.850\nWe also include inside of TCP, the ability\nto recover from things like this.\n\n219\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.310\nSo sequencing, which is why I\nhad the sequence number up here.\n\n220\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.420\nThe ability to do all this stuff and\n\n221\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.125\nget everything transferred in the way\nthat we want to, so that things could be\n\n222\n00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:34.920\nre-assembled in the proper order\nreally do help us out as well.\n\n223\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.940\nIt can even help us with\nflow control if we need to.\n\n224\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.440\nSay how much can be sent at one time,\nhow much can I handle?\n\n225\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.310\nInstead of just relying on\nlayer three at the ICMP level,\n\n226\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:51.210\nwe can now use TCP to be more\ngranular in its approach to do so.\n\n227\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.960\nSo there's a lot that's going on here\njust at the basic levels to do that.\n\n228\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.200\nOkay, so let's come back here now and try\nand see just in understanding the basics\n\n229\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.650\nof what essentially goes on when\nwe start this synchronization.\n\n230\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.540\nBecause it's gonna help you to\nunderstand when things can go wrong,\n\n231\n00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.140\nas you start to see this.\n\n232\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.084\nSo, at the very beginning, okay,\n\n233\n00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:19.786\nlet's remember that what's key here\nin TCP is those five IP tuples.\n\n234\n00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:24.293\nI'm not gonna be able to say it, but\nI know that I think I've said it wrong at\n\n235\n00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:27.380\nleast once or\ntwice in the show here, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.400\nSo let's make sure that we review this,\nokay?\n\n237\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.880\nThe five tuples of information,\nIP addresses, right?\n\n238\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.880\nSource and destination IP address,\nsource and\n\n239\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.010\ndestination protocol and I think as I\nwas reviewing this last night I said,\n\n240\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.400\nI think I said in one episode source and\ndestination MAC address.\n\n241\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.960\nI'm pretty sure I said that.\n\n242\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.370\nBut it's actually source and destination\nport number is what we also want.\n\n243\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.790\nAnd then of course, the proper protocol.\n\n244\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.750\nUsually for us that's gonna be TCP or\nUDP, or normally even ICMP is possible.\n\n245\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.520\nBut that's what we're looking for, right?\n\n246\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.406\nSource IP, Source Port, Destination IP,\n\n247\n00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:13.077\nDestination Port and the protocol,\nthose are the five tuples or\n\n248\n00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:17.435\ntuples of information that we have, okay.\n\n249\n00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:21.135\nSo notice we have Source Port, Destination\nPort, and the we go up to layer three.\n\n250\n00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:23.855\nOr go down to layer three,\ndepending on how you look at it.\n\n251\n00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:26.485\nYou then get the IP\naddresses along with that.\n\n252\n00:13:26.485 --> 00:13:30.375\nAnd also in the IP header, you also get\nthe protocol field down there as well.\n\n253\n00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:36.310\nSo the combination in TCP/IP, those five\ntuples of information really establish for\n\n254\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.630\nus that direct communication\nbetween those devices, and\n\n255\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.968\nas continued communication\nbetween them as well, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.990\nSo when we talk about that handshake,\n\n257\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.410\nhow does it know how to\nestablish the handshake?\n\n258\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.167\nWell, it is following the protocols,\nwhich most devices are today in TCP/IP.\n\n259\n00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:56.870\nThe initial send that is sent.\n\n260\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.850\nThe way that I had it here,\nlet me see if I can find it again, okay,\n\n261\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.080\nin the reset here.\n\n262\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.210\nSo the way that I had\nit here in this Sin0,\n\n263\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.570\nwhat begins to send is\nactually right here.\n\n264\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.690\nOkay, so we'll come back to\nthe idea of sequence number and\n\n265\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.080\nthe acknowledgement numbers.\n\n266\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.420\nWe'll point out what this is for\nhere as well,\n\n267\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.320\nbut let me get to this since I\nalready started on this, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.280\nIs right here in these fields,\nthese are called our TCP flags.\n\n269\n00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.958\nNow there's a lot more than six fields but\na lot of them are actually not used,\n\n270\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.190\nthere's at least two other ones that\nare generally not used anymore.\n\n271\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.050\nSo we're gonna focus on\nthe ones that we need to.\n\n272\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.340\nThere's an urgent flag,\nthere's an ACK, there's a push, PSH.\n\n273\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.580\nA reset, a SYN and a FIN.\n\n274\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.610\nSo in the initial one,\nwhat's actually given a one, okay,\n\n275\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.860\ncuz this is actually a symbol bit field,\nit's either a one or a zero, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.220\nWhat's gonna be turned on is\ngonna be the SYN bit, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.780\nSo when the computer B receives this.\n\n278\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.570\nIt sees a SYN bit over there, and then\nwhen it actually sends back the SYNACK,\n\n279\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.960\nit sends back and\nit turns on the SYN and the ACK.\n\n280\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.970\nSo it actually marks these two fields\nhere, and puts a one in place, so\n\n281\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:18.890\nthat now the originator of\nthe original SYN packet, right?\n\n282\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.110\nIt can acknowledge that it got that.\n\n283\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.450\nAnd once it acknowledges it,\nit now can begin to send data.\n\n284\n00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:31.250\nAnd when it begins to send data and\ntransmit, it then goes to this PSH here.\n\n285\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.530\nWhen everything is ultimately done,\nyou of course will then end up with a FIN.\n\n286\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.580\nSo after you finished transmitting\neverything else, you can get this, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.690\nSo, that's what happens is that these\nare the bits that are really being used\n\n288\n00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.820\nduring the whole time.\n\n289\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.866\nSo they're either gonna be ones or\nzeroes, zeroes are gonna be off,\n\n290\n00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.558\nones of course mean that they're on.\n\n291\n00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:54.376\nWe're gonna point out a couple\nof combinations when we get into\n\n292\n00:15:54.376 --> 00:15:56.010\nthe vulnerabilities here.\n\n293\n00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.450\nAnd there's gonna be a couple of them\nthat you should never see in those\n\n294\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.626\ncombinations, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.524\nSo that's kind of the key in what\nwe also want to be able to do.\n\n296\n00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:05.584\nSo right at the very beginning, and\n\n297\n00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:08.700\nunderstanding that that\nis going to help you.\n\n298\n00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.800\nIf you understand where the SYN is, and\nwhere the SYN_ACK comes from, and where\n\n299\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.260\nthe acknowledgement comes from, it is\nwithin these flagged fields here as well.\n\n300\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.210\nWe're ready to talk about source port and\ndestination ports here,\n\n301\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.170\nbut let's make sure that we\nfill this information in,\n\n302\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.070\njust as part of our primer that\nwe're talking about, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:34.609\nThe very fact is, we have 16 bits,\n2 to the 16th power,\n\n304\n00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:41.299\n65536 possible ports here,\n0 through 65,535.\n\n305\n00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.624\nAnd then if you go 0 through 1023,\n\n306\n00:16:45.624 --> 00:16:51.540\nthose are what we call\nthe well-known ports, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.710\nAnd then from 1024 all the way\n\n308\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.640\nthrough, is it's 41,152,\nI think, or 151, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.770\nThose are actually gonna have\na couple of different names, and\n\n310\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.050\nthis is where I need us to focus in on.\n\n311\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:12.000\nSo Daniel, put on the exam, you know,\n\n312\n00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.180\nkind of preparedness hack is what\nwe're talking on here, okay.\n\n313\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.180\nSo Daniel, if you can remember,\nin each show that we've pretty much done,\n\n314\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.117\nthat we had a couple of this, right.\n\n315\n00:17:20.117 --> 00:17:23.080\nThere's the well-known ports,\nno big deal, the other ones,\n\n316\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.730\nthough, that's where it gets\na little bit more sketchy.\n\n317\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.698\nBecause most people don't know,\nI know what those are, most of us,\n\n318\n00:17:30.698 --> 00:17:32.144\nwe really don't pay attention.\n\n319\n00:17:32.144 --> 00:17:34.992\n&gt;&gt; Probably don't even know most\nof the thousand well known ports,\n\n320\n00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:35.988\nto be honest with you.\n\n321\n00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:39.228\nWe know a handful of ports\nthat we typically work with.\n\n322\n00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:40.151\n&gt;&gt; I think I know like six.\n\n323\n00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:40.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n324\n00:17:40.673 --> 00:17:42.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:45.421\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n326\n00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:48.877\n&gt;&gt; I'm familiar with maybe 20 or\n\n327\n00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:50.798\n30 [CROSSTALK].\n\n328\n00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:53.046\nThose upper ports\nare typically unregistered,\n\n329\n00:17:53.046 --> 00:17:56.953\nthey're just used by anything that needs\na port, you'll see it with like natting.\n\n330\n00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:58.991\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're CISCO people here, and\n\n331\n00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:01.373\nwe're gonna engage in\nnatting from time to time.\n\n332\n00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.619\nYour router just goes, well,\nI'll just throw a port on the end of that.\n\n333\n00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:09.078\nAnd there you go,\nit's not being used, go ahead,\n\n334\n00:18:09.078 --> 00:18:15.114\nyou'll see it in your WireShark,\nsee from source port 23214.\n\n335\n00:18:15.114 --> 00:18:17.832\nRandom port, right, but\nthat's just the port it was using.\n\n336\n00:18:17.832 --> 00:18:19.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange how they do this,\n\n337\n00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:22.385\nbut there's two names that we\ngotta get familiar with here.\n\n338\n00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:26.183\nAnd I wish I could tell you which one\nyou're gonna see something in the near\n\n339\n00:18:26.183 --> 00:18:30.120\nfuture, but I really don't know\nwhich one you'll end up seeing it.\n\n340\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.160\nSo you may hear the term, registered\nports, is what you'll hear, okay, so\n\n341\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.700\nbetween that 1024 to 49151, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.515\nThose are called registered ports,\nand then 49152 to 65535,\n\n343\n00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:46.270\nthose are dynamic, and\nare generated as they need to.\n\n344\n00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.590\nBut the ones in the mup, those are the key\nones that has that second name.\n\n345\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.718\nYou may hear the term,\nif I can say it right, ephemeral ports.\n\n346\n00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:57.659\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I've heard that.\n\n347\n00:18:57.659 --> 00:19:00.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well see I'm glad you have,\nbecause I was like,\n\n348\n00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:02.725\nnobody calls them ephemeral port-\n&gt;&gt; No one calls them ephemeral\n\n349\n00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:04.888\n[CROSSTALK],\n&gt;&gt; Yet, when I said, I was like,\n\n350\n00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:09.080\nwho the heck called it, so I typed\nit into our favorite search engine.\n\n351\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.810\nAnd darn if not everybody and their mother\nwrites them, and they're called ephemeral\n\n352\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.250\nports, [LAUGH] so obviously-\n&gt;&gt; I never heard that in common speak.\n\n353\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, obviously I am not\nsophisticated enough to have done that.\n\n354\n00:19:22.216 --> 00:19:24.267\n&gt;&gt; The upper echelon of academia [LAUGH].\n\n355\n00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:30.109\n&gt;&gt; So here it is, ephemeral ports is\nwhat you may also hear the term as well.\n\n356\n00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:34.808\nNow, Daniel, I don't think I would\never actually really use the term\n\n357\n00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:39.360\nephemeral in the show, or\neven in regular conversation normally.\n\n358\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.320\nUnless It may be important,\nwhat do you think, Daniel?\n\n359\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nRonnie typically likes to put\n\n360\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.040\nsome sort of emphasis on things\nthat you might run across.\n\n361\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.760\nWhen it comes to any portion where someone\nmight be asking you questions about things\n\n362\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.110\nin such a certain way that you might\nbe required to give an answer, or\n\n363\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.760\nnot pass an exam [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just weird,\nbecause all terminology,\n\n365\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.676\nright, we can't blame them for using\nwhatever terminology that they wanna use.\n\n366\n00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:06.684\n&gt;&gt; You watch me, Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:20:06.684 --> 00:20:09.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but at the same time it\nstill means you have to learn it,\n\n368\n00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:11.140\nthat's the issue, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.570\nSo there are what we call ephemeral\nports out there, so we take a look at\n\n370\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:20.000\nthe diagram once again, okay, well,\nthese can all be in those areas.\n\n371\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.564\nNow typically, when we start to\nmake that type of connection\n\n372\n00:20:24.564 --> 00:20:27.344\ndepending on your computer, okay.\n\n373\n00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:30.758\nIf you're actually making\na source connection, you're\n\n374\n00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:36.060\nnormally gonna see one of two things,\nand it also depends on the application.\n\n375\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.330\nMost of the time, you'll see these\nas being relatively high numbers,\n\n376\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.970\ntechnically, they're supposed to\nbe that 49152 and above, or 50.\n\n377\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.890\nThat's what essentially is supposed\nto happen, it doesn't always happen.\n\n378\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.232\nIt's the application that says,\n\n379\n00:20:51.232 --> 00:20:53.600\nyou're gonna start on this port\nwhen you make a connection.\n\n380\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.020\nSo a client that makes\na connection to a server,\n\n381\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.370\nit can choose whatever ports it wants to,\nas long as it believes it's not out there.\n\n382\n00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.160\nOr if it actually says,\nhere's what port I want you to connect on,\n\n383\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.010\nyou can do that, it's no big deal,\nokay, so it can be done that way.\n\n384\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:12.150\nDestination ports, though, usually are\ngonna be, well, those well-known ports.\n\n385\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.890\nNot always, but typically,\nthat's the way it's gonna be.\n\n386\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.900\nSo for example, a web server,\nwe know that HTTP, so\n\n387\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.290\nI'm gonna test Daniel's port knowledge\nhere, HTTP, Daniel, come on.\n\n388\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.390\n&gt;&gt; Port 14,000, no,\nit's 80 [LAUGH] eight, zero.\n\n389\n00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.110\n&gt;&gt; We've seen it often, right, yeah,\n\n390\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.500\nusually destination ports are those\nvery relatively well known ports.\n\n391\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.310\nSo seeing source ports and\ndestination ports,\n\n392\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.570\nthere's nothing written in stone\nthat says it must be this way.\n\n393\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.300\n&gt;&gt; You can change it.\n\n394\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou can change it to whatever you want to.\n\n395\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:49.580\nBut if you start to go, right,\nsource parts are kind of low here.\n\n396\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.520\nIt starts to make you wonder, especially\nif they're those well known ones.\n\n397\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.290\nAnd then destination port, if they're,\nagain, odd numbers, check and take\n\n398\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.350\na look if this is something that you're\nexpecting to see on your network, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.010\nIf you're seeing destination ports,\nthen you're going,\n\n400\n00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.310\nI don't know why we would be\nsending anything on that port.\n\n401\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.020\nDaniel, do you think that that's kind of\na key that something else is going on\n\n402\n00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.150\nin your network you don't know about?\n\n403\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually,\nwhen you start seeing weird stuff,\n\n404\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.980\nit should raise the eyebrow\nto a further investigation.\n\n405\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is the key,\nright, once again,\n\n406\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.540\nlooking at the header information\nthe way that we see it.\n\n407\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.099\nThat's what we want to be able to see and\ndo and understand as we take a look here,\n\n408\n00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:31.680\nokay, so same thing here.\n\n409\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.180\nNow sequencing number is all about,\nonce again, putting things back together.\n\n410\n00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.360\nThe acknowledgement number is\nabout the reliability here, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.670\nBoth sides essentially acknowledge that\nyes, I'm gonna send you stuff, and\n\n412\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.830\nthe other guy says, I'm ready, okay.\n\n413\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.940\nOr, maybe he responds back with,\nno, maybe you're not ready,\n\n414\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.030\nI'm not gonna transmit anything.\n\n415\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.450\nAnd then you have to start all over in\nterms of the three way handshake and\n\n416\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.360\nget everything else there\nready to go as well, not so\n\n417\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.580\nmuch concerned about these data offsets.\n\n418\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.030\nIn case something doesn't actually gets\nused, because this entire field across\n\n419\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:10.780\nhere is supposed to be 32 bits,\nit can add padding if it needs to.\n\n420\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.840\nThere's some reserved bits for\nother things that need it as well.\n\n421\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.710\nThis right here is by far kind of\nthe important ones that we wanna focus on,\n\n422\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.610\nwhich we just did, and\nthen there is the window.\n\n423\n00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.910\nWindow is about flow control, so it's neat\nthat everything that we talked about so\n\n424\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:31.630\nfar, right, acknowledgement to help\nus with the reliability, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.330\nAnd then the sequence number to\nhelp us to make sure that we\n\n426\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.620\ncan put things back in the right order.\n\n427\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.043\nThe idea of using the TCP handshake here,\nright,\n\n428\n00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:48.782\nwe also talked about those bits, and\nthe window helps us with flow control,\n\n429\n00:23:48.782 --> 00:23:52.706\nokay, so\nthat is also a good one too, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:57.430\nThe other thing that is offered here at\nlayer four, of course, are checksums.\n\n431\n00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.346\nAnd Daniel, how important is it that\nthe checksum actually Matters to you and\n\n432\n00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:05.154\nme in terms of receiving\ndata packets here.\n\n433\n00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:08.539\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would say it matters a lot\nbecause if it's not the right checksum,\n\n434\n00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:10.118\nthen you've got corrupted data.\n\n435\n00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:12.062\nAnd TCP is all about data integrity,\n\n436\n00:24:12.062 --> 00:24:15.574\nmaking sure that you got what it was\nthat you were supposed to get and\n\n437\n00:24:15.574 --> 00:24:19.862\nnot something different and that's why\nit has these checksums available to us.\n\n438\n00:24:19.862 --> 00:24:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, so Daniel, that's a good\npoint to actually make here, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.860\nSo when we think about this idea, there's\nsomething that's special about the way\n\n440\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.982\nthat these TCP header actually works\nin terms of the checksum here, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:41.080\nNothing else checks this except for\nthe destination device.\n\n442\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.930\nSo routers in between,\nfirewalls don't check the checksum at TCP.\n\n443\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.450\nIt's just the destination device.\n\n444\n00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.670\nSo at that point, it's only when it\ngets through your entire network do\n\n445\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.140\nyou realize, okay,\nthat something could be, yeah, not right.\n\n446\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n447\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.494\n&gt;&gt; So it lets you know that there's a\npossibility here that something could get\n\n448\n00:25:04.494 --> 00:25:09.261\nin and it's only after it arrives on your\ndevice are you able to kind of spot that\n\n449\n00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:12.314\nthis is happening, so\nit just realizes that too.\n\n450\n00:25:12.314 --> 00:25:14.910\nOf course,\nthere's even prioritization, okay?\n\n451\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:21.230\nAnd then we actually move on to this one\nhere, which I believe is actually a typo.\n\n452\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, that's what happens when\nyou copy and paste a little too much.\n\n453\n00:25:25.018 --> 00:25:26.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Daniel, you're right.\n\n454\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.080\nSo I just noticed that too, I've been\ngoing the whole show and there it is.\n\n455\n00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.308\nDaniel's looking at it like yep,\nhe's gonna explain that.\n\n456\n00:25:32.308 --> 00:25:32.996\nI'm not gonna explain.\n\n457\n00:25:32.996 --> 00:25:34.328\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing,\n\n458\n00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:36.150\nI’m like Ronnie knows what he's doing.\n\n459\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.535\nMaybe he's got some trick up his sleeve.\n\n460\n00:25:38.535 --> 00:25:40.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthere's some tricks, it's called-\n\n461\n00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:41.358\n&gt;&gt; The trick is that Ronnie copied and\n\n462\n00:25:41.358 --> 00:25:42.025\npasted it [LAUGH].\n\n463\n00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:44.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I copied and\npasted as I was making this diagram.\n\n464\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.122\n&gt;&gt; Trick's on Ronnie.\n\n465\n00:25:45.122 --> 00:25:46.288\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is on Ronnie.\n\n466\n00:25:46.288 --> 00:25:47.720\nOnce again, egg on his face.\n\n467\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.763\nAnd you're probably used to it by now,\nI would assume.\n\n468\n00:25:49.763 --> 00:25:51.182\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've come to expect it.\n\n469\n00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:51.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n470\n00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.075\nyes, these are additional options that\nwe choose to put in there if we need to.\n\n471\n00:25:57.075 --> 00:25:59.250\nSo, you may choose to use them.\n\n472\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.970\nYou may not.\n\n473\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.350\nAnd that's probably why I was thinking\nthat you didn't need them or something.\n\n474\n00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.230\nBut no, I just copied and\n\n475\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.940\npasted the last large bar down there and\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n476\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:13.030\nSo, other additional fields that may\nactually be in use, those are kind of key.\n\n477\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.040\nSo having this primer ready to go and\n\n478\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.080\nunderstanding, we're starting to see where\nwe can see some weaknesses at least.\n\n479\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.190\nThat's what I hope that we're seeing here,\n\n480\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.210\nis that we can start spotting some ways\nthat this can show vulnerability as well.\n\n481\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.700\nNow I haven't gotten to what I want to.\n\n482\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.360\nI really wanna show you\nthis inside of Wireshark.\n\n483\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.650\nYou might go, Ron, you just explained it,\n\n484\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.990\nbut seeing it, seeing the real live data\nand being able to see that exchange and\n\n485\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.490\nseeing how this actually works\nis part of what I want to do.\n\n486\n00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:46.176\nBut Daniel, it looks like once again\nI have beaten the clock again.\n\n487\n00:26:46.176 --> 00:26:46.972\n&gt;&gt; Into submission.\n\n488\n00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Into submission.\n\n489\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.050\nAnd that means we\nare going into a part two.\n\n490\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.980\nSo Daniel hit it right on as he guessed\nthe show that we weren't gonna get\n\n491\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.230\ntoo far into this, because he knows\nwho I am and that's what I do.\n\n492\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.292\n&gt;&gt; I've known Ronnie for a few years now\nand I've come to expect certain things out\n\n493\n00:27:00.292 --> 00:27:03.701\nof him and I knew that this was\nnowhere ever going near a one parter.\n\n494\n00:27:03.701 --> 00:27:04.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's okay,\n\n495\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.000\ncuz it's great stuff,\nstuff we need to know.\n\n496\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.970\nStuff even if you do already kinda\nknow it, it's good to rehash that,\n\n497\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.470\ngo over it again, make sure that you\nrefresh that information in your mind,\n\n498\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.500\nbecause it might be important on the exam.\n\n499\n00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.078\nAnd I'm sure if Ronnie's\ntelling you about it right now-\n\n500\n00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:18.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n501\n00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:19.680\n&gt;&gt; That that is the very case.\n\n502\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.170\nSo Ronnie, thanks so much.\n\n503\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.059\nAnd we do look forward to\nseeing you in part two.\n\n504\n00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:24.138\nWe will back for that.\n\n505\n00:27:24.138 --> 00:27:25.266\nDefinitely join us there.\n\n506\n00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:28.276\nWe do thank you for watching, but\nlike we've been talking about,\n\n507\n00:27:28.276 --> 00:27:29.848\nit's that time for us to sign off.\n\n508\n00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:32.040\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n509\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n510\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.112\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n511\n00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:40.974\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:27:40.974 --> 00:27:43.984\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.385\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:16.675\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:18.165\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.275\nin today's episode we're back with\nmore in our Cisco SECOPS series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.287\nAnd yes, it is that difficult to say.\n\n9\n00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:26.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very, very speedily, anyway.\n\n10\n00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.755\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:30.405\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.175\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:32.095\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:35.950\nThank you again for having me back\nas we continue on in TCP headers.\n\n15\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.750\nWe are of course in a part two.\n\n16\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.180\nI wonder why?\n\n17\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.520\nIt's just because well I apparently\ntalk once again a little bit too much.\n\n18\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.100\n&gt;&gt; If you were a program on\na command line you would be dash VV.\n\n19\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes I would.\n\n20\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.030\nYou better believe it I would be dash VV.\n\n21\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.240\nSo here it is.\n\n22\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.480\nWe are just taking a look at the headers,\nand we've talked about them pretty well.\n\n23\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000\nBut I wanted to show you.\n\n24\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.760\nNow, most of us, of course,\nhave seen the diagram that I drew, and so\n\n25\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.130\nit makes sense.\n\n26\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.560\nBut it doesn't make sense when you go,\nokay, so logically, you understand, but,\n\n27\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.890\nhow does it actually look when something\ncomes across a wire and it's that way?\n\n28\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.785\nWhere the TCP connection is established,\nwhere everything is done.\n\n29\n00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:23.840\nSo that's what I wanted to take us through\nand then examine the usage also of\n\n30\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.620\nsomething in the field's that we've been\ntalking about that we don't get to see.\n\n31\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.080\nLet's take a look here\non my screen once again.\n\n32\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.140\nAnd this will help us.\n\n33\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.984\nWe're gonna see not only all this\ninformation, but we're gonna focus in\n\n34\n00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:38.270\non these sequence numbers because\nthis is very important for,\n\n35\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.742\nwhat we're talking about especially\nbecause there's a very well\n\n36\n00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:44.980\nknown attack that happens here\nwith these sequence numbers.\n\n37\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.916\nBut it's a lot harder to do than\nit once was, which is great.\n\n38\n00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:52.339\nBut at the same time we wanna see all\nthis information, especially these\n\n39\n00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:56.992\nbits right here and how they do work and\nhow they do look across a connection.\n\n40\n00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:01.336\nI have got my Kali Linux box here,\nready to go.\n\n41\n00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:05.272\nI have got a connection out and\nwe are going to use wireshark.\n\n42\n00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:08.558\nAnd we're simply going to use a simple\nconnection going out to a webpage to\n\n43\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:10.420\nestablish what I want to see.\n\n44\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.334\nSo I will launch first what\nI normally forget to launch,\n\n45\n00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:16.020\nwhich is the tool that\ncaptures everything.\n\n46\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.360\nSo I don't know why and it's kinda,\nno I just do the thing and\n\n47\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.060\nyeah I got to launch that and\nthen we have to do that thing twice.\n\n48\n00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:26.540\nNow we'll not worry about\nthe unprivileged user guide\n\n49\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.560\nI wanna make sure that I've got the right\nIP address, which is the one that I want.\n\n50\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.010\nAnd that is the one that I want, at least\nthat's what I believe is happening.\n\n51\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.850\nSo it says a live capture is in progress.\n\n52\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.870\nNow I'm gonna open up my browser.\n\n53\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.940\nAnd in a moment here,\nwell maybe if Kali Linux lets me.\n\n54\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.118\nWe just established a connection out to,\nwell, let's just do ITPro.TV.\n\n55\n00:02:52.118 --> 00:02:56.510\nNow, a shameless plug into our own web.\n\n56\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.740\nDid you know that we have a website?\n\n57\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.820\nI was unaware.\n\n58\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.025\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know we have a website.\n\n59\n00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n60\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.195\n&gt;&gt; I've been there once or twice.\n\n61\n00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:06.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n62\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.000\nSo here's our website, connection.\n\n63\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.960\nThat's pretty much all that we need, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.710\nBut I could have used anything,\nbut why not, help out.\n\n65\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.595\nHere we go, now I've got some data,\nsome traffic coming in.\n\n66\n00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.220\nLet's stop the capture here for a moment.\n\n67\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.270\nAnd then of course we want to go down and\nfind some tcp traffic.\n\n68\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.890\nI do see some tcp traffic\nwhich is what I'm hoping for.\n\n69\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.403\nI can then apply a display filter, so\nthat helps me out a little bit more.\n\n70\n00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:39.935\nAnd now we can focus in over\nhere on the right hand side and\n\n71\n00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:45.336\nI'm starting to see in the info,\nthere is the synchronization and\n\n72\n00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:48.720\nthe syn ack and\nthe ack as we see it as well.\n\n73\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.884\nSo, if we take a look at this summary and\nthis information that we're seeing,\n\n74\n00:03:53.884 --> 00:03:58.971\nwe're really just gonna focus in on the,\nof course, the SYN and the sequence\n\n75\n00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:03.849\nhere as well as these numbers right\nover here, just briefly for a moment.\n\n76\n00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.332\nWe'll talk about the win to size\nin just a moment as well too.\n\n77\n00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:07.040\nOkay?\n\n78\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.460\nBut at the very beginning, if I wanna\nestablish a connection, notice this SYN.\n\n79\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.210\nSo here it is.\n\n80\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.240\nThat means that that\nparticular bit is marked and\n\n81\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.390\nthen we have the sequence\nnumber which says, look,\n\n82\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.450\nwe are beginning what's called an ISN here\nwhich is the Initial Sequence Number.\n\n83\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.750\nNow the Initial Sequence Number\ndoesn't always have to be a 0 and\n\n84\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.870\nto tell you the truth,\nthis is actually a relative number and\n\n85\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.990\nthat is because of the way\nthat it's measured.\n\n86\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.070\nWay back, when ever before I\never even thought about TCP,\n\n87\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.260\nI'm gonna say that for sure.\n\n88\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.560\nWay back then, yeah,\n\n89\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.160\nbefore I ever thought about TCP, it used\nto be relatively simple like, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.190\nFirst pack of the SYN, zero.\n\n91\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.880\nSecond one?\n\n92\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.520\nWell, let's make that a one-\n\n93\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n94\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.890\nAnd that made it incredibly easy to go,\n\n95\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.310\nall right so,\nit makes sense to sequence numbers.\n\n96\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.200\nBut, they started realizing that if\nthey do that it makes it also easy for\n\n97\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.720\npeople to guess.\n\n98\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.830\nAnd we'll talk about why that's\nactually something bad in a moment.\n\n99\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.330\nSo now they've changed this up to\nwhere it's incredibly almost random.\n\n100\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.560\nNow I say almost random because to you and\nme the clock doesn't make sense.\n\n101\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.450\nEven if we're going,\n\n102\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.880\nit's every second of a day we\ncould kind of even guess that out.\n\n103\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.920\nBut the way that it works\nis based on a weird clock.\n\n104\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.717\nIt really is.\n\n105\n00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:30.468\nSo like, for you and\nI if we do an hour of it's 60 minutes.\n\n106\n00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.173\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:35.445\n&gt;&gt; It was 37 minutes but we changed that.\n\n108\n00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:36.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For some reason in my mind\n\n109\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.710\nas I said what I said which I go.\n\n110\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.570\nThat's not right.\n\n111\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.770\nAnd then I changed around.\n\n112\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.750\nIt was 60 seconds, an hour or 60 seconds.\n\n113\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.480\nI was like I'm no longer\ngonna say that wrong.\n\n114\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.690\nSo that's why I kind of paused there.\n\n115\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.420\nBut it's 60 minutes.\n\n116\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.560\nBut in the cycle, in the way that the\nsequence number is generated the clock is\n\n117\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.080\nsomething like 4 hours and 55 minutes,\nso it makes it a little bit harder.\n\n118\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.950\nAnd they also do the increments\nnot in seconds, but\n\n119\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.195\nin tens of microseconds or milliseconds.\n\n120\n00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:09.243\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not really good\nat just naturally gauging tens\n\n121\n00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:13.499\nof millionths of micro seconds, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:14.205\n&gt;&gt; Probably gonna be there.\n\n123\n00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:15.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well think about that.\n\n124\n00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.090\nThat's what it makes a little\nbit more difficult to kind of\n\n125\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.538\nguess the numbers that really appear.\n\n126\n00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:23.488\nInside of Wireshark they're like, let's\nmake it easier because most people aren't\n\n127\n00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:26.880\ngonna understand where these\nnumber come from anyways, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.580\nSo we see the ack, and we see this and\nwe'll talk about how that actually comes\n\n129\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.020\nin and\nwhy that helps us out a little bit more.\n\n130\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.290\nSo if I select that very first packet, and\nthat's the highest it's gonna let me pull\n\n131\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.080\nthat up, then let me expand out TCP.\n\n132\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.450\nThen I can scroll in and\nzoom in a little bit more.\n\n133\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.920\nNow we can see something.\n\n134\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.090\nNotice there's that sequence number again.\n\n135\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.256\nAnd look at how it's actually reported.\n\n136\n00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:57.545\nRelative sequence number.\n\n137\n00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:01.594\nNow it's relative, in other words it's so\nsmall I am just going to report a zero.\n\n138\n00:07:01.594 --> 00:07:03.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:03.916\n&gt;&gt; That's-\n\n140\n00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.013\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n141\n00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:05.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n142\n00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:09.120\nIt's so small right now, I'm just going\nto report a zero at this picker point.\n\n143\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.110\nAcknowledgement number.\n\n144\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.630\nWe're not getting\nacknowledgement number either.\n\n145\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.280\nBut notice this flag that\nyou see right here, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.930\nIt tells me, if I see that hexi decimal\nvalue 02, that that's the SYN flag.\n\n147\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.800\nIf I expand that out, we can now\nlook at the flags that are here.\n\n148\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:36.740\nAnd now you see, in that 4 bit,\nthese bit sequences here, there it is.\n\n149\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.020\nSo that is actually the second one here.\n\n150\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.310\nAnd that is the one that is set.\n\n151\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.430\nNotice all the other ones are not set.\n\n152\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.010\nWe normally don't use these up here.\n\n153\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.640\nThis Nonce and Congestion Reduced, or\nWindow Reduced and even the ECN-Echo.\n\n154\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.600\nI'm not saying you can't.\n\n155\n00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.633\nSomebody can use them.\n\n156\n00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:56.004\nBut when we focus in a lot of times it's\ngonna be on this last six down here is\n\n157\n00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:59.474\nwhat we end up seeing that\nare actually set When we do this.\n\n158\n00:07:59.474 --> 00:08:01.798\nSo right there at the beginning,\n\n159\n00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:05.866\nthis is where we see the idea\nof it being set and ready to go.\n\n160\n00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:10.120\nThe receiving computer, though,\nlet's take a look at how this changes it.\n\n161\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.127\nWhen we selected the receiving, oops,\nI went down too far, I was like,\n\n162\n00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:15.983\nwhy didn't that set two of them?\n\n163\n00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:19.648\nSo on the receiving one,\nwe can now see here that,\n\n164\n00:08:19.648 --> 00:08:25.322\nwhen you take a look at the SYN_ACK,\nnotice that it is the acknowledgement,\n\n165\n00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:29.590\nas well as the SYN flag is\nalso set here too, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.714\nSo this is where you're starting\nto see a couple of these\n\n167\n00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:36.011\ncombinations work out for us.\n\n168\n00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:39.358\nAnd notice that the sequence\nnumber is still 0, but\n\n169\n00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:43.220\nthe acknowledgement number has now risen,\nokay.\n\n170\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.610\nThen as we go to the final part,\nwell, not really the final part, but\n\n171\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.150\nthe part that actually allows us to now\nbegin to send data, the acknowledgement.\n\n172\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.850\nNotice it is only the acknowledgement at\nthis point, and now this sequence number\n\n173\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.760\nhas risen to a 1, and the acknowledgement\nnumber has now risen to a 1 as well, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.340\nSo that begins to kind of plot out for\n\n175\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.310\nus at least the information\nthat we're seeing right here.\n\n176\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:17.030\nNow inside that you'll go, okay, so\nthat's not exactly terribly exciting.\n\n177\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.175\nBut you can see where it breaks down, and\n\n178\n00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:23.330\nnow you can see where it's\ncoming across on Wireshark.\n\n179\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.230\nNow, once we get to this point,\nlet me show you the real numbers too, and\n\n180\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.310\nthis why we turned off\nthe real numbers and\n\n181\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.240\nshow relative numbers, is what ends\nup happening here, Daniel, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.315\nSo if I were to show you the real numbers,\nthey would be a little bit more confusing.\n\n183\n00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:40.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I go to Edit, then Preferences,\n\n184\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.450\nwithin Preferences here,\nI can then select on protocols.\n\n185\n00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.310\nAnd of course I have to scroll\ndown to the t's for TCP, if I can.\n\n186\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.210\nIt's a long way to scroll,\nwe're zoomed, it's insanely long.\n\n187\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.010\nTCP, and right here,\nwhere it says relative sequence numbers.\n\n188\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.370\nMake the TCP dissector\n\n189\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.220\nuse relative sequence numbers\ninstead of absolute ones, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.900\nSo to use this option,\nyou must also enable the analyzer, so\n\n191\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.910\nif I just un-click that little\ntiny check box, click OK.\n\n192\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:26.758\nAll right, so let's take a look at that\nsequence number now, all right, Daniel.\n\n193\n00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:28.335\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n194\n00:10:28.335 --> 00:10:31.589\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, there's-\n&gt;&gt; 920 million?\n\n195\n00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.322\n&gt;&gt; See how it's-\n&gt;&gt; Billion.\n\n196\n00:10:33.322 --> 00:10:36.807\n&gt;&gt; 920,741,533.\n\n197\n00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:40.012\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that was just,\nlet's start off with this,\n\n198\n00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:42.514\nwould it kill them to\nput a comma in there?\n\n199\n00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:43.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:46.525\n&gt;&gt; Let's start off with just\nthat first one that we got,\n\n201\n00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.720\nwhich was just the acknowledgement here.\n\n202\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.730\nSo even on the acknowledgement, so\nright here at the beginning, does that\n\n203\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.750\nmake sense at the very beginning of a-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n204\n00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.787\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is where it\ncomes in those, like I said,\n\n205\n00:10:59.787 --> 00:11:03.488\nthose tens of milliseconds or\nmicroseconds, and stuff like that.\n\n206\n00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:07.777\nA little bit more difficult\nto guess how this actually-\n\n207\n00:11:07.777 --> 00:11:08.999\n&gt;&gt; Of what's coming next.\n\n208\n00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:12.868\n&gt;&gt; What comes next, right, and\nthat's very important, okay,\n\n209\n00:11:12.868 --> 00:11:15.790\nin what we wanna talk about here, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.210\nAnd that's because we're gonna end up\ntalking about what we call a session\n\n211\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.593\nhijacking, or\njust a hijacking, TCP hijack.\n\n212\n00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:29.730\nSo when you start seeing something like\nthis, just realize you may not see\n\n213\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.410\nall the sequence numbers, because they're\nrelatively hidden and you can see why.\n\n214\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.070\nMost of us are just gonna say,\nlet's go and turn that back on here.\n\n215\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.430\nAnd I wanna turn it on because I\nwanna see this in the order, and\n\n216\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.340\nactually a better way than when\nwhat we showed you right here.\n\n217\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.070\nThis is good, don't get me wrong, but\nif you start to find something that you\n\n218\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.690\nbelieve is sketchy,\nout of the ordinary, and\n\n219\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.290\nyou go, I wonder if that's actually\nwhat I think it is here, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.610\nYou may turn those things on and\ntry and do the actual mathematics, but\n\n221\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.220\nthe math is easier with the relative\nnumbers, that's what we're gonna do,okay?\n\n222\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.890\nSo, how do I do something like that,\nwhere I go from this, and\n\n223\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.400\ngo okay, so\nwhat can I do with those numbers?\n\n224\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.150\nAnd how do I know if things are actually\nin the sequence that they need to be in?\n\n225\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.920\nThen I could go to,\nlet me make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n226\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.418\nStatistics, excuse me, I can't remember,\nStatistics up here at the top,\n\n227\n00:12:26.418 --> 00:12:31.240\nthen Flow Graph.\n\n228\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.220\nIf I select that,\nnow I'm going to just limit\n\n229\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.200\nus to TCP flows here, and\nlet's kind of zoom back in.\n\n230\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.130\nAnd let's pay attention just to the green,\nso let me see if I can zoom in on that\n\n231\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:49.086\nportion, is that gonna let me do it,\nthere we go, let's zoom in right here.\n\n232\n00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:54.837\nAll right, so\nthis doesn't really make much sense, but\n\n233\n00:12:54.837 --> 00:12:59.940\nhere is an actual initial idea of what's\ngoing on as we start seeing this.\n\n234\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.478\nAnd then if I go over here to the right\nhand side all the way over, you'll see\n\n235\n00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:09.259\nthe sequencing and this acknowledgement\nof what's happening over here too.\n\n236\n00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:14.258\nAll right, so Daniel, let's talk about\nthis idea of how the sequence numbers\n\n237\n00:13:14.258 --> 00:13:18.800\nare supposed to work, and\nhelp us out a little bit here too.\n\n238\n00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.450\nWe're gonna see that the sequence number\ndoesn't change too often because it's\n\n239\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.420\nthe relative numbers, but\nif we were to do the very real numbers,\n\n240\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.440\nthey'd change like crazy, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.350\nSo, when we first begin,\nusually, it begins with a zero,\n\n242\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.200\nit starts off with whatever\nthe lowest number actually is, okay.\n\n243\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.360\nSo for us,\nit's gonna begin with a zero, so\n\n244\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.560\nwe are sending across the initial\nsend bit right, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.780\nWell, the other side,\nwhen they have to, right,\n\n246\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.580\nthey have to acknowledge what they\nset they send it, so what do they do?\n\n247\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.100\nThey say, all right, I'm gonna\nacknowledge by changing mine to a 1,\n\n248\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.760\nokay, and sending a note,\nnow what is that about?\n\n249\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.830\nWell, they're saying here, when they also\nacknowledge, notice that they're also\n\n250\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.790\nsending their own first initial\nsynchronization as well, okay.\n\n251\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.244\nTheir own SYN, over here, so\nnotice they started on a 0 as well, okay,\n\n252\n00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.400\nwhen they sent back.\n\n253\n00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.980\nBut they've acknowledged that\nthey've received this first one.\n\n254\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.290\nWhen they do that, what happens then\nis that the originating computer,\n\n255\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:21.310\nwhat we're telling them is,\nI'm expecting your next value to be a 1.\n\n256\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:29.089\nOkay, so when you respond back to my ACK,\nyou should respond back with a 1.\n\n257\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:35.930\nSo it says, all right, I'm gonna show you\nthat I've changed my sequence to that 1,\n\n258\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:40.620\nso now I'm gonna acknowledge that I got\nyour SYN bit, which actually was a 0.\n\n259\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:48.270\nYour first one was a 0, so when you send\nback to me, you should also have a 1.\n\n260\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.960\nSo now it's saying, right you're\ntelling me I need to display a 1, I'm\n\n261\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.780\ngonna display a 1, I'm gonna acknowledge\nthat I got yours, which is fine.\n\n262\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.770\nSo that's where we got the SYN,\nthe SYN_ACK, and the ACK.\n\n263\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.040\nNotice that the numbers\nchange really quickly,\n\n264\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.638\nall of a sudden it went 204,\nwhat the heck is that about?\n\n265\n00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:09.020\nThis is where I have to scroll\nback here to the right, so\n\n266\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.980\nthat we can see something.\n\n267\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:16.580\nNotice after the ACK here,\nwe now get a PSH and\n\n268\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:22.120\nan ACK, and ACK says,\nwe've now said that we are in agreement.\n\n269\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:29.050\nI'm going to push 203 bits or\nwhatever it is, okay, 203 bits, 203 bytes,\n\n270\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:35.030\nI don't care, whatever the number actually\nis here, I'm gonna push this number over.\n\n271\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.719\nSo when I push that much data over to you,\nand you process it, so remember that we're\n\n272\n00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:46.503\non this line here, so let me scroll over,\nOkay, so it's acknowledging that,\n\n273\n00:15:46.503 --> 00:15:50.970\nand then when it actually sends that\ninformation, it's saying, all right.\n\n274\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.870\nSo here's what I'm expecting to\nsee from you which is a sequence\n\n275\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.785\nof 1 I'm acknowledging\nthough that I got 203.\n\n276\n00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:05.704\nNow, you're saying but Ronnie, that's 204.\n\n277\n00:16:05.704 --> 00:16:10.584\nThe reason why it's 204 is\nif we scroll back over here,\n\n278\n00:16:10.584 --> 00:16:16.772\nremember what's also sent along with that,\nwhich is this idea of an ACK.\n\n279\n00:16:16.772 --> 00:16:19.234\nSo it now added in what?\n\n280\n00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:21.596\n1 bit, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:25.543\nSo instead of 203, it adds in 204, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:25.543 --> 00:16:27.957\nAnd says, all right,\nI'm acknowledging that.\n\n283\n00:16:27.957 --> 00:16:30.876\nAnd then it is now sending back.\n\n284\n00:16:30.876 --> 00:16:36.605\nSo this is where you'll continue to see\nthose numbers rise and build up, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:36.605 --> 00:16:39.143\nThe reason why this is\nimportant is because if we\n\n286\n00:16:39.143 --> 00:16:42.638\nstart seeing regular patterns of this,\nthis is perfectly fine.\n\n287\n00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:47.875\nAnd as long as it actually fits,\nthe math fits, then we are good, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:52.084\nThe problem is, if you and I can see\nthat by using these simple numbers and\n\n289\n00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:54.642\ndoing something as regular as this, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:54.642 --> 00:17:00.086\nIt means other people can do that and\nnow imagine what happens here, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:04.222\nSo I want to at least get to that point\nand you can see how to do that, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:07.560\nSo let me go back simply\nhere to my diagram and\n\n293\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.438\nwe'll talk about this idea of section\nhijacking for a moment as well, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:17.091\nSo using that same logic that\nyou just saw, all right?\n\n295\n00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:18.942\nThat we just saw here Daniel, right?\n\n296\n00:17:18.942 --> 00:17:23.409\nThat we start that synchronization\nprocess in just the SYN app.\n\n297\n00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:28.702\nWhat if instead when I guess what the\nsequence that you're expecting to see and\n\n298\n00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:32.083\nI just use small numbers cuz it's easier,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:35.451\nAnd an attacker though instead sends\n\n300\n00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:40.454\nthe acknowledgement before\nthe real guy does, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:43.421\nHe can essentially take over what's next.\n\n302\n00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:48.158\nHe can start pushing data\njust like we saw that push.\n\n303\n00:17:48.158 --> 00:17:52.447\nSo if he can guess exactly what that is,\nthat's what happens, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:56.323\nAnd that's why it's important that\nthe numbers aren't exactly zeros and\n\n305\n00:17:56.323 --> 00:17:57.994\nones and so on that we can guess.\n\n306\n00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:58.598\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:03.026\n&gt;&gt; And even the old units, when used to\ndo it like an increments of like 128,000\n\n308\n00:18:03.026 --> 00:18:04.661\n&gt;&gt; Well, whatever it was that they gave.\n\n309\n00:18:04.661 --> 00:18:06.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It was just regular increments.\n\n310\n00:18:06.206 --> 00:18:08.938\nWell, after awhile people are like,\nthat's easy to get.\n\n311\n00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:14.097\nWell, now that's in that weird clock\ncycle of 4 hours and 55 minutes and then\n\n312\n00:18:14.097 --> 00:18:19.340\nalso every single little sliver of time\nis divided up into tens of micro seconds.\n\n313\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.549\nGood luck at guessing what\nthat [LAUGH] particular next\n\n314\n00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:27.298\nsequence is to jump in for\nsomething like this.\n\n315\n00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:28.215\nSo can it be done?\n\n316\n00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:30.199\nYes, people have done it.\n\n317\n00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:31.821\nBut not this guy.\n\n318\n00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:33.278\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not this one either.\n\n319\n00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.622\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n320\n00:18:34.622 --> 00:18:37.684\nthat's why it's a little bit\nharder to carry this out.\n\n321\n00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:40.863\nWith computers as quickly as\nthey're as they are now, right?\n\n322\n00:18:40.863 --> 00:18:43.638\nQuad-core machines on our laptops.\n\n323\n00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:48.907\nPeople doing this much, I mean it is\ninsane how fast these things are getting.\n\n324\n00:18:48.907 --> 00:18:54.573\nBut it requires them to be all to predict\nwhen that very first sequence happens,\n\n325\n00:18:54.573 --> 00:18:55.090\nokay?\n\n326\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.943\nNot by just working of of what\nthe second of third one that you get,\n\n327\n00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:02.953\nyou literally have to get the very\nfirst number that you began with.\n\n328\n00:19:02.953 --> 00:19:06.870\nAnd then from that point, figure out\nall the rest before you can jump in.\n\n329\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.691\nAnd by the point you figure out how\nto jump in, hopefully those tens of\n\n330\n00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:17.036\nmicroseconds have now turned into 20,\n30, 50, 6, 90 seconds.\n\n331\n00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:21.042\nGood luck at trying to figure all that\nstuff out in between as they continue to\n\n332\n00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:24.251\nsend data back and forth and\nnumbers continue to increment.\n\n333\n00:19:24.251 --> 00:19:30.141\nSo a little bit harder but it's not in the\nrealm of impossibility, but highly hard.\n\n334\n00:19:30.141 --> 00:19:30.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n335\n00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:31.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And very difficult.\n\n336\n00:19:31.955 --> 00:19:33.182\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably not most people's attack\n\n337\n00:19:33.182 --> 00:19:33.739\nvector of choice, right?\n\n338\n00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:38.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably not as easy as it\nonce was is what we want to get to.\n\n339\n00:19:38.246 --> 00:19:42.326\nBut you can see why this is\nkind of an important step for\n\n340\n00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:46.142\nus as we start to move through here and\ntake a look.\n\n341\n00:19:46.142 --> 00:19:49.561\nNow the other thing that I wanted to\npoint out as well, and it was something,\n\n342\n00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:51.604\nI don't know why I put\nit this way in my notes.\n\n343\n00:19:51.604 --> 00:19:53.788\nCuz it's probably cuz I was tired and\nI just needed to do that\n\n344\n00:19:53.788 --> 00:19:54.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:55.872\n&gt;&gt; But remember that just when we could go\n\n346\n00:19:55.872 --> 00:19:57.858\nwell why don't we kinda\nget away from this stuff.\n\n347\n00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:01.095\nIf it's really that, if there is so\nmany vulnerabilities,\n\n348\n00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:04.528\nbecause everything relies on\nthis idea of reliability, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:08.049\nRemember that like,\nlet me make sure I'm telling you that,\n\n350\n00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:11.166\nDNS zone transfer,\neven though DNS itself, right?\n\n351\n00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:15.422\nNormally uses UDP, but\nDNS zone transfer for\n\n352\n00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:19.120\nactive directory stuff, it uses TCP.\n\n353\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.769\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea for\nthat to be highly.\n\n354\n00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Reliable?\n\n355\n00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:22.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, reliable.\n\n356\n00:20:22.956 --> 00:20:25.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, to make sure\nthe other end is actually connecting,\n\n357\n00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:27.682\nthat's actually really good too.\n\n358\n00:20:27.682 --> 00:20:31.461\nSMB, HTTP like we talked about, SSL, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:36.451\nEven FTP, there's a lot of applications,\na lot of different things\n\n360\n00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:41.450\nthat we're using, utilities that\nwe're using that do rely on TCP.\n\n361\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.419\nSo, it's not going anywhere,\nit really isn't.\n\n362\n00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:47.891\nSo, it means that you and I as\nan analyst though would then need to be\n\n363\n00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:50.743\nable to understand not only\nwhat we're seeing there,\n\n364\n00:20:50.743 --> 00:20:52.982\nbut also some of these different attacks.\n\n365\n00:20:52.982 --> 00:20:54.382\nSo that high jacking,\n\n366\n00:20:54.382 --> 00:20:58.293\nas simplistic as the one that I\nshowed you in my little diagram.\n\n367\n00:20:58.293 --> 00:21:01.982\nIt can work out in reality,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n368\n00:21:01.982 --> 00:21:05.789\nSo let's just briefly talk about\nsome of these other ones here.\n\n369\n00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:08.182\nSo, notice that by using that sequence and\n\n370\n00:21:08.182 --> 00:21:11.113\nthat exchange of being able\nto predict that, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:11.113 --> 00:21:12.815\nThat is, also, key.\n\n372\n00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:16.340\nNow, there's another thing we also\nwanna point out what the port number,\n\n373\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.172\nsee I'm gonna do that just like\nI did in the previous episode.\n\n374\n00:21:19.172 --> 00:21:22.873\nAll right, so let's talk about this\nport number thing for a moment, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:27.505\nEven though zero is considered an actual\nreal port number in that well range\n\n376\n00:21:27.505 --> 00:21:30.307\nnumber, we should never see it used, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:30.307 --> 00:21:34.003\nSo it's real, but\nwe should never see it actually used.\n\n378\n00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:38.436\nAnytime you see zero as a port,\nas a source port or a destination port,\n\n379\n00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:41.529\nthat is going to be\nsomething that is anomalous.\n\n380\n00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:44.988\nAnd that normally means that\nsomebody has set it that way.\n\n381\n00:21:44.988 --> 00:21:49.254\nIt's not because your application or\nyour machine has done so, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:51.715\nAnd that is a good indicator, okay?.\n\n383\n00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:55.537\nIf somebody has set it to zero,\nit is on purpose and\n\n384\n00:21:55.537 --> 00:22:01.554\nit's not done by any other application or\nany other machine, and that is key.\n\n385\n00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:05.818\n&gt;&gt; So it's a clue to you that\nsomething nefarious may be going on.\n\n386\n00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:07.663\n&gt;&gt; It should be, okay?\n\n387\n00:22:07.663 --> 00:22:10.930\nIt should be something, because if you\ndo it, let's just say somebody on your\n\n388\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.662\nnetwork said, I'm gonna use port zero,\nthey shouldn't do it.\n\n389\n00:22:13.662 --> 00:22:14.271\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:22:14.271 --> 00:22:16.473\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it just should not be done.\n\n391\n00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:16.991\nCan they do it?\n\n392\n00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:18.046\nYes.\n\n393\n00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:18.633\nBut should they?\n\n394\n00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:19.255\nNo.\n\n395\n00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:23.521\nThis should be a clear indication that\nthere is something anomalous going on here\n\n396\n00:22:23.521 --> 00:22:25.725\nand you want to make\nsure that you do this.\n\n397\n00:22:25.725 --> 00:22:28.728\nThe other thing that\nyou'll also want to see,\n\n398\n00:22:28.728 --> 00:22:31.277\nlet me go back to our Kali machine here.\n\n399\n00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:32.721\nIt locked me out very quickly.\n\n400\n00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:33.798\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n401\n00:22:33.798 --> 00:22:35.392\n&gt;&gt; Now let me get back in here and\n\n402\n00:22:35.392 --> 00:22:38.593\nlet me go back to the regular\nflow of information, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:38.593 --> 00:22:41.066\nThat we can also see it.\n\n404\n00:22:41.066 --> 00:22:42.825\nLet's see here too.\n\n405\n00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:43.476\nThere it is.\n\n406\n00:22:43.476 --> 00:22:50.805\nI wanna get back to this idea of the\nsource port and everything as well, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:54.612\nSo if you see the idea of the source port,\nokay?\n\n408\n00:22:54.612 --> 00:22:58.278\nBeing, let me make sure I'm\ntelling you right, yeah,\n\n409\n00:22:58.278 --> 00:23:01.010\nthe same source port constantly, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.380\nWhen you start seeing something like that,\nwhere it's exact the same source port\n\n411\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.260\ngoing to the exact same exact machine\nmultiple times over again, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.756\nConstantly, then you may\nalso have another issue.\n\n413\n00:23:13.756 --> 00:23:15.823\nNotice that even in this one on the t,\n\n414\n00:23:15.823 --> 00:23:19.114\nI was trying to make sure I'm\nlining this up right, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:19.114 --> 00:23:20.401\nLet's see,\nlet's start off with that, right?\n\n416\n00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:22.494\nSo that won't work cuz that's so,\nall right, great.\n\n417\n00:23:22.494 --> 00:23:25.164\n443, yeah, it makes sense,\nhttps, secured http.\n\n418\n00:23:25.164 --> 00:23:27.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:31.943\n&gt;&gt; That one actually works for\nus and that's no big deal, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:35.430\nWe see the source IP address,\nwe see the source destination address.\n\n421\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.983\nThat's fine, but I shouldn't see\nthis combination again, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:46.006\nWhere I actually have the same source and\nthe same destination, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:46.006 --> 00:23:49.845\nWith exactly the same port number and\ndestination port number,\n\n424\n00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.701\nif it's actually doing that.\n\n425\n00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:54.381\nIf it's doing that multiple times,\nit's resending, And\n\n426\n00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.069\nthat's actually not incrementing\nthe way that it should.\n\n427\n00:23:57.069 --> 00:24:00.310\nThat actually is another indication\nthat something else is happening too.\n\n428\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.350\nSo, with that same source port\nbeing static in multiple times,\n\n429\n00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.070\nthat means that the tuples,\nthe five tuples that we talked.\n\n430\n00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:15.130\nSource, IP address,\nsource port Destination IP address,\n\n431\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.310\ndestination port number,\nthose should not be repeating.\n\n432\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.287\nCan you reuse port 443?\n\n433\n00:24:21.287 --> 00:24:22.499\nYes, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:22.499 --> 00:24:26.190\nCan you reuse port 14 if you want to?\n\n435\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.770\nSure, why not.\n\n436\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:27.800\nI mean what it is.\n\n437\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.230\nBut you kinda get the idea here.\n\n438\n00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.730\nThat source port shouldn't\nreally be static too often.\n\n439\n00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.674\nSo, when you start seeing that and\nthe same exact one all the time,\n\n440\n00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:42.139\nthat is when you start having\nsome of the issues that go on.\n\n441\n00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:45.728\nNow notice, you might saying like,\nI was trying to see if I had one.\n\n442\n00:24:45.728 --> 00:24:47.560\nThis is exactly identical.\n\n443\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.910\nSo here's the one I just showed you.\n\n444\n00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.450\nAnd notice right here on the top one,\nthat's one I wanna make sure of.\n\n445\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.427\nThis looks exactly identical.\n\n446\n00:24:56.427 --> 00:24:57.307\nRight?\n\n447\n00:24:57.307 --> 00:24:59.289\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSource IP and\n\n448\n00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:04.265\nnotice that the source port is the same.\n\n449\n00:25:04.265 --> 00:25:09.741\nIf I go down here, Destination Port is\nsame, does that mean something's wrong?\n\n450\n00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:12.125\nJust what I told you,\nabsolutely that's something wrong.\n\n451\n00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:17.910\nBut remember that it's about the tuple,\nis that the same as TCP, the same as TLS?\n\n452\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.370\n&gt;&gt; No it's not.\n&gt;&gt; No, so\n\n453\n00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.610\nas long as the tuple is different,\nwe're okay with it.\n\n454\n00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.130\nBut is the same one over and over again.\n\n455\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.470\nThat may indicate something else is going\non, that you probably don't want going on.\n\n456\n00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.490\nAnd so, those are again little tips\nof information that might help you\n\n457\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:42.270\nat least start to spot some of the stuff,\nthat could be damaging as well.\n\n458\n00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.919\nAlso, if you end up seeing something like\na sim scan, with a source port increment.\n\n459\n00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:52.949\nSo not that it changes randomly,\nwhich is what we normally expect.\n\n460\n00:25:52.949 --> 00:25:57.924\nBut you start seeing where we got 49152,\n49153.\n\n461\n00:25:57.924 --> 00:25:58.654\n&gt;&gt; The source port?\n\n462\n00:25:58.654 --> 00:25:59.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:25:59.757 --> 00:26:05.050\n49154, were increment but the destination\nport turns out to be a zero.\n\n464\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.680\nThen you have an issue at that point.\n\n465\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.690\nWe should never see a destination\nport of zero anyways.\n\n466\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.720\nWhat we're normally seeing at that point,\nis somebody is trying to elicit some type\n\n467\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.140\nof response that's gonna reset\neverything is what's gonna happen.\n\n468\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.710\n&gt;&gt; So the source port of the attacking\nbox is incrementing, and\n\n469\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.330\nthe destination of the box you're\ntrying to scan is always zero?\n\n470\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah on the destination port of zero.\n\n471\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.330\nYeah, when you do something like that,\nthat is actually trying to indicate that\n\n472\n00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.540\nthey're trying to restart something,\nthey're trying to do something,\n\n473\n00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.250\nthey're trying to trigger\nsomething else to happen.\n\n474\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.440\nIt does test if the host is live which is\nwhat it want to, but if they're constantly\n\n475\n00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.590\nsending something to zero port,\nthey're they're trying to reset something.\n\n476\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Got you, that's what is happening.\n\n477\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.370\nSo yeah we had one but it is.\n\n478\n00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.402\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Out there, okay.\n\n479\n00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:55.163\nThe one of course is what we\ntalked about a little earlier.\n\n480\n00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:57.470\nThe idea of the checksums.\n\n481\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.080\nRemember that we can't rely\non those devices in between,\n\n482\n00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.360\nto save us on this checksums.\n\n483\n00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.270\nIt is only at the destination device.\n\n484\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.770\nIf something like that going to happen.\n\n485\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:13.690\nSo, it could be where that malicious\nattack really is there, but\n\n486\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.010\nthe great thing is, the checksum changed,\nand when you calculate, go, no,\n\n487\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:17.800\nlet's go ahead and drop it.\n\n488\n00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.210\nThat's a good thing.\n\n489\n00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.950\nBut it also starts to indicate\nthat they've got that far,\n\n490\n00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.850\nsomething else you may have to\nkind of go and check, as well.\n\n491\n00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.770\nSo just be careful on these reliances.\n\n492\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.758\nWe already saw in ICMP, right?\n\n493\n00:27:31.758 --> 00:27:34.085\nThe idea that checksums error,\nor we did an IP.\n\n494\n00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:37.359\nI can't remember which one we did, where\nI showed you where you could actually\n\n495\n00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:39.860\nchange those numbers, and\nyou're going are you joking?\n\n496\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.960\nNo I wasn't joking, you could\nactually get the right exact one,\n\n497\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.710\nbut that's why we rely on this one.\n\n498\n00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.465\nThis one is actually much more granular\nand protects us a little bit more.\n\n499\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.120\nSo once we get that down, and\n\n500\n00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.280\njust understand some of those basic\ntypes of attacks that are there.\n\n501\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.720\nRemember that all this is gonna\nbe shown in those headers.\n\n502\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.635\nPay attention when you get ready for\nthe exam,\n\n503\n00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:04.415\nmake sure you pay\nattention to those flags.\n\n504\n00:28:04.415 --> 00:28:08.850\nI don't know how else to tell you this,\nyou've got to know and understand what's\n\n505\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.597\nbeing set those two flags or\nwhether it's one or whether it might be.\n\n506\n00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:16.970\nThe sequence numbers are also\na big key to what it is.\n\n507\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.030\nOnce again, I can't tell you what's on\nthe exam but the idea of you going,\n\n508\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:27.310\nyou think somebody is trying to do this\nand inserting this weird number in here.\n\n509\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.600\nAnd you calculate just what I showed you\na little bit and is not working out,\n\n510\n00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:37.950\nthat kinda you know somebody is trying to\nhijack that, and it's just not working.\n\n511\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.190\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we should be able to spot.\n\n512\n00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.910\nLearning those five tuples,\nkey in helping you out.\n\n513\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.200\nRemember that each tuple, and\n\n514\n00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.670\nevery time that you make that connection,\nit has to be unique.\n\n515\n00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:55.260\nWe can have the same source, IP address,\nsame destination IP address, same source\n\n516\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.640\nport, same destination port, but the\nprotocol is different, we're still okay.\n\n517\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.190\nThat's the one that if I\nthink anything is tricky,\n\n518\n00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.000\nthat one was the one that would go.\n\n519\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.980\nNo, yeah, that's the one that would go.\n\n520\n00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was very, because it's\njust the opposite of what I've normally\n\n521\n00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.860\nworked with, when I do SYN scans.\n\n522\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.510\nIt's typically,\nyou have the attacking machine and\n\n523\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.040\nit's looking for each port that's open.\n\n524\n00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.030\nIt does that by sending a SYN.\n\n525\n00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.710\nIf it gets an acknowledgement,\nand then knows the port is open.\n\n526\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.700\nIt doesn't complete the handshake,\nmoves on the next port.\n\n527\n00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.670\nSo it's very backwards is what\nI'm typically used to seeing.\n\n528\n00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n529\n00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.120\nAnd I understand that.\n\n530\n00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.574\nBut those are some of the things,\nmake sure you pay attention.\n\n531\n00:29:37.915 --> 00:29:40.475\nThink about using Wireshark,\nif you haven't been using Wireshark.\n\n532\n00:29:41.535 --> 00:29:43.625\nThat's also gonna be key for us as well.\n\n533\n00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:45.865\n&gt;&gt; Kind of the bread and\nbutter in this whole thing, isn't it?\n\n534\n00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:47.055\n&gt;&gt; It really is key.\n\n535\n00:29:47.055 --> 00:29:49.925\nWe're gonna also start seeing\nsomething in security onion,\n\n536\n00:29:49.925 --> 00:29:52.305\nwhich is gonna introduce\nus to a couple more tools.\n\n537\n00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:53.915\nBut being able to work with Wireshark,\n\n538\n00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:57.730\nis a key aspect of what you'll also\nbe facing on the exam, as well.\n\n539\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.640\nSo getting ready to do all this,\nmake sure you pay attention there\n\n540\n00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.900\nas you start seeing the scans,\nthat's what we wanna be able to do.\n\n541\n00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.230\nAll right Daniel,\nthere's a little bit more to go on UDP but\n\n542\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.555\nI once again apparently\nchallenged the clock and won.\n\n543\n00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:11.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here it is, so\n\n544\n00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.290\napparently we're gonna\ndo a part three here.\n\n545\n00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem Ronnie, we're enjoying,\nit's been Good times had by all so far.\n\n546\n00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.310\nSo let the revelries\ncontinue in our Part 3.\n\n547\n00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.220\nAll right, Ronnie, thanks for\njoining us today, though.\n\n548\n00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.670\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n549\n00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.220\nBut as the man has said,\nwe are done for this episode.\n\n550\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.770\nCome on back for that Part 3, though.\n\n551\n00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.320\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n552\n00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:31.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n553\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.889\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:30:34.889 --> 00:30:40.857\n[MUSIC]\n\n555\n00:30:40.857 --> 00:30:44.314\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.476\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.137\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:14.217\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:17.016\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.217\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are coming back at\n\n8\n00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:23.762\nyou with more and\nour Cisco Cyber Ops series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.902\nAnd joining us back in studio, yet\nagain, you know him, the man, the myth,\n\n10\n00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:28.617\nthe legend.\n\n11\n00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:29.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think he's actually a chicken\n\n12\n00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:30.338\nwing by this point.\n\n13\n00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:32.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's eaten so many of them,\n\n14\n00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.711\nI've seen it first hand,\nit's incredible to watch.\n\n15\n00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.427\nOur good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n16\n00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:39.165\n&gt;&gt; Well, I do love chicken wings, so-\n&gt;&gt; He does love chicken wings.\n\n17\n00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:43.528\n&gt;&gt; So I am good today, Daniel, thank you\nagain for having me back on the show,\n\n18\n00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:47.706\nas we complete the idea here of taking\na look at some layer four headers.\n\n19\n00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:50.872\nWe've got a little bit of more information\nto go, and we've gotta talk about,\n\n20\n00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:51.876\nof course, UDP as well.\n\n21\n00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:56.789\nSo let's jump right into it, and make sure\nthat we understand just a few more things\n\n22\n00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.908\nthat we need to take a look at, too.\n\n23\n00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:02.212\nSo last thing we were talking about,\nof course,\n\n24\n00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.448\nin our part two of this\nlittle miniseries here.\n\n25\n00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:08.640\nWe were talking about some of\nthe different attacks that we may see,\n\n26\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.339\nand I want to mention just\na couple more before we move on.\n\n27\n00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:15.726\nAnd also, a couple of things that I forgot\nto mention in those previous episodes as\n\n28\n00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.453\nwell, so this will help us out.\n\n29\n00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:21.846\nLet's take a look on my screen here, okay,\nwe've talked about session hijacking,\n\n30\n00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:23.628\nso I'm not so worried about that.\n\n31\n00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:26.745\nBut here's the reset idea that I\nleft off with, remember, Daniel,\n\n32\n00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.100\nI was telling you that, hey.\n\n33\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.425\nIf you start getting this idea where you\ncontinue incrementing on your side, but\n\n34\n00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.542\nthe [CROSSTALK] zero,\nsomething like this can happen, but\n\n35\n00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.722\nit shouldn't happen too often, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:42.240\nIf it does, it's because somebody is\ntrying to reset something at the other\n\n37\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.142\nend, so\nhere there is what is called a TCP reset.\n\n38\n00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:48.140\nSo if you start off with\njust a three way handshake,\n\n39\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.095\nremember that what should end up happening\nis that the acknowledgment should show,\n\n40\n00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:57.658\nat least even after the first one, that\nI got the SYN which normally says a 1.\n\n41\n00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:02.474\nThat's what I'm sending you back is a 1,\nbut if someway somehow, okay,\n\n42\n00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:06.145\nwhat has actually happened is,\nI don't send that back,\n\n43\n00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.909\nthat means that I have\nto start over again.\n\n44\n00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.688\nOkay, and\nthat means that whoever the originating\n\n45\n00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:15.706\nsender is just continues to resend,\nhe didn't get my last message.\n\n46\n00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:19.062\nSo I'm not gonna continue,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and reset and\n\n47\n00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:20.295\nstart that over again.\n\n48\n00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:24.719\nSo when this ends up going on,\nthis is when we start having some issues.\n\n49\n00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.498\nAnytime you actually set like the sequence\nback to zero for one reason or another,\n\n50\n00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:31.643\nyou're just telling them,\nI'm not ready for anything to happen.\n\n51\n00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:35.224\nAnd that idea of resetting\neverything is kind of a,\n\n52\n00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:39.324\nthe result is a denial of service,\nis what happens, too.\n\n53\n00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:41.909\nSo even using a SYN scan,\nif somebody's trying to do that,\n\n54\n00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.649\nthey're trying to disconnect, especially\nif somebody is using the ports, right?\n\n55\n00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.754\nThey're just trying to go, let's just go\nahead and see how many of these we can hit\n\n56\n00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:53.460\nand see what happens too, so not exactly\nthe harshest thing in the world.\n\n57\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.934\nA lot of times those applications and\neven firewalls start to drop these things\n\n58\n00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:02.365\nimmediately, once they start to see it,\ntoo, so we don't see a lot of that.\n\n59\n00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:06.402\nBut synth-leading is a big one, so\nmy diagram is not the best, but\n\n60\n00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:08.001\nyou kind of get this idea.\n\n61\n00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.779\nThe attacker essentially spoofs\nwhoever the real guy is, so\n\n62\n00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.789\nhere's the real person,\nsupposed to be sending traffic here.\n\n63\n00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.764\nBut let's say that the attacker\nspoofs his IP address, okay,\n\n64\n00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:23.889\nsends all those SYN messages that\nare supposed to be spoofed, and\n\n65\n00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.740\nnow nobody's actually really responding.\n\n66\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.150\nSo he sends a SYN-ACK, well, what's\nsupposed to happen in the third part?\n\n67\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.162\nHe's supposed to reply back with ACK,\nokay, so there you go,\n\n68\n00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:37.585\nyou now have that idea of\nthe flooding that can occur.\n\n69\n00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:42.144\nAnd now you have a connection that is\npretty much open and they are just and\n\n70\n00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:43.353\nthey are waiting.\n\n71\n00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:48.311\nWhile they're waiting, other people can't\nactually respond or can't do anything and\n\n72\n00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.370\nthat's where you also see that too.\n\n73\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.907\nAnd the reason why this\nis actually a good one,\n\n74\n00:03:52.907 --> 00:03:55.324\nas far as what we're talking about, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:59.729\nWhen jumping to UDP you're gonna see that\nthere is only one form of attack here,\n\n76\n00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.821\nwhich is some type of flooding attack,\nis what we normally end up seeing.\n\n77\n00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.114\nThat's pretty much it about that, but\nwe'll take at the headers in a moment and\n\n78\n00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.690\nthen we'll also talk\nabout a few other things.\n\n79\n00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.375\nNow, there's only one last thing I\nwanted to say back on the headers,\n\n80\n00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.635\nwhich as I looked over my notes, I forgot.\n\n81\n00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:21.199\nThere are certain combinations of\nthese flags, okay, and there's only\n\n82\n00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.704\nreally one that I want to point out here,\nokay, that you should not see.\n\n83\n00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:30.354\nWe know that we can see a SYN and\nan ACK flag set, okay, that make sense?\n\n84\n00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:33.099\nBecause that's about the second part\nof the handshake, we can see that.\n\n85\n00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.672\nBut the one that we should not see is,\n\n86\n00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:42.328\nyou shouldn't see the SYN and\nthe FIN set at the same time.\n\n87\n00:04:42.328 --> 00:04:47.249\nIf you do, this is actually\na real violation of RFC 793, now,\n\n88\n00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.079\nthat doesn't mean that the RFC\npolice are gonna come after you,\n\n89\n00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.853\nbut it lets you know what,\nthis should not occur.\n\n90\n00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.091\n&gt;&gt; It's abomination before [INAUDIBLE].\n\n91\n00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:58.374\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:58.374 --> 00:04:59.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n93\n00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:00.484\nyou will be stricken [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:05.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, but it does, right, that should be\n\n95\n00:05:05.552 --> 00:05:11.584\nkind of a red flag to you that hey, why\nwould anybody ever set a SYN and a FIN?\n\n96\n00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:15.050\nThe only reason to do that is to kind of\ngo, all right, I don't care if we're gonna\n\n97\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.172\nsynchronize, but we're gonna just\nsay it's finished immediately, so\n\n98\n00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:19.609\nthat you can essentially reset.\n\n99\n00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:23.723\nSo why not just use the reset\nflag is what should happen, but\n\n100\n00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:27.193\nthose two should not be set\nat the same exact time.\n\n101\n00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:32.277\n&gt;&gt; I know in nmap, they encourage you\nto play around with these flags and\n\n102\n00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:35.793\nas you attempt to enumerate\na certain machine.\n\n103\n00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:38.913\nAnd sometimes certain flag\ncombinations don't give you anything.\n\n104\n00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:42.330\nBut just getting crazy with them\nsometimes can elicit a good\n\n105\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.379\nresponse out of the machine,\nletting you know that port is open.\n\n106\n00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.436\nAll my other attempts are just being\nmasked behind some sort of rules,\n\n107\n00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:52.450\nso playing with these can happen.\n\n108\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.106\nSo if you see SYN and FIN put together,\n\n109\n00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:59.681\nmaybe it was someone crafting\nan nmap scan to illicit a response.\n\n110\n00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:04.694\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is not someone crafting it,\nin theory, in a very small,\n\n111\n00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:08.991\nsmall, tiny,\natomic theory that's out there, okay,\n\n112\n00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:15.188\nit could be data corruption that has\ncaused this thing to, right, it's one bit.\n\n113\n00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:19.900\nI'm not saying you can't lose a bit\nhere or there, but at the same time,\n\n114\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.988\nit's so\nsmall in which you're saying, wait,\n\n115\n00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:27.878\nthis is happening during the midst of\nthese other things that are going on.\n\n116\n00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:32.799\nIt seems to be more than just missing a\nbit, it seems to be some type of something\n\n117\n00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:37.443\ncrafted, and that's the idea that\nthat's trying to be put across here.\n\n118\n00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:41.407\nSo when you see unusual flag\ncombinations like Daniel was saying,\n\n119\n00:06:41.407 --> 00:06:46.287\nthis is something we shouldn't be dealing\nwith too much, so, okay, as well, so\n\n120\n00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:48.517\nwhat in the world fixes a lot of this?\n\n121\n00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:51.377\nAuthentication is what\nfixes a lot of this, right,\n\n122\n00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:55.935\nverifying that this is who the originator\nis, and who the sender is supposed to be.\n\n123\n00:06:55.935 --> 00:07:00.223\nDoing that idea of the two way mutual\nauthentication really does help,\n\n124\n00:07:00.223 --> 00:07:04.589\nbecause that way, you know somebody\nelse is not hijacking the session.\n\n125\n00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:06.300\nThey're not sending these floods,\n\n126\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.236\ncuz you're not actually\nestablishing that authentication.\n\n127\n00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:13.819\nIt just makes sense to do something\nlike that, now, it is a lot more set up.\n\n128\n00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.520\nYou do have to do a lot more things to\nmake that ready to go as well, all right.\n\n129\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.211\nNow let's move to our final\ntopic here if I can get to it,\n\n130\n00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.002\nlook how exciting this is, Daniel.\n\n131\n00:07:22.002 --> 00:07:24.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you believe it?\n\n132\n00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:27.788\n&gt;&gt; Man that's a lot of headers to\nmemorize, I don't know if they can do it,\n\n133\n00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:28.546\nRonnie [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.792\n&gt;&gt; Well after all the ones\nthat we've gone through,\n\n135\n00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:32.672\nit's probably just kind of this, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:37.283\nSo what is the difference here\nbetween what we see in TCP versus UDP?\n\n137\n00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:40.770\nThe great thing about this\nas far as a primer goes,\n\n138\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.854\nit's easier to understand versus the TCP.\n\n139\n00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:46.745\nRemember, in TCP,\nboth sides have to be connected,\n\n140\n00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:50.812\nhave to agree that they're gonna connect,\nthey have to be synchronized.\n\n141\n00:07:50.812 --> 00:07:54.103\nOne side's gonna send, one side gonna\nreceive, that's what has to happen.\n\n142\n00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:59.136\nIn this one, all Daniel has to say is,\ngive me, and I don't even have-\n\n143\n00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.224\n&gt;&gt; Turn on the fire hose, Ronnie.\n\n144\n00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:04.036\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to find who is there,\nI don't even have to actually go sure,\n\n145\n00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:05.954\nit's just like- here you go [LAUGH].\n\n146\n00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:10.525\nThat's it, it's not exactly\nare hard them to understand.\n\n147\n00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:13.409\n&gt;&gt; And even if the door's shut,\ndoesn't matter, here it comes anyway,\n\n148\n00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.007\nit's gonna pile up on the welcome mat.\n\n149\n00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:19.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just there,\nit just sends and sends and sends, and\n\n150\n00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:21.995\nonce you actually say gimme, it does that.\n\n151\n00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:26.904\nIt probably don't technically say gimme,\nbut you kinda get the idea, as soon as you\n\n152\n00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:31.971\nrequest it, the response is there, so it's\nmuch quicker, so why don't we use this?\n\n153\n00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:36.202\nBecause a lot of other things really\ndo require the idea of the reliability,\n\n154\n00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:38.051\nas well as need the flow control,\n\n155\n00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.312\nas well as need the ability to\nput things back in sequence.\n\n156\n00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:45.721\nIf, so if you watch movies,\nthey talk about, especially in,\n\n157\n00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:48.730\nI don't why I like legal dramas, but I do.\n\n158\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.774\nThey talk about this idea of,\n\n159\n00:08:50.774 --> 00:08:55.212\nhere's this one piece of information\nthat would really help the defense,\n\n160\n00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:59.449\nlet's send them everything, and\nthey send them a truckload of boxes.\n\n161\n00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:00.392\n&gt;&gt; It's in there.\n\n162\n00:09:00.392 --> 00:09:04.805\n&gt;&gt; It's in there, okay, well,\nthat's what would happen with UDP.\n\n163\n00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:11.007\nThe key is in there to how all this stuff\ngoes back together, but you figure it out.\n\n164\n00:09:11.007 --> 00:09:14.006\nThere's not even a key,\nyou're just getting it, and so\n\n165\n00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.515\nthat's where UDP comes in.\n\n166\n00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:18.695\nSo we can see why,\nthe way that Daniel described it,\n\n167\n00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:22.837\nwe can see why UDP flooding is kind\nof the real big attack here [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.462\n&gt;&gt; It's UDP is a little easy to do, you\njust turn on the hose and let it happen.\n\n169\n00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:29.997\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much it, so\nthese particular types of floods,\n\n170\n00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:33.162\nyou do that, and you might go,\nall right, so how bad is it?\n\n171\n00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:36.280\nIt can be really bad if you\nhave enough of this, but\n\n172\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.003\ndo understand that UDP flooding\nis pretty much the big one.\n\n173\n00:09:40.003 --> 00:09:44.173\nNow are there a couple of other things\nthat I wanna point out, yes, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:48.782\nOne, take a look at the source port here,\nokay, on UDP especially,\n\n175\n00:09:48.782 --> 00:09:52.928\nit doesn't mean that it always\nhas to happen this way, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:57.672\nBut it really depends on the application\nthat you're using, usually,\n\n177\n00:09:57.672 --> 00:10:00.872\nthe source port is one of\nthose ephemeral ports.\n\n178\n00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:04.729\nHey, look,\na term I just brought up out of the blue,\n\n179\n00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.615\nan ephemeral port,\nmake sure you understand that.\n\n180\n00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:11.506\nOkay, so these source ports\nshould not be the dynamic ones,\n\n181\n00:10:11.506 --> 00:10:13.615\nnormally are not also\nthe well known ports.\n\n182\n00:10:13.615 --> 00:10:17.682\nCan it be, yes, but\nnormally those are ephemeral ports,\n\n183\n00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:23.326\nwhen we start talking about, so\nanything above 1023 is what we're seeing.\n\n184\n00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:28.572\nAlso along with this, of course,\nis that since you also have layer three,\n\n185\n00:10:28.572 --> 00:10:32.319\nremember that this also goes\ninto part of that tuple,\n\n186\n00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:35.504\ntuple, whatever we wanna call it, as well.\n\n187\n00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:38.941\nYou still need unique tuples\nthroughout this if you're also going to\n\n188\n00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:41.498\nmake sure that this ends\nup working as well, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:41.498 --> 00:10:44.446\nThe other thing, of course,\nis the way that ICMP works with this.\n\n190\n00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:50.345\nYou have a couple of things that can\ntell you something is going right and\n\n191\n00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.535\ngoing wrong.\n\n192\n00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:55.151\nIf your destination normally responds with\n\n193\n00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:59.945\na port unreachable message\nto a non-listening UDP port.\n\n194\n00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:01.591\nIn other words,\nif you get a port unreachable,\n\n195\n00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:03.168\nand that's what we're expecting, right.\n\n196\n00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:05.934\nThe port's not on, we get a port\nunreachable, something like that.\n\n197\n00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:09.254\nThat actually tells us something, but\nwhat if you don't get that message?\n\n198\n00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:13.194\nWhat if you do the regular thing\nthat you do, as far as a ping goes,\n\n199\n00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:16.575\nand it's supposed to be a UDP\nport that you ping, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:20.580\nAnd you don't get a port unreachable,\nwhat does that tell you?\n\n201\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.780\nWe know that the port unreachable,\nthough, says what?\n\n202\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.906\nIt's closed, it's not open, but\nwhat if you don't get that response?\n\n203\n00:11:27.906 --> 00:11:29.287\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's being firewalled.\n\n204\n00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:31.507\n&gt;&gt; Firewalled, okay, or\nit could just be open.\n\n205\n00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:34.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's not supposed\nto respond if it's open, right?\n\n206\n00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:37.449\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not supposed to respond,\nso the absence of the response,\n\n207\n00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:40.397\nunlike what I would think,\nI should get something coming back.\n\n208\n00:11:40.397 --> 00:11:42.561\nNo, it's the absence of\nthe response that says,\n\n209\n00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.131\nyou might not get anything back in that\nway, depending on what you actually need.\n\n210\n00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:49.201\nBut it can be that false positive,\nbecause of what you were talking about,\n\n211\n00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:49.845\nthe firewall.\n\n212\n00:11:49.845 --> 00:11:54.674\n&gt;&gt; So just be aware of certain things\nlike that, too, so if you're an attacker,\n\n213\n00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:57.761\nif you're on the red team and\ngo, look, I got in!\n\n214\n00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:02.729\nYou may [LAUGH], or you may have just hit\nthe biggest firewall you've even seen.\n\n215\n00:12:02.729 --> 00:12:06.530\nAnd now the rest of your life, you're\ngonna go, why couldn't I get in, no,\n\n216\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.240\nnot really, but\nyou'll kind of get that idea, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.565\nAlso, there is another one here, okay,\n\n218\n00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.563\nthe length field is going to be important,\nokay?\n\n219\n00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:20.493\nTheoretically, the length field here,\nfor one reason or another,\n\n220\n00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:24.083\nthe maximum length, 65,515,\nI had to write that down,\n\n221\n00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:29.187\nbecause I was thinking 536, that should\nmake sense, because it's a 16 bit field.\n\n222\n00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:34.641\nBut theoretically,\nthe maximum length here is 65,515,\n\n223\n00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:37.268\nnot that that matters so much.\n\n224\n00:12:37.268 --> 00:12:42.181\nIt's close enough to 65,536 that\nit really doesn't matter, but\n\n225\n00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:45.413\nif you start to get in\nhere in the 16 bit field.\n\n226\n00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:50.982\nOkay, it should never be any\nlonger than 65,536 anyways, but\n\n227\n00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:56.853\nwhat they're saying is it's longer\nthan 16 all the way through 35.\n\n228\n00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:58.775\nIt may also indicate a compromise,\n\n229\n00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.470\nsomething else has happened here as well,\nokay?\n\n230\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:07.572\nMost applications that use UDP tend\nto limit the length field here.\n\n231\n00:13:07.572 --> 00:13:09.928\nSo this is not everybody, but\n\n232\n00:13:09.928 --> 00:13:15.687\nthe majority of the application is\nlimited to about 8,092 or less.\n\n233\n00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:20.413\nSo if you now take that into\nconsideration, anything above, let's say,\n\n234\n00:13:20.413 --> 00:13:25.073\n10,000 then might be considered\nout of the range of normal, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:29.959\nAnd that might also indicate to you\nsomething else is also going on as well.\n\n236\n00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:35.967\nSo those are key information that we\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n237\n00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:39.364\nThis is a little bit more\nunusual inside of IP, okay,\n\n238\n00:13:39.364 --> 00:13:43.588\nwe did take a look where we saw that\nthere was actually a checksum for\n\n239\n00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:48.364\nthe header, and there was a checksum for\nthe data in the IP headers, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:48.364 --> 00:13:51.539\nNotice that in UDP,\nit does it both, but at one time,\n\n241\n00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.669\nit combines everything together.\n\n242\n00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:56.574\nThat's because it doesn't want to\nslow down and do anything else.\n\n243\n00:13:56.574 --> 00:13:59.760\nBut this one we're not really\nconcerned about too much, but\n\n244\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.072\nall the rest that we've just talked here,\nall those are elements that we should be\n\n245\n00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:07.285\nable to look out for and\nunderstand in terms of the analysis.\n\n246\n00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:11.600\nAnd the idea of UDP vulnerabilities\nthat we might have to face, so\n\n247\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.959\nthose are just some of the key ones.\n\n248\n00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:18.355\nThis one is probably not as big as\nfar as just the general concepts go.\n\n249\n00:14:18.355 --> 00:14:21.394\nBut when we get into,\nlike I said a little a bit later on,\n\n250\n00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:24.393\nwhen we start using DNS and\ngetting some records back.\n\n251\n00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:27.626\nRemember, all that comes through UDP,\nwe're gonna see there's other\n\n252\n00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:30.761\nvulnerabilities that are there that\nwe also want to pay attention to.\n\n253\n00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:34.147\nAnd that's where the length field\nis going to really kind of play\n\n254\n00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:36.903\nwith us a little bit and\nplay a little bit of havoc, so\n\n255\n00:14:36.903 --> 00:14:39.557\nthat's what we'll actually\ntake a look at then.\n\n256\n00:14:39.557 --> 00:14:42.157\nBut, Daniel, at this particular point,\n\n257\n00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:45.344\nthis is something a little bit unusual for\nme to say.\n\n258\n00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:49.796\nBut I am done with the layer\nfour headers here, and\n\n259\n00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:53.925\nI didn't actually run the clock out-\n&gt;&gt; You didn't.\n\n260\n00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:55.052\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not.\n\n261\n00:14:55.052 --> 00:14:55.552\n&gt;&gt; Wow, man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:14:55.552 --> 00:14:56.555\n&gt;&gt; Surprises me every day,\n\n263\n00:14:56.555 --> 00:14:59.097\nyou never know what you're gonna\nget with Mr. Wong over here.\n\n264\n00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:02.121\nWell, it's perfectly fine, we've taken TCP\n\n265\n00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:06.727\nheaders, we've looked at UDP headers,.\nThere are a lot of things that we\n\n266\n00:15:06.727 --> 00:15:09.427\nneed to ruminate in before\nwe move on to our next\n\n267\n00:15:09.427 --> 00:15:11.984\ntask anyway.\nSo Ronnie, having a bit of a respite is\n\n268\n00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:16.193\nprobably a good idea at this point.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's just remember, right, in\n\n269\n00:15:16.193 --> 00:15:21.528\npreparing for the exam, Daniel it sounds,\njust the upsides we've done on headers,\n\n270\n00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:26.484\noverwhelming, it sounds like it can be.\n&gt;&gt; But if you just take a little bit of\n\n271\n00:15:26.484 --> 00:15:31.350\ntime and put yourself in that regular\nstudy habit and that schedule.\n\n272\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.660\nJust every day do a little bit, again,\n\n273\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.420\nhour, hour and a half, whatever it might\nbe, just a little bit, that compounds\n\n274\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.016\nthe learning that you'll get.\nYou can do six hours at a time if\n\n275\n00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:44.154\nyou're that machine-\n&gt;&gt; Not the best idea.\n\n276\n00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:46.278\n&gt;&gt; Not Ronnie, hour and a half, I'm done,\n\n277\n00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.690\nand then I'll put that away.\nBut next day, when I come back to it,\n\n278\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.373\nit'll be fresh in my mind and\nI'm ready to go again.\n\n279\n00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:54.309\nTake some time to learn about this,\n\n280\n00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:57.092\nspend more time in Wireshark,\ntake a look at that.\n\n281\n00:15:57.092 --> 00:15:58.661\nThat's really gonna help you out,\n\n282\n00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:02.269\nwhatever you actually end up seeing,\nwhether you're preparing for the exam, or\n\n283\n00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:05.217\nas you're hired on as an analyst\nat a security operations center.\n\n284\n00:16:05.217 --> 00:16:07.015\n&gt;&gt; All right, good words, Ronnie,\n\n285\n00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:10.270\ngood ideas and wise thoughts.\nThank you for joining us again, but\n\n286\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:15.100\nlike you said, we're done, we're good.\nWe are not done with the SecOp series,\n\n287\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.998\nwe're done with this little portion of it,\nso come back for more.\n\n288\n00:16:19.998 --> 00:16:21.375\nThere will be more shows, but\n\n289\n00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:24.515\nthat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off, for ITProTV,\n\n290\n00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:27.347\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n291\n00:16:27.347 --> 00:16:28.314\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n292\n00:16:28.314 -->

--> 00:00:16.514\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:20.323\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue with Cisco Secops.\n\n8\n00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:22.094\nIn this episode, HTTP headers and\n\n9\n00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:26.442\nthe person bringing us all the information\nwe need is the one, the only Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.184\nRonnie, great to work with you again,\ngood to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:31.484\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\non the show, Zach, and thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:34.298\nallowing me to come and\ntalk about HTTP headers a little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:38.219\nAs we continue on taking a look at cyber\nops and the idea here, of course, of\n\n14\n00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.644\nworking on security operation center, one\nof the things that we are talking about,\n\n15\n00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:45.046\nof course, is well, intrusion detection.\n\n16\n00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.578\nAnd the ability, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:50.025\nto analyze some of the information\nthat comes across our screens.\n\n18\n00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:54.607\nAnd well, understanding HTTP\npatterns is gonna be a big one for\n\n19\n00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:57.556\nus that we just need to be familiar with.\n\n20\n00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.722\nSo we're gonna take a look, of course,\n\n21\n00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:04.013\nat making sure we can identify some of\nthe information we find in those headers.\n\n22\n00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:08.573\nAs well as talk about the vulnerabilities\nthat we're likely to discover as we're\n\n23\n00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:10.697\nlooking at some of that information.\n\n24\n00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:14.890\nAnd of course we'll show you an example\nof that type of vulnerabilities, and\n\n25\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.322\nthe information as well.\n\n26\n00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:20.706\nUsing a lab that we've got set up here\nto make sure that we run through it and\n\n27\n00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.772\nthat we can see what we need to see.\n\n28\n00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:27.359\nSo it's very important as\nan analyst then that we have a good\n\n29\n00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.134\nfundamental understanding of\nthe networking concepts, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:36.192\nespecially the idea here\nof working HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n31\n00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:40.566\nThe reason why right is the majority of\nwhat we do today in Web browsing, right,\n\n32\n00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.616\ngoes out to the Internet and we can\nconnect our machines to a Web browser and\n\n33\n00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:46.664\nthen they send us information back.\n\n34\n00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:49.835\nAnd that means there's a connection there\nthat we need to be able to monitor and\n\n35\n00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.190\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n36\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.109\nCuz if we don't, this is where\nan attacker will find that ability\n\n37\n00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.901\nto discover all the vulnerabilities that\nare already and take advantage of it.\n\n38\n00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.627\nAnd then on our end, we don't know\nit's happening or we're actually so\n\n39\n00:02:03.627 --> 00:02:07.720\nunsuspecting of it because we don't even\nknow how to identify that an attack has\n\n40\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.573\nhappened that we can learn from it.\n\n41\n00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:13.391\nSo let's go ahead and remember that\nconcept here is that we're not gonna\n\n42\n00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:16.908\nbecome an expert today, let's say,\nin Web development, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:21.613\nWe're not gonna do that, we're not gonna\nwriting a ton of code in HTTP or HTML,\n\n44\n00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:23.523\nwe're not gonna be doing that.\n\n45\n00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:28.342\nBut the goal behind us, right, is to know\nwhat is vulnerable inside of that and\n\n46\n00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:30.620\nto actually be able to find this out.\n\n47\n00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.432\nIt's little bit better in today's world,\n\n48\n00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:37.543\nbecause just about every website\nwe go to today Zach is secured.\n\n49\n00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:39.641\nOkay, let me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n50\n00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:41.716\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So here on my machine, okay,\n\n51\n00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:45.757\nI've just brought up Kali Linux to just\nuse this out as an example machine and\n\n52\n00:02:45.757 --> 00:02:48.932\nwe'll also use this in our lab\na little bit later on as well.\n\n53\n00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:53.603\nI'm gonna just launch up a browser and\nbrowse to a website, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:57.875\nWhen I go ahead and click on the address\nbar, I'm just gonna do a shameless plug\n\n55\n00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.197\nto our own website because it's\nactually easy and it works.\n\n56\n00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:03.743\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a great website,\nby the way.\n\n57\n00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Then, you'll notice right away,\nhere it is, right here at the beginning,\n\n58\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.661\nwe get this green lock and\nit shows us that it is secured.\n\n59\n00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:16.978\nWe also of course get the, well,\nthe idea here where you can read HTTPS.\n\n60\n00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:21.234\nSo the great idea behind this,\nright, is really that we secure all\n\n61\n00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:26.024\nthe information now that goes between\nmy browser right here on my machine.\n\n62\n00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:29.150\nAnd of course the Web browser\nthat we're connecting to,\n\n63\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.318\nit's interesting because if I go to,\nlet's just say a regular search, and\n\n64\n00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.073\nI'm just gonna choose\nGoogle as an example here.\n\n65\n00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:38.364\nIf I go to Google, and then I just try and\n\n66\n00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:40.934\ntype out just a list of things like,\nlet me\n\n67\n00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:45.669\nsee here.I'm trying to think of something\nthat I wanna actually find out here.\n\n68\n00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.102\nSo let's say I'm looking for\na new computer, so\n\n69\n00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:52.803\nwe'll go computers, sales,\nlet's just do that.\n\n70\n00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:53.864\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n71\n00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:56.784\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwhen we start to scan down through here,\n\n72\n00:03:56.784 --> 00:03:59.924\nwe'll start to see some\ndifferent things as well.\n\n73\n00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:05.431\nNotice each of the links here says what,\njust about HTTPS, just about all of it.\n\n74\n00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:10.202\nNot every single one of them, but\njust about all of them tend to do that.\n\n75\n00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:12.314\nThat's because in the last few years,\n\n76\n00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.711\nwe've realized how insecure is\nthat actually, or unsecure.\n\n77\n00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:19.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's unsecure,\nthey're gonna run an analysis for that.\n\n78\n00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:22.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, anyway a little bit\ninsecurity going on there.\n\n79\n00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:27.409\nBut how unsecure things really can be when\nwe're sending this type of information\n\n80\n00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.084\nback and forward and across.\n\n81\n00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:32.666\nSo even some of the simplest websites\nwhere you're doing nothing but\n\n82\n00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:36.866\njust serving up Web pages, it's already\nsecured using the security that we have\n\n83\n00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:39.105\nout there and that's where you see HTTPS.\n\n84\n00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:40.164\n&gt;&gt; Ryan, question for you,\n\n85\n00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:42.582\nwould you actually go to\na website that didn't have HTTPS?\n\n86\n00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:45.317\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually,\nthat's a good question, okay, and\n\n87\n00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:49.285\nthe reason why that's a good question is\nit depends on what you're looking for.\n\n88\n00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:51.919\nNow, today's world,\nthey recommend, of course,\n\n89\n00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.325\nyou don't because now you're\nexposing that connection out there.\n\n90\n00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:59.194\nAnd you're actually connecting to a site\nyou don't really know if you're actually\n\n91\n00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:00.502\nconnecting to that site, so\n\n92\n00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:03.512\nthere's a lot of different things\nthat can happen if you do that.\n\n93\n00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:06.007\nSo today though,\nbecause of the way that things are,\n\n94\n00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:09.898\nwe're actually a little bit more paranoid,\nwhich doesn't mean that we're bad.\n\n95\n00:05:09.898 --> 00:05:13.110\nIt just means that we're a little bit\nmore concerned about our security.\n\n96\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.519\nAnd we tend to take it more seriously in\nthat way instead of going it's just a Web\n\n97\n00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.925\nserver, what's the big deal?\n\n98\n00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.951\n&gt;&gt; Just because you're paranoid,\ndoesn't mean they're not out to get you.\n\n99\n00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:20.643\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n100\n00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:23.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually that makes a lot of sense,\n\n101\n00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:27.940\nso in this particular sense here,\nwe do see it's a lot more difficult.\n\n102\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.645\nBut what we're talking about today,\nthough, is not really the HTTPS side,\n\n103\n00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:34.214\nwhich is secured,\nwe're still talking about HTTP.\n\n104\n00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:34.885\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n105\n00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:36.581\n&gt;&gt; So why do we need to know that?\n\n106\n00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:40.183\nWell, we need to know that because\nvulnerabilities do still exist out there.\n\n107\n00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:45.073\nAnd even internally though, if we have\ninternal websites inside of our own\n\n108\n00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:48.575\ncompany, they may not be\nsecured with HTTPS either.\n\n109\n00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:51.710\nNow, just when I said it, everyone's\ngonna say of course I've secured it,\n\n110\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.268\nthat's fine, but you may find that.\n\n111\n00:05:53.268 --> 00:05:56.559\nOkay, so we're gonna actually look at\nthe ones that are more vulnerable,\n\n112\n00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.291\neven though we don't tend to see\na lot of connections to them.\n\n113\n00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:00.919\nBut just when I said that,\n\n114\n00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.963\nare there actually websites out there on\nthe Internet today that are unsecured?\n\n115\n00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:11.312\nYes, are they major websites that\npeople might go to on a regular basis?\n\n116\n00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:15.136\nYou might go, there's no one that would\nactually do that on purpose, but let me\n\n117\n00:06:15.136 --> 00:06:19.093\nknow you an example here where you might\nactually see something like this, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:21.462\nSo back on my screen,\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n119\n00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.758\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust open up another tab here, and\n\n120\n00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:27.653\nlet's say that you like to look for\nthe news here.\n\n121\n00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:32.877\nSo I'm just gonna use WWW,\nlet's do BBC.com just\n\n122\n00:06:32.877 --> 00:06:37.615\nas an example and\nnow notice that in bbc.com,\n\n123\n00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:42.612\nI've actually got access\nto the page right now.\n\n124\n00:06:42.612 --> 00:06:47.058\nAnd notice that there is no security\nwarning on it at all, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:49.926\nSo when we take a look at this,\ndo people go and\n\n126\n00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:53.029\nbrowse the news that way and\nlook for news sites?\n\n127\n00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:54.036\nLet's just try another one,\n\n128\n00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:56.661\nlet's just say that this one's actually\nprobably a little bit easier here.\n\n129\n00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:04.064\nAnd we just do cnn.com and now, we should\nsee, look, no change here either, Zach.\n\n130\n00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:05.879\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n&gt;&gt; So do people come, and\n\n131\n00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.621\nwill they actually browse these things?\n\n132\n00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.657\nAnd when you think about this idea,\nright, this is now you opening\n\n133\n00:07:12.657 --> 00:07:16.275\nup just an unsecured connection\nbetween you and that site.\n\n134\n00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:18.322\nAnd the reality of this, right,\n\n135\n00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:23.003\nis that most of us really aren't gonna\ncare too much, cuz it's a website but\n\n136\n00:07:23.003 --> 00:07:27.849\nat the same time, it's one of these\nwhere this stuff could be spoofed, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.065\nAnd that means there is a chance,\nnot a great chance, but\n\n138\n00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.809\nthere is a good chance, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:36.028\nAnd depending on actually\nwho owns the site,\n\n140\n00:07:36.028 --> 00:07:41.112\nsomebody could be taking advantage\nof something like this and going let\n\n141\n00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:46.294\nme just make my page look exactly\nlike BBC's page, or CNN's page here.\n\n142\n00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:49.725\nAnd that way when you go to it,\nyou're not really connecting to them,\n\n143\n00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:52.185\nyou're connecting to\nwhoever that attacker is.\n\n144\n00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:55.385\nYou go and you click on some and I'm not\ngonna do this cuz I don't wanna get all\n\n145\n00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:56.996\nthese ads but for an example, right?\n\n146\n00:07:56.996 --> 00:08:00.935\nThis you can see right here, Zach, it says\nan advertisement, I go hey, I wanna click\n\n147\n00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:04.364\non the advertisement Well, it may not\nbe bringing you to the advertiser.\n\n148\n00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:08.254\nIt may be bringing you to the site\nthat they want you to go to.\n\n149\n00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:13.164\nSo it's very much a possibility here,\nand that's why we want to understand and\n\n150\n00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:16.260\nbe able to take a look at\nthe ID of the information.\n\n151\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.302\nSo let's go ahead and do this and\nshow you the difference here.\n\n152\n00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:20.909\nSo, we're gonna use the same example.\n\n153\n00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:24.748\nI'm just gonna close out all of these\ndifferent tabs here for just a moment.\n\n154\n00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:27.471\nNope, let me see if I can\nclose out of that tab.\n\n155\n00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.486\nLooks a little bit harder than it is.\n\n156\n00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:32.125\nI'm gonna bring up a good\nold friend of ours,\n\n157\n00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:36.503\nan application that allows us to do\nwhat we call some wire sniffing here, or\n\n158\n00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:39.369\nsome packet sniffing,\nthat we call Wireshark.\n\n159\n00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:43.043\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, can you explain to me again,\nwhat is Wireshark exactly?\n\n160\n00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:43.831\n&gt;&gt; Sure thing, Zach.\n\n161\n00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:45.814\nWhen we talk about the idea of Wireshark,\n\n162\n00:08:45.814 --> 00:08:49.440\nwhat we just showed you is an example\nof us getting the result, the webpage,\n\n163\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.005\nthe graphics,\nall the stuff that it wants to give us.\n\n164\n00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:55.605\nBut if we're gonna be an analyst,\nwe have to look beyond that.\n\n165\n00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:58.593\nWireshark gives us the ability to\nactually examine the packets that\n\n166\n00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:01.427\nare coming across,\nallows us to analyze them, in other words,\n\n167\n00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:04.116\nbreak them apart into those\ncomponent parts that we need to.\n\n168\n00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:07.934\nSo it's a good utility for an analyst,\nof course, to be able to take that and\n\n169\n00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:08.604\ntake a look.\n\n170\n00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:12.468\nSo we're gonna pretty much do\nthe same thing here with Wireshark.\n\n171\n00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:14.750\nSo just like I launched\nthe webpage before,\n\n172\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.978\nwe're simply going to launch Wireshark.\n\n173\n00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:19.664\nSo on my machine,\nI'm just gonna launch up Wireshark.\n\n174\n00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.985\nDon't worry about this warning for\nright now.\n\n175\n00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:24.954\nI'm gonna ignore it,\nthat's how important it is to me.\n\n176\n00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:25.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n177\n00:09:25.721 --> 00:09:30.550\nwe're actually gonna launch this up and\nthen we're gonna go to that website.\n\n178\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.130\nI'm just gonna choose BBC.com to go to.\n\n179\n00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.383\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that we can see what information it\n\n180\n00:09:34.383 --> 00:09:35.994\nreally does capture here.\n\n181\n00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:39.211\nSo I'm gonna launch this up,\nlet it start here.\n\n182\n00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.133\nNo packets are coming across, that's fine.\n\n183\n00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:43.170\nThere we go, one packet is coming across.\n\n184\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.020\nLet me minimize this,\nopen up the web browser.\n\n185\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.644\nAnd in a moment as my web browser comes up\nhere, I should be able to go to bbc.com,\n\n186\n00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:53.147\nand see the information.\n\n187\n00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:57.041\nRemember that this is\nunencrypted information, so\n\n188\n00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:01.472\nwe're not actually seeing anything but\nBBC's page here.\n\n189\n00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:07.298\nWe're gonna leave it at that and\nclose out of the entire webpage there.\n\n190\n00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:13.304\nAnd then,\nI'm simply going to close out of this,\n\n191\n00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:16.459\nso stopping the capture.\n\n192\n00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:23.344\nI've got 1,317 packets that we've\ncaptured between us and BBC.com.\n\n193\n00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:27.214\nIf I want to look at the HTTP information,\nwhich I can't say.\n\n194\n00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:31.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I wanna be able to look at that,\n\n195\n00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:35.575\nI'm gonna use that display filter to help\nlimit and cut that down for what we want.\n\n196\n00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:39.390\nAnd about 114 of these is gonna\nbe associated with the HTTP.\n\n197\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.032\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So right here at the very beginning.\n\n198\n00:10:42.032 --> 00:10:44.053\nThis is what we're normally looking for,\nright?\n\n199\n00:10:44.053 --> 00:10:46.771\nThe very fact that we\nhave an HTTP request, and\n\n200\n00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.811\nan HTTP response that comes back.\n\n201\n00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:54.228\nWe now know that the client and the server\nare pretty much in what they need.\n\n202\n00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:58.219\nAnd you can now start seeing the\ninformation that gets sent across as well.\n\n203\n00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:02.215\nThe messages that begin to come across,\nin terms of the methodology,\n\n204\n00:11:02.215 --> 00:11:03.919\nbegins with this idea of GET.\n\n205\n00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:09.420\nNow, if I expand this out in\nthe details section here, in the GET,\n\n206\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:15.435\nyou should see where it actually went,\nwhich is right here in BBC.com.\n\n207\n00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:18.290\nNow there is something\na little bit funny about this,\n\n208\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.650\nwhich we'll talk about a little bit later.\n\n209\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.392\nBut notice this one that says user agent.\n\n210\n00:11:22.392 --> 00:11:26.505\nAnd it says Mozilla 5.0, and\nthat tells me what version of,\n\n211\n00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:29.464\nlet me see if I can scroll\nup a little bit more.\n\n212\n00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:32.226\nTells me what version of\nthe browser that I'm in.\n\n213\n00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:37.060\nSo this is the information that we're\nbeing able to tell the server, and\n\n214\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.403\nsay, hey, look,\nI'm using a Firefox browser.\n\n215\n00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:44.584\nI'm actually getting access in,\nthe language that it accepts when you\n\n216\n00:11:44.584 --> 00:11:47.525\nreturn the webpage back,\nnotice it's English.\n\n217\n00:11:47.525 --> 00:11:52.249\nThe encoding that it will also accept,\nas well as the connection part.\n\n218\n00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:54.513\nAnd let's see if I can pull in some more.\n\n219\n00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:57.695\nNope, that's pretty much about it just for\nthat information.\n\n220\n00:11:57.695 --> 00:12:02.642\nAs we scroll on through, we'll also see\nthat there is a lot more information, and\n\n221\n00:12:02.642 --> 00:12:07.322\nthat's because that website is also\nloaded full of advertisements as well.\n\n222\n00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:12.091\nSo you'll also see that here on BBC,\nthere's something else running that's\n\n223\n00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:16.082\nrunning on Apache web server\ngetting that response coming back.\n\n224\n00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:17.806\nAnd you'll actually see some other ones.\n\n225\n00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:21.953\nThere's some SEO stuff that's out there,\nyou name it.\n\n226\n00:12:21.953 --> 00:12:24.137\nBut here is what we're\nactually able to see.\n\n227\n00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:26.899\nWe're able to break apart\nall that information and\n\n228\n00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:28.576\nget that type of information.\n\n229\n00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:31.827\nNow, you and I, when we look at it,\ngo, what's the big deal?\n\n230\n00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:34.130\nSo we've gotten that information.\n\n231\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.195\nWell the problem is,\nyou and I, as analysts,\n\n232\n00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:42.065\nas a person that may know what to look\nfor, or may not know what to look for,\n\n233\n00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:44.760\nit doesn't really affect us that much.\n\n234\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.260\nBut an attacker that understands\nwhat they're looking for\n\n235\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.698\nhere knows what can be manipulated,\nwhat can be changed.\n\n236\n00:12:51.698 --> 00:12:55.419\nThis is what we have to be able to spot\nand understand, and understand what\n\n237\n00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:59.559\nthe methods are, what the fields are that\ncan be changed, and that's where it's\n\n238\n00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.845\ngonna become more important for us\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\n\n239\n00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:04.005\nhere we could even spot\nredirection as well, right?\n\n240\n00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:05.237\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, you can, yep.\n\n241\n00:13:05.237 --> 00:13:08.074\nSo you actually do have a couple of other\nthings, which we'll talk about a little\n\n242\n00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:11.879\nbit later on\n&gt;&gt; Such as this idea of this referer,\n\n243\n00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.863\nwhich I can't say.\n\n244\n00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:14.644\n&gt;&gt; Referer?\n\n245\n00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Referer, and\nyou'll notice it's misspelled here, Zach,\n\n246\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.176\ntake a look at that.\n\n247\n00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:19.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n248\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.435\nthat's actually part of the standard.\n\n249\n00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:24.501\nYeah, that's actually misspelled on\npurpose as part of the standard here.\n\n250\n00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:28.348\nSo yeah, we didn't generate that, that's\nactually the machines that generated that\n\n251\n00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:30.120\nand sent it back and forth across there.\n\n252\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.726\nBut that's according to the RFC standard,\nmisspelled that way as well.\n\n253\n00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:35.256\n&gt;&gt; So that's like you're a referer?\n\n254\n00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:36.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who referred that to me.\n\n255\n00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:40.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is a strange field for\nsome of the information that we see.\n\n256\n00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:41.975\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:43.908\n&gt;&gt; Cuz normally we don't want\nthat to be populated at all.\n\n258\n00:13:43.908 --> 00:13:44.525\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:47.739\n&gt;&gt; So it starts to indicate some\nother information that you do end up\n\n260\n00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:48.462\nseeing here.\n\n261\n00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:51.626\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at, is some of this information.\n\n262\n00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:56.482\nBut before we actually kind of dive into\nthat, I actually got a malicious file,\n\n263\n00:13:56.482 --> 00:14:00.976\nin other words, something that was\nactually compromised at some point,\n\n264\n00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:03.314\nthat we're gonna take a look at here.\n\n265\n00:14:03.314 --> 00:14:06.588\nBut before we can jump in that and\nunderstand what's going on there,\n\n266\n00:14:06.588 --> 00:14:10.325\nwe have to understand those particular\npieces and bits of information first.\n\n267\n00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:12.735\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're talking about here when\n\n268\n00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:17.672\nyou see those terms up here inside of the\ninfo, and of course, so let me go back up\n\n269\n00:14:17.672 --> 00:14:22.056\nhere to where it says GET right here for\na moment so that we can see that.\n\n270\n00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:24.979\nWhen you see GET and\ninformation like that,\n\n271\n00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:27.986\nthat is what we call\ndifferent HTTP methods.\n\n272\n00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:33.097\nThose are methods in which the client\nsays, here's information that I need,\n\n273\n00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:37.136\nhere's what's gonna happen,\nand here's what can be done.\n\n274\n00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:40.880\nSo it's not always about the GET, you'll\nsee sometimes that it'll say different\n\n275\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.628\nthings and that's what we also\nneed to take a look at as well.\n\n276\n00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:45.682\nNow let me go ahead and\njust close out of this for a moment.\n\n277\n00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:47.083\nActually, let me just switch off.\n\n278\n00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:50.753\nAnd let's talk about the idea\nof some of these common methods.\n\n279\n00:14:50.753 --> 00:14:53.632\nYou don't have to memorize them all.\n\n280\n00:14:53.632 --> 00:14:56.558\nYou do need to understand what they do,\nthough.\n\n281\n00:14:56.558 --> 00:15:01.971\nSo don't memorize this and go crud, I\ndon't need to memorize this for the exam.\n\n282\n00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:03.836\nIt's not about memorization for the exam.\n\n283\n00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:07.208\nIt's at least understanding\nthe processes behind it and\n\n284\n00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:10.733\nwhat you see inside of Wireshark here and\nwhat it's doing.\n\n285\n00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:12.682\n&gt;&gt; Good to be familiar with all of this.\n\n286\n00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:14.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good to be familiar,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n287\n00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:18.024\nBut I don't want you to go,\nRonnie told me to memorize this.\n\n288\n00:15:18.024 --> 00:15:19.178\nI didn't see a single question on it.\n\n289\n00:15:19.178 --> 00:15:20.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't help you there.\n\n290\n00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:25.491\nBut part of the analysis is you're gonna\nactually be able to understand what you're\n\n291\n00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:29.182\nactually seeing at this point when\nyou see these types of messages.\n\n292\n00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:32.300\nSo GET is essentially our client,\nin other words, my web browser,\n\n293\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.091\nwhen I connect to a server, that says,\nhere's what I want to see from the server.\n\n294\n00:15:36.091 --> 00:15:41.034\nNow there's a couple of other things\nthat can also get confused at this point\n\n295\n00:15:41.034 --> 00:15:41.660\nas well.\n\n296\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.950\nNotice that there is actually POST,\nand there is also PUT here.\n\n297\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.466\nYou want to be careful when\nyou see stuff like this.\n\n298\n00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:53.162\nBy itself, generically,\nthe idea of POST is simple.\n\n299\n00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:55.268\nIt just sends data to the server.\n\n300\n00:15:55.268 --> 00:15:57.702\nNow when we say that, well,\nwhy the heck does that matter?\n\n301\n00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:01.924\nNot so much matters, it matters\nin how it does and what it does.\n\n302\n00:16:01.924 --> 00:16:06.692\nWhen you're posting something,\nokay, just as a simple example.\n\n303\n00:16:06.692 --> 00:16:10.016\nThis is not the most technically\naccurate example, but\n\n304\n00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:13.832\nif you fill out a web form because\nyou wanted to get a white paper or\n\n305\n00:16:13.832 --> 00:16:16.820\nyou wanted a free download\nof whatever that said.\n\n306\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.024\nGo here for your free download and\nmakes you fill out stuff.\n\n307\n00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:21.446\nWhat you're really sending is a post,\nokay?\n\n308\n00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:26.642\nSo you're sending information in but\nyou really are actually giving them\n\n309\n00:16:26.642 --> 00:16:32.026\ninformation that's gonna update\nsomething in the background somewhere.\n\n310\n00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:34.321\nYou're posting it to them to do that,\nokay?\n\n311\n00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:36.209\nThere is something that is very similar.\n\n312\n00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:37.793\nI'm gonna skip overhead here for a moment.\n\n313\n00:16:37.793 --> 00:16:39.538\nSomething called PUT.\n\n314\n00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:44.244\nOkay, PUT is different that in\nthe very fact that it actually\n\n315\n00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:48.044\nsends a replacement file or\nit can create a file.\n\n316\n00:16:48.044 --> 00:16:52.586\nSo that sounds like POST, that you're\nsending data over to the server.\n\n317\n00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:57.153\nPUT says, well, I'm actually also\nsending data or sending a file over.\n\n318\n00:16:57.153 --> 00:17:01.634\nBut one actually can update or\ncreate something on the server.\n\n319\n00:17:01.634 --> 00:17:03.352\nThis one doesn't do that, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:06.529\nThis one though, it allows you to take and\ngo all right, here it is.\n\n321\n00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:10.886\nI'm gonna sign up for this thing, it's\ngonna ask me for my email address, and\n\n322\n00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:12.751\nfirst name and last name, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:13.513\nSomething like that, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:13.513 --> 00:17:16.288\nSo you're posting information like that.\n\n325\n00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:19.227\nAnd that doesn't necessarily\nchange a lot except,\n\n326\n00:17:19.227 --> 00:17:21.846\nit actually adds\ninformation into that base.\n\n327\n00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:25.646\nWhereas PUT though, you can continue\nto put information in there and\n\n328\n00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.821\nyou'll get the same thing every time.\n\n329\n00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:32.330\nAnd what that means is, you're not\nreally kind of adding anything in.\n\n330\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.070\nYou're replacing something, or\nyou're updating something that's actually\n\n331\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.260\nan existence at that point so here,\nthat's kind of the difference.\n\n332\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.336\nThe technical term is put as item potent,\nokay?\n\n333\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.062\n&gt;&gt; Which means, yeah,\nyou're gonna continue to add,\n\n334\n00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:46.153\ndo whatever you want to it.\n\n335\n00:17:46.153 --> 00:17:49.158\nBut you're still gonna end up with\nthe same, exact result, no matter what,\n\n336\n00:17:49.158 --> 00:17:50.004\nevery time you do so.\n\n337\n00:17:50.004 --> 00:17:50.671\nBut POST though,\n\n338\n00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.659\nyou're actually updating pretty much\nthe whole time when you're doing that.\n\n339\n00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:58.393\nSo if you get a GET, that's perfectly fine\nthat's what we're normally used to seeing.\n\n340\n00:17:58.393 --> 00:18:01.686\nAnd that's what we saw pretty much in\nthat output that we saw from Wireshark\n\n341\n00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:02.427\nitself, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:02.427 --> 00:18:05.922\nBut then, there's also this idea of head.\n\n343\n00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:08.464\nHead works in the same way like GET but\n\n344\n00:18:08.464 --> 00:18:11.672\nit's processes only get\nthose headers back.\n\n345\n00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:15.911\nNow, why in the world would I choose to do\nthat, when I could actually get whatever\n\n346\n00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:20.171\nelse I wanted back, cuz you're really\ntrying to see all the header information.\n\n347\n00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:24.676\nI'm not saying it's not possible that you\nwon't see this but more than likely you're\n\n348\n00:18:24.676 --> 00:18:28.823\nprobably not gonna see it as often as you\ndo like GET or POST or PUT as well, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:28.823 --> 00:18:33.617\nThe dangerous ones that we really have\nto pay attention to is when we see\n\n350\n00:18:33.617 --> 00:18:36.637\na lot of these two, PUT and DELETE, right?\n\n351\n00:18:36.637 --> 00:18:39.637\nPUT because it's really\nreplacing something or\n\n352\n00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:42.277\nis creating something new on that server.\n\n353\n00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:45.430\nIn only post you're not doing that.\n\n354\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.338\nPOST, you're kind of going hey, here's\nthe stuff and I'm sending it to you.\n\n355\n00:18:48.338 --> 00:18:50.157\nYou decide what to do with it.\n\n356\n00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:53.029\nPUT though is actually changing\nsomething over on the other end.\n\n357\n00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:56.132\nDELETE is changing something\non the other end as well.\n\n358\n00:18:56.132 --> 00:18:59.938\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou understand both of those.\n\n359\n00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:00.924\nAnd we'll come back and\n\n360\n00:19:00.924 --> 00:19:04.036\nwe'll talk about the vulnerabilities\nof each of these in a moment, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:06.679\nTRACE is some a little bit more unusual,\n\n362\n00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:10.566\nremember that you could actually\nbe in more than one or two or\n\n363\n00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:15.579\nthree routers removed from where\nultimately the website is hosted, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:20.068\nTRACE allows in the browser to request\nthat all of the actual servers in\n\n365\n00:19:20.068 --> 00:19:23.959\nbetween or routers in between\nannounce themselves, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:26.602\nSo if it is actually in [INAUDIBLE] hey,\n\n367\n00:19:26.602 --> 00:19:31.399\nmake sure you kind of register back\nto me that I'm going through you.\n\n368\n00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:36.162\nSo TRACE is one of those options or\nanother type of method not\n\n369\n00:19:36.162 --> 00:19:40.844\nevery single browser will\nactually use every single one.\n\n370\n00:19:40.844 --> 00:19:46.952\nNot every server will respond to these but\nthat is another one for you as well, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:49.355\nOPTIONS is kind of a big one too.\n\n372\n00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:53.937\nOPTIONS we do have to kind of understand\nthis that when we go over, right?\n\n373\n00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:55.380\nWe can actually say hey,\n\n374\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.732\nwhat are the methods we're gonna accept\nto return information back to us.\n\n375\n00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.153\nSo we can send the option\nover as a request and\n\n376\n00:20:02.153 --> 00:20:05.162\nsay, here's the two options\nI'm expecting to see and\n\n377\n00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:09.361\nthat means that the server normally goes,\nokay, you want one of those two?\n\n378\n00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:11.898\nLet me give you one of those\ntwo options instead, so\n\n379\n00:20:11.898 --> 00:20:14.204\nthat's what options helps\nus to be able to do.\n\n380\n00:20:14.204 --> 00:20:18.203\nFinally, the other one of course is\nCONNECT here where it creates what we call\n\n381\n00:20:18.203 --> 00:20:19.074\nan HTTP tunnel.\n\n382\n00:20:19.074 --> 00:20:24.328\nA tunnel means it's encapsulating\ndata within another protocol.\n\n383\n00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:29.345\nSo we can send data even through HTTP and\ninside of Wireshark itself,\n\n384\n00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:32.978\nunless you really know\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n385\n00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:38.269\nyou're not gonna be able to actually\nsee all of that data inside of HTTP.\n\n386\n00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:40.775\nSo there is some of that information,\nokay?\n\n387\n00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:44.774\nNow, just understand that,\nthe methodologies, this is kind of\n\n388\n00:20:44.774 --> 00:20:49.063\nthe major part of what we're spending\na lot of time on in describing and\n\n389\n00:20:49.063 --> 00:20:50.750\nunderstanding it, okay?\n\n390\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.559\nBecause we have to actually get to\nthis point where we understand what is\n\n391\n00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:57.171\nactually vulnerable and\nwhat actually isn't.\n\n392\n00:20:57.171 --> 00:20:58.475\nAnd that's what we have to make sure of.\n\n393\n00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:02.398\nSo we'll start here, we've got a few\nminutes left before we need to,\n\n394\n00:21:02.398 --> 00:21:05.936\nkind of a before I run out of time\nis what ends up happening here.\n\n395\n00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:07.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's get started with at least\n\n396\n00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.029\na couple of them, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:12.837\nSo remember that when we talk\nabout the idea of a GET request,\n\n398\n00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:16.435\nmost of the time it is\njust exact like we said.\n\n399\n00:21:16.435 --> 00:21:19.084\nWe're saying, give me the web page and\n\n400\n00:21:19.084 --> 00:21:22.311\nthat's kind of the first\nbig one that happens.\n\n401\n00:21:22.311 --> 00:21:27.697\nBut somebody can take this field and\nmanipulate it if they choose to and be\n\n402\n00:21:27.697 --> 00:21:33.721\nable to pass different parameters through\nit at the same time using a URL, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.661\nAnd it's very easily manipulated.\n\n404\n00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:38.795\nSo just when you don't think\nit can be manipulated,\n\n405\n00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:42.155\neverything that's out there\ninside of the URL itself.\n\n406\n00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:45.086\nSomebody that's very familiar\nwith working with that URL,\n\n407\n00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:47.563\nthen can manipulate that\ndata as it comes through.\n\n408\n00:21:47.563 --> 00:21:51.380\nAnd send you back information that\nyou didn't know that you requested.\n\n409\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.999\nEven though according to the server,\nyou did.\n\n410\n00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:57.628\nOkay, so that's why it's important for\nus to understand.\n\n411\n00:21:57.628 --> 00:22:00.979\nMost of the time when you do this\nbecause it's set in that URL,\n\n412\n00:22:00.979 --> 00:22:04.202\ninstead of that get message,\nit means somebody don't even\n\n413\n00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:07.442\nhave to go into the payload when\nthis return to do anything.\n\n414\n00:22:07.442 --> 00:22:12.503\nSo this GET is something else,\nthat's out there, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:12.503 --> 00:22:15.428\nMost of the time in newer like HTTP 2.0 or\n\n416\n00:22:15.428 --> 00:22:20.159\nsomething I can't remember all\nthe versions that are out there now.\n\n417\n00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:25.438\nBut let's say, HTTP 2.0 at 1.1\nyou might see more post messages.\n\n418\n00:22:25.438 --> 00:22:30.194\nThat means that even the GET stuff\nis actually located inside of\n\n419\n00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:31.548\nthe POST itself.\n\n420\n00:22:31.548 --> 00:22:36.577\nThe POST only comes with payload, so that\nway they have to actually open that up.\n\n421\n00:22:36.577 --> 00:22:40.363\nThey have to kind of mess with the packet\nbefore they can do anything and\n\n422\n00:22:40.363 --> 00:22:42.429\nthe server may not actually get that.\n\n423\n00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:46.455\nIn other words, they might look at it and\ngo, something's messed up here.\n\n424\n00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:50.769\nSo that's what newer web servers may\ndo instead, say don't send me GET,\n\n425\n00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:54.733\nsend me a POST instead and I'll take\na look at what's inside of it and\n\n426\n00:22:54.733 --> 00:22:56.977\nthen I'll deal with it as it chooses.\n\n427\n00:22:56.977 --> 00:22:59.678\nSo you may see this kind\nof change going on.\n\n428\n00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:03.339\nBut what we see from BBC, it's still\nusing GET messages all the time and\n\n429\n00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:04.693\nwe'd use it all the time.\n\n430\n00:23:04.693 --> 00:23:08.636\nSo it's still out there and\nit is still available as well.\n\n431\n00:23:08.636 --> 00:23:12.165\nOn the header stuff, we don't tend\nto see a lot dealing with it here.\n\n432\n00:23:12.165 --> 00:23:14.992\nIf there's anything that's\nactually right there,\n\n433\n00:23:14.992 --> 00:23:18.519\nthat people want it's the ability\nto do reconnaissance, right?\n\n434\n00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:22.532\nIt's the ability to say, all right,\nI'm gonna take that information I see from\n\n435\n00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:26.675\nthe headers and then figure out what it is\nthat's actually vulnerable that I need.\n\n436\n00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:29.438\nAnd that's gonna be important for\nsomething else,\n\n437\n00:23:29.438 --> 00:23:31.205\nthat we're gonna actually see.\n\n438\n00:23:31.205 --> 00:23:35.635\nIs that people would use just that type of\ninformation just to see what is vulnerable\n\n439\n00:23:35.635 --> 00:23:39.449\nin that communication between your\nbrowser and the web server as well.\n\n440\n00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:41.175\nOkay, all right.\n\n441\n00:23:41.175 --> 00:23:43.130\nNow Zach has just given me\na little bit of a sign and\n\n442\n00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.923\na warning here that I'm coming\nclosely being done, which is great.\n\n443\n00:23:45.923 --> 00:23:46.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n444\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.463\nbecause it actually means that\nI have to either wind up and\n\n445\n00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:52.341\ngive you everything in five minutes or\nI need to slow down and\n\n446\n00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:55.587\nmake sure that I cover a lot more\nof what we actually have left here.\n\n447\n00:23:55.587 --> 00:23:58.606\nWhich is probably the better idea\ninstead of rushing through it.\n\n448\n00:23:58.606 --> 00:24:02.241\nSo Zach, I think this is a good place for\nus to go and end this.\n\n449\n00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.348\nAnd then we'll pick up in a part two.\n\n450\n00:24:03.348 --> 00:24:07.313\n&gt;&gt; Well, this has been part one\nof describe HTTP headers inside\n\n451\n00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:09.032\nthe Cisco SecOps series.\n\n452\n00:24:09.032 --> 00:24:11.894\nRonnie, anything else you'd\nlike to add before we leave?\n\n453\n00:24:11.894 --> 00:24:15.567\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\ndon't worry about memorizing so much but\n\n454\n00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:19.330\nworry more about taking a look at\nwhat you see inside of Wireshark.\n\n455\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.545\nAnd understanding the process here.\n\n456\n00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:23.591\nIf this is now sounding foreign to you,\n\n457\n00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:26.825\nin other words you're going,\nmy gosh I'm in over my head.\n\n458\n00:24:26.825 --> 00:24:31.270\nGo back and take a look inside of other\nthings inside of the ITProTV library,\n\n459\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.080\nokay, that will help you out.\n\n460\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.288\nUnderstanding the process that\ngoes on between the client and\n\n461\n00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:37.952\na web server is pretty much key,\n\n462\n00:24:37.952 --> 00:24:41.787\nthere are plenty of resources out there\navailable to you on the Internet.\n\n463\n00:24:41.787 --> 00:24:43.639\nSo if you get that process down and\n\n464\n00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:47.291\nunderstand that communication\nprocess right at the beginning.\n\n465\n00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:51.190\nThe rest of what we're telling you in\nidentifying the vulnerabilities is gonna\n\n466\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.929\nmake it a lot easier for you, cuz then\nyou'll be able to put it into context.\n\n467\n00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:58.867\nWe just really don't have the ultimate\ntime in this series to take you through\n\n468\n00:24:58.867 --> 00:24:59.723\nall that again.\n\n469\n00:24:59.723 --> 00:25:04.657\nBut that doesn't mean that in ITProTV\nlibrary we don't take you through it\n\n470\n00:25:04.657 --> 00:25:06.080\nsomewhere in there.\n\n471\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.880\nSo make sure you do check that out and\n\n472\n00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.706\nprobably check out your\nnetwork plus library in there.\n\n473\n00:25:10.706 --> 00:25:15.334\nI know in the Cisco security fundamentals,\nright?\n\n474\n00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:20.275\nRight here, in other words the first\npart of this series for the Cyber Ops.\n\n475\n00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:22.714\nWe go through as part of\nthat process as well,\n\n476\n00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:24.843\nin helping you to understand that too.\n\n477\n00:25:24.843 --> 00:25:28.662\nSo all of that will help you out but\nthere's plenty of different things inside\n\n478\n00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:32.597\nof our library that will give you a good\nfoundation, as we're now coming to talk\n\n479\n00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:36.561\nabout the vulnerabilities here and\nthat's what we're really focusing it on.\n\n480\n00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:39.829\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great job Ronnie\nalways great to work with you.\n\n481\n00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:43.333\nAnd make sure you watch all the episodes\ninside the Cisco SecOps series,\n\n482\n00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.162\nyou'll be really glad you did and\nthank you for watching.\n\n483\n00:25:46.162 --> 00:25:49.277\nMake sure you tell a friend about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n484\n00:25:49.277 --> 00:25:50.276\nMy name's Zack Memos.\n\n485\n00:25:50.276 --> 00:25:51.104\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n486\n00:25:51.104 --> 00:25:52.273\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n487\n00:25:54.908 --> 00:26:00.578\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:26:00.578 --> 00:26:03.295\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.565\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.761\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.594\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:19.290\nI'm you host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco SECOPS,\n\n7\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.049\nand this is Describe HTTP Headers, Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.691\nNow that's a hard one to say.\n\n9\n00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.501\nYou try that, HTTP headers.\n\n10\n00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.822\n[LAUGH] Anyway, Ronnie Wong is gonna give\nus all the information that we need,\n\n11\n00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:30.597\ncuz he's got it.\n\n12\n00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.795\nHe's got it, he's ready to go.\n\n13\n00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.061\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:36.445\nThank you again for having me back on the\nshow as we continue in this little mini\n\n15\n00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.760\nseries here on HTTP headers.\n\n16\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.791\nLet's make sure that we understand what\nit is that we're talking about and\n\n17\n00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.844\nwhere we're picking up from as well.\n\n18\n00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:48.158\nIn the previous episode we briefly talked\nabout, of course, the idea of what can\n\n19\n00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:52.106\nhappen with the HTTP headers and\nwhy they're actually important for us.\n\n20\n00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:56.032\nIt exposes vulnerabilities that\nwe may not be as familiar with,\n\n21\n00:00:56.032 --> 00:01:00.324\nespecially in today's world where\njust about every website out there\n\n22\n00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:05.048\nis actually gonna be secured in some\nmanner and form, usually a SSL or TLS, so\n\n23\n00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.767\nwe don't tend to worry\nabout them too much.\n\n24\n00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.862\nBut at the same time, as an analyst\nworking at a security operations center,\n\n25\n00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:15.326\nthese are things we shouldn't\noverlook because people will take\n\n26\n00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:16.411\nadvantage of them.\n\n27\n00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:20.869\nAnd we are just talking about some of the\ndifferent methodologies that are out there\n\n28\n00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.001\nfor us to get information from\nour web servers too, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.104\nNow, one of the key things that I didn't\nmention that I definitely want to make\n\n30\n00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:32.083\nsure that we understand as well, and\nwhy these things are so vulnerable, is\n\n31\n00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:36.716\nyou gotta remember that header information\nis usually controled by the client, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:39.637\nThat means your browser is\nthe one that's in control of\n\n33\n00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:41.868\nthis connection going to the web server.\n\n34\n00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.884\nThe web server doesn't\ninitiate the contact.\n\n35\n00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:48.300\nYou, as someone using your machine and\nyour browser, you're the one that's making\n\n36\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.615\nthe connection,\nyou're the one that's telling the browser,\n\n37\n00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:55.170\nhere's the information I want to get back,\nhere's what I want, and\n\n38\n00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.007\nhere's the information I'm putting\nup there or deleting, you name it.\n\n39\n00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:03.794\nReally, you are in control of all of\nthe header information and when you think\n\n40\n00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:08.452\nabout that from the client then, web\nstores can be as secure as they can be.\n\n41\n00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.653\nBut if you're the one that\ncan make that connection and\n\n42\n00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:16.036\nit's pretty much say what you want,\nit makes that easy then for an attacker\n\n43\n00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:20.491\nto manipulate in the change information\nas a client to that server as well and\n\n44\n00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:24.944\nmaybe be able to take advantage of things\nthat we don't realize just because\n\n45\n00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:28.250\nof their base operations and\nthe way that that happens.\n\n46\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.186\nSo that's why it's important for\nus to remember.\n\n47\n00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:34.183\nSo we were talking about some of the\nvulnerabilities and we've got a couple of\n\n48\n00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:38.199\nthem still to go through in terms of\nthe different methods that are out there.\n\n49\n00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.447\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I was gonna say, we left\noff, we were talking about HTTP methods.\n\n50\n00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:43.239\nWe're on PUT now, aren't we?\n\n51\n00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.287\nWe're gonna look more in depth into that,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:49.351\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're actually about to talk about\nthe vulnerabilities that we find in PUT,\n\n53\n00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:51.324\nand then will also, of course later on,\n\n54\n00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:53.605\nfinish up a few more of\nthe different methods.\n\n55\n00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:58.608\nBut we'll also talk about user agents as\nwell as some of the cookies in information\n\n56\n00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:03.703\nand we'll talk about some of the different\ntypes of injection attacks, briefly.\n\n57\n00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:07.829\nWe're not gonna go through all of those\ndifferent injection attacks during this\n\n58\n00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.712\nepisode or even the next one, and the\nreason why is that we cover the majority\n\n59\n00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:15.131\nof those types of attacks inside\nthe security fundamentals show.\n\n60\n00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.075\nSo make sure you return back there and\n\n61\n00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:21.033\nlook at those different ones on\nthe cross-site scripting SQL injection,\n\n62\n00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.760\nall of those different\ntypes of vulnerabilities.\n\n63\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.209\nBut we will mention a few of them as we go\nthrough here because there's a little bit\n\n64\n00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.832\nmore that we've got to know about, so\n\n65\n00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:31.051\nwe'll make sure that we mention those two,\nokay?\n\n66\n00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:35.105\nSo this is key for us and why we want\nto make sure that we know, because most\n\n67\n00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:39.762\npeople, when they make a connection out to\nthe internet it's usually gonna be over\n\n68\n00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.780\nsome type of web connection, and\nthat's what we're taking a look at.\n\n69\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.099\nAll right, so on my screen is a list of\nsome of the different methods that we've\n\n70\n00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.700\nbeen talking about, and\nin that previous episode, like I said,\n\n71\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.756\nwe really did mention the idea of GET and\nPOST and then we talked about their\n\n72\n00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:00.099\nvulnerabilities, and what we actually\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n73\n00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.255\nWe'll start to take a look at\nthe idea of getting POST here, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:07.756\nThis is where we can send data in as terms\nof POST to update things like forms that\n\n75\n00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:11.325\nwe need to, and GET, of course,\nas what we want to retrieve.\n\n76\n00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.318\nThat information can actually have\nanything in it that it wants to, so\n\n77\n00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:20.005\nusually it's a request of some sort and\nthen we get that response that comes back.\n\n78\n00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.957\nWe're just about to mention the idea\nof PUT again, and this is key.\n\n79\n00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:27.587\nEven though normally it has to replace or\nupdate something,\n\n80\n00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:32.568\ninsert something into the web server,\nthe key here to understand, the question,\n\n81\n00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:36.865\nI should say, that we need to ask,\nis what can we actually put up there?\n\n82\n00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:39.106\nWell, we can put whatever we want to,\n\n83\n00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:43.802\nand that even includes things like\nexecutables, which means programs that can\n\n84\n00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:47.401\nrun, and that's where some of\nthe vulnerability comes in.\n\n85\n00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:52.028\nIt doesn't always have to be in form of a\ndocument of some sort, it can actually be\n\n86\n00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:56.453\ncode that is designed to run over on that\nserver so when we issue something like\n\n87\n00:04:56.453 --> 00:05:00.743\nPUT, we can actually do that to tell\nit that it's gonna insert something or\n\n88\n00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:05.442\nit's gonna update something, and we can\ntell it it's gonna also run this code and\n\n89\n00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:08.278\ncall something like that\nover on the server too.\n\n90\n00:05:08.278 --> 00:05:11.955\nSo we definitely need to pay\nattention to information that we see\n\n91\n00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:16.263\nthat's going across our servers,\nour machines, as we start to see that.\n\n92\n00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:21.188\nInside of Wireshark it means we also\nneed to pay attention to these keywords,\n\n93\n00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.673\nthese methods here,\nbecause it may actually reveal at\n\n94\n00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:28.006\nleast what the content that\nwas put up on the server,\n\n95\n00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:32.810\nand even DELETE may tell us what was\ndeleted off that server as well, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.615\nAnd all of that is important on\nthe web server itself, right?\n\n97\n00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:41.131\nIt means I can remove any resource\nthat I want to if that server is not\n\n98\n00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:43.970\nprotected in the ways that it needs to be.\n\n99\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.271\nNow, we're not getting into the idea of\nsetting up all of the standard protections\n\n100\n00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.450\nthat need to be on the web server, because\nwe've already talked about the idea of\n\n101\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.027\nhardening web servers before inside\nof the security fundamentals.\n\n102\n00:05:56.027 --> 00:06:00.765\nBut just remember that if those things are\nnot in place, such as authentication or\n\n103\n00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:05.365\nauthorization, if all that's not in place,\na simple DELETE can really do some\n\n104\n00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.661\ndamage on a web server that\nwe don't understand as well,\n\n105\n00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.203\nand even change the entire configuration,\n\n106\n00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:16.254\nif not delete the configuration off that\nweb server too, and that's very important.\n\n107\n00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:21.089\nSo if there is anything that really\ncan be damaging, these two very simple\n\n108\n00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.613\nwords here are something that we\nreally don't want to see often, and\n\n109\n00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:30.059\nif you do, make sure you know what's\nactually being put up there and\n\n110\n00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.584\nwhat's actually being deleted,\nis kind of the key.\n\n111\n00:06:33.584 --> 00:06:37.675\nAll right, so those are kind of\nthe big hefty ones that we have.\n\n112\n00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:43.884\nNow, once we do that, we don't tend to do\na lot with TRACE, but in the OPTIONS here,\n\n113\n00:06:43.884 --> 00:06:48.696\nremember this is more about\nreconnaissance than anything else,\n\n114\n00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:54.743\nthis is used to determine the available\nmethods that we return back to the client.\n\n115\n00:06:54.743 --> 00:07:00.033\nSo if my client says I'll take an EXE\nfile, which is an executable file,\n\n116\n00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:04.195\nor I'll take an SWF file,\nsome type of Adobe Flash file,\n\n117\n00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:07.869\nit's a sure thing,\nI'll send you those things.\n\n118\n00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:13.294\nSo those options then, if somebody knows\nthat your client is actually able or\n\n119\n00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:17.133\nwilling to accept those,\nthey can then manipulate and\n\n120\n00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:22.141\nmodify even this OPTIONS to help them\nout to get information back on your\n\n121\n00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:27.076\nmachine that you probably don't\nneed running on them as well, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:30.980\nSo just be aware that these\noptions are out there for us.\n\n123\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.419\nAlso, on the CONNECT side of things,\n\n124\n00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.304\nin this one the attacker can actually\nuse this particular way of doing things\n\n125\n00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:42.979\nin the CONNECT methodology here that\nwe have to connect through a proxy.\n\n126\n00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.203\nAnd then once they're actually\nconnected through a proxy,\n\n127\n00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:50.245\nif we don't have the authorization and\naccess control set up, they can gain\n\n128\n00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:54.353\naccess to unrestricted information, and\nthat is something else that we also\n\n129\n00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:58.738\nneed to pay attention to as well, without\nus ever noticing that it's happening.\n\n130\n00:07:58.738 --> 00:08:04.162\nSo it's very important that we take a look\nand understand some of the different\n\n131\n00:08:04.162 --> 00:08:08.691\nvulnerabilities that are right here,\njust in the methodology.\n\n132\n00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:12.256\nAnd we can see all of this information,\nlike what we just showed you inside of\n\n133\n00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:14.612\nWireshark, to be able to\ndo something like this.\n\n134\n00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:18.188\nNow, a lot of times,\nit doesn't come across as easily and\n\n135\n00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:20.895\nas quickly as being able\nto spot the attack.\n\n136\n00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:25.391\nAnd the reason why is that this stuff,\nright, happens in live time, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:30.196\nSo unless you're doing active network\nsecurity monitoring, just like\n\n138\n00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:35.235\nwhat I showed Zack in the previous episode\nwhere I did a Wireshark capture and\n\n139\n00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:39.509\nthen I stopped the capture, and\ntook a look at the information.\n\n140\n00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:41.768\nWell, that can show me that,\nbut I did that on purpose.\n\n141\n00:08:41.768 --> 00:08:44.732\nI started and stopped it after 35,\n40 seconds, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:50.148\nWell, this stuff can come at any\ntime during the day, 24 hours a day,\n\n143\n00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:56.040\na simple PUT or DELETE message that gets\nin there among thousands of packets.\n\n144\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.432\nTens of thousands of packets, hundreds\nof thousands of packets during a day,\n\n145\n00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:02.038\nnot exactly as easy to spot.\n\n146\n00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:03.389\nBut it can be done.\n\n147\n00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.355\nIt just takes a little bit more time.\n\n148\n00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:10.962\nSo Wireshark is kind of primarily at least\nwhat we'll be exposed to a lot of times.\n\n149\n00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:14.558\nAnd then you can use those different\ntypes of display filters to help you to\n\n150\n00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:16.600\nfigure out what you really do need to see.\n\n151\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.430\nJust kind of understand that it may not\ncome across just that easily where we'll\n\n152\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.667\nspot stuff, okay?\n\n153\n00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:27.273\nNow, the other thing that we can also do,\nof course, is examine,\n\n154\n00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:31.081\nokay, an output that actually\nis a corrupted output.\n\n155\n00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:34.831\nAnd we can at least take a look at what\nsomething like that can look like, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:38.350\nSo, we'll not see all the simple telltale\nsigns, like we'll see right here.\n\n157\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.648\nBut it will at least\nhelp us to notice that.\n\n158\n00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:43.386\nAnd that's what we want to do next,\nis show you that.\n\n159\n00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:45.422\nSo, I'm gonna switch over to my machine,\nand\n\n160\n00:09:45.422 --> 00:09:47.945\nmake sure that we are ready to\ngo to do that as well, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.787\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n162\n00:09:49.787 --> 00:09:52.594\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, while you're doing that,\nquick question for you.\n\n163\n00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:55.155\nAre there other utilities we\ncan utilize besides Wireshark?\n\n164\n00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:57.589\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt.\n\n165\n00:09:57.589 --> 00:10:01.580\nWireshark is great to help us to do\nsome analysis at what we're looking at.\n\n166\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.941\nBut a lot of times, the idea of\ndoing live analysis in Wireshark,\n\n167\n00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.847\nthings are floating by too quickly.\n\n168\n00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:10.190\nSo we're not gonna be able to capture\nthem live very easily, a lot of times.\n\n169\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.684\nSo even the example that we did in\na previous episode, where we captured it,\n\n170\n00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:15.774\nwe only captured it for 35, 40 seconds.\n\n171\n00:10:15.774 --> 00:10:16.572\nAnd we stopped it.\n\n172\n00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:18.567\nAnd I don't know what happened after that.\n\n173\n00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:22.425\nIt could still be going on if everything\nis still connected, there could be more\n\n174\n00:10:22.425 --> 00:10:25.957\ninformation or even a vulnerability\nthat actually got attached there.\n\n175\n00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:30.095\nSo what you have to use is some type of\ntool that is designed, then, to actually\n\n176\n00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:34.115\nmonitor what we call network security\nmonitoring tools that are out there,\n\n177\n00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:35.279\nthat are available.\n\n178\n00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.560\nNow, some of them of course are paid.\n\n179\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.108\nThere's a lot of them that are paid,\nand very expensive,\n\n180\n00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.140\nbecause they're really\ngood at what they do.\n\n181\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.109\nSome of them are freeware\nthat's out there, but\n\n182\n00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:46.906\nit also means a lot of maintenance,\nand you have to be able to do that.\n\n183\n00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:49.336\nAnd we'll actually get into to\nsome of that a little bit more,\n\n184\n00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:50.758\nwith something that we call Sguil.\n\n185\n00:10:50.758 --> 00:10:51.579\nI know that sounds weird.\n\n186\n00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:52.528\n&gt;&gt; Sguil?\n\n187\n00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:54.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's actually one that's\ncalled Sguil that we'll get into.\n\n188\n00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:57.950\nIt's a network security monitoring\ntool that's designed for\n\n189\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.841\nlive capture,\nif you have the ability to do that.\n\n190\n00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:04.080\nAnd we'll see that in another episode,\nlater on.\n\n191\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.255\nBut for what we're doing, right, is we\nwanna take something that I know that\n\n192\n00:11:08.255 --> 00:11:10.776\nactually has captured\nsome bad information.\n\n193\n00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:13.968\nAnd I want us to be able to examine it and\ntake a look at the output of it,\n\n194\n00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.461\nand Wireshark is a great\nutility to help us to do that.\n\n195\n00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:20.900\nRemember that in terms of working\nas security analysts, right,\n\n196\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.865\nthe goal always is to stop\nsomething from ever happening.\n\n197\n00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:26.344\nAnd that's great when we can do it.\n\n198\n00:11:26.344 --> 00:11:28.965\nBut even if we don't stop it,\nit's to try and\n\n199\n00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:31.388\nstop it in mitigation if at all possible.\n\n200\n00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:34.515\nIn other words, while it's happening,\nwe wanna cut the attack off so\n\n201\n00:11:34.515 --> 00:11:35.903\nthat nothing else is damaged.\n\n202\n00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:40.538\nBut what if we can't catch it,\nthen we still want to learn from it.\n\n203\n00:11:40.538 --> 00:11:45.517\nSo in the realm of cyber ops,\nand the idea of network security\n\n204\n00:11:45.517 --> 00:11:50.511\nmonitoring, is not enough just to say,\nI got good defense.\n\n205\n00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:54.608\nIt is about the idea of actually having\nthat good defense and good compliance.\n\n206\n00:11:54.608 --> 00:11:59.051\nIt's about the idea of actually trying to\ndo real active mitigation, and lastly,\n\n207\n00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:03.496\nif nothing else, learning from it, so\nthat the next time something comes around,\n\n208\n00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:05.228\nwe can actually spot it better.\n\n209\n00:12:05.228 --> 00:12:09.255\nSo we're looking at it from every aspect\nof an attack, instead of just going, ha,\n\n210\n00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:12.032\nI stopped that attack, and\nnot learning anything else.\n\n211\n00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:15.531\nSo we're kind of taking a look at it\nfrom that kind of post phase now.\n\n212\n00:12:15.531 --> 00:12:19.140\nBut it really is helpful, because\nhopefully this will help you also to be\n\n213\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.886\nable to spot things in the future,\nas you might come across them, as well.\n\n214\n00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:25.910\nSo I simply went back to\nmy Kali Linux machine, and\n\n215\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.081\nwe're gonna use Wireshark again.\n\n216\n00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.960\nAnd I've pulled up another capture, and\n\n217\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.180\nthat's been previously\nout there to help us.\n\n218\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.143\nSo if I already have a capture that's\ndone, and I want to learn a little bit\n\n219\n00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:43.865\nmore from it, as long as it's in what\nthey call a PCAP extension file,\n\n220\n00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:46.688\nI can then go to File and\nthen select Open.\n\n221\n00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:49.884\nAnd if I remember where it is,\nand that's the key part,\n\n222\n00:12:49.884 --> 00:12:51.929\nis remembering where it is, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:55.100\nWhich is right there, and you can see\nright here where it's actually PCAP.\n\n224\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.286\nThis is from January 9 of 2015,\nand that's fine.\n\n225\n00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:04.254\nAnd I like this, because it means I'm\nnot actually exposing my machine to any\n\n226\n00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:05.943\nreal damage that goes on.\n\n227\n00:13:05.943 --> 00:13:09.917\nBut we can see just a little\nbit of information, and\n\n228\n00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:12.977\nall the component stuff that comes in.\n\n229\n00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:17.080\nThere's about 503 packets\nthat we'll actually see here.\n\n230\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.696\nAnd there's a couple of things\nthat we want to start noticing,\n\n231\n00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:22.480\nas we start to take a look here.\n\n232\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.588\nSo I am just gonna do that http,\njust like I did a little bit earlier.\n\n233\n00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:29.447\nThat way we can start to\nsee some information,\n\n234\n00:13:29.447 --> 00:13:32.098\nwhat can be manipulated and changed here.\n\n235\n00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:36.601\nSo as I take a look in comparison to the\ndifference between something legitimate\n\n236\n00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:40.850\nthat we saw, let's take a look at this\nfirst idea of GET right here, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.797\nSo notice we saw that GET, and\nnotice there's a POST here as well.\n\n238\n00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:48.681\nSo we see some information, but\ntake a look at that GET, and\n\n239\n00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:54.765\nnotice that there is something little\nbit more random about this, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:57.977\nSo when it's actually retrieving\nsomething, when we're\n\n241\n00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:02.683\nactually telling it that it needed to go\nand say, hey, here's what I'm looking for.\n\n242\n00:14:02.683 --> 00:14:06.389\nNow if I take a look inside\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol,\n\n243\n00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:10.979\nI can see that right here it said,\ngo ahead and retrieve for me this, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:15.270\nNow, this is kinda the key and\nclue right here, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.613\nSwf, this is some type of flash file,\nokay?\n\n246\n00:14:19.613 --> 00:14:23.487\nAdobe Flash, that add-on we have for\njust about every browser that's out there,\n\n247\n00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:25.218\nthat people are trying to get rid of.\n\n248\n00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:28.769\nWell, my browser essentially said,\nGET this file.\n\n249\n00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:32.609\nAnd this runs on my\ncomputer if it gets it.\n\n250\n00:14:32.609 --> 00:14:35.308\nNow, I don't have a clue what this is, and\n\n251\n00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:38.310\nsomebody might be able\nto justify what this is.\n\n252\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:43.086\nBut more that likely, if I'm retrieving\na file, I should at least know what it is.\n\n253\n00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:44.401\nBut notice this one,\n\n254\n00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:48.942\nI can even repeat that to tell you again\nwhat something like this might be.\n\n255\n00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:51.385\nSo it lets you know that, too.\n\n256\n00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:55.499\nThe other thing that we were\ntalking about a little bit earlier,\n\n257\n00:14:55.499 --> 00:15:00.083\nin terms of methodology, is here\ninside of the referrer field, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:03.678\nNow, it shouldn't be populated at all,\nnormally.\n\n259\n00:15:03.678 --> 00:15:07.321\nMost of the time when we talk about\nusing the idea of the referrer field,\n\n260\n00:15:07.321 --> 00:15:10.549\nwe normally do not want to see\nanything in here, okay, at all.\n\n261\n00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:12.197\nBut you can.\n\n262\n00:15:12.197 --> 00:15:15.252\nAnd here,\nyou're starting to see something, and\n\n263\n00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:17.604\nlet's say that I realized something.\n\n264\n00:15:17.604 --> 00:15:20.328\nLet's say, okay,\nwe accept the fact that referrer field.\n\n265\n00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:23.703\nWe know where it's actually going to\nrefer us to, or what's happening here.\n\n266\n00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:27.260\nBut notice this,\n\n267\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.533\nopushangszer.hu.\n\n268\n00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:36.595\nEven in all realms of possibilities-\n&gt;&gt; Hungary?\n\n269\n00:15:36.595 --> 00:15:37.623\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, Hungary.\n\n270\n00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:39.319\nAll of a sudden you start realizing that.\n\n271\n00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:42.684\nBut then it's like,\nwe don't have a company, and\n\n272\n00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:45.676\nI don't know why we would\never be going here.\n\n273\n00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:48.485\nThat kind of lets you know something else,\nas well.\n\n274\n00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:53.771\nThis field can also let somebody\nelse know, and let a browser know,\n\n275\n00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:59.540\nokay, the past history of where you\nhave been connecting before as well.\n\n276\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.253\nSo even this referer, the one that's\nmisspelled right here, right?\n\n277\n00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:03.858\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n278\n00:16:03.858 --> 00:16:06.765\n&gt;&gt; It has that ability\nto essentially do that,\n\n279\n00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:09.525\nto reveal the last site that you visited.\n\n280\n00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:13.952\nAnd it's saying, hey, let's go ahead and\nsend that information too.\n\n281\n00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:18.369\nAlso, if the site has bad coding, right\nhere, we can also send a session cookie,\n\n282\n00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:21.650\nwhich shows you information\nthat don't need to be in there.\n\n283\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.709\nUser name and password,\nit can get all that information.\n\n284\n00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:27.466\nIt can even do some other things.\n\n285\n00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:31.795\nSo we are starting to see a lot in just\nthat line of information that we see.\n\n286\n00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:34.752\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, is that telling you\nthere's some redirection there?\n\n287\n00:16:34.752 --> 00:16:39.251\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily redirection, but\nenough information to say look.\n\n288\n00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:43.583\nInformation can be sent through this\nfield and that refer field is kind of\n\n289\n00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:47.278\ntelling you either this is the last\nsight that we've been to or\n\n290\n00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:50.283\nthis is where information\ncan ultimately end up.\n\n291\n00:16:50.283 --> 00:16:50.883\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n292\n00:16:50.883 --> 00:16:55.606\nSo just be aware of just understanding\nwhen you start seeing this.\n\n293\n00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:58.650\nNow here we start to see\nthe application too, right?\n\n294\n00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.043\nThe application field that we see,\nokay, this is good, but\n\n295\n00:17:03.043 --> 00:17:06.846\nnotice that it says\nApplication X Shockwave Flash.\n\n296\n00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:12.590\nIt also lets us know what particular\ntype of content it is expecting to see.\n\n297\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.225\nNow, you might go, is this good or bad?\n\n298\n00:17:15.225 --> 00:17:17.600\nIt's not good or bad by itself.\n\n299\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.290\nBut you do have to kind of worry.\n\n300\n00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.736\nMost of the time because there are so\nmany vulnerable in flash.\n\n301\n00:17:22.736 --> 00:17:26.471\nIs this something you really want\nyour web browser looking for, right?\n\n302\n00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:28.819\nThe content type is\nthere something in here.\n\n303\n00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:31.880\nIt is your web browser saying\nthis is the type of content that\n\n304\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.239\nI'm really looking for.\n\n305\n00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:37.586\nIt's what called content sniffing and\nit is saying I am willing to go out and\n\n306\n00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:41.812\ntry and announce, here's what I'm\nreally looking for, give me that.\n\n307\n00:17:41.812 --> 00:17:44.453\nThis is where somebody can take\nadvantage of that information\n\n308\n00:17:44.453 --> 00:17:46.195\nthat comes across there as well, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:49.780\nSo just, when you start to see that.\n\n310\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.080\nAnd now, here's where we get the post,\nokay, remember what we said about post.\n\n311\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.058\nThink about it in terms of a form, right?\n\n312\n00:17:56.058 --> 00:18:01.288\nThat you're submitting information to\ndo something like this as you do that.\n\n313\n00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:04.305\nSo here it is inside of this one.\n\n314\n00:18:04.305 --> 00:18:08.176\nWe see the posting of information.\n\n315\n00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:12.060\nAnd now you start seeing where it's\nactually getting some information\n\n316\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.983\nsomewhere and\nposting that into something else too.\n\n317\n00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:19.517\nSo there is a lot, and\nhere is some other things that where we\n\n318\n00:18:19.517 --> 00:18:23.898\ndon't normally see you know\nright there as well, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:23.898 --> 00:18:28.917\nSo you start to look and you start\nto wonder like what in the world is\n\n320\n00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:34.486\ngoing on with all this kind of very\nunusual nature of getting this site and\n\n321\n00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:38.503\nthen getting to a link like this D2A42EF,\nyeah,\n\n322\n00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:41.728\nsomething like this is a little bit long.\n\n323\n00:18:41.728 --> 00:18:45.625\nAnd the return code to it,\nthis is where you start to kinda go.\n\n324\n00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:49.089\nSomething else is happening here,\nokay, that in portion.\n\n325\n00:18:49.089 --> 00:18:51.492\nAnd then it retrieves something else.\n\n326\n00:18:51.492 --> 00:18:55.057\nNotice it actually got something\nelse that came across.\n\n327\n00:18:55.057 --> 00:18:57.299\nAnd then even more, and more.\n\n328\n00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:01.096\nAnd this is where you start to notice\nthat, hey it really got a hold of this\n\n329\n00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:04.170\nparticular machine pretty\ngood as we've started to see.\n\n330\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.144\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I don't wanna jump\nahead of ourselves here, but, so\n\n331\n00:19:08.144 --> 00:19:11.903\nlet's say we were doing this in\nreal time where we saw this.\n\n332\n00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:13.512\nWhat would be your next course of action?\n\n333\n00:19:13.512 --> 00:19:18.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, your next course of action of\ncourse then especially as an analyst at\n\n334\n00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:21.882\ntype 1 is to kind of escalate that\nis what you would end up doing.\n\n335\n00:19:21.882 --> 00:19:25.144\nAnd it should go through that process,\nideally, right,\n\n336\n00:19:25.144 --> 00:19:29.751\nin your center if you have all the tools\nthat are available, you don't need that.\n\n337\n00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.719\nSome type of automated process\nhopefully has kicked in already.\n\n338\n00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:34.738\nSo once it spots it, it identifies it.\n\n339\n00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:37.736\nAnd once it identifies it,\nit rates it, and then it goes,\n\n340\n00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:40.323\nall right,\nif it's got this rating it goes here.\n\n341\n00:19:40.323 --> 00:19:42.710\nOr it's known as being this, it goes here.\n\n342\n00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.354\nWhether it might be automated is always\nbetter than actually having to escalate.\n\n343\n00:19:46.354 --> 00:19:51.128\nBut it's all about that system that's\nin place for you inside that security\n\n344\n00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:55.764\noperation center of what happens when\nsomething like this comes across.\n\n345\n00:19:55.764 --> 00:19:58.610\nSo those particular\nsecurity monitoring tools,\n\n346\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.198\nthat's what you would see pop up and\nwhat you're hoping for and\n\n347\n00:20:02.198 --> 00:20:05.804\nwhat everything is hopefully set up for\nif you're doing that.\n\n348\n00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:09.074\nIs that it's saying I did see\nthis come across the screen,\n\n349\n00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:13.277\nhere's the next action that happened and\nnormally that would be sent off to\n\n350\n00:20:13.277 --> 00:20:16.097\nsome kind of intervention\ndevice will then stop.\n\n351\n00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:18.898\n&gt;&gt; In a container maybe?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, but it's analysis and\n\n352\n00:20:18.898 --> 00:20:21.444\nstopping and\nwhat you have to figure out is\n\n353\n00:20:21.444 --> 00:20:24.880\nwhat's actually the best\naction at that point of time.\n\n354\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.891\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, is it\n\n355\n00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.169\n&gt;&gt; Is it something that's just\n\n356\n00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:30.751\ninteresting for us, or is it something\nthat, we don't know what's going on?\n\n357\n00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:34.035\nIf it's something we don't understand\nwhat's happening, we'll take that, and\n\n358\n00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:35.746\nwe'll send it into what\nwe call a honeypot,\n\n359\n00:20:35.746 --> 00:20:37.525\nto allow it to explode there, okay?\n\n360\n00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:39.048\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; And then that way,\n\n361\n00:20:39.048 --> 00:20:41.249\nwe can see what the results of it will be.\n\n362\n00:20:41.249 --> 00:20:44.887\nIf this is something that's known,\nwe may not choose to go that route and\n\n363\n00:20:44.887 --> 00:20:48.303\ngo It just needs to be stopped,\nwe understand exactly what this is.\n\n364\n00:20:48.303 --> 00:20:49.814\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll see that as well, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:49.814 --> 00:20:54.485\nSo this is good in us examining what we\nnormally would see inside of something\n\n366\n00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:55.220\nlike HTTP.\n\n367\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:00.001\nNow, I didn't show you every single field,\nI just showed you a couple because\n\n368\n00:21:00.001 --> 00:21:05.146\nthat's all that came across here, but you\ncan see why it's so different than what we\n\n369\n00:21:05.146 --> 00:21:10.246\nnormally do end up seeing in those regular\nmethods that we've been talking about.\n\n370\n00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:14.408\nSo it just explodes a lot more, there's\na ton more content that comes across it.\n\n371\n00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:17.887\nAnd you'll even see at times\nwhere data wash should be so\n\n372\n00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:22.642\nmuch filled in that get requests are\ninside of the response that comes back.\n\n373\n00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:26.943\nI mean, it's just overwhelming at\nhow much can actually be sent there.\n\n374\n00:21:26.943 --> 00:21:31.076\nSo there a couple of different things\nthere that we wanna make sure we pointed\n\n375\n00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:33.350\nout, and be able to see that, all right?\n\n376\n00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.349\nSo what are some of the other things we\ndefinitely need to point out in terms\n\n377\n00:21:37.349 --> 00:21:38.841\nof vulnerabilities then.\n\n378\n00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:42.387\nWell, let's go ahead and check this\nout cuz I kind of mentioned it, right?\n\n379\n00:21:42.387 --> 00:21:43.781\nThat content type field.\n\n380\n00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:48.768\nThis is your browser essentially\ndoing what we call content sniffing.\n\n381\n00:21:48.768 --> 00:21:52.191\nReally telling the web server, hey,\nthis is what I'm really looking for.\n\n382\n00:21:52.191 --> 00:21:55.403\nHere's what I hope to find.\n\n383\n00:21:55.403 --> 00:21:57.303\nAnyone can take advantage of that.\n\n384\n00:21:57.303 --> 00:21:59.936\nIf you tell them what to find,\nyou tell a good salesman,\n\n385\n00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:03.298\nthis is what I hope to find, he's\ngonna figure out how to get it to you.\n\n386\n00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what he's gonna do.\n\n387\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.529\nAnd in this one so it may be where you\nhave to look at how to hard something like\n\n388\n00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:11.992\nthis so\npeople don't take advantage of that.\n\n389\n00:22:11.992 --> 00:22:16.947\nBut just realize that a lot of time in\nthis one, it actually just kinda give you\n\n390\n00:22:16.947 --> 00:22:21.770\nthat field, and you'll probably see\nsomething that says, no sniffing.\n\n391\n00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.323\nIn other words,\ndon't announce what you're looking for.\n\n392\n00:22:24.323 --> 00:22:26.451\nJust don't do it, then do that.\n\n393\n00:22:26.451 --> 00:22:31.241\nThe other one that's here is kind of neat,\ntoo, which is the User-Agent and\n\n394\n00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:32.359\nbrowser, okay?\n\n395\n00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:36.381\nThe User-Agent essentially announces\nto the server what browser,\n\n396\n00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:41.387\nwhat operating system, and what language\nthat you're actually running on, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:41.387 --> 00:22:44.508\nAnd that's done for\nstatistical information.\n\n398\n00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:49.607\nBut it also allows somebody that's an\nattacker to be able to find that out and\n\n399\n00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:54.638\nto see if you're actually running\nperhaps on an older unsecured browser.\n\n400\n00:22:54.638 --> 00:22:57.473\nIn other words, something that\nhas a vulnerability on it and\n\n401\n00:22:57.473 --> 00:22:59.539\nyour machine is just announcing it, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:04.953\nThe unusual thing about this is that it\ncan also be manipulated to to the point\n\n403\n00:23:04.953 --> 00:23:11.148\nwere is actually kind of weird, if we can\ntry and capture this, if that'll possible.\n\n404\n00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:14.005\nSo let me step out of this here right now,\nand\n\n405\n00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:17.734\nlet's see if I can manipulate\nthis field up here, okay?\n\n406\n00:23:17.734 --> 00:23:22.264\nSo, my browser, I'm running \"Firefox\"\ninstead of \"Kali\" is the one that default\n\n407\n00:23:22.264 --> 00:23:23.764\ncomes with Kali Linux here.\n\n408\n00:23:23.764 --> 00:23:28.453\nIf I go to this little hamburger button\nover in the upper right hand corner and\n\n409\n00:23:28.453 --> 00:23:32.648\nthen I select developer,\nI think I'm actually in the right place.\n\n410\n00:23:32.648 --> 00:23:35.476\nI could be in the wrong place here.\n\n411\n00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:38.610\nActually, I'm going to the wrong place.\nI'm going to the one that's actually in\n\n412\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.249\nChrome.\n\n413\n00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:40.756\nSee, I'm doing the wrong one.\n\n414\n00:23:40.756 --> 00:23:42.189\nSo it's up here in the address bar.\n\n415\n00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:48.622\nSo I need to actually type\nin About colon config, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:48.622 --> 00:23:52.368\nThis will get me into the area that I can\nmanipulate what my browser's actually\n\n417\n00:23:52.368 --> 00:23:53.006\nreporting.\n\n418\n00:23:53.006 --> 00:23:57.457\nNow it says, hey, are you sure and\nlook at the warning.\n\n419\n00:23:57.457 --> 00:23:59.973\nThis might void your warranty.\n\n420\n00:23:59.973 --> 00:24:01.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My goodness.\n\n421\n00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:03.610\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of scary at that point.\n\n422\n00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.733\nSo you have to kind of just, they're\ntelling you, back off, don't do this,\n\n423\n00:24:07.733 --> 00:24:09.927\nso if you don't know what you're doing.\n\n424\n00:24:09.927 --> 00:24:10.917\n&gt;&gt; Danger, danger.\n\n425\n00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:14.886\n&gt;&gt; But that's never stopped me before,\nso why not, so\n\n426\n00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:20.764\nat this particular point here, I'm\ngonna do a search for user agent, okay?\n\n427\n00:24:20.764 --> 00:24:24.239\nWhen I select user agent\nhere inside of Firefox,\n\n428\n00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:28.836\nyou may end up finding a couple\nof different things here, okay?\n\n429\n00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:32.336\nSo here's kind of the defaults,\nand it tells you, right,\n\n430\n00:24:32.336 --> 00:24:34.230\nthe status is the default here.\n\n431\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.483\nDev tools, this, this,\nyeah, yeah, okay, so\n\n432\n00:24:37.483 --> 00:24:40.200\nwe see user agents pretty much down here.\n\n433\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.231\nCompatibility mode,\nuser agent locale, ours is set to US,\n\n434\n00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:48.037\nsite specific overrides,\nI'm not worried about that.\n\n435\n00:24:48.037 --> 00:24:52.280\nI want my browser to report as\na different browser besides Firefox,\n\n436\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.554\nis what I want to do.\n\n437\n00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:57.187\nSo if I right click,\nI select New &gt; String,\n\n438\n00:24:57.187 --> 00:25:02.996\nit's here that I have to get the syntax\na little bit more careful here.\n\n439\n00:25:02.996 --> 00:25:08.022\nAnd this is where I have to type in\n\n440\n00:25:08.022 --> 00:25:15.855\ngeneral.useragent.override, and click OK.\n\n441\n00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:20.244\nNow I enter in the value that I want,\nnow this is where you do a little bit\n\n442\n00:25:20.244 --> 00:25:23.610\nmore research,\ncuz it has to be in a specific format.\n\n443\n00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.076\nSo I want it to report as\n\n444\n00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:33.726\nWindows-RSS-Platform.\n\n445\n00:25:40.337 --> 00:25:41.774\n/2.0.\n\n446\n00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:49.422\nThen I'm going to tell\nit that this is going to\n\n447\n00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:54.402\nbe Internet Explorer 11.0 colon, and\n\n448\n00:25:54.402 --> 00:25:59.265\nthat this is a Windows NT 6.1 machine.\n\n449\n00:25:59.265 --> 00:26:05.227\nSo here I'm now announcing as\nthe override of what I'm on,\n\n450\n00:26:05.227 --> 00:26:09.532\nwhich is a Kali Linux box, which is Linux.\n\n451\n00:26:09.532 --> 00:26:13.507\nAnd the browser, which is actually\nsupposed to Firefox here, and\n\n452\n00:26:13.507 --> 00:26:14.790\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n453\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:22.575\nAnd that now sets it up as being\nWindows RSS Platform 2.0, this.\n\n454\n00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:28.881\nSo now, let's do this,\nlet's close all this here,\n\n455\n00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:35.482\nlet's open up,\nI'm gonna say trusty Wireshark here.\n\n456\n00:26:35.482 --> 00:26:39.269\nIt has not been as trustworthy for\nme today as I'd want it to be, but\n\n457\n00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:42.867\nwe'll let it go here,\nI'm not gonna hold grudges against it.\n\n458\n00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:46.856\nI'm gonna launch up Wireshark here, and\n\n459\n00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:51.423\nthen I'm just gonna open\nup our browser again.\n\n460\n00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:54.740\nHopefully I actually clicked OK,\nI don't even remember if I did or not, so\n\n461\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.231\nwe'll all know here in a moment.\n\n462\n00:26:56.231 --> 00:27:00.621\nWe'll bring back our own\nwebsite in a shameless plug.\n\n463\n00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:01.255\n&gt;&gt; It's a great website.\n\n464\n00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:05.476\n&gt;&gt; Because it's a great website,\nokay, so we'll do that, that's good.\n\n465\n00:27:05.476 --> 00:27:07.288\nNow we'll simply close that out,\n\n466\n00:27:07.288 --> 00:27:10.171\nand let's see if we actually\nget CNN.com back [LAUGH].\n\n467\n00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:12.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, you're probably going,\n\n468\n00:27:12.996 --> 00:27:13.737\nwhat was that about?\n\n469\n00:27:13.737 --> 00:27:14.672\nDon't worry about it,\n\n470\n00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:17.109\nit was a joke that happened\na little bit earlier in our series.\n\n471\n00:27:17.109 --> 00:27:17.823\n&gt;&gt; Inside joke.\n\n472\n00:27:17.823 --> 00:27:21.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here we go, so\nwe are back, and we are ready to go.\n\n473\n00:27:21.997 --> 00:27:28.054\nLet's see if I can get to one of our\nwebsite requests right here somewhere,\n\n474\n00:27:28.054 --> 00:27:30.376\nthere should be something.\n\n475\n00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:34.594\nLet me see if I can do an HTTP and\nsee if that comes up for us.\n\n476\n00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:45.918\nAll right, so now just by doing that,\nokay, I want you to take a look at how\n\n477\n00:27:45.918 --> 00:27:50.859\nthis Kali Linux machine is reporting\nitself over to the server, okay.\n\n478\n00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:54.700\nNotice it's reporting itself\nas a Windows machine,\n\n479\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.310\nit's reporting that it's actually\nrunning Internet Explorer\n\n480\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:04.106\n11 on a Windows 6.1 platform,\nwhich is Windows 10 I think.\n\n481\n00:28:04.106 --> 00:28:10.453\nSo it is reporting all that, yet I'm on a\nKali Linux machine browsing using Firefox.\n\n482\n00:28:10.453 --> 00:28:13.917\nOkay, so it can manipulated,\nit can be changed,\n\n483\n00:28:13.917 --> 00:28:19.452\nsomebody can override this stuff, and\nit cause some complications in the end.\n\n484\n00:28:19.452 --> 00:28:21.968\nBut you might be wondering\nwhy in the world is this\n\n485\n00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:23.973\nbecause it really wants\nto be able to do that.\n\n486\n00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:28.136\nThere are certain sites that are designed\nand, for best use, run whatever,\n\n487\n00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:32.060\nInternet Explorer 11, I don't know\nanybody that's ever said that.\n\n488\n00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:37.046\nBut for whatever the usage is, right,\nbut it is, and there are some business\n\n489\n00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:42.294\nwebsites out there, internal, that only\nrun on that particular version of it.\n\n490\n00:28:42.294 --> 00:28:46.882\nWhat if you can't get access to that\nversion, and there is an older version,\n\n491\n00:28:46.882 --> 00:28:51.045\nwell, this is saying, go ahead,\nreport yourself as that version and\n\n492\n00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:54.880\nlet's see what turns up,\neven if I'm running something else.\n\n493\n00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.187\nSo you can see where fields like\nthis inside of the HTTP header\n\n494\n00:28:59.187 --> 00:29:03.919\ninformation can be manipulated and\nchanged very simply here, and\n\n495\n00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:07.151\nthis is where an attacker\ncan gain a benefit.\n\n496\n00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:11.925\nAll right, Zack, once again, I have raced\nthe clock and I have made it submit, and\n\n497\n00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:14.740\nI thought I was gonna\nactually get through this.\n\n498\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.197\nBut it looks like I'm gonna need\na part three on this, Zack, so\n\n499\n00:29:18.197 --> 00:29:21.610\nlet me go ahead and stop right\nhere before I kind of get too far.\n\n500\n00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.275\n&gt;&gt; No Ronnie, you're doing a wonderful\njob, and I love it when you take us step\n\n501\n00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:28.162\nby step, and make the hard to\nunderstand understandable.\n\n502\n00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:31.348\nThis is describe HTTP headers part two,\nthere was a part one,\n\n503\n00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:33.075\nmake sure you watch both of them.\n\n504\n00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:35.421\nThere will be a part three, and\nbefore you move on, Ronnie,\n\n505\n00:29:35.421 --> 00:29:36.759\nanything else you'd like to add?\n\n506\n00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:37.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just remember,\n\n507\n00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.538\nthere's a lot of different things\nwe're taking a look at here, and\n\n508\n00:29:40.538 --> 00:29:43.750\nsomebody in our chatroom did point out,\nRonnie, you misspelled platform.\n\n509\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.967\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I just realized that,\n\n510\n00:29:44.967 --> 00:29:47.459\nI looked it up, I was like, great,\nbut you kind of get the idea.\n\n511\n00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.963\nYou can put whatever you want in that\nfield, somebody that misspells platform,\n\n512\n00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:52.160\nI want you to know, right.\n\n513\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.841\nIf you're looking at this as an analyst,\nthat should be a key, okay.\n\n514\n00:29:56.841 --> 00:29:58.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ding.\n\n515\n00:29:58.681 --> 00:29:59.412\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Jim.\n\n516\n00:29:59.412 --> 00:30:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some attacker out there is, they\ncan't spell, and more than likely, if you\n\n517\n00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:07.725\nsee it again somewhere, it's probably\nRonnie Wong, cuz he probably can't spell.\n\n518\n00:30:07.725 --> 00:30:08.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n519\n00:30:08.296 --> 00:30:12.330\nyou at least can even identify who\nyour attacker is easily, but overall,\n\n520\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.553\nthough, take a look at those concepts.\n\n521\n00:30:14.553 --> 00:30:18.478\nDon't be afraid to try some of this, there\nare plenty of pcap files that are out\n\n522\n00:30:18.478 --> 00:30:20.757\nthere on the internet\nthat you can download.\n\n523\n00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.652\nIf you go,\nI don't want to infect my machine,\n\n524\n00:30:22.652 --> 00:30:24.364\nnone of us want to infect our own machine.\n\n525\n00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:29.355\nBut if you want to take a look\nat the analysis, I've mentioned\n\n526\n00:30:29.355 --> 00:30:34.349\nthis website before,\nmalware-traffic-analysis.net.\n\n527\n00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:38.750\nI know that's long, but that's something\nthat can help you to get more familiar and\n\n528\n00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.245\nbetter at using Wireshark.\n\n529\n00:30:40.245 --> 00:30:43.779\nAs far as the malicious content goes,\nwe can all get better just using it,\n\n530\n00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:45.034\njust trying to look at it.\n\n531\n00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:49.294\nBut if you want to take a look at what\nthe malicious stuff looks like in a,\n\n532\n00:30:49.294 --> 00:30:52.702\nI'm going to say relatively,\nin a relatively safe way,\n\n533\n00:30:52.702 --> 00:30:55.765\nthis is at least one that\nwill show you that output.\n\n534\n00:30:55.765 --> 00:30:59.922\nNow, is there stuff in there that can\nharm, yes, and they'll mark it, it says,\n\n535\n00:30:59.922 --> 00:31:02.717\nbe careful here,\ndon't allow the executable to run.\n\n536\n00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:07.146\nBut just kind of be aware that you\ncan do this, so take a look at that.\n\n537\n00:31:07.146 --> 00:31:10.576\nThe output's gonna be very important\nas you get ready for the exam as well.\n\n538\n00:31:10.576 --> 00:31:14.747\nBut understanding the vulnerabilities is\nkey, and some of the output that we showed\n\n539\n00:31:14.747 --> 00:31:18.761\nyou today, and the ability to have that\nchange is what we want to understand too.\n\n540\n00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:22.248\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, describe HTTP\nheaders part three, coming up.\n\n541\n00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:26.931\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Cisco SecOps series,\n\n542\n00:31:26.931 --> 00:31:29.556\nyou're gonna be very glad that you did.\n\n543\n00:31:29.556 --> 00:31:32.257\nAnd make sure you tell\na friend about ITProTV,\n\n544\n00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:36.767\nthey'll be really glad that you did\ntell them about ITProTV, I'm Zach Memos\n\n545\n00:31:36.767 --> 00:31:37.653\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n546\n00:31:37.653 --> 00:31:40.595\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for watching,\nand we'll see you soon.\n\n547\n00:31:40.595 --> 00:31:46.632\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:31:46.632 --> 00:31:49.779\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:03.238\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:08.345\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:10.809\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.827\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:16.217\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.385\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.881\nAs we continue on with Cisco SECOPS.\n\n10\n00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:24.203\nAnd this is\nDescribe HTTP Headers Part III.\n\n11\n00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:28.441\nI'm gonna say that again,\nDescribe HTTP Headers Part III.\n\n12\n00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.241\nAnd Ronnie Wong is doing\n\n13\n00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.248\nthis again because he has all\nthe information fit to print.\n\n14\n00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:34.099\nRonnie, good to see you again,\nthanks for being here.\n\n15\n00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\n\n16\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.753\non taking a look at what HTTP headers\n&gt;&gt; And we're kind of moving,\n\n17\n00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:44.413\nnot beyond headers right now, but\njust a little bit further removed and\n\n18\n00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:47.102\ntaking a look at some of\nthe attacks that can be done.\n\n19\n00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:51.238\nAnd we're gonna talk about everyone's\nfavorite subject, of course,\n\n20\n00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:52.335\nwhich is cookies.\n\n21\n00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:52.967\n&gt;&gt; Yum yum!\n\n22\n00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.562\n&gt;&gt; It always sounds delicious\nuntil you talk about them in HTTP.\n\n23\n00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:00.532\nThen they're no longer that delicious,\nlittle morsel that we all love and enjoy.\n\n24\n00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:01.614\nBut overall though,\n\n25\n00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:04.806\nit is an essential part of what\nwe see on the Internet every day.\n\n26\n00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:05.604\n&gt;&gt; Every day.\n\n27\n00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:11.047\n&gt;&gt; And it's also something that people do\nget paranoid about as well, and there's\n\n28\n00:01:11.047 --> 00:01:16.262\ngood reason to do that, but there's\nalso bad reasons to do it as well, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:19.654\nThe world essentially runs on\nheaders as far as the Internet,\n\n30\n00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:23.320\non headers and, of course,\nalso on cookies as far as websites go.\n\n31\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.651\nI don't know if I can say\nboth at the same time.\n\n32\n00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:29.320\nSo we need to understand\nthe headers that are out there and\n\n33\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.773\nthe information that we have.\n\n34\n00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:32.312\nAnd let's go ahead and talk about that.\n\n35\n00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:36.389\nAnd then we'll kind of show you a real\nexample of where they're used as well,\n\n36\n00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:40.861\nand then we'll kind of talk about their\nvulnerabilities that we have, too, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.480\nSo when we start to take a look here,\nokay?\n\n38\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.948\nLet's take a look at my computer, and\nthis will help us out a little bit.\n\n39\n00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.932\nHere's the way that it\nessentially sets up.\n\n40\n00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:53.140\nWhen you first make a connection\nover to the web server,\n\n41\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.946\nyou're not sending over a request for\na cookie.\n\n42\n00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:57.643\nMost of us don't, okay?\n\n43\n00:01:57.643 --> 00:02:00.667\nBut we are making a request, and\nwe want something from that website.\n\n44\n00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.917\nWhen you initially visit that website,\nokay,\n\n45\n00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:08.073\nthat website is gonna have some\ndatabase in the background.\n\n46\n00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:09.376\nIt's not gigantic.\n\n47\n00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:11.390\nI'm not gonna say all the time.\n\n48\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.127\nA lot of time it's not designed\nto really keep track of a lot of\n\n49\n00:02:15.127 --> 00:02:16.680\npersonal information.\n\n50\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.705\nIt is normally designed to keep\ntrack of something that we call for\n\n51\n00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.102\nyour session, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:25.468\nYour state data is what it's\nnormally designed to do.\n\n53\n00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:29.680\nSo your initial visit will create for\nyou a unique ID, okay, and\n\n54\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.258\nan entry into the database for that ID.\n\n55\n00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:35.595\nSo it will actually keep track for\nyou on their own website.\n\n56\n00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:40.762\nThey'll also take that information and\nthey'll send it back to you when you\n\n57\n00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:46.090\nrequest whatever it is in the response and\nthere'll be a cookie header line and\n\n58\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.122\nthere will also of course be attached\non the payload itself, the cookie.\n\n59\n00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:55.708\nThe cookie normally is going to have well,\nat least this in it,\n\n60\n00:02:55.708 --> 00:03:00.131\nthe unique ID, okay,\nthat will be stored on your computer.\n\n61\n00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.291\nYour browser will essentially\nmanage the cookie.\n\n62\n00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:10.829\nWhen you connect back to that website\nto do so, okay, you don't have to go,\n\n63\n00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.939\nI've been here before\n&gt;&gt; And it says, well, I don't know.\n\n64\n00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.929\nLet's restart this whole thing again and\nthen have to reconnect and\n\n65\n00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:23.621\ndo all that stuff again, is simply you\npresent the cookie information, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:28.821\nSo the cookie information the second time\nwill be part of the request this time and\n\n67\n00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:33.803\nthat will actually present you with\nthe same unique ID that was there before.\n\n68\n00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:35.499\nOkay, now let's talk about,\n\n69\n00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.557\nlet's at least show you where we tend\nto see something like this going on.\n\n70\n00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:46.270\nSo let me get back and do,\nMy machine over here, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.382\nSo here it is, I'm running Cali Linux and\nI'm just gonna open up Firefox.\n\n72\n00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:54.847\n&gt;&gt; I've kind of reset everything\nfrom the previous session where\n\n73\n00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:58.313\nI changed the actual user agent,\nwhich is fine.\n\n74\n00:03:58.313 --> 00:03:59.932\nI don't really need to.\n\n75\n00:03:59.932 --> 00:04:04.524\nBut if I just browse back to ITProTv\nright here, okay, what has just happened?\n\n76\n00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:07.260\nThe same thing I just told you,\nZach, okay,\n\n77\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.295\nis that we did the initial request\non ITProTV's backend website.\n\n78\n00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.790\nIt created a unique ID session for\nme, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.633\nWhen it did that,\nit sent it back over to me.\n\n80\n00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:19.875\nNow that I have it on my computer and\nit's stored where it needs to be,\n\n81\n00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.523\nthe browser can use it\nhowever it wants to.\n\n82\n00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:26.810\nThe reason why this is important is\nif I click on Course Library, okay,\n\n83\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.960\nnotice that the link changed here.\n\n84\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.816\nThe URL changed up here at the top.\n\n85\n00:04:30.816 --> 00:04:35.582\nInstead of being ITPro.TV,\nit actually did go to a different page.\n\n86\n00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:39.702\nWell, if we didn't have the cookie\nthere to present me as being\n\n87\n00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:43.044\nthe same session ID or\nthe same unique ID as before,\n\n88\n00:04:43.044 --> 00:04:46.890\nit would probably ask me to log\nin again or do what I need to.\n\n89\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.558\nBut it actually keeps a cookie.\n\n90\n00:04:48.558 --> 00:04:51.414\nSo if I log in, it keeps a cookie\nsaying Ronnie's logged in.\n\n91\n00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:53.773\nSo I don't have to log\nin again on this page.\n\n92\n00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:56.957\nIf I change another page,\nhe doesn't have to log in again on that.\n\n93\n00:04:56.957 --> 00:05:00.969\nIt uses the cookie information to keep\nthat as being the same state information\n\n94\n00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.068\nthat allows me to browse within that\nwebsite to different pages that are there.\n\n95\n00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:09.104\nWe're not having to constantly\npresent information, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.889\nSo that's where cookies\nare normally used effectively and\n\n97\n00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.210\nthe reason why cookies are used in\na business sense is why we do that.\n\n98\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.428\nAnd just when I say that,\nwhat can be in a cookie?\n\n99\n00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:22.658\nAnything that it wants to be, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:22.658 --> 00:05:24.402\nIt really is just a simple text file.\n\n101\n00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:28.989\nBut at the same time, information can be\nretrieved then that can be put into that\n\n102\n00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:31.326\ncookie and sent back somewhere as well.\n\n103\n00:05:31.326 --> 00:05:35.903\nAnd that's why it's something that\npeople kind of get wary about.\n\n104\n00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:40.591\nThe other thing that also happens,\nare what we'll call third-party\n\n105\n00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:44.490\ncookies If we go to another website,\nand this is where we.\n\n106\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.613\nso let me try, we'll do CNN this time,\nokay, in our series here?\n\n107\n00:05:50.613 --> 00:05:53.477\nCNN.com, okay.\n\n108\n00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:56.358\nThis is a site where there is actually\nmore than this that's going on.\n\n109\n00:05:56.358 --> 00:05:59.795\nSo when you start seeing it, right, and\nthis is not all the information from CNN.\n\n110\n00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:03.350\nThere's a lot of advertisements\nthat go through here.\n\n111\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.425\nThere's a lot of other information\nthat's pulled from everywhere across\n\n112\n00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:08.274\nthe Internet.\n\n113\n00:06:08.274 --> 00:06:12.645\nThey could also have said, well,\nI'm gonna send my cookie information, too.\n\n114\n00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.432\nSo you may end up with what\nwe call third party cookies,\n\n115\n00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:19.448\ncookies that you weren't really hoping\nto accept but they send them anyways.\n\n116\n00:06:19.448 --> 00:06:23.368\nBut you don't know where every single\ncookie from this site comes from, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:23.368 --> 00:06:24.440\nI don't.\n\n118\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.150\nAnd look at all that stuff\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n119\n00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.765\nNotice where it says Paid Partner Content?\n\n120\n00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:32.527\nThey want to send information over to\nyour machine to make it easier for\n\n121\n00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:34.523\nthem to browse information as well.\n\n122\n00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:39.295\nSo you have all of this information then,\nthat can then be used and manipulated,\n\n123\n00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:43.525\nand that's something that we also\nwanna make sure that we understand.\n\n124\n00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.232\nSo inside of that cookie,\n\n125\n00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:49.356\npeople can take advantage of that\nif we are not careful, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:53.827\nSo this is where you have to go into your\nbrowser and set up those controls inside\n\n127\n00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:58.724\nof an organization that has something\nlike Microsoft's Active Directory, right?\n\n128\n00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:03.703\nYou can change that group policy level to\nmake it apply to everybody where you don't\n\n129\n00:07:03.703 --> 00:07:08.840\naccept third party cookies or you don't do\nthis, you don't do something like that.\n\n130\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.338\nAnd you can change the privacy settings\nand you can change all that information to\n\n131\n00:07:13.338 --> 00:07:16.268\nmake sure it's locked down\nthe way that you want to.\n\n132\n00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:19.267\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, would you recommend not\naccepting third party cookies?\n\n133\n00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:20.467\n&gt;&gt; I normally don't, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:21.299\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:25.126\n&gt;&gt; If I go to that website, I really only\nwanna communicate with that website.\n\n136\n00:07:25.126 --> 00:07:26.902\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I don't really wanna be sending\n\n137\n00:07:26.902 --> 00:07:29.619\nmy information to anybody else,\nunless I want to.\n\n138\n00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.177\nNow just when I said that, I went here.\n\n139\n00:07:31.177 --> 00:07:35.080\nI'm not accepting every cookie\npossible that's actually out there.\n\n140\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.146\nSo it is there for us in this lab.\n\n141\n00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:40.890\nBut you kind of get this idea\nthat it is all about that.\n\n142\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.184\nNow remember that there are a lot\nof legitimate uses for cookies and\n\n143\n00:07:45.184 --> 00:07:47.724\nthose sites will even tell you, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:50.296\nIf you go to one of those sites and\nit says,\n\n145\n00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:53.319\nhey, we notice that\nyou're blocking cookies.\n\n146\n00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.545\nAnd it tells you, hey,\nI really need this to work.\n\n147\n00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:58.188\nWell, if you're going to that site, and\n\n148\n00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:02.656\nyou really need to view it then let\nthe cookie pass through and do that.\n\n149\n00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:06.066\nThere's plenty of blockers out\nthere that you can download for\n\n150\n00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.488\nyour browser as an add on.\n\n151\n00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:10.596\nBut just be careful, and\nyou'll end up seeing that.\n\n152\n00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:14.528\nThat's another thing that can be\ntaken advantage of in the HTTP world,\n\n153\n00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:16.965\nwhich is the idea of cookies as well,\nokay?\n\n154\n00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:20.675\nNow, Zach, I mentioned that we're not\ngetting into this because we talked about\n\n155\n00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.578\nthis inside the security fundamentals.\n\n156\n00:08:22.578 --> 00:08:27.671\nBut there are also different types of\ninjection attacks that are also out there.\n\n157\n00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.106\nThat come across inside\nof the web browser.\n\n158\n00:08:31.106 --> 00:08:32.292\nWe talk about cross-site scripting.\n\n159\n00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:36.544\nWe talk about SQL or SQL attacks\nthat may actually be out there,\n\n160\n00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:39.442\ncommand injection attacks, you name it.\n\n161\n00:08:39.442 --> 00:08:43.206\nAll these types of injection\nattacks that are out there,\n\n162\n00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:48.932\neven directory traversal attacks that are\nout there, all these are actually possible\n\n163\n00:08:48.932 --> 00:08:54.515\nby simply sometimes manipulating the URL\nthat's inside of the address bar, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:56.110\nAnd this is why it's important.\n\n165\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.616\nIt's important because you have to be\nable to at least go I know some of\n\n166\n00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:03.568\nthe information that should be up there,\nbut\n\n167\n00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:07.704\nI know what I shouldn't see up\nthere in the address bar as well.\n\n168\n00:09:07.704 --> 00:09:12.258\nAnd then the address bar, if you see it,\nand if you see it across a Wireshark\n\n169\n00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:16.254\ncapture, it also means something\nelse is going on, too, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:19.913\nSo let's take a look at something\nwhich is going to start to kind of\n\n171\n00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:22.653\nmaking our eyes squint a little bit more,\nokay.\n\n172\n00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:23.207\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n173\n00:09:23.207 --> 00:09:28.069\nI'm just gonna zoom in a little bit so\nthat we can pay attention.\n\n174\n00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:32.549\nNow all these are, it's not necessary that\nyou memorize them, okay, for the exam.\n\n175\n00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:33.493\nDon't worry about doing them.\n\n176\n00:09:33.493 --> 00:09:34.197\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n177\n00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.837\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it's really.\n\n178\n00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.767\nI want to give you a broad example of\nsome of the things that you might end up\n\n179\n00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:41.676\nseeing, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:45.784\nWhen you start seeing additional\ninformation like this inside of a web\n\n181\n00:09:45.784 --> 00:09:48.581\nbrowser's URL something\nelse maybe going on.\n\n182\n00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:51.810\nAnd so this is why you wanna\nbe careful here, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.990\nNow notice even something like 1 or 1 =1,\n\n184\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.603\nsimple things like this where you\nsee x and then UPDATE, INSERT.\n\n185\n00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:03.363\nYou start seeing stuff like this,\nsomething else may be going on.\n\n186\n00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:08.608\nInside of this next section here, when you\nstart seeing information like this and\n\n187\n00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:12.648\nyou start seeing these dots in\nevery place that you see, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:14.908\nThis is somebody trying to get access and\n\n189\n00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:18.974\nbe on what they're allowed access to\non the web server, okay, as well.\n\n190\n00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:24.125\nNotice the percent signs and this kind\nof unusual repeating pattern here, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:27.313\nYou start seeing this as well and\neven some of these.\n\n192\n00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:29.333\nLet's see over here at the end.\n\n193\n00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:33.747\nThese are not common and\nsomething that is normally legitimate.\n\n194\n00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:36.254\nThis is a sign of some type of an attack,\ntoo.\n\n195\n00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:40.737\nAnd let me see if I can scroll or\nat least zoom down here at the bottom so\n\n196\n00:10:40.737 --> 00:10:42.952\nthat we can see a little bit more.\n\n197\n00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:47.396\nThis is also an example of other types of\nattack that you may also see, too, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:51.309\nNotice the greater than and\nless than symbols, and\n\n199\n00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:55.589\nall this stuff appearing in\nthe way that it does, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.365\nWhen you start seeing all\nthat type of information,\n\n201\n00:10:58.365 --> 00:11:02.099\nthey are symbolic of other types of\nattacks that are out there, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:03.427\n&gt;&gt; It all looks very suspicious.\n\n203\n00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:04.917\n&gt;&gt; And they should.\n\n204\n00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:08.237\nThat's the goal is that they\nshould look suspicious to you.\n\n205\n00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:09.595\nBut at the same time,\n\n206\n00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:14.057\nyou should also be able to identify\nat least what they might be, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:14.057 --> 00:11:18.647\nNow the reason why I wanted to\nput it like this is because Zach,\n\n208\n00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:22.818\nI can't tell you or\nanybody really what's on the exam.\n\n209\n00:11:22.818 --> 00:11:23.762\nI can't.\n\n210\n00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:25.060\nLegally, I cannot do that.\n\n211\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.247\nOkay, but I can sit there and\nat least tell you something like this,\n\n212\n00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:35.616\nthat you should be able to identify\nsome of these different attacks and\n\n213\n00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:39.626\nidentify what type of\ncategory that they belong to.\n\n214\n00:11:39.626 --> 00:11:42.410\nSo something like this is\nactually pretty decently done.\n\n215\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.982\nSo if we were to try and\nmatch something like this up, okay, well,\n\n216\n00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:54.964\nI know that the idea of path traversal,\nand this is pretty darn common here, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.887\nSo I'm pretty sure that that one\nmatches up to path traversal.\n\n218\n00:11:58.887 --> 00:12:03.782\nOkay, the other one because of\nthe words like update and insert,\n\n219\n00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:08.232\nokay, and then even the unusual\nlogic here, the o-ring,\n\n220\n00:12:08.232 --> 00:12:11.526\nthe x-oring that goes\non up here at the top,\n\n221\n00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:16.804\nI know that that's actually part of\na SQL injection attack over here.\n\n222\n00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:22.591\nAnd then down at the bottom is all\nthe angles and the brackets down here,\n\n223\n00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:27.608\nthat actually let me know that\nsomething else is going on, and\n\n224\n00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:32.833\nthat that is part of a cross site\nscripting attack, too, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:38.410\nSo it is being able to do something like\nthis, okay, that I can identify those.\n\n226\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.480\nThat's really gonna help me out,\nespecially when I'm scanning for them and\n\n227\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.121\nI'm doing analysis of\nbeing able to identify it.\n\n228\n00:12:45.121 --> 00:12:47.371\nBut what about those other two?\n\n229\n00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:50.433\nWell, some of them are actually right,\nbut some of them aren't.\n\n230\n00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:54.371\nThe idea of ICMP tunneling, well,\nthat's not doing any of that.\n\n231\n00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.745\nSo I just eliminate that one out.\n\n232\n00:12:55.745 --> 00:13:00.462\nAnd the idea of malware scripting, again,\nis not represented by that either.\n\n233\n00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:04.715\nSo it is possible that you may actually\nseem some of that's where somebody goes,\n\n234\n00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:06.555\nno, that's some type of malware.\n\n235\n00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:08.260\nAnd you go, no, that's not malware.\n\n236\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.956\nThat's definitely a SQL injection attack.\n\n237\n00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:14.600\nNow this one, this is definitely\na path traversal, which I can't say,\n\n238\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.455\ntype of attack.\n\n239\n00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:18.324\nAnd then, even down here on\nthe cross-site scripting,\n\n240\n00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:21.510\nthis is another one that you\nshould be able to identify, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.515\nDon't go overboard and\ngo why memorize all these things?\n\n242\n00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:28.738\nBut understanding and realizing that\nare certain characters that are used\n\n243\n00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:32.423\nin certain attacks that you actually\nkind of be able to identify,\n\n244\n00:13:32.423 --> 00:13:35.036\nI just try to give you\na sampling of what might,\n\n245\n00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:38.474\nwhat you might actually encounter\nin the real world as well.\n\n246\n00:13:38.474 --> 00:13:41.746\nAnd possibly even on the exam\nthat you'll end up seeing,\n\n247\n00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:44.348\nall of these are possibilities here, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:48.412\nSo look for the telltale signs,\nespecially when you see characters.\n\n249\n00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:52.192\nThe path traversal one is the one\nthat looks the easiest to me, and\n\n250\n00:13:52.192 --> 00:13:55.852\nthat's because of the unusual\npatterns that you see, right?\n\n251\n00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:56.492\n&gt;&gt; Chicken scratches.\n\n252\n00:13:56.492 --> 00:14:00.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start seeing the weird,\nto me that's kind of the easy one.\n\n253\n00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:05.008\nI know the SQL ones because I worked with\nSQL for a bit, so I do know that one.\n\n254\n00:14:05.008 --> 00:14:07.933\nBut the one that's confused\nme is probably this one,\n\n255\n00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:10.736\ndown here at the bottom\nof cross-site scripting.\n\n256\n00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:12.301\nOkay, and the reason why is,\n\n257\n00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:16.254\ncuz I'm not as familiar with the idea\nof the cross-site scripting stuff.\n\n258\n00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:20.078\nBut if you take the time and you\nunderstand, and you can look through and\n\n259\n00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:23.357\nsee this, this is what they\ncall encoding types of attacks.\n\n260\n00:14:23.357 --> 00:14:26.604\nThere are more than this, and\nyou actually see that, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:28.348\nThat's a little bit more unusual.\n\n262\n00:14:28.348 --> 00:14:33.019\nSometimes there's actually one that I\ndidn't list here that I probably should\n\n263\n00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:34.423\npoint out here, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:34.423 --> 00:14:38.385\nIs that, when somebody even changes\nthe font inside of the URL, okay,\n\n265\n00:14:38.385 --> 00:14:40.180\nthis could indicate an attack.\n\n266\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.525\nSo instead of it being a true, you know,\nO, they actually change it over to,\n\n267\n00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:51.399\nlet's say like, the cyrillic alphabet, and\nthey change it to what looks like an O.\n\n268\n00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:56.327\nThat could also indicate that they\nhave messed with the actual URL itself\n\n269\n00:14:56.327 --> 00:15:01.028\nto where it's not gonna go to\nthe website you think it's gonna go to.\n\n270\n00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:03.237\nIt's gonna go to the one\nthat they want it to go to.\n\n271\n00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:06.237\nAnd you might not actually\nknow until it's over.\n\n272\n00:15:06.237 --> 00:15:10.315\nSo there are many different ways that\nthe HTTP protocol itself can be taken\n\n273\n00:15:10.315 --> 00:15:11.181\nadvantage of.\n\n274\n00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.236\nAnd inside of at least this\nlittle mini series here, right.\n\n275\n00:15:13.236 --> 00:15:17.624\nWe've taken a look at the idea of using\nthose methods, of talking about of course,\n\n276\n00:15:17.624 --> 00:15:19.203\nthe different headers here.\n\n277\n00:15:19.203 --> 00:15:22.652\nAnd even here at the end talking about\nsome of the different types of attacks\n\n278\n00:15:22.652 --> 00:15:23.922\nthat you may end up seeing.\n\n279\n00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.493\nThough quite a bit of information,\nsomething that as an analyst,\n\n280\n00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.232\nwe should be on the lookout for.\n\n281\n00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:31.768\n&gt;&gt; I love your teaching, Ronnie,\nand I love this diagram as well.\n\n282\n00:15:31.768 --> 00:15:34.666\nI have really enjoyed\nthe Describe HTTP series.\n\n283\n00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:36.010\nThis is part three of Describe HTTP.\n\n284\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.994\nAnd Ronnie, anything else you'd\nlike to add before we move on?\n\n285\n00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:41.113\n&gt;&gt; Well, the idea, right?\n\n286\n00:15:41.113 --> 00:15:43.846\nDon't just accept this as being academics,\nright?\n\n287\n00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:46.530\nYou have to get in there,\ntake a look at the information.\n\n288\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.047\nYou've got enough now of some\nunderstanding of the use of Wireshark.\n\n289\n00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:55.692\nYou have a resource out there like the\nmalware-traffic-analysis.net where you can\n\n290\n00:15:55.692 --> 00:15:57.990\npull those files in and\ntake a look at them.\n\n291\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.081\nUnderstand the basics of HTTP,\ngo back and take a look at that.\n\n292\n00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:06.912\nFilling in that knowledge gap that you\nhave right now is gonna always be better\n\n293\n00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:10.499\nfor you than trying to fill it\nin while you're on the job.\n\n294\n00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:13.545\nSo if you're preparing for\nthat future job, do it now and\n\n295\n00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:16.664\ndon't do it when you're under the gun and\nhaving to do it.\n\n296\n00:16:16.664 --> 00:16:21.059\nDo it right now and that will help you\nout, not only for the exam, but for\n\n297\n00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:23.998\nthat future job that you in have in place,\ntoo.\n\n298\n00:16:23.998 --> 00:16:26.093\nSo take some time and\nlearn how to do this.\n\n299\n00:16:26.093 --> 00:16:27.448\n&gt;&gt; Thanks again, Ronnie.\n\n300\n00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:30.294\nOnce again, Describe HTTP Headers,\nparts one, two and three.\n\n301\n00:16:30.294 --> 00:16:33.314\nAnd that's inside of\nthe Cisco SECSOPS series.\n\n302\n00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:34.745\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n303\n00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:35.817\nYou'll be glad that you did.\n\n304\n00:16:35.817 --> 00:16:37.657\nAnd hey, tell a friend about ITProTV.\n\n305\n00:16:37.657 --> 00:16:39.897\nThey'll thank you, they really will.\n\n306\n00:16:39.897 --> 00:16:40.857\nI'm

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:07.019\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.839\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.647\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:14.468\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:16.860\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.484\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco SECOPS, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:26.463\nright now we're looking at identifying\nNetFlow Version 5 records.\n\n10\n00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:30.517\nPretty cool utility, and who's gonna bring\nus that information, why it's Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.573\nRonnie, good to see you again,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:36.383\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for Zach, for\nhaving me back on the show, as we now take\n\n13\n00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:40.196\na look at another topic, when we continue\nthrough talking about the idea of\n\n14\n00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:44.031\nanalysis, some of the neat tools that\nwe have available to us, of course.\n\n15\n00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.408\nWe've been using Wireshark\nprimarily a lot of places.\n\n16\n00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:47.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.739\n&gt;&gt; We've also, of course,\ntaken a look at the use of Kali Linux,\n\n18\n00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.361\njust a little bit as well, and we've kind\nof avoided the Windows operating system,\n\n19\n00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.056\nand it's not because\nwe're afraid of Windows.\n\n20\n00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:02.016\nBut normally in the analysis part, and in\nthe networking tools part, we're probably\n\n21\n00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:05.179\ngonna stick more to Linux than some\nof these tools that are out there.\n\n22\n00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.840\nSo today though, it's kind of unusual\nin the very fact that we're now\n\n23\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.632\nheading towards what could be\na paid utility instead, or\n\n24\n00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:17.589\na paid tool that we normally see,\nwhich is called NetFlow.\n\n25\n00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:20.375\nNetFlow is a very neat utility Zach.\n\n26\n00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.840\nIf we're not familiar with it, I was\ntrying to describe this to you a little\n\n27\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.436\nbit earlier, so\nlet me describe it again, in this way.\n\n28\n00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:27.168\n&gt;&gt; Please do.\n\n29\n00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:32.691\n&gt;&gt; So, Zach, if you and I ended up\ngetting invited to a party, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.654\n&gt;&gt; That'd be difficult.\n\n31\n00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:38.293\n&gt;&gt; It would be difficult, but if we\nwere invited to a party together, and\n\n32\n00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:43.169\nthere were a 1,000 people there,\nand we looked out across the room,\n\n33\n00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:48.144\nand we noticed that there were two\npeople that were having a conversation.\n\n34\n00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:50.688\nIt'd be difficult for you and I or\neven one of us to actually go,\n\n35\n00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:53.856\nI wondering what they're talking about,\nand actually be able to listen, and\n\n36\n00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:55.296\nhear what they're talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:55.911\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n38\n00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.647\n&gt;&gt; NetFlow though, gives us that ability\nto actually zoom in, or to fill in, drill\n\n39\n00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:05.874\ndown, whatever the terminology you want to\nuse, and essentially filter out everything\n\n40\n00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:10.211\nelse, but what we really want to see\nthere, and be able to go, all right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:14.879\nI wanna see that traffic and that flow of\ndata between that sender, or that source,\n\n42\n00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.561\nand that destination, and\npull the information that I want out.\n\n43\n00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.183\nSo, you might be wondering,\nwell, why is that valuable?\n\n44\n00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:26.872\nIt's valuable because so much data\ngoes across the wires in our network.\n\n45\n00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:29.501\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; There's just a ton of data that goes\n\n46\n00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.063\nacross there, and it flows so quickly.\n\n47\n00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:35.493\nSo in something like Wireshark, when we\ndid a live capture in previous episodes,\n\n48\n00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:37.869\nand Zach, you've seen a few of those-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was great.\n\n49\n00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:42.549\n&gt;&gt; And even different shows, you see\nthat it just rolls by within 90 seconds,\n\n50\n00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.645\nwithin maybe a minute, or\nmaybe even two minutes,\n\n51\n00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:48.835\nwe can get thousands of packets going by-\n&gt;&gt; Lots of packets.\n\n52\n00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.597\n&gt;&gt; And just finding the right\none is a challenge unto itself.\n\n53\n00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:57.231\nSo with NetFlow we can capture that\ninformation, store it, or cache it,\n\n54\n00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:02.388\ntechnically is the proper term, cache it,\nand then we can go back and examine that\n\n55\n00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:07.518\nparticular traffic flow, and make it a\nlittle bit easier for us to learn from it.\n\n56\n00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:08.681\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's great.\n\n57\n00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.712\n&gt;&gt; So that is what net flow\nessentially does for us.\n\n58\n00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.693\nNow it is a valuable technology,\nbecause learning\n\n59\n00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.922\nabout the network in that particular way,\nwith that much information,\n\n60\n00:03:18.922 --> 00:03:23.525\nit essentially provides for us what we\ncall full visibility into our network.\n\n61\n00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.693\nAs long as we have NetFlow turned on\nto those devices that are connecting\n\n62\n00:03:27.693 --> 00:03:32.279\neverything else, then we can actually\nhave that information get captured and\n\n63\n00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.054\ncome about.\n\n64\n00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:34.777\nNow, when I talk about visibility,\n\n65\n00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.733\na lot of times you might we\nwondering what are we talking about.\n\n66\n00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.194\nWell, it's application utilization.\n\n67\n00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:43.118\nWe can find out what applications\nare running on a network.\n\n68\n00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:45.000\nYou go, okay, well, big deal there.\n\n69\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.101\nBut it's not only that, it's the flow,\nit's the information that's flowing\n\n70\n00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:51.886\nbetween that application and\nsomething else as well.\n\n71\n00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:55.509\nSo you combine that together you can find\nout a lot more information, whether or\n\n72\n00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.159\nnot that's high traffic, or\nwhether it's low traffic,\n\n73\n00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.100\nor is that what you're expecting for\nthat application as well.\n\n74\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.051\nThe same thing with your\nregular network utilization.\n\n75\n00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:06.479\nYou might have actually\nset this up in saying,\n\n76\n00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.150\nI think I'm only gonna have this much\namount of traffic on my network,\n\n77\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.514\nand all of a sudden you find yourself\noverwhelmed by the amount of\n\n78\n00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:17.590\ntraffic just connecting there, and\nyou're wondering what's happening.\n\n79\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.087\nWell you can even find out that\nin terms of network utilization,\n\n80\n00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:25.752\nusing NetFlow that helps you to know where\nyour experiencing some different issues in\n\n81\n00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:27.716\nterms of the amount of data as well.\n\n82\n00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:29.464\nProductivity on your network,\n\n83\n00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:33.034\nyou can find out areas that aren't\nas productive as other areas.\n\n84\n00:04:33.034 --> 00:04:35.940\nIn other words, do you have devices\nthat are not configured correctly?\n\n85\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.495\nIt can kind of lead you when all of\na sudden, everything's avoiding the flow\n\n86\n00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:45.069\nof data to that area that you're expecting\nto see the data go through, too.\n\n87\n00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.614\nYou can also, of course,\n\n88\n00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:51.480\nfind out the impact that it makes when you\nadd in different additional equipment.\n\n89\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.900\nSo let's say, Zach, that here it is, that\non our network we realize we wanna add in\n\n90\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.879\nthis brand new piece of equipment, and\nwe're in the middle of a production\n\n91\n00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.228\nnetwork that we have,\nwe don't wanna take down a network, but\n\n92\n00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:06.800\nwe don't want to actually kind of\ntry to get away without doing it.\n\n93\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.125\nSo we wanna see what the impact is,\nif we add this device into it,\n\n94\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:13.771\nit can even show us the impact,\nwhat is does to the rest of our network.\n\n95\n00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.349\nSo NetFlow data can help us to do all\nthat, as well as in the security realm,\n\n96\n00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.473\nto detect things like anomalies.\n\n97\n00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:22.656\nIn other words,\ntraffic that shouldn't be there.\n\n98\n00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:25.234\nIt can help us do that,\nwhich is actually great.\n\n99\n00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:28.848\nEven some of the vulnerabilities that\nwe've been talking about throughout\n\n100\n00:05:28.848 --> 00:05:32.349\nthe SECOPS and the security fundamentals\nseries that we've been doing,\n\n101\n00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.577\nit really helps us out with that too,\nand even test out compliance.\n\n102\n00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:38.850\nDid we set up the proper policies\nthe way that we needed to?\n\n103\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.731\nWere all those things put together?\n\n104\n00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:45.970\nNetFlow can provide enough data, taking\na look at individual flow of information,\n\n105\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.013\nwhether or not we've actually gotten all\nthat stuff done the way that we want to.\n\n106\n00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:56.032\nSo it is a large, gigantic tool that Cisco\ndid come up with, and at one time was\n\n107\n00:05:56.032 --> 00:06:00.919\nonly proprietary, and only available\nto people who would buy into Cisco.\n\n108\n00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.153\nBut people have actually\nstarted using it more, and\n\n109\n00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:05.148\nthe key is that there's\ntwo components to it.\n\n110\n00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:08.974\nYou normally, of course, need those\ndevices that will provide the NetFlow\n\n111\n00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:12.139\ndata, and then you need some type\nof system that will cache it,\n\n112\n00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.284\nand maybe even a third component\nto monitor the information.\n\n113\n00:06:15.284 --> 00:06:18.734\nYou don't always have to actually\nprovide a monitor, you can do it through\n\n114\n00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:22.404\nthe command line, if you're actually very\ngood at being able to understand all\n\n115\n00:06:22.404 --> 00:06:25.949\nthe command line, and actually see\nthe data, and do the analysis that way.\n\n116\n00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.928\nBut most of the time today, there's third\nparty utilities, there's paid utilities,\n\n117\n00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:31.944\nthere's free utilities that are out there,\n\n118\n00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:34.083\nthat can provide you\nsome of that information.\n\n119\n00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:38.582\nThe paid ones will be more feature rich,\nthat's some of the free ones that are out\n\n120\n00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:41.956\nthere, but essentially this is\nwhat it provides for us as far\n\n121\n00:06:41.956 --> 00:06:46.412\nas the ability goes, in terms of what we\nactually need to be able to understand.\n\n122\n00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:47.307\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n123\n00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:51.411\n&gt;&gt; So, let's take a look then at\na diagram that I've created to try and\n\n124\n00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.299\nhelp us to visualize everything\nthat I've been talking about,\n\n125\n00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:58.626\nin the simplest diagram that\nI could actually do here.\n\n126\n00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:02.942\nSo over here on the left hand side,\nI have of course my source,\n\n127\n00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:08.434\nwhich is just a regular client that is\nconnecting, let's say to a web server.\n\n128\n00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:12.955\nWell, normally if I'm on one network,\nand the web server's on another network,\n\n129\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:15.358\nwe're gonna go through probably a router.\n\n130\n00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:18.962\nWe may go through a switch, whatever\nit might be, but we're gonna go through\n\n131\n00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:22.191\na router, so a router, a layer\nthree switch, whatever it might be.\n\n132\n00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:22.911\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.410\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be connected\nin that way somehow.\n\n134\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.025\nIf I'm connected to the Internet, we can\ngo through a lot of different routers, but\n\n135\n00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:34.185\non my network though, if I'm doing that\nI'm probably gonna be using http as\n\n136\n00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:37.371\na protocol or https as a protocol\nto get to my destination,\n\n137\n00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.447\nwhich is the web server over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n138\n00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:43.801\nIt's no big deal if we were to use\nsomething like Wireshark we could see that\n\n139\n00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:44.718\nsame information.\n\n140\n00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:45.369\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n141\n00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:49.460\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt,\nwe can capture that information as well.\n\n142\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.324\nBut, if we take NetFlow, which is\nnormally enabled on a CISCO route,\n\n143\n00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:59.434\nit can be enabled on a CISCO routers IOS,\nAnd it also depends on the version\n\n144\n00:07:59.434 --> 00:08:04.145\nof the IOS that you're running,\nso the version numbers do matter.\n\n145\n00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:07.914\nAnd it depends on whether or\nnot that feature is supported in that IOS.\n\n146\n00:08:07.914 --> 00:08:12.377\nIf it's not, then you won't be able to run\nthe NetFlow versions that you want to.\n\n147\n00:08:12.377 --> 00:08:14.485\nIf it is, then you will be able to.\n\n148\n00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:19.591\nSo don't always go, okay, I'm gonna buy\nthe oldest router that I can from eBay,\n\n149\n00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:21.447\nand expect it to run NetFlow.\n\n150\n00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:25.596\nYou might be able to do some of it, but\na lot of it you may not be able to, so\n\n151\n00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:28.521\ndon't expect that every\nsingle one will have it.\n\n152\n00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.930\nTake a look,\ngo to Cisco's website, and say,\n\n153\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.791\nwhich of the following IOS's allow for\nNetFlow data to be enabled,\n\n154\n00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:40.136\nand to actually be able\nto put that on the port.\n\n155\n00:08:40.136 --> 00:08:45.156\nSo once you get that, now,\nas the information starts to traverse\n\n156\n00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:50.361\nthat device, the NetFlow enabled router or\nswitch will go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:56.050\ncreate a NetFlow record, or\nwhat they call a flow record, technically.\n\n158\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.658\nWith that flow record, now I have to send\nit to some place where it can be cached.\n\n159\n00:09:01.658 --> 00:09:05.782\nSo this is where do you have\nanother machine that may cache it.\n\n160\n00:09:05.782 --> 00:09:08.090\nNow, can the router cache it itself?\n\n161\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.338\nYes, but the router is not really\ndesigned to hold a ton of information.\n\n162\n00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:18.270\nSo you may find yourself actually kind of\nnot being able to cache a lot of it there.\n\n163\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.835\nBut if you do send it off to a device\nthat is designed to capture it or\n\n164\n00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:28.483\nto collect that information, it will then\nprovide for us more is what it will do.\n\n165\n00:09:28.483 --> 00:09:32.694\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, the NetFlow collector is\nan actual device, it's an actual hard?\n\n166\n00:09:32.694 --> 00:09:35.287\n&gt;&gt; Software, is what it actually is.\n\n167\n00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:40.232\nIt's software that ends up running on\nanother machine, usually a machine or\n\n168\n00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:43.210\na PC or a Linux machine or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n169\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.563\nIt's software that captures\nthat information for us.\n\n170\n00:09:46.563 --> 00:09:50.152\nThen we can actually use\nthe management software, or\n\n171\n00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:55.116\na NetFlow viewer, or management console,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n172\n00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:58.598\nIt actually interprets that\ninformation and provides for\n\n173\n00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:02.590\nus filters, provides for\nus the way that we could see if visually.\n\n174\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:07.200\nAnd it just depends on how much\nmoney you're willing to spend.\n\n175\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.153\nAnd I mean that, it really does.\n\n176\n00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:14.294\nThe ones that are basically free,\nwon't provide us much it make sense.\n\n177\n00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:18.057\nBut they'll provide the basics and enough\nthat you're good at the analysis and\n\n178\n00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:20.656\nyou're good at looking at numbers,\nit will help you.\n\n179\n00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:25.488\nBut if you need the more visual aspects of\nit you may find yourself instead looking\n\n180\n00:10:25.488 --> 00:10:27.915\nto pay a little bit more money to do that.\n\n181\n00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:30.302\nAnd that's what will end up happening.\n\n182\n00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:32.803\nSo that's what were talking about.\n\n183\n00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:37.631\nNow when we talk about this idea, now\nthat I've started using the term NetFlow,\n\n184\n00:10:37.631 --> 00:10:40.115\nthe only thing that I haven't defined yet\n\n185\n00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:42.965\nis the idea is what the heck\nis a flow of traffic.\n\n186\n00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:45.214\nAnd that's what we also need to define so\n\n187\n00:10:45.214 --> 00:10:49.198\nthat we can talk about the idea of\npinpointing what we're looking for.\n\n188\n00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:53.365\nSo if we go back, Zach, and we talk about\nthe analogy that I used at the beginning\n\n189\n00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:56.991\nhere about the party and\nus spotting someone having conversations.\n\n190\n00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:00.660\nWell even if afterwards and\nwe talked about saying hey do you remember\n\n191\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.457\nthat conversation that we\nspotted across the room?\n\n192\n00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:07.712\nWell, Zach, let's think about what we'd\nhave to do to actually recreate that\n\n193\n00:11:07.712 --> 00:11:09.945\nconversation if we were try to to do that.\n\n194\n00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:13.333\nWe'd have to know who the two\npeople that were talking, right?\n\n195\n00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:17.812\nWe'd want to know at least what\nthey were conversing about.\n\n196\n00:11:17.812 --> 00:11:18.968\nWhere they were in the room.\n\n197\n00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:21.452\nWe'd want to actually be able to do that.\n\n198\n00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:25.006\nAnd that way, we might be able to\npiece some of that back together,\n\n199\n00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:27.669\nif we were able to catch\nthose two people and try and\n\n200\n00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:30.413\npiece some of that information and\npull it back in.\n\n201\n00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:32.724\nWell, in NetFlow,\nwhen we talk about a flow of data, and\n\n202\n00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:35.483\nthis is where I'm going to type in\na little bit of information here.\n\n203\n00:11:35.483 --> 00:11:36.722\nWhat is a flow?\n\n204\n00:11:36.722 --> 00:11:39.248\nWhat is a flow?\n\n205\n00:11:39.248 --> 00:11:42.823\nAnd that will kind of help us out here.\n\n206\n00:11:42.823 --> 00:11:44.521\nAt least I think it's gonna help us out.\n\n207\n00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:47.249\n&gt;&gt; Flo's also a woman\nthat said kiss my grits.\n\n208\n00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:50.321\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, back in the 70s it was.\n\n209\n00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:51.513\nYou are correct.\n\n210\n00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:53.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm old, I'm telling ya.\n\n211\n00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:58.037\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes down to it,\nthe basic idea here is we have to begin\n\n212\n00:11:58.037 --> 00:12:02.199\nwith that unusual terminology\nthat we've been using\n\n213\n00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:06.372\nthroughout the entirety of\nthe SecOps series so far.\n\n214\n00:12:06.372 --> 00:12:12.275\nIt begins with what we call that IP tuple,\nthe five tuples.\n\n215\n00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:16.199\nThe IP 5-TUPLE of data.\n\n216\n00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:19.492\nAnd so let's make sure that we\nreview this concept once again.\n\n217\n00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:21.792\n&gt;&gt; IP 5-TUPLE information.\n\n218\n00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:27.196\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah, so this is gonna be\nthe Src IP and also the Src port.\n\n219\n00:12:31.554 --> 00:12:36.702\nIt's gonna be the Dst IP,\nand, of course, the Dst port.\n\n220\n00:12:36.702 --> 00:12:40.768\nAnd then the last bit of\ninformation here is, of course,\n\n221\n00:12:40.768 --> 00:12:45.356\ngonna be the protocol, so for\nus, normally, it's TCP or UDP.\n\n222\n00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.496\nUDP, I can spell udp.\n\n223\n00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:50.031\nTrying to type it and talk it.\n\n224\n00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:50.785\n[CROSSTALK].\nYeah, I know,\n\n225\n00:12:50.785 --> 00:12:52.571\nyou would think it'd be easy enough but\n\n226\n00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.344\nsometimes it kind of gets a little\nbit out of order in my mind.\n\n227\n00:12:55.344 --> 00:13:00.195\nSo it normally at least\nincludes that information.\n\n228\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:07.122\nAlso included in the flow of information\nis the Communication Time So\n\n229\n00:13:07.122 --> 00:13:09.963\nessentially time stamps is\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n230\n00:13:09.963 --> 00:13:14.117\nSo it's here that we can talk\nabout the idea of time stamps and\n\n231\n00:13:14.117 --> 00:13:17.142\nalso included in that flow of information.\n\n232\n00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:20.318\nSo it's not enough that we just go,\nall right, those two people,\n\n233\n00:13:20.318 --> 00:13:21.586\nwe have to know a bit more.\n\n234\n00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:26.320\nThat specific port that they're\ncommunicating on, what the conversation,\n\n235\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.255\nthe protocol that we are using,\n\n236\n00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:31.851\nas well as the time that\nthe conversation happened as well.\n\n237\n00:13:31.851 --> 00:13:37.780\nAnd then even the amount\nof data transferred,\n\n238\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.435\nalso a possibility as well.\n\n239\n00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:46.567\nNow, from that amount of\ninformation NetFlow itself if it's\n\n240\n00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:51.897\ncapturing this information,\nit essentially helps us to answer\n\n241\n00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:58.331\ndifferent questions that we would\nnormally have about our network traffic.\n\n242\n00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:00.936\nAnd that's where the key comes\nin to help us out, here.\n\n243\n00:14:00.936 --> 00:14:05.664\nThe types of questions that we're talking\nabout, of course, are the same ones that\n\n244\n00:14:05.664 --> 00:14:09.872\nwe learned about in third grade,\nwho, what, where, when, why and how.\n\n245\n00:14:09.872 --> 00:14:13.333\nIt helps us to answer all of that\nabout what essentially happen.\n\n246\n00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:17.222\nSo we go back to that analogy again in\nterms of the conversation where were\n\n247\n00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:18.818\nspotting that information,\n\n248\n00:14:18.818 --> 00:14:22.538\nout of thousand voices that were hearing,\nwe want to zoom in on that.\n\n249\n00:14:22.538 --> 00:14:27.515\nYou and I is almost impossible to do that\nunless we have very high powered ear,\n\n250\n00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:30.503\nheadphones on and\nthe one that's parabolic,\n\n251\n00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:35.115\nmicrophones that we're zooming in\non that particular conversation.\n\n252\n00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:35.713\n&gt;&gt; Or if we were expert lip readers.\n\n253\n00:14:35.713 --> 00:14:38.149\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or your insanely expert\nlip readers, which I am not.\n\n254\n00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:39.477\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n\n255\n00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:41.044\n&gt;&gt; We could do that.\n\n256\n00:14:41.044 --> 00:14:43.710\nHere inside of NetFlow,\nthey're saying we can do this.\n\n257\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.894\nIf we can actually gather this amount\nof information, we're tuning in,\n\n258\n00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:52.618\nwe're pretty much massaging, we're tuning\nor whatever you want to call it here,\n\n259\n00:14:52.618 --> 00:14:57.217\nwe're putting in the specific details\nabout who's traffic that we want to see.\n\n260\n00:14:57.217 --> 00:14:59.144\nThe protocol is really answering and\n\n261\n00:14:59.144 --> 00:15:02.013\nhelping us to answer what\napplication's being used.\n\n262\n00:15:02.013 --> 00:15:05.793\nWe're even zeroing in on the time-stamp\nthat something occurred and\n\n263\n00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:10.224\nhow long the conversation happened and\nhow much data was transferred in between.\n\n264\n00:15:10.224 --> 00:15:14.210\nYou name it, we can actually start\npicking up on all those questions and\n\n265\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.465\nanswering those questions\nabout a network communication\n\n266\n00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:19.672\nthat happened between those devices.\n\n267\n00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:20.669\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great.\n\n268\n00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:25.216\n&gt;&gt; So it is a tremendous amount\nof data that we also have.\n\n269\n00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:30.275\nAlong with this then, we can also start\nidentifying what traffic that can be\n\n270\n00:15:30.275 --> 00:15:35.669\nout place on our network, and have NetFlow\neven help us to begin to send an alert.\n\n271\n00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:40.052\nSo when we actually start to do this,\nan and list should be able, then,\n\n272\n00:15:40.052 --> 00:15:44.528\nwith the information that we have,\nanswer some very simple questions.\n\n273\n00:15:44.528 --> 00:15:47.952\nHow long the data flow was active?\n\n274\n00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:53.230\nAnd that is key for us understanding\nif this is some form of attack,\n\n275\n00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.696\nand how long did it happen for?\n\n276\n00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:57.200\nWe wanted to know that.\n\n277\n00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.777\nWe could even make sure that we can\nidentify what application was used in this\n\n278\n00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:02.859\ncommunication.\n\n279\n00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:05.935\nNot being able to identify\nthat can be harmful.\n\n280\n00:16:05.935 --> 00:16:08.510\nThe very fact that we don't\nknow what the target was.\n\n281\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.309\nWe don't know what's actually\ncausing the source or\n\n282\n00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:13.621\nthe destination to\nreturn what it needs to.\n\n283\n00:16:13.621 --> 00:16:17.212\nAnd then of course find out where\nthe return traffic is coming from,\n\n284\n00:16:17.212 --> 00:16:20.240\nas well as where the originating\ntraffic is coming from.\n\n285\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.817\nAll of that comes into play when we start\ntalking about the basics of NetFlow, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:25.817 --> 00:16:30.164\nSo it's enough for us to actually\njust kind of reel our heads around.\n\n287\n00:16:30.164 --> 00:16:34.386\nYou might be wondering, well, I just wanna\nsee it and I understand, but if you don't\n\n288\n00:16:34.386 --> 00:16:38.492\nwrap your head around what it's doing,\nit's not gonna really help you in the end,\n\n289\n00:16:38.492 --> 00:16:42.331\nwhen you're talking about the analysis\nof what needs to happen here, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:46.555\nAll right, so Zach, now ready to at least\ntake a look at some of the tools that we\n\n291\n00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:48.731\nhave available, but before we do that,\n\n292\n00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:53.154\nI wanna make sure that we understand that\nthere's multiple versions of NetFlow.\n\n293\n00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:54.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n294\n00:16:54.028 --> 00:16:58.297\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's, I think,\nmake sure I'm telling you that.\n\n295\n00:16:58.297 --> 00:16:59.490\nThere's nine versions.\n\n296\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.780\nI wanna make sure that I said that right.\n\n297\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.393\nI looked down I saw 19.\n\n298\n00:17:02.393 --> 00:17:03.146\nI was like that's not right.\n\n299\n00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:05.311\nThere's nine versions at least.\n\n300\n00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:08.749\nThe most popular version is\nthe one that this show is about.\n\n301\n00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:10.456\n&gt;&gt; Version 5.\n&gt;&gt; And which is Version 5.\n\n302\n00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:13.688\nSo we are gonna take a look at well, what\nabout the other ones that are out there?\n\n303\n00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:17.838\nThey're out there, people do use them and\nthey do have more advanced features than\n\n304\n00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:22.063\nones that their version numbered a little\nbit later on but Version 5C's becoming.\n\n305\n00:17:22.063 --> 00:17:24.835\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy is Version 5 so common?\n\n306\n00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:29.057\nThat's because if you kinda wanted you\nto do something at least in the world\n\n307\n00:17:29.057 --> 00:17:33.224\nof Cisco, those are the devices in\nwhich are still active and operating.\n\n308\n00:17:33.224 --> 00:17:37.217\nAnd the idea of needing to update that\nmay not be a gigantic priority for\n\n309\n00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:38.848\nmost people on the network.\n\n310\n00:17:38.848 --> 00:17:42.834\nSo they'll probably go with the highest\nversion that all the devices will\n\n311\n00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:43.548\nrecognize.\n\n312\n00:17:43.548 --> 00:17:48.618\nSo it could be where Zach bought\na brand new 3800 series switch, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:52.135\nThat supports version,\nwhatever the nine version, yeah.\n\n314\n00:17:52.135 --> 00:17:53.600\nThe highest version that's out there.\n\n315\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.532\nHe may be still be running equipment that\nthe highest one may be version five,\n\n316\n00:17:57.532 --> 00:18:01.826\nthe most common then is version five, and\nthat's why we're gonna focus in on that,\n\n317\n00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:04.262\nand take a look at the idea of the record,\nokay?\n\n318\n00:18:04.262 --> 00:18:08.352\nAlso key in getting ready for\nthe exam is understanding what the flow\n\n319\n00:18:08.352 --> 00:18:12.945\nrecord actually is, and we'll point\nall that information out as well, and\n\n320\n00:18:12.945 --> 00:18:16.128\nwhat elements are also\ninvolved in that too, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:19.558\nSo that's what we want to\nmake sure that we do, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:21.798\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n323\n00:18:21.798 --> 00:18:26.687\ntake a look at that aspect of Version\n5 information here, for a moment.\n\n324\n00:18:26.687 --> 00:18:28.494\nAnd so\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n325\n00:18:28.494 --> 00:18:31.253\nOkay, if you haven't gone to this yet,\n\n326\n00:18:31.253 --> 00:18:36.789\nmake sure you do take some time to take\na look at this particular page here, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:38.831\nIf you're preparing for the exam,\n\n328\n00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:43.474\nyou'll go to the exam website where you\ncan download all of the exam objectives.\n\n329\n00:18:43.474 --> 00:18:47.513\nAnd then you'll see another link\nthat will also say, not only for\n\n330\n00:18:47.513 --> 00:18:51.416\nthat SECCOPS exam, but\nyou'll see a link for study material.\n\n331\n00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:57.148\nSo Cisco provides some study material,\nsome of it is paid, some of it is free.\n\n332\n00:18:57.148 --> 00:19:01.306\nAll the ones that are listed here are now,\nactually, the ones that have the cart,\n\n333\n00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.545\nyou can see that little\ntiny shopping cart.\n\n334\n00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:05.527\nThose, of course, are paid, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:05.527 --> 00:19:09.513\nBut a lot of this stuff is actually\nfree and available out there.\n\n336\n00:19:09.513 --> 00:19:13.826\nTo also prepare for the exam,\nespecially on NetFlow,\n\n337\n00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:17.388\nyou wanna go down to\nthe second section here,\n\n338\n00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:23.599\nunder Network Intrusion Analysis, and\nthe last two that are available here.\n\n339\n00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:27.586\nThe Introduction to the Cisco IOS NetFlow.\n\n340\n00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:30.816\nThis is the one that is based on\nthe router and that helps you and\n\n341\n00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:33.425\nthat helps you to key in on something,\nat least for\n\n342\n00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:37.426\nthe exam, that this is actually probably\nthe one it's going to be based on.\n\n343\n00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:41.111\nNow we're gonna use a switch is what we're\ngonna use because that's what I have\n\n344\n00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:42.267\naccess to for right now.\n\n345\n00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:47.357\nAnd then the other one, which is important\nfor what we're talking about as well for\n\n346\n00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:50.933\nthe record format,\nthe NetFlow Export Datagram Format.\n\n347\n00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:54.202\nLet me click on that link and\nall you have to do is click on the link.\n\n348\n00:19:54.202 --> 00:19:56.317\nAnd that of course will\nbring you to this page,\n\n349\n00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:58.118\nthen you can download this right here.\n\n350\n00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:01.268\nYou can download the other\ndocument too as well.\n\n351\n00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:06.877\nAnd here you start seeing that at this\npoint when the document came out,\n\n352\n00:20:06.877 --> 00:20:09.975\nVersions 1, 5, 7, and 8, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:14.610\nAnd you can even see what these other\nversions do for you, and that's pretty\n\n354\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.041\nmuch nice, but what we're really\nfocusing in on is right there, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:26.371\nDescribe the Version 5 headers and\nlook at that flow record format, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:31.283\nThat is what we are looking for, that's\nthe information that they want us to\n\n357\n00:20:31.283 --> 00:20:35.527\nbe able to identify and get ready for\nwhen we face the exam as well.\n\n358\n00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:39.963\nAnd we'll show you how that actually gonna\nlook when you start seeing that too.\n\n359\n00:20:39.963 --> 00:20:42.898\nSo I'm gonna click on this table B4,\n\n360\n00:20:42.898 --> 00:20:47.222\nB4 that's an apartment number,\nI think 4B, B4 here.\n\n361\n00:20:47.222 --> 00:20:48.080\n&gt;&gt; And a very good vitamin.\n\n362\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.466\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n363\n00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.238\nI don't even know, what's B4 for?\n\n364\n00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:52.976\nI don't even know.\n\n365\n00:20:52.976 --> 00:20:58.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Describe the B4 Version 5 flow record.\n\n366\n00:20:58.771 --> 00:21:00.972\nSo now,\nyou can take a look at the information and\n\n367\n00:21:00.972 --> 00:21:03.240\na lot of this is what we've\nalready talked about.\n\n368\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.341\nSource destination address, makes sense.\n\n369\n00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:10.900\nWe can even see there's a lot of data\nthat's right here and available.\n\n370\n00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.034\nAll of these are not\nconsidered key fields, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:19.516\nSo they are not all considered key fields,\nbut this will give you at least a starting\n\n372\n00:21:19.516 --> 00:21:22.604\npoint that you want to be able\nto pay attention to, okay?\n\n373\n00:21:22.604 --> 00:21:25.026\nBut when it comes down to key fields,\n\n374\n00:21:25.026 --> 00:21:30.198\nyou wanna make sure that you understand\nthe autonomous system number, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:34.371\nThis is a key field right here is\nthis autonomous system number.\n\n376\n00:21:34.371 --> 00:21:38.866\nSo understand that in Version 5,\nNetFlow includes\n\n377\n00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:44.189\nthe autonomous system number as\nwell as the Protocol Type 2.\n\n378\n00:21:44.189 --> 00:21:47.684\nThen make sure you pay\nattention to the protocol type.\n\n379\n00:21:47.684 --> 00:21:51.572\nAlso of course, well, we've talked about\nsource and destination IP address,\n\n380\n00:21:51.572 --> 00:21:53.185\nthat makes sense as well, okay.\n\n381\n00:21:53.185 --> 00:21:55.029\nAll that is actually good.\n\n382\n00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:58.473\nAnd then as we go, I'm trying to see.\n\n383\n00:21:58.473 --> 00:22:00.048\nThe subnet masks as well, so\n\n384\n00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:03.275\nmake sure you pay attention\nto the information like that.\n\n385\n00:22:03.275 --> 00:22:05.613\nAll that will be in there too.\n\n386\n00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:08.232\nAnd then, let's see,\nwhat other ones do we want?\n\n387\n00:22:08.232 --> 00:22:12.246\nThe packets that are in the flow,\nthose are also key as well, okay?\n\n388\n00:22:12.246 --> 00:22:16.041\nSo there's a few of them that's right\nhere, but kind of the big ones that we\n\n389\n00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:19.675\nalready talked about, what's in\nthe five tuple information, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:22.766\nSource IP address.\n\n391\n00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:24.288\nSource port.\n\n392\n00:22:24.288 --> 00:22:28.117\nDestination IP address,\ndestination port protocol.\n\n393\n00:22:28.117 --> 00:22:31.154\nThose five are kind of the big\nkeys that we're looking for\n\n394\n00:22:31.154 --> 00:22:34.391\nbecause that indicates all of\nthe data as we go through them.\n\n395\n00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:37.269\nThat's how it really pools and\ngoes, that's one conversation.\n\n396\n00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:41.671\nThat is the one that we are looking for,\nnot everything else that's going on, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:45.486\nSo in that one for\nus to zoom in on that, that's the key.\n\n398\n00:22:45.486 --> 00:22:47.301\nBack to that analogy that we were using.\n\n399\n00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:49.461\nThose two people,\nthat's the only conversation we want.\n\n400\n00:22:49.461 --> 00:22:52.719\nBut if those two people had 10 or\n15 conversations in between,\n\n401\n00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:54.127\nhow do we separate that out?\n\n402\n00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:59.512\nWell, in networking terms, we do it by the\nfive tuple data information that we have.\n\n403\n00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:02.112\nWe say, no, I don't care about\nthe other ones that are out there,\n\n404\n00:23:02.112 --> 00:23:03.984\nthat's the information\nthat I want to gather.\n\n405\n00:23:03.984 --> 00:23:07.956\nAnd that's what NetFlow helps\nus to be able to do, okay?\n\n406\n00:23:07.956 --> 00:23:12.591\nAll right, so, let's go ahead then and\nbegin to at least take a look at\n\n407\n00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:17.074\nthe information that we are going\nto end up needing to understand and\n\n408\n00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:18.191\nlook at as well.\n\n409\n00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.613\nAll right, so I brought up a Cisco switch.\n\n410\n00:23:20.613 --> 00:23:24.358\nAnd this one is 38, 50,\nor something like that.\n\n411\n00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:26.359\nI don't remember exactly which one it is.\n\n412\n00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:29.335\nAnd I've already looked at\nsome of the information, so\n\n413\n00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:30.929\nthis will help us out, okay.\n\n414\n00:23:30.929 --> 00:23:34.934\nAt the very beginning, if we were set\nthis up, we're not setting it up, but\n\n415\n00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:36.997\nI want to make sure we understand this,\n\n416\n00:23:36.997 --> 00:23:40.392\nit's gonna help us answer really\nfour basic questions, okay.\n\n417\n00:23:40.392 --> 00:23:43.812\nAnd if we setup NetFlow,\nthis is what we want to do.\n\n418\n00:23:43.812 --> 00:23:47.201\nThe first thing we want\nis to actually say, look,\n\n419\n00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:50.359\nhere's what should end up happening, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:53.655\nI need to actually create a flow record,\nokay?\n\n421\n00:23:53.655 --> 00:23:59.351\nSo if I create a flow record, what is\na flow record helping me to answer, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:02.057\nWell, what a flow record\nhelps me to answer is,\n\n423\n00:24:02.057 --> 00:24:06.267\nwhat particular data am I really\nlooking to measure at this point, okay?\n\n424\n00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:08.985\nSo what do I want from this, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:09.547\nWhat data do I want?\n\n426\n00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:14.824\nSo if I had configured it on this switch\nwhich has already been configured for\n\n427\n00:24:14.824 --> 00:24:16.485\nme on this switch here.\n\n428\n00:24:16.485 --> 00:24:20.840\nI need to simply go ahead and type in show\n\n429\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.651\nrunning-config here and\nthen I can do flow record.\n\n430\n00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:30.930\nAnd when I do this and\nI take a look at that information,\n\n431\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.405\nyou'll notice that a flow\nrecord has been created here.\n\n432\n00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:38.140\nAnd it was named my-flow-record, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:45.422\nInside of this, it tells you exactly\nwhat it's description is, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:45.422 --> 00:24:49.316\nSo somebody was actually even nice\nenough to create a description,\n\n435\n00:24:49.316 --> 00:24:52.473\nit collects the flow data for\nwhat we have here, okay?\n\n436\n00:24:52.473 --> 00:24:56.852\nSo what is it actually trying to\ndo when we create a flow record?\n\n437\n00:24:56.852 --> 00:25:01.549\nThe first thing that we need to do is,\nwe need to identify the data that\n\n438\n00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:06.018\nwe're looking for and\nnotice this key term here it says, match.\n\n439\n00:25:06.018 --> 00:25:10.242\nIt says look at all the data\nthat flows through this device.\n\n440\n00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:13.072\nCatch this, matches this whatever it is.\n\n441\n00:25:13.072 --> 00:25:15.852\nDatalink mac and source match that.\n\n442\n00:25:15.852 --> 00:25:19.311\nAnd it matches that that's\nfine that's what we want.\n\n443\n00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:24.180\nSame thing with all of this other\ninformation all the way down here, and\n\n444\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.052\nnotice it actually matches the datalink\nlayer which is layer two data,\n\n445\n00:25:29.052 --> 00:25:33.536\nnotice there's layer three,\nhere's layer four information.\n\n446\n00:25:33.536 --> 00:25:38.993\nAnd then because of the way that NetFlow\nworks, notice it changes here too.\n\n447\n00:25:38.993 --> 00:25:42.121\nNow we get to match flow.\n\n448\n00:25:42.121 --> 00:25:45.364\nAnd now we're actually\nlooking at direction and\n\n449\n00:25:45.364 --> 00:25:50.031\nwe're even looking at a couple of\nother things that are little bit more\n\n450\n00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:52.500\nunusual which is right here, okay?\n\n451\n00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.898\nThis flow is actually\nbetween security groups now.\n\n452\n00:25:56.898 --> 00:25:59.027\nSo it's not only enough to say look,\n\n453\n00:25:59.027 --> 00:26:02.473\nI know here's the specific\ninformation I'm looking for.\n\n454\n00:26:02.473 --> 00:26:04.458\nBut I'm really looking for\n\n455\n00:26:04.458 --> 00:26:09.908\nif those devices also have this particular\ntype of tag associated with it.\n\n456\n00:26:09.908 --> 00:26:11.523\nSo it can actually go ahead and\n\n457\n00:26:11.523 --> 00:26:14.507\nmonitor more than just one\nindividual conversation.\n\n458\n00:26:14.507 --> 00:26:17.244\nI can say these group\nof people right here.\n\n459\n00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:19.719\nI wanna hear that, I wanna know that.\n\n460\n00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:23.255\nSo when we actually do this,\nthat's what we're also end up\n\n461\n00:26:23.255 --> 00:26:27.021\nseeing is that we can see that\nparticular information as well.\n\n462\n00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:29.312\nNow it also means that you had to set up,\n\n463\n00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:32.380\nthis set up takes a little\nbit longer to end up doing.\n\n464\n00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.961\nBut I just wanted to show you that at\nthe beginning here in terms of what\n\n465\n00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:38.703\na flow record helps us do.\n\n466\n00:26:38.703 --> 00:26:41.826\nFirst thing,\nit identifies at least the traffic,\n\n467\n00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:45.030\nit identifies who could be\ninvolved in this as well.\n\n468\n00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:50.802\nThen the second thing of course\nis to tell it what to do, okayt?\n\n469\n00:26:50.802 --> 00:26:56.247\nSo once you match it, notice the next\nverb that's here collect, okay?\n\n470\n00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:58.288\nSo now notice what it's saying.\n\n471\n00:26:58.288 --> 00:27:02.871\nNow I want to not only match so\nin order to make sure it matches but\n\n472\n00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:05.134\nif it does match it collect it.\n\n473\n00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:08.929\nSo don't just go this one matches and\nmark and let it go on,\n\n474\n00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:11.491\nmake a copy of it and collect it as well.\n\n475\n00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:17.244\nSo that's where that flow record helps\nus out in establishing what do I really\n\n476\n00:27:17.244 --> 00:27:23.191\nwant to measure out and then what action\ndo I want to take if it actually matches.\n\n477\n00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:27.435\nAll of the data this is above, and\nwhat we're looking at right here.\n\n478\n00:27:27.435 --> 00:27:32.992\nAnd that's kind of a key, as far as\nwhat the flow record does for us, okay?\n\n479\n00:27:32.992 --> 00:27:36.426\nSo it's neat that we can actually\nsee something like this because\n\n480\n00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:38.869\nwe'll actually see a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n481\n00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:40.719\nNow, when we start to\ntake a look at this Zach.\n\n482\n00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:45.084\nWe still need to go through a little bit\nmore, even though we've talked about\n\n483\n00:27:45.084 --> 00:27:49.197\nthe flow record and we haven't seen\na lot but we've seen a bit of it here.\n\n484\n00:27:49.197 --> 00:27:50.281\nThere's still we have to\ntalk about the exporter.\n\n485\n00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:52.872\nWe still have to talk about the collector.\n\n486\n00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:54.540\nWe still have to talk\nabout a few other things.\n\n487\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.957\nBut once again Zach,\n\n488\n00:27:55.957 --> 00:27:58.304\nI have talked a long time here\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:27:58.304 --> 00:27:59.445\n&gt;&gt; And that means that I have run\n\n490\n00:27:59.445 --> 00:27:59.975\nout of time.\n\n491\n00:27:59.975 --> 00:28:02.317\nSo Zach,\nwe might have to carry on in another part.\n\n492\n00:28:02.317 --> 00:28:03.604\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you do an amazing job.\n\n493\n00:28:03.604 --> 00:28:04.137\nThank you so very much.\n\n494\n00:28:04.137 --> 00:28:07.390\nIdentifying NetFlow Version 5,\nrecords this has been part one,\n\n495\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.831\nthere will be a part two, maybe\na part three, we'll have to find out.\n\n496\n00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:12.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, before we move on Ronnie,\n\n497\n00:28:12.647 --> 00:28:13.191\nany last words?\n\n498\n00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:16.251\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's just think about this\nright, it's overwhelming, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:17.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot.\n\n500\n00:28:17.114 --> 00:28:21.418\n&gt;&gt; What I explained, if you're not\nfamiliar with it you make sure you take\n\n501\n00:28:21.418 --> 00:28:24.431\na look at those two documents\nthat I pointed out and\n\n502\n00:28:24.431 --> 00:28:27.111\nyou can download directly from Cisco free.\n\n503\n00:28:27.111 --> 00:28:32.053\nThose are at least gonna help you to get\nthat solid basic fundamental understanding\n\n504\n00:28:32.053 --> 00:28:33.405\nof what NetFlow does.\n\n505\n00:28:33.405 --> 00:28:36.540\nThen focusing in on version five and\nunderstanding that information,\n\n506\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.325\nthat's kind of the light and easy part.\n\n507\n00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.916\nExcept, we need to see it in context, and\n\n508\n00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:42.521\nthat's what we'll end up seeing in\nthe next part of this, as well.\n\n509\n00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:46.244\nWe're showing you the setup and the\nbackground of what's gonna be collected.\n\n510\n00:28:46.244 --> 00:28:48.760\nAnd now we're actually gonna show you,\nof course, not only this.\n\n511\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.348\nOnce we actually get everything set up and\nhow it's actually being configured,\n\n512\n00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:55.317\nwe'll show you what it actually\nlooks like and the output as well.\n\n513\n00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:56.759\nSo we'll see that in the next part.\n\n514\n00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:57.488\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n515\n00:28:57.488 --> 00:28:59.663\nThanks Ronnie, can't wait for that and\n\n516\n00:28:59.663 --> 00:29:04.030\nmake sure that you watch everything in\nthe Cisco SecOps series, all the videos.\n\n517\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.078\nYou'll be so happy that you did that.\n\n518\n00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:10.322\nAnd by the way, tell a friend about\nITProTV, they'll thank you for it.\n\n519\n00:29:10.322 --> 00:29:11.024\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n520\n00:29:11.024 --> 00:29:12.257\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:16.681\nHello and thank you for watching IT PROTV\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.603\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n5\n00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:21.245\nAs we continue on with Cisco Secops, and\n\n6\n00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:25.149\nthis is part two of identify\nnet flow version five records.\n\n7\n00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.040\nAnd Ronnie Wan has agreed to come help\nus out with that, thanks, Ronnie, for\n\n8\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.695\nbeing here, good to see you again, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:35.474\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Zach, for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n10\n00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:39.617\nas we continue talking more about the idea\nof NetFlow, and being able to identify,\n\n11\n00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.126\nof course,\nthe records that are in place as well.\n\n12\n00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:45.031\nAnd that's kind of the key\nin what we're doing.\n\n13\n00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:48.644\nSo in the previous episode, we really\ndid set up at least a foundation and\n\n14\n00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:50.957\nunderstanding of\nthe knowledge that we need,\n\n15\n00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:52.990\nto know a little bit more about NetFlow.\n\n16\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.228\nAlso, of course, pointed out some of\nthe resources that are available to us and\n\n17\n00:00:57.228 --> 00:01:00.390\nthen we started to show you,\nof course, the configuration\n\n18\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.888\nthat we normally do end up seeing\non a device that will help us out.\n\n19\n00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:05.127\nSo, when we set up NetFlow,\n\n20\n00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:07.513\nwe were talking about what\nit really is designed to do.\n\n21\n00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:11.078\nAnd it really helps us to answer\nsome different questions when we\n\n22\n00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:13.203\nstart setting it up to do what we want.\n\n23\n00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:17.102\nSo in the first episode we ended with\ntalking about the idea of setting up\n\n24\n00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:20.950\na flow record and the question that\nreally helps us to after here okay.\n\n25\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.930\nAnd that question is what is that I\nwant to measure we talk about the idea\n\n26\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.169\nof matching the data and\nthe protocols that available and\n\n27\n00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:30.275\nthen collecting that information.\n\n28\n00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:33.630\nNow that we've got the information\ncollected and we've got\n\n29\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.126\neverything kind of set up, The information\nnow needs to, well, go somewhere.\n\n30\n00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:41.288\nSo this is where technically\nwe call it the idea of\n\n31\n00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:44.462\nactually creating what\nwe call a flow exporter.\n\n32\n00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:47.923\nNow the flow exporter is not\na device that we put in place but\n\n33\n00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:52.023\nit's just another command that says\nhere's what we are going to do,\n\n34\n00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:55.221\nhere's what we're going to\nsend it to is what we wan.\n\n35\n00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:59.922\nSo, a flow exporter essentially says,\nwhere do I want to send the data, and\n\n36\n00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.357\nit helps us to answer those questions.\n\n37\n00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:06.709\nSo, if we go back to my screen, this\nwill help us out where we just finished\n\n38\n00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.894\ntaking a look at the idea\nof the flow record, itself.\n\n39\n00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:14.255\nAnd our flow record,\nwe named it my-flow-record.\n\n40\n00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.558\nNow, you can give it\nwhatever name you want to,\n\n41\n00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:18.930\nthis is just the one that\nwas here on this switch.\n\n42\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.123\nAnd now if I type in\nshowrunning-config and\n\n43\n00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:31.435\nwe start talking about the flow\nexporter is what we want to do.\n\n44\n00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:35.900\nNow on the flow exporter this is key\nif there is element that I know that\n\n45\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.520\nI have messed up in the past in setting\nthis up in a complex environment is\n\n46\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.754\nforgotten either she set\nup the exporter itself or\n\n47\n00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:47.313\nforgot the IP address of what\nwhere I want to send it to.\n\n48\n00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:50.879\nAnd that's kind of the key here.\n\n49\n00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.803\nSo now notice this is what we were talking\nabout a little bit previously with\n\n50\n00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:58.691\nthe diagram, we talked about some\ntype of a collector that's out there.\n\n51\n00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:02.670\nThis one is just saying here is\nthe command on this switch and\n\n52\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.934\nhow it's going to take\nthe information I want and\n\n53\n00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:09.615\nit's gonna send the flow\nto that flow connector, FC.\n\n54\n00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.183\nSo there's the description.\n\n55\n00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:15.352\nHere we get the destination\nof where it's going to go.\n\n56\n00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:20.390\nSo you have to have that flow collector\nready to accept the information.\n\n57\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.252\nBut now this is where it gets a little\nbit tricky on most people, okay,\n\n58\n00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:25.438\nwhich is the source.\n\n59\n00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:30.329\nThe source can actually be an interface\non a switch or a router, and on a switch,\n\n60\n00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.086\nthough, you also have the ability for\nit to actually just be a complete VLAN.\n\n61\n00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:38.571\nSo unlike what we normally expect to see\non a router when we only have two or\n\n62\n00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:42.230\nthree points, and we just pick another\nport that we really want the source of\n\n63\n00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.624\nthe information to come in.\n\n64\n00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:49.460\nHere on the switch, I might have 10, 15,\n100 ports that are actually in Vlan10.\n\n65\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.810\nAnd I can say I'm just collecting\nit from all of Vlan10 and\n\n66\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.608\nthen we're gonna send it on to\nthis IP address right here, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:02.910\nThe other thing, of course,\njust as another exam tip for\n\n68\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.406\nus to understand,\nthe default Port is also key in NetFlow.\n\n69\n00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:12.332\nMake sure you understand that\nNetFlow itself is 2055 and it's udp,\n\n70\n00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:15.736\nis what we normally end\nup seeing here too, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:20.438\nSo this is kind of key information\nas we start to also see this.\n\n72\n00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:25.454\nNow, there's one last piece of information\nhere that we want to make sure that\n\n73\n00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:30.180\nwe do talk about just briefly which\nis this template data timeout, okay.\n\n74\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.363\nThe template data timeout is\nthe frequency in seconds,\n\n75\n00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:39.168\nand that's the key here,\nit will actually advertise back out to\n\n76\n00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:43.627\nthe flow collector what data's\nactually going to be sent.\n\n77\n00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:46.930\nSo the flow collector can\ntake information from\n\n78\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.894\nmultiple devices if it needs to\nthat's sending NetFlow information.\n\n79\n00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:56.111\nThis particular device is going to\nsend a template of what it is going\n\n80\n00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.333\nto send just about every 60 seconds\nis what it's also going to do.\n\n81\n00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:04.846\nSo that is what we'll end up seeing\nright here in this flow exporter.\n\n82\n00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.736\nAnd it really is kind of important\nthat this is setup correctly.\n\n83\n00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:12.612\nIf not, the wrong IP address will\nnot let it do what it needs to.\n\n84\n00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.750\nOr, if you don't have\nthe proper source IP address,\n\n85\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.120\nit's not gonna give you what you want and\n\n86\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.145\nunless you already configured it on the\nflow clip to take another port then 2055,\n\n87\n00:05:23.145 --> 00:05:27.933\nif you don't have that one correct,\nit's not gonna help you out either, okay.\n\n88\n00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:32.377\nSo that brings us then to another question\nthat we also need to ask once we get\n\n89\n00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:33.095\nthis done.\n\n90\n00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:37.565\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, now that we've identified\nthe information that we want and\n\n91\n00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:41.142\nwe need to send it somewhere,\nhow to we go about caching or\n\n92\n00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.397\nwhere do we cache the information?\n\n93\n00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:44.298\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nthat's actually a good question, right.\n\n94\n00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:48.306\nSo, we think about in terms of those\nquestions that you're talking about, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.242\nSo, we've got what we collected.\n\n96\n00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:50.853\nWe know where we wanna send it to.\n\n97\n00:05:50.853 --> 00:05:55.832\nNow, we have to kind of combine that\ntogether in one particular command\n\n98\n00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:57.660\nthat we need to issue out.\n\n99\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.522\nAnd when we do so, we're telling it,\nhey, take that information, and\n\n100\n00:06:02.522 --> 00:06:04.613\nthen go ahead and cash it here.\n\n101\n00:06:04.613 --> 00:06:05.600\nAnd that's kind of the key.\n\n102\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.747\nSo the next thing we're gonna take a look\nat as far as the configuration go,\n\n103\n00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:16.540\nokay, is show running-config,\nif I can spell running,\n\n104\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.751\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n105\n00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.942\n&gt;&gt; A dash config, and then this time,\n\n106\n00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:23.451\nwhat we're actually needing is flow,\nmonitor, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:30.288\nNow flow monitor it sounds like collector,\nbut it's not exactly collector.\n\n108\n00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:31.938\nBut it actually says all right\nwhat are we really monitoring?\n\n109\n00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:34.392\nWhat are we really looking for?\n\n110\n00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:37.128\nWe're trying to actually know\nwhat's actually inside of our cash.\n\n111\n00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:42.055\nSo it's here that notice it\nreferences both the record itself and\n\n112\n00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:46.356\nyou can see it right here,\nokay, the record itself, and\n\n113\n00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.146\nalso the the exporter information.\n\n114\n00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:54.113\nSo it's combining those two together and\nthen saying, the cache and\n\n115\n00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:57.552\nthis active timeout that\nit actually needs to.\n\n116\n00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:00.818\nAnd this is actually kind of something\nthat we want to understand, right?\n\n117\n00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:04.368\nIt has to be this kind of\ncombination of things.\n\n118\n00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:08.211\nIt's not just this easy sometimes to\njust go like, let's turn this on and\n\n119\n00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.759\nwe'll just wait for\nthe information to come in.\n\n120\n00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.071\nYou do have to set this up,\n\n121\n00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:15.005\nif you're doing it manually\nto do all these other things.\n\n122\n00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:16.561\nNow, on a router though.\n\n123\n00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:20.129\nI have to admit this, Zack,\non a router it's actually much easier.\n\n124\n00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:23.307\nYou pick the interface that you're\ngoing to send all this stuff out to.\n\n125\n00:07:23.307 --> 00:07:24.333\nAnd you can tell,\n\n126\n00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:28.726\nI want to capture information on the\negress as well as on the ingress of that.\n\n127\n00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:31.481\nAnd then you just tell\nit where to send it to,\n\n128\n00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:34.907\non a switch in which we have\nmultiple pieces involved,\n\n129\n00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:39.234\nit takes a lot more and you're seeing\nthat, at least on this switch.\n\n130\n00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:43.502\nThere's three or four different commands\nthat we have to run up in this point to\n\n131\n00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:44.805\nmake it actually work.\n\n132\n00:07:44.805 --> 00:07:46.260\nAnd this is all configurable.\n\n133\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.218\nSo we can actually change the time\nout activity if we need to.\n\n134\n00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:52.440\nSo we're saying cache it every 30 seconds.\n\n135\n00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.112\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n136\n00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:56.735\n&gt;&gt; And when we cache it every 30 seconds,\nthat's the window that we're doing it.\n\n137\n00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:59.433\nAnd then we're gonna send it on\nto that destination as well.\n\n138\n00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:03.104\nSo every 30 seconds,\nit's gonna end up at this destination too.\n\n139\n00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:03.927\nOkay?\n\n140\n00:08:03.927 --> 00:08:09.020\nSo it does tell us just about\neverything that we need.\n\n141\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.580\nBut even if we cache it in this way,\nand this amount and we know what we\n\n142\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.957\nare cashing, we know that we are gonna\nexport it off to that one address, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:22.201\nIt doesn't mean that we're ready\nto look at the information.\n\n144\n00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:26.645\nThe data that's going to come across\nis just in bits, ones and zeros, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:26.645 --> 00:08:31.505\nWe don't have any way to interpret the\ndata that comes across there to a machine,\n\n146\n00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:33.590\nit doesn't care, that's cool.\n\n147\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.151\nIt's the data, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:40.580\nBut to you and me, we don't generally read\nones and zeros as easily as machine do.\n\n149\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.962\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n150\n00:08:41.962 --> 00:08:46.451\n&gt;&gt; We have to translate that and put it\ninto something which normally means for\n\n151\n00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:49.240\nus an application of some sort as well,\nokay?\n\n152\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.164\nSo in the idea the application, okay,\nwe now also need to take a look at what\n\n153\n00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:59.402\nwe're doing here to actually send it to\nthat right place, which means we have to\n\n154\n00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:04.819\nidentify where the application resides,\nwhich is gonna be on a particular port.\n\n155\n00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:10.483\nThen I do\nthe show-running-dash-config here and\n\n156\n00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:15.502\nthen we're gonna take\na look at an interface-\n\n157\n00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:20.395\ninterface-gigabit Ethernet 1/0/1,\n\n158\n00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:25.171\noops, I misspelled, what did I misspell?\n\n159\n00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.518\nInterface, it's supposed to be one word,\nsorry,\n\n160\n00:09:28.518 --> 00:09:31.610\nthat's what I misspelled,\nand there we go, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.198\nSo now we're taking a look\nat the interface, and\n\n162\n00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:36.231\nwhat's actually going to be on here.\n\n163\n00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:40.984\nAnd notice that you have a couple\nof the ones that we normally see.\n\n164\n00:09:40.984 --> 00:09:45.229\nSo here, you're essentially\ntaking that monitor, right?\n\n165\n00:09:45.229 --> 00:09:49.310\nSo the monitor is going to take\nthe my flow monitor output and\n\n166\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.748\nsend it out that way, and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n167\n00:09:52.748 --> 00:09:54.792\nThat's the only thing\nwe're sending out here.\n\n168\n00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:57.209\nSo here's the command\nto make that do this.\n\n169\n00:09:57.209 --> 00:10:03.080\nThis CTS command though, is something that\nwe also want to pay attention to as well.\n\n170\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.836\nIf you're using security groups,\nlike what we showed you earlier in\n\n171\n00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:12.428\nthe previous episode, you have to\nmanually tell that export right\n\n172\n00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:16.367\nthere on this interface that\nyou are going to set this up.\n\n173\n00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:20.985\nSo that's why this particular\ncommand appears right here as well.\n\n174\n00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:24.700\nIf you're not using it, in other words,\nyou're not using those security groups,\n\n175\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.256\nnow even though we have security groups,\nbut we didn't set up anything to really\n\n176\n00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:31.577\nmonitor every individual security group,\nso it doesn't really matter.\n\n177\n00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:36.133\nBut, if you are using security groups,\nyou're going to need to actually do this\n\n178\n00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:40.163\nparticular command right here that\nhas to be a part of the information.\n\n179\n00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:42.226\nThat we see, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.865\nAnd that's gonna be key, too, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:51.031\nSo, once we get that set up,\nall right, and now that's all done,\n\n182\n00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:58.434\nI want to generate some traffic going\nthrough the devices that we have in place.\n\n183\n00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:03.111\nSo, there's another PC that I'm\ngoing to connect to right here.\n\n184\n00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:06.853\nAnd on this one,\nlet me see if I've got, yep.\n\n185\n00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:09.809\nI've been running this the whole time so\nthat we could generate traffic during\n\n186\n00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:11.710\nthe whole time that we've\nbeen seeing this here.\n\n187\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.549\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I've sent some data.\n\n188\n00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:18.418\nThe other thing that I'm going to\ndo is launch that website again.\n\n189\n00:11:21.108 --> 00:11:25.707\nAnd this website is essentially using\nwhat's called Network as a Sensor,\n\n190\n00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:27.828\nyou can see the little tab up here.\n\n191\n00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:30.178\nAnd an enforcer is what it says.\n\n192\n00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:33.994\nSo we're essentially showing you\nthat you can have many devices,\n\n193\n00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:35.776\nwhich work as sensors for you.\n\n194\n00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:38.365\nAnd the output of that is\nsupposed to be right here.\n\n195\n00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.143\nNow, I didn't actually bring up\nthe webpage to do this right here but\n\n196\n00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:45.596\nit allows me to show that I can\nmake a connection to that sensor so\n\n197\n00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:49.594\nI'm generating net flow traffic\nthrough the switch is what I'm doing.\n\n198\n00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:53.318\nAll right, so this is all this\nmachine is going to do for right now.\n\n199\n00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:58.303\nNow, when I try to connect them,\nwe're actually going to\n\n200\n00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:03.310\nconnect to a fancier tool than\nwhat we would normally see.\n\n201\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.154\nI should say what I normally\nwould end up seeing here okay.\n\n202\n00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:10.661\nAnd so this tool, let me see if\nI can just reconnect to it and\n\n203\n00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.248\nthat will make it easier.\n\n204\n00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.865\nSo when we, there it goes okay.\n\n205\n00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:20.772\nSo on this one I should now be able to,\nand you'll see that\n\n206\n00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:25.690\nthere is a link here that's\non my bar right here, right?\n\n207\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.531\nAnd it says Stealthwatch.\n\n208\n00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:33.470\nStealthwatch is an insanely incredible\nmonitoring network security\n\n209\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:39.089\nmonitoring tool, which is, I'm going\nto say expensive to say the least here.\n\n210\n00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:44.274\nSo this use to belong to a company called\nLancope and you'll probably actually see.\n\n211\n00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:49.181\nVery tiny here it says by Lancope here,\n\n212\n00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:53.641\nokay, but Cisco bought them out and\n\n213\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.356\nnow if I enter in my user name,\n\n214\n00:12:57.356 --> 00:13:02.129\nwe can get access in to stealth watch.\n\n215\n00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.158\nNow, inside of Stealthwatch,\n\n216\n00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:08.605\nit has all of these different\npossibilities if we've set them all up.\n\n217\n00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:10.310\nOn this one there is nothing set up.\n\n218\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.875\nThis is a very expensive utility or tool\nthat you have to be able to monitor just\n\n219\n00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:19.110\nabout anything that you can think of for\nnetwork security monitoring.\n\n220\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:26.334\nThe key tool though that we really want Is\nright here on where it says launch SMC.\n\n221\n00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:31.599\nSo I need select that and then click OK\nand that's gonna bring up a Java console\n\n222\n00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:36.638\nfor me and there is that word Lancope or\nthe company that used to belong to.\n\n223\n00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:40.265\nAnd just continue on at this point on\nthe lab I'm just gonna not worry about\n\n224\n00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:40.799\ntoo much.\n\n225\n00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:45.719\nMost of the time we would not like this\nidea of running a Java application\n\n226\n00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:49.989\nto make this work but for\nour demo we're gonna use it anyways.\n\n227\n00:13:49.989 --> 00:13:53.516\nBecause I'm in the side of secured\nenvironment, I'm gonna allow it to run.\n\n228\n00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:57.011\nAnd now it should load up and\n\n229\n00:13:57.011 --> 00:14:00.726\nit should show you like all of\nthe information that we can.\n\n230\n00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:03.538\nPossibly ever really want to\nsee as far as monitoring.\n\n231\n00:14:03.538 --> 00:14:06.064\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, you pay for\nStealthwatch or is that also a free?\n\n232\n00:14:06.064 --> 00:14:07.187\n&gt;&gt; No, this one you'll pay for.\n\n233\n00:14:07.187 --> 00:14:08.390\nYou'll pay dearly.\n\n234\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n235\n00:14:10.723 --> 00:14:13.061\non this particular type of\ntool you'll pay dearly.\n\n236\n00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.662\nNow, you're probably like,\nwell Ronnie why are you showing us this?\n\n237\n00:14:15.662 --> 00:14:19.073\nBecause it's part of something that you\ndefinitely want to understand that in\n\n238\n00:14:19.073 --> 00:14:21.875\na security operation center,\nyou may run into tools like this.\n\n239\n00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:25.226\nIt's not always about just piecing\ntogether what you can have,\n\n240\n00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:28.017\nsometimes you do have to count this,\nand on the exam,\n\n241\n00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:31.886\nit's a Cisco exam, you need to\nunderstand some of those Cisco products.\n\n242\n00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:32.842\n&gt;&gt; Right, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're\n\n243\n00:14:32.842 --> 00:14:33.367\ntrying to show you.\n\n244\n00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Perfect so that is kind of the key.\n\n245\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.216\nNow, if we take a look at all of\nthe information that we can see, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:46.196\nThis monitors everything on your\nnetwork that you can imagine.\n\n247\n00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:50.870\nSo for example, okay, all of\nthe machines that are monitors inside\n\n248\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.551\nthis D cloud Cisco.com,\nit includes what they call inside hosts.\n\n249\n00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:59.820\nThese are essentially the devices or\ncomputers inside of my own network.\n\n250\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.070\nIf I wanted to,\nI can even monitor outside hosts.\n\n251\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.348\nIn other words, certain devices that\nare out there that are not part of my\n\n252\n00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:10.587\nnetwork I can even try and\nmonitor some of them as well.\n\n253\n00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:13.934\nSo I'm really focusing in\non the inside host too.\n\n254\n00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:17.797\nOnce everything gets connected\nthrough stealth watch and\n\n255\n00:15:17.797 --> 00:15:22.299\neverything else, it kinda ends up\nin what we call a catch all group.\n\n256\n00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:24.118\nAnd that's because it doesn't\nknow where else to put it.\n\n257\n00:15:24.118 --> 00:15:28.180\nAnd so it's not really monitoring anything\nyet, so at this point, if you had\n\n258\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.695\nsomething, which I don't, everything of\nmine is actually monitored fairly well.\n\n259\n00:15:32.695 --> 00:15:36.977\nSo if I had something in here I\ncould just simply right-click and\n\n260\n00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:41.115\ngo to Host and show the Active Host\nthat are available in here.\n\n261\n00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:44.361\nAnd you'll see I don't have anything\nin that catch all group at all.\n\n262\n00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.423\nNow, do I have things\nactually inside as hosts?\n\n263\n00:15:47.423 --> 00:15:53.557\nI right click on inside hosts,\nand hosts, and active hosts here.\n\n264\n00:15:53.557 --> 00:15:58.490\nYou'll see that there are four different\nmachines that are available Each one\n\n265\n00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.940\nhas already been assigned\nto their particular group.\n\n266\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.225\nAnd that means it was already set up,\n\n267\n00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:07.485\nthere's a lot of configuration\nin the background.\n\n268\n00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:11.407\nBut it also means that this\nis net flow enabled, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:16.129\nAll this stuff is now ready to go and for\nus to take a look at that information.\n\n270\n00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:20.745\nRight here you can see where I\nfinished the configuration, 4 minutes,\n\n271\n00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:21.964\n37 seconds ago.\n\n272\n00:16:21.964 --> 00:16:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.961\n&gt;&gt; So it is not exactly brand new but\nI already set up the group and the server.\n\n274\n00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:26.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.887\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is why you see it's only 4 minutes,\n\n276\n00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:32.775\n37 seconds ago instead of these other\nones that have been up for three or\n\n277\n00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:36.818\nfour hours when I first initially\nlaunched this and got everything set up.\n\n278\n00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:37.501\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n279\n00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:42.133\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's where you do\nsee the information is there and\n\n280\n00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:43.836\nready to kind of work.\n\n281\n00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.713\nThe other thing that Stealthwatch allows\nme to do is of course group it by\n\n282\n00:16:47.713 --> 00:16:50.701\ndifferent functions that\nare available our here too.\n\n283\n00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:52.722\nAnd let me show you.\n\n284\n00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:56.600\nSo each one of these, of course,\nhas their different functions.\n\n285\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.875\nAnd if I expand out Servers,\nI can show you the group that I created,\n\n286\n00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:04.185\nwhich is the Production Servers\nright here, okay.\n\n287\n00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:08.514\nSo this is the one that I did create\nright before we started to show just\n\n288\n00:17:08.514 --> 00:17:12.322\nthe group itself, but\nI didn't actually have it configured\n\n289\n00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:16.001\nto start sending information\nuntil we turned it on there.\n\n290\n00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:21.282\nAnd now, if I select host group\nproperties, type in my super\n\n291\n00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:26.048\nsecret password if I can remember it\n&gt;&gt; Password 123.\n\n292\n00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:26.935\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't sure was that easy.\n\n293\n00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:30.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I actually remember\n\n294\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.605\nthe password here.\n\n295\n00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:39.569\nAnd we'll give it a moment and\nif I just entered a wrong password you,\n\n296\n00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:44.023\nit will tell me that's the wrong password.\n\n297\n00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:46.835\nAll right,\nI'm assuming I entered the wrong password.\n\n298\n00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:50.597\nWe'll try it again [LAUGH],\none more time, there it goes, okay,\n\n299\n00:17:50.597 --> 00:17:53.848\nit just wasn't gonna show me,\nit just gonna make me wait.\n\n300\n00:17:53.848 --> 00:17:55.760\n&gt;&gt; It just wants you to guess.\n\n301\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.560\n&gt;&gt; So I added in the IP address\nof that one machine and\n\n302\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.400\nthen let it do its thing in\nthe background is what I did, okay.\n\n303\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.877\nAnd now, let's see if I can\nclose out of that thing, okay.\n\n304\n00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:12.943\nSo this is our basic setup,\ngetting everything running and recognized.\n\n305\n00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:17.576\nBecause in the background, also what's\nworking with Self Watch is NetFlow.\n\n306\n00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:23.279\nIt means we have that ability now, inside\nof NetFlow, even spot the flow of traffic.\n\n307\n00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:26.346\nSo if I right-click on Production Servers,\nagain, let me zoom in, so\n\n308\n00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:27.227\nthat I can see that.\n\n309\n00:18:27.227 --> 00:18:30.085\nSorry, I always forget that\nas I'm looking at my screen.\n\n310\n00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:31.885\nI only notice it when it's\nreally tiny to me [LAUGH], and\n\n311\n00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:32.913\nthen that's when [INAUDIBLE].\n\n312\n00:18:32.913 --> 00:18:33.883\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:37.660\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna select that,\nand then flow, and\n\n314\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.360\nthen notice there's one called,\nflow table.\n\n315\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:50.895\nSo if I select the flow table Because\nit's brand new, I may have to go and\n\n316\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:55.386\nrefresh my connection here but\nlet's see if I can just refresh it here.\n\n317\n00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:58.218\nAnd now it's actually gonna\ntake a sweet time and\n\n318\n00:18:58.218 --> 00:19:00.925\ndoing with this then do it here,\nlet me see it.\n\n319\n00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:05.607\nSometimes you just have to refresh\nthe connection to make it work a couple\n\n320\n00:19:05.607 --> 00:19:06.619\nof times here.\n\n321\n00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:11.329\nSo we'll just give it a moment or\ntwo and it has to kind of do that.\n\n322\n00:19:11.329 --> 00:19:15.332\nSo this is just making the connection\nmark making sure that he information can\n\n323\n00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:15.835\nbe seen.\n\n324\n00:19:15.835 --> 00:19:16.694\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n325\n00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:19.882\n&gt;&gt; At least that's what I'm hoping.\n\n326\n00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:22.083\nI've got two of these windows open,\nlet me see which one is which.\n\n327\n00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:23.109\nThere it goes.\n\n328\n00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:26.024\nSo that's the problem that I had,\nI had had the wrong one open.\n\n329\n00:19:26.024 --> 00:19:27.005\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n330\n00:19:27.005 --> 00:19:29.715\n&gt;&gt; So, there we go.\n\n331\n00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:35.651\nAll right, so now that I have\nthis as the flow of information,\n\n332\n00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:42.516\nit doesn't really look too impressive\nas far as the information goes.\n\n333\n00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:47.342\nBut as I start to take a look at some of\nthe other stuff, 11 minutes 47 seconds.\n\n334\n00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:51.601\nThere's the application,\nhere's the group that's a part of,\n\n335\n00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:55.715\nthere of course,\nis the application that's not classified.\n\n336\n00:19:55.715 --> 00:19:59.831\nThe total amount of traffic\nthat's going across.\n\n337\n00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:04.213\nSo we can see that it's got some\ninformation that's starting to\n\n338\n00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:05.195\nhappen here.\n\n339\n00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:11.846\nAll right, now if I select on the,\nmake sure I'm telling you right here.\n\n340\n00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:19.494\nLet me do the quick view, there we go,\nthis is what I'm looking for.\n\n341\n00:20:19.494 --> 00:20:24.720\nNow, notice that there is a graphical\nrepresentation instead, okay.\n\n342\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.785\nNow, with this graphical representation,\nlook at how I can zoom in.\n\n343\n00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:32.170\nRemember, if we go back to\nthat first episode, and\n\n344\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.176\nwe talk about that conversation, right?\n\n345\n00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:36.214\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That we had, that we're spotting.\n\n346\n00:20:36.214 --> 00:20:39.283\nRemember, that there could be hundreds,\non my network, there's four, okay?\n\n347\n00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:42.587\nBut there could be hundreds of\ncomputers actually communicating.\n\n348\n00:20:42.587 --> 00:20:46.342\nBut I want to spot the amount of data\nthat's going across from this one.\n\n349\n00:20:46.342 --> 00:20:49.635\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I can actually even see the username,\n\n350\n00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:55.006\nthe host machine that is on IP address,\nthe group that he's a part of.\n\n351\n00:20:55.006 --> 00:20:57.397\nThe activity and duration here so far,\n\n352\n00:20:57.397 --> 00:21:01.102\n3 minutes 35 seconds you've\nbeen active for about 11.\n\n353\n00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:04.586\nYou can see that on this day,\nthis actually got brought up,\n\n354\n00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:08.636\neverything got brought up about\nthree hours, that's about right.\n\n355\n00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:12.201\nYou can see the server information\nover on the other side,\n\n356\n00:21:12.201 --> 00:21:16.954\nand there's that production server that\nI added into that group to monitor.\n\n357\n00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:19.808\nYou can see how much\ndata is going across and\n\n358\n00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:23.864\nhow many packets on what\nparticular port in what direction.\n\n359\n00:21:23.864 --> 00:21:27.950\nThe service summary and\nthe number of connections in between,\n\n360\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.109\nas well as the amount of\ndata coming through, and\n\n361\n00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:35.518\nthe first port number that came\nacross from that other side as well.\n\n362\n00:21:35.518 --> 00:21:37.236\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthis is all from Stealthwatch, right?\n\n363\n00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:38.953\n&gt;&gt; It's all within Stealthwatch.\n\n364\n00:21:38.953 --> 00:21:44.437\nThis is all a type of, for us here a\nspecific type of flow communication, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.554\n&gt;&gt; Any types of tool.\n\n366\n00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.741\n&gt;&gt; That we have available to us and\n\n367\n00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.950\nNetFlow is what provide\nthe basis behind us.\n\n368\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.922\nOkay, so with that in hand, there's\nalso other things that this tool can do.\n\n369\n00:21:55.922 --> 00:22:02.951\nBut if you, let me get kind of\ninto exam prep mode for a moment.\n\n370\n00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:07.637\nSo this, something like this right here,\nI'm gonna leave it up on purpose, okay,\n\n371\n00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:09.421\nbecause I wanna say something.\n\n372\n00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:14.241\nNow, I would screenshot this, is what\nI would do, is what I would do here.\n\n373\n00:22:14.241 --> 00:22:17.762\nNow this not the exact one you'll\nend up seeing on the exams and\n\n374\n00:22:17.762 --> 00:22:21.640\nI can't even tell you what you\nare actually going to see on the exam.\n\n375\n00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.982\nBut you want to understand the labeling\nthat you're seeing right here.\n\n376\n00:22:24.982 --> 00:22:26.143\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n377\n00:22:26.143 --> 00:22:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.028\nSo if you wanna take a look at that,\nI'll zoom in just a little bit more so\n\n379\n00:22:31.028 --> 00:22:32.778\nthat we can get a better shot.\n\n380\n00:22:32.778 --> 00:22:37.071\nAt least I hope to give you a better\nshot and what you can see there.\n\n381\n00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:42.057\nSo that way, if you want to go ahead and\ndo something like that, and\n\n382\n00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.943\nthat way you can do that.\n\n383\n00:22:43.943 --> 00:22:46.348\nHey, let's go ahead and\nalso full screen this,\n\n384\n00:22:46.348 --> 00:22:50.468\nthat way somebody might be able to take a\nbetter screenshot of something like this.\n\n385\n00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:51.776\nAnd this will also help you out.\n\n386\n00:22:51.776 --> 00:22:54.861\nSo I would do this, and\nI would go through and\n\n387\n00:22:54.861 --> 00:22:59.376\nmake sure I understand what I'm\nseeing on something like this.\n\n388\n00:22:59.376 --> 00:23:04.593\nIn case in the future have you run across\nsomeone that says hey, what is the amount\n\n389\n00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:09.222\nof data that is going across from\nthis connection to thiss connection?\n\n390\n00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:11.783\nOr who's involved in\nthis communication here?\n\n391\n00:23:11.783 --> 00:23:13.501\nHow long has it been active?\n\n392\n00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:16.572\nWhatever it might be,\nit should not be a challenge for\n\n393\n00:23:16.572 --> 00:23:20.003\nyou when you take a look at this\nat what you're looking for.\n\n394\n00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:23.617\nSo do make sure that you\npay attention there.\n\n395\n00:23:23.617 --> 00:23:28.694\nNow even though this is kind of the more\nimportant aspect of what we're taking away\n\n396\n00:23:28.694 --> 00:23:33.863\nfor exam prep, Stealthwatch also provides\ndifferent facets of the information.\n\n397\n00:23:33.863 --> 00:23:34.371\nSo now,\n\n398\n00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:38.798\nnotice that I can actually just change\nit to look at it as a per interface,\n\n399\n00:23:38.798 --> 00:23:43.241\nand you can see right here, that is\nsaying hey, on this interface okay?\n\n400\n00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:45.116\nI'm gathering what I can gather.\n\n401\n00:23:45.116 --> 00:23:49.000\nAnd then if I go over here, you can see\nit can also go to the other interface and\n\n402\n00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.988\ndo the same thing.\n\n403\n00:23:49.988 --> 00:23:55.159\nIt is quite amazing, and if you need\nto even tabular information instead,\n\n404\n00:23:55.159 --> 00:23:59.194\nthat way you get a better report\nas you go down and see this.\n\n405\n00:23:59.194 --> 00:24:04.025\nBut it's not gonna be uncommon for\nus to try and take a look at this,\n\n406\n00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:08.081\nto observe the type of data\nthat we're looking for, and\n\n407\n00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:10.956\nto even see possibly the application.\n\n408\n00:24:10.956 --> 00:24:14.373\nAnd notice this one is unclassified at\nthis point, which man we probably need to\n\n409\n00:24:14.373 --> 00:24:16.936\ngo back through and\nmake sure it's recognized too, okay?\n\n410\n00:24:16.936 --> 00:24:21.410\nSo NetFlow information, quite a bit of\ninformation that's available to us.\n\n411\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.688\nWe need to be able to take the facet and\nthe information that we're given and\n\n412\n00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:28.090\nunderstand what part is NetFlow\ninformation that we're seeing right here.\n\n413\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.624\nIt's pretty much just about\neverything that we think about, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:31.624 --> 00:24:36.478\nSo Zach, that kind of really does\nround out just about everything that\n\n415\n00:24:36.478 --> 00:24:40.692\nwe want to at least get prepared for\nin dealing with NetFlow.\n\n416\n00:24:40.692 --> 00:24:42.973\nIt's not always gonna be this, right?\n\n417\n00:24:42.973 --> 00:24:46.669\nBut you can't say that on,\nsince we're preparing for a Cisco exam,\n\n418\n00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:51.145\nI can't get away and go, okay, I'm not\ngonna show you any Cisco utilities at all.\n\n419\n00:24:51.145 --> 00:24:52.261\nAt least right here,\n\n420\n00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:56.170\nyou get a good shot of the very fact that\nthis is a utility that you might see.\n\n421\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.486\nAnd it's something that's very common\ninside of security operations centers,\n\n422\n00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:03.497\nespecially big ones,\nthat might be able to help you out.\n\n423\n00:25:03.497 --> 00:25:05.884\nSo, make sure you're\nable to examine that and\n\n424\n00:25:05.884 --> 00:25:09.388\nanalyze the amount of information\nthat you're seeing right here.\n\n425\n00:25:09.388 --> 00:25:12.143\nThat's kind of a big key\naspect of using NetFlow.\n\n426\n00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:13.851\n&gt;&gt; Excellent information,\nRonnie, thank you so much.\n\n427\n00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:18.326\nAnd this is Identifying NetFlow Version 5\nRecords, Part 2, make sure you see Part 1.\n\n428\n00:25:18.326 --> 00:25:21.650\nAnd before we say goodbye,\nRonnie, any last words?\n\n429\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.801\n&gt;&gt; Well, study is the key, right?\n\n430\n00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:27.541\nAnd if we don't have equipment at home,\n\n431\n00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:33.262\nmost of us are not gonna go out and\nenable NetFlow very easily.\n\n432\n00:25:33.262 --> 00:25:38.844\nBut the great thing is, with ITProTV,\nyou have access to different Cisco labs.\n\n433\n00:25:38.844 --> 00:25:42.246\nNow, there's no specific labs for\nthe SecOps right now, but\n\n434\n00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:45.061\ntaking advantage of the Cisco\nlabs that are there,\n\n435\n00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:48.411\ntake advantage of the routers and\nswitchers that are there.\n\n436\n00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:52.815\nTry and learn some of the different\ncommands that involve enabling NetFlow,\n\n437\n00:25:52.815 --> 00:25:57.147\nand use that to actually be able to see\nwhat you can see just even in the command\n\n438\n00:25:57.147 --> 00:25:59.542\nline interface and in the show commands.\n\n439\n00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:03.879\nLike what I showed you, verify that you\nunderstand what those things are as well\n\n440\n00:26:03.879 --> 00:26:05.835\nand that will also help you out too.\n\n441\n00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:09.315\nSo there's plenty of help out there on\nthe Internet that can get you ready.\n\n442\n00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:13.178\nMake sure you pay attention to\nthe Version 5 Record Flow Format and\n\n443\n00:26:13.178 --> 00:26:17.870\nunderstand those, pick our fields that we\ndid call out in this little mini series\n\n444\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.541\ninside of this SecOps show.\n\n445\n00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:20.696\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie, well done.\n\n446\n00:26:20.696 --> 00:26:23.367\nAnd like he was saying,\ngo to the course library.\n\n447\n00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:28.585\nCheck out all the Cisco SecOps videos,\nyou will be happy that you did that.\n\n448\n00:26:28.585 --> 00:26:33.739\nAnd hey, tell someone you know about\nITProTV, they'll be thankful that you did.\n\n449\n00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:34.479\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n450\n00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:35.301\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n451\n00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:37.324\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n452\n00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:45.486\n[MUSIC]\n\n453\n00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.688\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:07.924\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.806\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.466\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.707\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:19.869\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco SECOPS.\n\n9\n00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.115\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:24.932\nwe're going to be examining\nintrusion events with Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:26.415\nRonnie, good to have you here again.\n\n12\n00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:30.318\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again for having me back\non the show as we do now take a look,\n\n13\n00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:33.878\nof course, at an intrusion event,\nand how we can spot it, and\n\n14\n00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:36.914\nsome of the different\nelements we need to identify.\n\n15\n00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:40.389\nAnd then, even with that\nintrusion analysis, at this point,\n\n16\n00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:41.642\nwhat can we do with it?\n\n17\n00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.925\nSo that's what we're hoping to show\nyou in this episode as we walk\n\n18\n00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:48.944\nthrough some of the different utilities\nthat are out there and available to us.\n\n19\n00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:53.554\nAnd we want to introduce you to one that\nwe are going to be using to help us out.\n\n20\n00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.850\nNow because we're in a lab environment,\n\n21\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.669\nright, we don't have\neverything set up in the same\n\n22\n00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:02.930\nway that a real world environment is going\nto be because it takes a long time for\n\n23\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.348\ncertain types of intrusion events to show\nup for the systems that we're using.\n\n24\n00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:11.710\nOf course, to learn what they need to or\nto get enough data to analyze and\n\n25\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.838\nto do all the information, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:17.807\nSo what we've done is we kind of fast\nforwarded the information a little bit\n\n27\n00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:20.148\nmore into our intrusion detection system.\n\n28\n00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:23.947\nAnd that way we can examine the\ninformation without really having to build\n\n29\n00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:27.684\nit all up and say all right, all right,\nwe're starting this process and\n\n30\n00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:29.295\nwe're gonna wait three days.\n\n31\n00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.588\nAnd then hopefully we'll be able\nto look at it at that point.\n\n32\n00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:36.144\nSo that's what I've done here\nin the lab that we've set up,\n\n33\n00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:40.469\nis that I've taken already previous\ninformation that I know that has some\n\n34\n00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.521\ninteresting things in it that we're gonna\nlook at as far as an intrusion goes, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:49.402\nAnd then I'm running through the system\nin, well, actually rapid time,\n\n36\n00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:50.831\nis what I've done, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:55.178\nThere's a utility out there in\nthe Linux that's called Tcpreplay.\n\n38\n00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:56.827\nAnd you can look that up and\n\n39\n00:01:56.827 --> 00:02:00.806\nsee how to use that to make it\nhappen a little bit faster for you.\n\n40\n00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:03.605\nBut then,\nthat won't generate the information.\n\n41\n00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.866\nSo what we're taking a look at then,\nof course,\n\n42\n00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.698\nis how this intrusion is going to look.\n\n43\n00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:10.889\nAnd what we see, so let's take a look at\nmy screen, and that will help us out.\n\n44\n00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:19.215\nAnd what I'm on right now is a nice Linux\ndistro that is called SecurityOnion, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:23.689\nSecurityOnion is a distribution that\nis designed fairly similar to the way\n\n46\n00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.472\nthat Kali Linux is designed.\n\n47\n00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:29.400\nBut this one is more about the idea\nof intrusion detection, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.808\nIt really does allow us to be able to\nanalyze the data a little bit more,\n\n49\n00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.640\ngives us all those utilities\nthat are built into the system.\n\n50\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.971\nAnd it's something that you can download\nand the nice thing about this one,\n\n51\n00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:42.856\njust like Kali Linux is it's free, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.886\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you that,\nmy favorite word.\n\n53\n00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:47.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n54\n00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:48.165\nIt's a great utility.\n\n55\n00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:50.046\nIt's something that we can learn on and\n\n56\n00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.768\na lot of companies are using SecurityOnion\nto help them in the analysis part.\n\n57\n00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:57.283\nSo that's what we're also\ngonna end up doing here, too.\n\n58\n00:02:57.283 --> 00:02:57.992\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n59\n00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:01.129\n&gt;&gt; So just to show you an example\nof something that I did,\n\n60\n00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.989\nlet me launch this terminal for\na moment, and we'll talk about.\n\n61\n00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.754\nI was hoping to show this, but\napparently it kind of went away on me.\n\n62\n00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:14.413\nI downloaded a premade pcap file, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:19.298\nA pcap file is essentially a packet\ncapture file that we can open up in\n\n64\n00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:24.029\nWireshark, where we can open up\nin something like Sguil as well.\n\n65\n00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.515\nWe can open all that stuff up.\n\n66\n00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:29.246\nAnd it shows us the information\nthat was captured through it.\n\n67\n00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:35.327\nBy using Tcpreplay, I ran it through\nthe system as it actually is mimicking and\n\n68\n00:03:35.327 --> 00:03:40.768\nimitating that it's going through\nthe intrusion detection system,\n\n69\n00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:43.003\nsomething like Sguil here.\n\n70\n00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:45.252\nSo it's not just that I imported it in,\n\n71\n00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:48.250\nactually ran it like Sguil\nwas going to capture it and\n\n72\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.841\nactually be able to look at it in that\nformat So it's able to generate that data.\n\n73\n00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.827\nNow this is not something\nwe're gonna do all the time.\n\n74\n00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:59.207\nBut this is something that we can do to at\nleast make it replay in the way that we\n\n75\n00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:02.493\nwant it to and how that actually\nhappened on the system and\n\n76\n00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:04.350\nthe way that it can be captured.\n\n77\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.032\nAnd so once I did that, I opened up Sguil.\n\n78\n00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:12.080\nIt's weird, it's spelled a little bit\ndifferent than the way we would think,\n\n79\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.997\nS-G-U-I-L.\n\n80\n00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:15.669\nBut according to their website\nit is pronounced squeal,\n\n81\n00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.627\njust like you would hear a pig squealing.\n\n82\n00:04:17.627 --> 00:04:19.984\nThat's exactly how it's pronounced here.\n\n83\n00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:24.746\nAnd once I did that,\nit generated all these different types of\n\n84\n00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:29.427\nintrusion events,\nreal time events that come across here.\n\n85\n00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:31.734\nOkay, now it went through\nright about 10,000 packets.\n\n86\n00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:35.681\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's about 9,950 packets it went through.\n\n87\n00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.838\nAnd these are the ones that it pulled in\nas far as the analysis goes that we can\n\n88\n00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:40.701\ntake a look at.\n\n89\n00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:45.767\nAlong with that,\nthis screen that we see, we can also see\n\n90\n00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:52.116\nrules down here at the bottom, and\nthen, even the packet data as well.\n\n91\n00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:56.305\nSo these rules, of course, are gonna be\nfrom snore or something called Siracata.\n\n92\n00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:58.330\nAll that's actually in place for us.\n\n93\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.691\nI was able to do the analysis on each one\nof them as it pulled it in to give us\n\n94\n00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.219\na little bit more information.\n\n95\n00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.541\nAdn that's why this is a great utility.\n\n96\n00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:07.112\nWe don't have to pay a cent for it.\n\n97\n00:05:07.112 --> 00:05:10.226\nIt all is pretty much in there and\nready and\n\n98\n00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.969\navailable for\nus to take a look at and to go, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.519\nSo this time as we want to focus in on\nsomething, what we wanna do, of course,\n\n100\n00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:23.208\nfirst is actually identify what we call\ndifferent things that might point out to\n\n101\n00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.607\nthe intrusion that we're looking for.\n\n102\n00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:27.996\nThis entire thing really\nis about intrusion.\n\n103\n00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:29.363\nDon't get me wrong, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:29.983\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n105\n00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:32.911\n&gt;&gt; But what is it that keys us in\non something that we're definitely\n\n106\n00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:33.569\nlooking for?\n\n107\n00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:40.388\nThis is where we go and\nwe find the IP 5 tuple data again, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:43.076\nThat's what we're really taking a look at.\n\n109\n00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.271\nAnd that kind of keys us in that\nthis is all part of one flow.\n\n110\n00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:52.595\nSo for example, as I look here\njust in the very top elements,\n\n111\n00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:57.190\nokay, so on the Alert ID 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n112\n00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.946\nI can see the source IP and\nthe destination IP,\n\n113\n00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:04.617\nas well as source port and\ndestination port.\n\n114\n00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:07.973\nNotice that on this one,\nI actually get kind of the reverse.\n\n115\n00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:10.083\nNow there's a return\ntraffic that comes back.\n\n116\n00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:12.897\nThe destination IP is now the source.\n\n117\n00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:14.552\nAnd then the source port over here.\n\n118\n00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:19.313\nSo I know that that's pretty much part\nof one kind of very possible danger\n\n119\n00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:23.857\nthat's happening as I take a look\nat the event message information.\n\n120\n00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:28.703\nSweet Orange CDN Gate Method 2,\npossible Sweet Orange redirection,\n\n121\n00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:34.451\nall that doesn't sound like something that\nis like, what the heck is Sweet Orange?\n\n122\n00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.612\nIf you're asking that question about\ndata that's coming through your network,\n\n123\n00:06:37.612 --> 00:06:38.951\nthat means you better examine it.\n\n124\n00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.437\nYou better take a look\nat this information and\n\n125\n00:06:41.437 --> 00:06:44.784\nfigure out the information that\nwe're looking for as well.\n\n126\n00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:49.902\nThis is where we can scroll down\na little bit more and then take a look.\n\n127\n00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:51.968\nLet me kind of do this here.\n\n128\n00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:55.119\nSo now we can zoom in on these\ndifferent types of rules.\n\n129\n00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.480\nLet me see if I can pull them up.\n\n130\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.722\nThere we go, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:57.722 --> 00:06:59.616\nTrying to get to one that's right here.\n\n132\n00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:03.710\nSo now I can see the rule\ninformation on what's happened.\n\n133\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.522\nFlow established to server content.\n\n134\n00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:11.332\nHere's the URI, HTTP URI,\nfast pattern only.\n\n135\n00:07:11.332 --> 00:07:14.344\nStart seeing a bunch of little\ncharacters here, class type.\n\n136\n00:07:14.344 --> 00:07:18.897\nNotice right away it indicates\nsomething else, trojan activity.\n\n137\n00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:23.393\nThis is something that I may want to\nmake sure that I pay attention to, and\n\n138\n00:07:23.393 --> 00:07:26.511\nit actually found it on\nthe download rules for us.\n\n139\n00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:28.573\nSo we'll use that as an example.\n\n140\n00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:32.915\nWell, we can just simply select the third\none, and now see a little bit more.\n\n141\n00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:37.055\nAnd here, you start seeing a lot\nof information that comes across.\n\n142\n00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:38.126\n&gt;&gt; That's quite a bit.\n\n143\n00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:41.979\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we started to\nactually examine some of the other things.\n\n144\n00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.424\nAnd on previous episodes, we talked about\nsome of the different ways an attack could\n\n145\n00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.565\nhappen, especially over a web server.\n\n146\n00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:52.857\nWe talked about some of the characters\nthat you might end up running into, and\n\n147\n00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:57.034\nnow I'm seeing a whole slash of that\ninformation right here, too, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:57.034 --> 00:08:01.035\nSo we're able to pull some of\nthat information just by looking.\n\n149\n00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:05.436\nJust the data and the rules that\nare there that are available to us,\n\n150\n00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:08.279\njust in that cursory examination, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.391\nSo we can pull in,\nof course, the addresses.\n\n152\n00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:16.350\nAnd even the source identities and\nthe ports here on destinations as well.\n\n153\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.912\nAnd then see how it actually\nmatches to the rules.\n\n154\n00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:23.580\nJust when you and I think that we\nare completely done with this, okay.\n\n155\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.061\nWe're not, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:30.561\nInside of SQL this is where it\nactually gets much more detailed.\n\n157\n00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.402\nSome of these columns if\nyou right click on them,\n\n158\n00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:36.397\nit will give you some information and\nyou'll see.\n\n159\n00:08:36.397 --> 00:08:37.576\nLet me see if I can zoom in on that, and\n\n160\n00:08:37.576 --> 00:08:39.041\nthat will make it a little bit easier,\nokay?\n\n161\n00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:42.536\nNotice on Alert ID, I can use this tool\n\n162\n00:08:42.536 --> 00:08:47.141\nto pivot to different other\nthings that it can do.\n\n163\n00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:48.674\nSo inside here I can go hey,\n\n164\n00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:53.432\nlet's take a look at the transcript of\nthe conversation that's happening, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:57.203\nI can even go ahead and\nsend it to WireShark if I want to.\n\n166\n00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.764\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; I can do something called NetworkMiner.\n\n167\n00:08:59.764 --> 00:09:04.692\nAnd I can even use Bro, which is another\nutility that's out there and available for\n\n168\n00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:08.372\nus, to be able to get some more\ndata out of this as well, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:13.049\nSo all this information that's\nactually available to us is neat and\n\n170\n00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:16.998\nit's actually right there\nthat we can pivot from, too.\n\n171\n00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:19.781\nIf I right-click on CNT here,\nwhich is the count,\n\n172\n00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:23.360\nlet me select something else that\nactually has a little bit more.\n\n173\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.273\nSo notice this actually saying that\nthis particular line on this event\n\n174\n00:09:28.273 --> 00:09:29.281\non fiesta EK.\n\n175\n00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:34.136\nEK stands for exploit kit, okay,\nis what this one stands for right here.\n\n176\n00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:39.050\nI can see that 15 packets have\nactually gone by the interface here\n\n177\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.695\nwith something like this going on.\n\n178\n00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:44.945\nAnd if I right-click and\nselect View Correlated Events,\n\n179\n00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:47.412\nnotice that shows me all the events, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:52.117\nThat are sent to here, and\nhere's where we see once\n\n181\n00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:56.614\nagain that idea of the five two pool data,\nokay?\n\n182\n00:09:56.614 --> 00:10:00.724\nSource IP, Source Port,\nDestination IP, Destination Port and\n\n183\n00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:04.907\nPR actually does stand for\nprotocol six, as what it stands for, so\n\n184\n00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:08.216\nthat actually links it to\na numeric system instead.\n\n185\n00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:12.609\nBut when all those are identical\nacross all of these,\n\n186\n00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:15.248\nthis is one particular attack.\n\n187\n00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:18.104\nSo all of these particular events here,\n\n188\n00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:21.891\nare all this one single\nattack is what we're seeing.\n\n189\n00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:23.562\nWhen we see something like that.\n\n190\n00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:26.548\nSo it does allow us to kind of see that.\n\n191\n00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:28.379\nLet me go ahead and close this out for\n\n192\n00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:31.077\na moment as we get back to\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n193\n00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:34.803\nSo just being able to identify\nthat information is gonna be key,\n\n194\n00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:38.186\njust saying here's the attacks\nthat we're looking for.\n\n195\n00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:42.774\nSo if we continue to select on down here,\nwe can see a little bit more here,\n\n196\n00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:44.631\nsome other URI structuring.\n\n197\n00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:49.699\nSo let's go ahead, and\nnow on this one that has 13.\n\n198\n00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:53.539\nI'm going to select on the alert ID here,\n\n199\n00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:57.395\nif I right-click and I go to transcript.\n\n200\n00:10:57.395 --> 00:11:01.725\nI can now start examining inside of the\ntranscript window what's happening between\n\n201\n00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:05.386\nthose two machines as far as\nthe transcript what's happening, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:10.483\nRight at the beginning of course, we have\nour header information that we might see.\n\n203\n00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:13.628\nAnd notice there's the get\nrequest that we have.\n\n204\n00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:18.971\nAnd on this get, it's somehow decided\nthat it was actually going to get, well,\n\n205\n00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:23.920\nonce again some unusual link here that\nhas this gigantic long number to it,\n\n206\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.451\nthat we don't know what it's about.\n\n207\n00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:28.493\nBut it's gonna get that information.\n\n208\n00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:30.591\nSo you continue to see the source\nthere and then the destination.\n\n209\n00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:34.778\nIt start announcing some of the other\nthings that we also see here.\n\n210\n00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.493\nAnd then some encrypted\ndata as we go on through-\n\n211\n00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:38.527\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n212\n00:11:38.527 --> 00:11:40.629\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so all that's encrypted data.\n\n213\n00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:43.221\nThen we could see another\nget message happening.\n\n214\n00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:47.621\nNotice that this is giving a little bit\nmore complex as it's actually now saying,\n\n215\n00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:49.359\nhey, I need to get more of this.\n\n216\n00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:50.634\nWhat is that?\n\n217\n00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:51.621\nAgain, I don't know.\n\n218\n00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:53.354\nI don't know exactly what it is.\n\n219\n00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:55.596\nBut now, you can see the refer field,\n\n220\n00:11:55.596 --> 00:12:00.295\nwhich if you're not exactly sure and\nyou're going, this sound foreign to me,\n\n221\n00:12:00.295 --> 00:12:03.962\nmake sure you go back and\ntake a look at the HTTP header, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:03.962 --> 00:12:07.894\nTax that we were talking about and\nwe described HTTP headers.\n\n223\n00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:11.652\nAnd you'll notice on that the referral\nfield normally doesn't have\n\n224\n00:12:11.652 --> 00:12:12.570\nanything in it.\n\n225\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.143\nThis one is actually saying hey,\n\n226\n00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:17.071\ngo and retrieve something else\nfrom here if we need to, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:22.807\nSo there is a lot of information\nthat we are seeing just right here\n\n228\n00:12:22.807 --> 00:12:30.156\nin terms of exploits that can happen just\nin the transcript nature of what we have.\n\n229\n00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:32.409\nNot only do we see stuff like that, but\n\n230\n00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:35.517\nI can also see information\nthat goes across as well.\n\n231\n00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:41.742\nAnd right here should be the one\nthat kind of gets us, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:41.742 --> 00:12:46.710\nFlash Exploit Download or Fiesta Flash\nExploit, and then the PDF Exploit.\n\n233\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.122\nWell, that doesn't sound\nlike a big deal so much.\n\n234\n00:12:50.122 --> 00:12:53.620\nFlash is being used,\nPDF is being used, you name it.\n\n235\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.516\nThere's a lot of things that are actually\nin use here that we might take a look at,\n\n236\n00:12:58.516 --> 00:12:59.453\nand go, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:59.453 --> 00:13:02.734\nSo there's no real big\ndeal that's happening.\n\n238\n00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:04.172\nBut there can be, there can be some\nother things that are also happening.\n\n239\n00:13:04.172 --> 00:13:08.328\nI'm gonna scroll back up to the top here,\ncuz I wanna focus in on one.\n\n240\n00:13:08.328 --> 00:13:11.212\nA little bit more vague, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:13.438\nWhich is this one, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:19.659\nPolicy PE EXE or\nDLL Windows file download.\n\n243\n00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:23.405\nNow what in the world is that one about?\n\n244\n00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:24.928\nSo what was actually downloaded?\n\n245\n00:13:24.928 --> 00:13:27.234\nI can see the two events here.\n\n246\n00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:31.780\nSo if I right click and select\ncollated events, I can now check and\n\n247\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.693\nverify something, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:33.693 --> 00:13:37.676\nWhich for\nus is again the five tuple information.\n\n249\n00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:40.504\nSo I know this is part of the same attack,\nand\n\n250\n00:13:40.504 --> 00:13:44.421\nI can see that this is actually\nwhat we're looking for okay?\n\n251\n00:13:44.421 --> 00:13:47.557\nSo from this point as we\nstart to take a look and go,\n\n252\n00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:51.607\nthat's the information we want\nto know a little bit more about.\n\n253\n00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:56.060\nUnder alert ID, right-clicking\nis kind of the key here, and\n\n254\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.770\nyou'll have to take a little bit\nof time and learn, like if I right\n\n255\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.759\nclick notice I can go to source,\nIP and do some querying, over here.\n\n256\n00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:10.390\nAnd then there's another thing that we can\ndo and somebody actually mentioned this in\n\n257\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.505\nour chat right before we began, is that\nSecurity Onion has a lot of tools that\n\n258\n00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:17.748\nare available and\nthere is one that's called ELSA as well.\n\n259\n00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:20.838\nElsa allows us to take a look\nat the vulnerabilities too, and\n\n260\n00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:23.336\nit gives us this ability\nto do it right from here.\n\n261\n00:14:23.336 --> 00:14:26.670\nSo pivoting, so this is kind of\na nice main tool that we can\n\n262\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:31.188\nthen now launch other tools from if we\nneed to without having to actually go and\n\n263\n00:14:31.188 --> 00:14:32.665\nlaunch the other tools.\n\n264\n00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:35.980\nNotice that it gives us all\nthese information right here,\n\n265\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.289\nthat's actually ready and available.\n\n266\n00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:41.777\nLet me select the ELSA lookup\non the source right now.\n\n267\n00:14:41.777 --> 00:14:43.899\nAnd let's see what happens here.\n\n268\n00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.439\nAnd it should allow me to log in.\n\n269\n00:14:46.439 --> 00:14:51.733\nAnd this is where if everything\nis there and available for\n\n270\n00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:55.826\nus, I don't know what the IP address is.\n\n271\n00:14:55.826 --> 00:14:59.259\nBut you'd have to actually start from\nthese filters is what you would actually\n\n272\n00:14:59.259 --> 00:14:59.893\nend up doing.\n\n273\n00:14:59.893 --> 00:15:03.742\nMaking sure you examine the correct\ntime period that you're looking for,\n\n274\n00:15:03.742 --> 00:15:07.240\nthen you could select what it is\nthat you're also looking for here.\n\n275\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.754\nI didn't actually remember\nwhat the IP addresses are, so\n\n276\n00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:11.768\nthis is not really gonna\nhelp us out right now.\n\n277\n00:15:11.768 --> 00:15:15.579\nBut we're not really looking for this tool\nyet, we'll get there a little bit later.\n\n278\n00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.137\nI'm not going to try and rush that and\n\n279\n00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:19.460\ndo something on the fly that\nI'm not ready for, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.134\nSo at that point, but you can, you can see\nwhere it's actually launching other tools.\n\n281\n00:15:23.134 --> 00:15:26.133\nNow once we determine this and\ngo, all right.\n\n282\n00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.001\nHere it is.\n\n283\n00:15:27.001 --> 00:15:31.816\nNow Zach, I could try and\ntake a look down here at the bottom.\n\n284\n00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:35.443\nLook at the packet data\nthat's coming across.\n\n285\n00:15:35.443 --> 00:15:37.545\nLet me just zoom in here.\n\n286\n00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:38.985\n&gt;&gt; You mean the 10,000 packets?\n\n287\n00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:40.674\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n288\n00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:41.187\nThis is just a few of them, right?\n\n289\n00:15:41.187 --> 00:15:42.249\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So this is just one.\n\n290\n00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:45.735\nI can scroll through here and\ngo, I don't know.\n\n291\n00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:49.094\nIt says that there's a file download here,\nbut\n\n292\n00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:51.954\nI can't see any file download in there.\n\n293\n00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:54.559\nI don't really even know\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n294\n00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:58.504\nEven here, if I go through,\ndoes this program can be run in DOS mode.\n\n295\n00:15:58.504 --> 00:16:00.157\nI'm getting closer.\n\n296\n00:16:00.157 --> 00:16:01.035\nBut what is it?\n\n297\n00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:03.274\nI see some information.\n\n298\n00:16:03.274 --> 00:16:05.080\nSo I see the word text down here.\n\n299\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.716\nSo I can see a little bit of that,\nbut not really much besides that.\n\n300\n00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:12.252\nEverything else just kinda looks empty,\n\n301\n00:16:12.252 --> 00:16:15.230\nit doesn't look like\nanything was really done.\n\n302\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.111\nSo at that point you're going, all right.\n\n303\n00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:21.895\nSo how can I actually figure out\nwhat was actually downloaded,\n\n304\n00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:23.796\nwhat can we actually do?\n\n305\n00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:24.846\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n306\n00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:30.051\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple of different ones,\nfirst I wanna find out if this is right.\n\n307\n00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:36.411\nSo if I go back to ID, and I right click\non this, I can go to network minor,\n\n308\n00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:41.371\nand click OK, and inside of this\nnetwork minor utility it shows\n\n309\n00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:46.424\nme what it just scanned for, so\nit actually did say, all right,\n\n310\n00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:51.385\nhere's the source and\ndestination stuff, which is fine, but\n\n311\n00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:56.102\nnotice that there's this tab\nback here that says, Files.\n\n312\n00:16:56.102 --> 00:17:00.002\nIf I select files here, I should find,\nit didn't actually show up.\n\n313\n00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:04.336\nSo, it's right here that I would probably\nbe looking for if there's a file here.\n\n314\n00:17:04.336 --> 00:17:07.810\nSo this one says that there is\nno file actually in that one.\n\n315\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:12.199\nLet's try the other one up here, and\nsee what happens, up here on this one.\n\n316\n00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.593\nSo, sometimes you have to look\nin a couple of different places.\n\n317\n00:17:17.593 --> 00:17:18.402\nIf it's not here,\n\n318\n00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:21.702\nwe'll actually show you another way\nthat this can actually be found as well.\n\n319\n00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:25.776\nSo, this one is also saying, hey,\nthere's no file actually in here, but\n\n320\n00:17:25.776 --> 00:17:28.502\nthere's other things that\ncan actually be done.\n\n321\n00:17:28.502 --> 00:17:32.583\nSo the great thing is,\neven if the utilities and\n\n322\n00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:36.973\ntools aren't working here,\nif I right-click and\n\n323\n00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:43.421\ngo down to Wireshark this time, so\nwe're gonna pull this into Wireshark,\n\n324\n00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:50.211\nAnd now inside of Wireshark,\nall this is part of that one capture.\n\n325\n00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:53.495\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If I now go to, let me say,\n\n326\n00:17:53.495 --> 00:18:02.924\nFile &gt; Export Objects,\nSee what we can do, and there you go.\n\n327\n00:18:02.924 --> 00:18:05.691\nSo it was able to find,\n\n328\n00:18:05.691 --> 00:18:10.938\nthis particular application right here,\n\n329\n00:18:10.938 --> 00:18:16.869\nthat was linked to shrinkitking.com,-\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n330\n00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:17.767\n&gt;&gt; Whatever that was.\n\n331\n00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:21.275\nSo something was actually\ndownloaded on to my machine, and\n\n332\n00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:25.975\nit gives me the file name, and you notice\nthe file name is pretty darn long here,\n\n333\n00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:29.085\nand what's actually out there and\navailable to us.\n\n334\n00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:34.068\nSo we can actually find out the file from\nthere, download it, take that, export it,\n\n335\n00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:36.923\nand then run it inside of\na honey pot if we need to.\n\n336\n00:18:36.923 --> 00:18:37.985\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n337\n00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:40.424\n&gt;&gt; Export it and\nsee what the end result is going to be.\n\n338\n00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:44.887\nBut just taking the information like\nthat is going to at least help us\n\n339\n00:18:44.887 --> 00:18:49.764\nout a little bit in making sure we're\ncovering some of that information.\n\n340\n00:18:49.764 --> 00:18:54.370\nNow, being able to do this,\nextracting that file and that information,\n\n341\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.062\ndoesn't just come very naturally for us.\n\n342\n00:18:57.062 --> 00:19:01.012\nSo we might end up finding out that\nit's actually a lot easier for\n\n343\n00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:05.639\nus to just simply find the right, let me\nsee if I can actually do it this way.\n\n344\n00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:08.954\nSo I thought that this was possible,\nI could be wrong.\n\n345\n00:19:08.954 --> 00:19:10.882\nLet me try this one,\nit may be that I filtered in here.\n\n346\n00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:14.954\nNope, okay, so I was thinking that the\nfiles would actually show up if I did it\n\n347\n00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:18.041\nthis way, but\nthis one's not actually working that way.\n\n348\n00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:22.009\nBut if I go through here, and I start\nlooking at those things like downloads,\n\n349\n00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:26.282\nand the different structures that we are\nseeing here, such as the downloads here,\n\n350\n00:19:26.282 --> 00:19:30.556\nI can probably find out what files were\nactually downloaded onto those computers,\n\n351\n00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:32.109\nand do what we need to as well.\n\n352\n00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:37.746\nNow, this is not the most in-depth show in\nterms of indefinite intrusion analysis,\n\n353\n00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:42.461\nbut at least gets you started and\nworking with those tools a little bit.\n\n354\n00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:44.758\nThis one though,\nyou actually can download for free.\n\n355\n00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:48.990\nYou can go to a website,\nthe one that I've been using,\n\n356\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.946\nwhich is, malware-traffic-analysis.net and\n\n357\n00:19:52.946 --> 00:19:58.742\nthat will also give you PCAT files that\nyou can then import into SQL there and\n\n358\n00:19:58.742 --> 00:20:02.519\nbe able to examine that and\ntake a look at as well.\n\n359\n00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:07.126\nWe've still got some other utilities\ninside the security onion that we'll be\n\n360\n00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:11.519\nlooking at, but at least that will give\nyou some of the basic information in\n\n361\n00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:16.267\nidentifying those different elements\nthat we've really been talking about all\n\n362\n00:20:16.267 --> 00:20:20.942\nthroughout the entire series here,\nwhether you're actually inside of a SQL,\n\n363\n00:20:20.942 --> 00:20:25.549\nwhether you're inside a Wireshark,\npaying attention to those five tupols of\n\n364\n00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:29.804\ninformation are going to hefty no\nmatter what you actually end up doing,\n\n365\n00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:33.620\ncuz it can help you identify a lot\nof interesting traffic for us.\n\n366\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.856\nSo Zach, as far as the analysis part goes,\nthat's pretty much what we have ahead of\n\n367\n00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:41.912\nus, and there's more to come in that\nanalysis as we start breaking it down, and\n\n368\n00:20:41.912 --> 00:20:46.089\nstart sending it to some of those other\nutilities, but at least, at the beginning\n\n369\n00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:50.446\nhere, just getting that, taking a look at\nthe lines of data, and then understanding\n\n370\n00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:54.115\nwhat we're seeing there, is gonna be key,\nso take the time to do that.\n\n371\n00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:55.985\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information as usual, Ronnie.\n\n372\n00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:58.378\nThanks so very much.\nExamine intrusion events, and\n\n373\n00:20:58.378 --> 00:21:01.234\nthe security onion,\nthat has a free download.\n\n374\n00:21:01.234 --> 00:21:02.425\nThat's fantastic.\n\n375\n00:21:02.425 --> 00:21:03.431\nWhat a wonderful utility.\n\n376\n00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:06.234\nAnything else you'd like\nto add before we go on?\n\n377\n00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:09.029\n&gt;&gt; Nope, just take the time and\nreally think about this.\n\n378\n00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:13.711\nIf you haven't downloaded security onion\nat this particular point in your studies,\n\n379\n00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:15.540\nit's worth you downloading it.\n\n380\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.954\nDo not install it just as a regular\ninstall like you think of a regular Linux\n\n381\n00:21:19.954 --> 00:21:21.378\ndistro would install,\n\n382\n00:21:21.378 --> 00:21:26.023\nmake sure you follow the guide that's\nthere on the security onion homepage.\n\n383\n00:21:26.023 --> 00:21:30.287\nIf not, you'll set up network adapters and\nthey won't work the way that you want to.\n\n384\n00:21:30.287 --> 00:21:33.747\nSo, set that thing up, use the PCAT file,\nand be able to do that, and\n\n385\n00:21:33.747 --> 00:21:37.270\nstart examining some of the data\npackets that are rolling across, and\n\n386\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.677\nlearn the tool that's actually there for\nyou.\n\n387\n00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:43.684\nSo it's ready, and it's available, and\nit's free, you can't beat that price, and\n\n388\n00:21:43.684 --> 00:21:46.410\nyou can't beat the experience\nthat you'll learn from it.\n\n389\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, free's a good price.\n\n390\n00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:51.021\nThanks very much Ronnie, and\nmake sure to check out our course library,\n\n391\n00:21:51.021 --> 00:21:53.644\nyou can see everything in\nthe Cisco SEC OPS series, and\n\n392\n00:21:53.644 --> 00:21:57.238\nwhile you're there, hundreds of other\nvideos to help you go further, and\n\n393\n00:21:57.238 --> 00:21:59.947\ntell a friend about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n394\n00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:01.238\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n395\n00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:02.131\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n396\n00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.424\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again very soon.\n\n397\n00:22:03.424 -->

live\n\n3\n00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:08.154\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:11.708\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:12.790\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.020\nchoosing ITPro.TV helping\nyou learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.420\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nwe continue on with Cisco SECOPS.\n\n8\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.180\nAnd in this episode, intrusion event\ntechnologies will be the issue we'll be\n\n9\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.880\nlooking at and the person to bring us\nall that information that we need is but\n\n10\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.040\none and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.510\nRonnie, good to see you again sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.240\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too,\nI'm glad to be back on the show as we\n\n13\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.250\ntake a look at more of these different\ntypes of intrusion events and\n\n14\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.570\nthe technologies that\nare associated with them,\n\n15\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.300\nthat we can of course use to give us\nmore information to spot intrusions.\n\n16\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.540\nSo in a previous episode we did take\na look at a couple of the technologies.\n\n17\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.420\nAnd we showed you where it wasn't\nsuper fancy in terms of the porting.\n\n18\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.380\nSo in other words you really just\nhave to be able to understand\n\n19\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.170\nthe statistics that are given to you or\n\n20\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.990\nunderstand what result that you're getting\nthat you're not supposed to be getting.\n\n21\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.680\nAnd figure that out then you might\nactually have indication of intrusion.\n\n22\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.150\nNot every modification is an intrusion,\nbut there are modifications that you don't\n\n23\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.580\nknow why it was modified, you don't know\nwho was modified, you don't know what\n\n24\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.720\nthe modification was about or done, that\ncould also indicate that somebody else has\n\n25\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.940\nbeen tampering with things that you\nset up that you don't need them too.\n\n26\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.400\n&gt;&gt; I mean look at DHCP and DNS2 right?\n\n27\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the technologies that\nwe're pretty much talking about in\n\n28\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.450\nthe previous episode.\n\n29\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.040\nSo today we are also\ngoing to move forward and\n\n30\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.760\ntalk about some of the other technologies\nas well, so one of those things that\n\n31\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.490\nwe want to make sure that we start looking\nat, of course, are things like logs, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.920\nJust about every single application and\n\n33\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970\nserver that's out there will\nproduce some type of logging.\n\n34\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.020\nThat will give you information about what\nhas gone on along with a timestamp and\n\n35\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.690\neven an indication of the event\nthat occurred with it.\n\n36\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.190\nThose logs are actually very important\nbecause they help to trace down when\n\n37\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.560\nsomething has actually occurred and allow\nus to actually correlate that with actual\n\n38\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.210\nevents that go on, and we may even find\nout that it's been happening longer than\n\n39\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.080\nwe think it's been happening or we might\nfind out as an isolated single event too.\n\n40\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.610\nSo the idea of actually understanding and\nexamining logs is gonna be a big part\n\n41\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.540\nof just about what we're gonna\nbe doing on a daily basis,\n\n42\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.520\nif we're actually gonna be an analyst\nworking at security operations center.\n\n43\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.220\nBut the technologies specifically\ncalled out on the exam of course\n\n44\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.510\nis examining things like\nproxy logs instead,\n\n45\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.390\nnow it doesn't mean that\nthe other logs aren't important.\n\n46\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.470\nThey just expect that you all\nshould be able to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.820\nBut in terms of actually understanding\nproxy logs, we're really looking for\n\n48\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150\nwhat we call, of course,\ntransactional data.\n\n49\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.890\nAnd we also are looking for\nwhat we call extracted data as well.\n\n50\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.230\nNow what does that mean?\n\n51\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.490\nOkay, on the transactional data, we're\ntrying to see what has actually occurred\n\n52\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.590\nin terms of the communication, when did\nit happen, who made the request, and\n\n53\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.220\nthen what response was, and of course,\nwhen that happened as well.\n\n54\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.600\nWe can even see if a file's been\ndownloaded or transferred too,\n\n55\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.690\nand that may also indicate some\ntype of compromise as well.\n\n56\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.470\nSo in setting up the idea of using\na proxy, it is something that we want to\n\n57\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.200\nunderstand, that we want\nto take a look at too.\n\n58\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.750\nOkay, so proxies are actually\nkinda very neat things, and\n\n59\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.300\ndifferent companies use\nthem in different ways.\n\n60\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.670\nA great reason for a proxy, right,\nis the ability to restrict content,\n\n61\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.960\nokay and to actually make it go through\nwhere I choose to make it through.\n\n62\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.692\nAnd the reason why this is\nimportant is because now,\n\n63\n00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:36.210\nif I choose to browse the Internet,\nI browse through my own proxy server.\n\n64\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.610\nMy own proxy server then becomes\nthe end point for that communication.\n\n65\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.540\nTo the rest of the Internet and\nto the to where I'm actually connecting to\n\n66\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.670\na website of some sort, it actually\nis sending it back to the proxy.\n\n67\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.280\nAnd the proxy is just\nrelaying it back to me.\n\n68\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.850\nThis provides another additional layer\nof devices, or at least one device or\n\n69\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.540\na server that has to hit before\nit actually comes back to me.\n\n70\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.020\nSo even if there's something a lot\nof time malicious on that, or\n\n71\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.630\nsomething that might not be what I need,\nthe proxy server is still that\n\n72\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.530\none step removed from really getting\nan infection on my system, too, okay.\n\n73\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.830\nNow in the early days,\nin the earlier days, I mean,\n\n74\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.620\nI shouldn't say in the earliest\ndays of the Internet.\n\n75\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.400\nBut in earlier days of the Internet\nwhen you had a fairly weak connection or\n\n76\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.900\nan anemic connection to the Internet,\nthey seemed like it helps speed\n\n77\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.180\nup your connection to the Internet so you\ncan have a single 1.544 megabit connection\n\n78\n00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.115\nout to the Internet which today we\nwould probably cry if we had did that.\n\n79\n00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:34.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at one point,\n\n80\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.750\nthat would actually relatively\nfast as what we would have there.\n\n81\n00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.290\nBut then you could also,\n\n82\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.740\nof course, then share that with everybody\non the inside of your network, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.220\nNow by doing something like that, if you\nget a hundred people trying to connect to\n\n84\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.660\nthe same website as the same time exactly,\nyou're gonna end up with a bottle neck.\n\n85\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.060\nNot everybody's gonna be\nable to connect through,\n\n86\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.630\neven if you're only on a 100 megabit\nnetwork, at least very easily.\n\n87\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.740\nSo what you could do instead\nis set up the proxy server.\n\n88\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd that would allow for\nthe very first connection to be made,\n\n89\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.620\ncache whatever information that you\nwere downloading on that website.\n\n90\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.870\nOnto that proxy server and\neverybody would be able to hit that\n\n91\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.950\nparticular proxied information, cached\ninformation, much quicker than they could\n\n92\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.870\nif they were retrieving the same copy\n100 times all across the network, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.150\nThe other thing that proxies\nreally help to do, of course,\n\n94\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.790\nis to be able to hide your particular\nservice behind that device.\n\n95\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.250\nSo it means that an attacker or\nsomebody that you're facing tried\n\n96\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.160\nto make some type of intrusion, may not\neven be hitting the right servers, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.420\nSo it really can mislead someone,\nand it can redirect someone.\n\n98\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.080\nA lot of times even hackers use this and\n\n99\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.430\nthat's kind of the example that\nwe'll be using here to help us out.\n\n100\n00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.060\nBut we want to take a look\nat this technology and\n\n101\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.830\neven take a look at how it's logged when\nit works, okay, is what we want to do.\n\n102\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.220\nSo that's what we're gonna take\na look at first here, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.070\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthis is how we'll start off.\n\n104\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.510\nSo on the network that I'm in,\nhere's my outside IP address, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.960\nSo I've gone to this particular site here,\nand\n\n106\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.390\nthat's what we have right here\nis this particular IP address.\n\n107\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.750\nThat's the way that it ends up looking,\nat least to the Internet.\n\n108\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.970\nThis is where I am connecting through.\n\n109\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.350\nThat's not my true IP address.\n\n110\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.070\nInside of my network, my true IP\naddress is something else, all right.\n\n111\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.870\n&gt;&gt; What is it?\n\n112\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.675\nIt's whatever it is.\n\n113\n00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't even tell you because\n\n114\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.440\nI'm using DHCP.\n\n115\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But on this Kali Linux machine,\n\n116\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.233\nthough, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:39.379\nSo I went ahead I have set up\nkinda a little proxy server, here.\n\n118\n00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.898\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n119\n00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:42.877\nwhat I've done is that now that\nI've got the proxy server setup,\n\n120\n00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:45.960\nI'm actually setting it up\nto make it anonymous, here.\n\n121\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.950\nSo if I now fire this and\nthis gonna launch your web browser.\n\n122\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.960\nWatch what will end up happening in\nterms of the web browser here when we\n\n123\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.800\nget that set up here.\n\n124\n00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.920\nIs that, it will launch up,\n\n125\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.380\nlet me see if I can, everything\nkinda is a little weird in here.\n\n126\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.680\nSo now, you can see some of the results.\n\n127\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.725\nAnd that was pretty much\nall I was gonna really do.\n\n128\n00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Is to show you that it did change.\n\n129\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.950\nNow you did see my particular IP address\n\n130\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.275\nas actually whatever it was\non the other page, right?\n\n131\n00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But now notice it actually\n\n132\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.685\nis turning out to be something\na little bit different, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And actually, going somewhere else.\n\n134\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.600\nSo let me see if I can scroll.\n\n135\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.590\nUp here and see the information as we\nstarted off the command that I did here.\n\n136\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.570\nJust live this slow, so there we go.\n\n137\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.990\nSo there was the first thing\nthat I winched up here.\n\n138\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.617\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n139\n00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:43.580\nnow you could see chaining the events\ntogether, switching the IP addresses and\n\n140\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.481\nthe LMM, changing them round and\nhere is, the other IP address.\n\n141\n00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:53.503\nSo it's actually changed my particular one\nhere into something that looks like this,\n\n142\n00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:55.510\nand made that connection as well.\n\n143\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.461\nAnd now you actually see that it\nwill continue to go through and\n\n144\n00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.464\nchange it again, and again, and again.\n\n145\n00:08:00.464 --> 00:08:04.685\nAnd that's because the proxy server I set\nup is actually designed to anonymize who I\n\n146\n00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:07.410\nactually am and\nthe connection that I have out there.\n\n147\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.400\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n148\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's great, but\nit can also be a little bit tricky here.\n\n149\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:21.230\nSo if I go back to showmy, showmemy.info.\n\n150\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.620\nLet's see if this one works here.\n\n151\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.760\n&gt;&gt; And what I meant by that it's, it's\ngreat because that would disguise your\n\n152\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.590\nidentity but the attacker or the bad\nactors they could do the same thing right?\n\n153\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Correct\n&gt;&gt; They could disguise themselves that\n\n154\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.510\nway as well.\n\n155\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.150\nSo here's where you see\nwhere it's changed.\n\n157\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.350\nSo remember what my IP address really is,\nokay.\n\n158\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.977\nBut notice here it\nactually did change okay.\n\n159\n00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:46.820\nSo the ability to actually\nlog the information and\n\n160\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.948\nrealize what your IP addresses are being\nchanged at will help you in terms\n\n161\n00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:54.070\nin the differences that\nyou end up seeing it.\n\n162\n00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.660\nSo this is why we want\nto examine the logs.\n\n163\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.230\nIs our information being changed?\n\n164\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.310\nWhat are we actually looking for\nwhen it does?\n\n165\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.220\nAnd notice there's a few different\ndenied things that happened.\n\n166\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.720\nBut this one, I didn't even know\nwhat the address would end up being.\n\n167\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.210\nBut most of the time we're gonna\npick which one that we want.\n\n168\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.020\nBut it does at least set up for you\nthe idea that you can end up going through\n\n169\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.920\nanother machine, but\nyou have to know where you're going.\n\n170\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.830\nYou have to know and understand what is\nhappening when you do something like this.\n\n171\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.489\nAnd this actually still working and\ndoing all the things that it's doing here.\n\n172\n00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:26.994\nBut you can kind of see that and\nthat's what logs are really about,\n\n173\n00:09:26.994 --> 00:09:30.824\nit's actually seeing the information\nin action as it actually occurs.\n\n174\n00:09:30.824 --> 00:09:32.652\nAnd it really does help, so\n\n175\n00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:37.140\nthat's where we did the information\nrequest of showmemy.info.\n\n176\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.470\nAnd it really did continue\nto work it's process through\n\n177\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.550\nuntil the very outcome that we wanted.\n\n178\n00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.520\nAnd what it ended up showing up as,\nwhich was right there.\n\n179\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.130\nAt least that's what I think it did.\n\n180\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.710\nYep, so that's what you end up\nseeing a lot of times too, is\n\n181\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.100\nthat you'll see it actually does change,\nand it continues to change it around.\n\n182\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.140\nAnd even in the end it actually even\nreported something a little bit different\n\n183\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.110\non, showmemy.info.\n\n184\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.080\nSo even though I can see that\nthis is kind of the last place it\n\n185\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.520\nlooks like it took off.\n\n186\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.681\nIt still changed it again even\noutside of my particular server here.\n\n187\n00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n188\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.070\nit is kind of neat in\nbeing able to see this.\n\n189\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.630\nChecking out those proxy logs can reveal\na lot more information than what we think,\n\n190\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.860\nif we actually take a look at the logs.\n\n191\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.800\nAnd any device that has logs in it,\n\n192\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.410\nthis is where it becomes\na little bit more challenging.\n\n193\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.308\nMost of the time the logs that are\nactually kept on those devices logs every\n\n194\n00:10:28.308 --> 00:10:32.033\nsingle thing and\nevery detail that you have ready to go.\n\n195\n00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:36.849\nBut the problem with it is fairly simple,\nit's so much overwhelming information\n\n196\n00:10:36.849 --> 00:10:41.540\nwe also need some system then that\nwe can use to filter those logs out.\n\n197\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.150\nExamining logs, not exactly the easiest\nthing in the world because there is so\n\n198\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.330\nmuch information.\n\n199\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.490\nBut this is why instead of looking\nat it raw like what we did,\n\n200\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.840\nwe send it to another system, okay,\nthat actually allows us to look at\n\n201\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.390\nthe log viewer in some type of nice\nlittle graphical user interface.\n\n202\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.110\nAnd then allows us to provide a filter for\nit so that we can filter out a certain\n\n203\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.750\ntime period or range or even\nthe communication endpoints if we want to.\n\n204\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.100\nAnd even a particular type of traffic.\n\n205\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.530\nThough we can actually use\nthose filters to help us out.\n\n206\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.210\nWhereas this one, can it be done manually?\n\n207\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.380\nYes.\n\n208\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.040\nDo you have to know a lot to\nget it to do it manually?\n\n209\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.390\nYes.\n\n210\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.770\n&gt;&gt; But\nusing the graphical user interfaces,\n\n211\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.540\nit actually does help a little bit more\ninstead if you can actually use that and\n\n212\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.500\nbe able to filter out\nthe way that we want to.\n\n213\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.440\nOkay, so\nthose are kind of the key aspects.\n\n214\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.690\nAnd so here's a utility that\nnow has logs available.\n\n215\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.343\nSo before we even showed you the logs, we\nkind of showed you it's keeping track of\n\n216\n00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:41.344\nthings but\nyou kind of had to know what to do.\n\n217\n00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:43.906\nAnd now we're actually\ngiven the information and\n\n218\n00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:48.570\nwe still have to know how to look at it\nand examine it and do some analysis of it.\n\n219\n00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.270\nBut those aren't the only\nsystems that are out there.\n\n220\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.060\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n221\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.020\nthat is why we're now gonna talk\nabout moving to more advanced systems\n\n222\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.770\nthat have some feature that really helps\nus to pinpoint exactly what we need.\n\n223\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.600\nSo, I'm no longer searching for\nit anymore Zach.\n\n224\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.280\nNow what I can do is actually say,\nall right, we paid good money for\n\n225\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.450\nyou, show me what I need to see, and\nthen I can filter out what I need to.\n\n226\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.610\nAnd that is where we\nare starting the head as well.\n\n227\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.680\nBecause of the nature of\nnetworks today is so complex and\n\n228\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.230\nit requires so much more time and effort\nin terms of monitoring, there are systems\n\n229\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.860\nout there that are developed, that\nare made that really take into perspective\n\n230\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.340\nthe entire spectrum of different\ndevices that you have to monitor, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.754\nSo in a regular network, you might\nhave to monitor the router itself,\n\n232\n00:12:41.754 --> 00:12:43.960\nor the firewall that's out there, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.660\nYou might also have to monitor the amount\nof data going through a switch.\n\n234\n00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.590\nYou might also, of course, then have to\nmonitor every device that's connected\n\n235\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.890\ninside of your own network for intrusions,\n\n236\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.820\nas well as malware detection, as well\nas actually seeing what the threat is.\n\n237\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.570\nTrying to figure all that stuff out and\n\n238\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.540\ntrying to see if anything else\nis going onto your systems,\n\n239\n00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.060\nwell that's a lot of different ways\nthat you might have to examine the data.\n\n240\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.130\nIf you had to go to every\nsingle one of those devices and\n\n241\n00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.570\nfigure out how to get them all to work.\n\n242\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.780\nWell, the great thing is, Cisco and\nother companies do provide\n\n243\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.880\nutilities that help us to manage\nthis a little bit better, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.520\nAnd in the realm of Cisco, the big,\nparticular utility that we're\n\n245\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.210\nreally talking about here okay,\nis going to be what we call, well\n\n246\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:36.370\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Center, is\nwhat we're really talking about as well.\n\n247\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.057\nAnd so, that's the perspective we're\ngonna take a look at, we're gonna talk\n\n248\n00:13:40.057 --> 00:13:43.306\nabout some of the different\ntechnologies that it actually monitors,\n\n249\n00:13:43.306 --> 00:13:45.801\nas well as take a look at\nthe outputs that we see there.\n\n250\n00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:47.109\nSo let's go ahead and do that too.\n\n251\n00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:51.458\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie is FMC, is that a free\nutility or do you pay for that one too?\n\n252\n00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:52.501\n&gt;&gt; No, you'll pay for that one.\n\n253\n00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:53.103\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n254\n00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:57.109\non the idea of the Firepower Management\nCenter subscription that you'll end up\n\n255\n00:13:57.109 --> 00:13:59.977\npaying for and, of course,\neven the equipment itself,\n\n256\n00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:02.350\nit's gonna be relatively expensive.\n\n257\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.231\nBut is it worth every penny of it?\n\n258\n00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:07.283\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Probably, there's no doubt that if your\n\n259\n00:14:07.283 --> 00:14:11.162\nnetwork can do this,\nit is designed around that concept and\n\n260\n00:14:11.162 --> 00:14:14.970\nthat idea the true\nfundamental goal behind it.\n\n261\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.094\nIs to prevent the intrusions\nbefore it happens so\n\n262\n00:14:18.094 --> 00:14:21.020\nit relies on technologies that\nare based out on the Internet\n\n263\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.990\nto help provide the latest and\nmost up to date information it can.\n\n264\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.554\nIt helps you to mitigate those things,\nwhile things are going on.\n\n265\n00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:30.894\nSo it provides true\nintrusion protection or\n\n266\n00:14:30.894 --> 00:14:34.680\nintrusion prevention systems\nthat are out there, too, okay.\n\n267\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.970\nSo it really does provide even\nthat during the attack as well.\n\n268\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.780\nAnd then it also provides,\nwell, interfaces galore.\n\n269\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.690\nAnd the different ways that we can view\nstatistical data as well as the multitudes\n\n270\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.300\nof the data streams that are available\nout there to view the data that\n\n271\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.130\nwe actually need at whatever time that\nwe need, it can provide it all, okay.\n\n272\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.591\nThis system of course can grow, it doesn't\never get smaller, it's like a wedding,\n\n273\n00:14:59.591 --> 00:15:00.852\nit doesn't ever get smaller.\n\n274\n00:15:00.852 --> 00:15:03.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It always continues to grow, and\n\n275\n00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:06.499\nyou can add in more elements to\nmake this much more suitable,\n\n276\n00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:10.069\nand much more feature rich than\nkind of the basics there, okay.\n\n277\n00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:14.172\nBut you actually end up seeing that this\nwill actually provide the majority of some\n\n278\n00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:17.395\nof the utilities and tools that\nwe need to talk about too, okay.\n\n279\n00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:20.359\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee right here inside of\n\n280\n00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:25.663\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Center what\nwe're normally taking a look at a lot\n\n281\n00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:31.520\nof times when we start to talk about\nthe idea of intrusion event technologies.\n\n282\n00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.681\nAs we start and we take a look at a few\ndifferent things, and I'm gonna select\n\n283\n00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:39.404\nAnalysis up here, let me do this and\nsee if I can make this work here.\n\n284\n00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:45.650\nI want to, Full screen that.\n\n285\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.650\nThat's what I wanna do.\n\n286\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.128\nAnd that will kind of just\npull that bar away and\n\n287\n00:15:49.128 --> 00:15:52.340\ngive me a little bit more real\nestate that I can work with.\n\n288\n00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.343\nOf course then as I hover over it,\nit doesn't do that anymore.\n\n289\n00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:57.077\nSo I'm gonna select\nAnalysis at this point.\n\n290\n00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:59.492\nAnd now I can have the context to explore,\n\n291\n00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:02.320\nthis is kind of\nthe overview of everything.\n\n292\n00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.050\nSo let's start off here and then we'll\nmove to some of the individual components\n\n293\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.960\nand talk about what this does for\nus as well.\n\n294\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.520\nSo while the page is actually loading,\nwe'll see different perspectives of\n\n295\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.805\nthe way that the Cisco fire\npower management center tends\n\n296\n00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:22.040\nto monitor the information, and see the\ninformation that goes across the screen.\n\n297\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.050\nI'm gonna change\nthe perspective over here to one\n\n298\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.610\nday instead of the single hour that I had.\n\n299\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.150\nYou of course,\n\n300\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.250\ndepending on how much traffic you have,\none hour may be enough for you.\n\n301\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.250\nI'm just gonna change mine to one day\nto give us a little bit more data,\n\n302\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:39.060\nnot exactly a lot more data, but a little\nbit more to be able to go through.\n\n303\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.470\nSo while everything is loading up,\nthe nice view about this,\n\n304\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.810\nright, is that it gives us\na graphical view for the audience.\n\n305\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.160\nSo we're not taking a look\nat this to break it down and\n\n306\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.360\ndo some heavy analysis yet.\n\n307\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.500\nBut we're doing this and\nwe're taking a look at this view so\n\n308\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.470\nthat decisions can be made\nof what to do next, right?\n\n309\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.519\nSo using graphs and of course charts,\n\n310\n00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:08.155\nI can take a look at the traffic and\nintrusion events over time, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:10.885\nAnd we can see that over\nthis particular day here,\n\n312\n00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:14.010\nyou actually see the activity and\nthe period right here.\n\n313\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.300\nAnd that's because I generated\nan attack on these machines, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.320\nSo, and that was actually probably\nin the last three or four hours.\n\n315\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.750\nI also can see what's called\nan indication of compromise.\n\n316\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.420\nNow an indication of compromise is a\nintersection between two different things,\n\n317\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.309\nright, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:35.530\nIt's an indication of\nwhatever the intrusion is.\n\n319\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.720\nSo we can see the intrusion over here,\nokay?\n\n320\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.110\nThis one has an impact 2 intrusion.\n\n321\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.240\nHas a C and C is connected.\n\n322\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.440\nThis one also of course even\nhas some detection for malware.\n\n323\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.100\nI can hover.\n\n324\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.870\nWell, why won't it let me?\n\n325\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.330\nTrying to get out of that so\nI can stop hovering.\n\n326\n00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.240\nWell, you're kinda partially seeing it.\n\n327\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.400\nThere we go.\nI was gonna say, you're kind of seeing it.\n\n328\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.700\nNotice it also detected\nmalware that's available.\n\n329\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.640\nOn the right hand side, the host itself.\n\n330\n00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.520\nEven be able to spot out the IP\naddress that it occurred on.\n\n331\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.530\nAnd of course, even the machines\nthat are also contained here.\n\n332\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.090\nSo we are able to see individual host.\n\n333\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.500\nAs well as what could be\nhappening in terms of compromise.\n\n334\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.170\nThe other aspect of it of course\nis regular networking information,\n\n335\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.670\nwhat operating systems are running.\n\n336\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.710\nWhat is the traffic by source IP?\n\n337\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.590\nWho's actually taking up the most here\neven in examination like this one,\n\n338\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.095\nmay indicate if it´s actually\nway above everybody else.\n\n339\n00:18:37.095 --> 00:18:39.630\nSo that´s sending more traffic\nthan we need to, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.540\nAnd we might wonder why we´re sending so\n\n341\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.330\nmuch more traffic in terms of the number\nof connections than what people are doing.\n\n342\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.000\nRegular traffic by the source user,\nyou name it.\n\n343\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.220\nYou can continue to see all\nof this information and\n\n344\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.120\neven ingress security zones, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.090\nWhat particular zones actually\nwere crossed, SSL status,\n\n346\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.120\napplication protocol information.\n\n347\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.760\nAll of this actually does help us out\nto see what's running on our network.\n\n348\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.570\nAnd even the security\nintelligence category, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.247\nNow I wanna focus in on intelligence,\nsecurity intelligence here for a moment,\n\n350\n00:19:17.247 --> 00:19:21.049\nand the reason for it is most of us\nknow it by a different name okay?\n\n351\n00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:25.959\nAnd know it by its actually\nkinda more immature-y sibling\n\n352\n00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:30.090\nthat we have here that we call antivirus,\nokay?\n\n353\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.100\nNow, and the reason why I talked\nabout this is this way, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.530\nIs that the antivirus software that\nwe run on our individual computers,\n\n355\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.950\nthey're good, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.660\nThey do what they're designed to do, okay?\n\n357\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.000\nBut they're not exactly\ngood at actually doing\n\n358\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.910\neverything that we think\nthey're supposed to do, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.641\nInside of Cisco they have essentially\nchanged the idea of just antivirus, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:56.641 --> 00:20:00.298\nAnd they added in a lot more power\nto what they call Cisco AMP,\n\n361\n00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:04.963\nThe Cisco Advanced Malware Protection and\nthey even added in and they changed\n\n362\n00:20:04.963 --> 00:20:10.330\nthat inside of Cisco Firepower Management\nCenter to Security Intelligence.\n\n363\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.520\nNotice that we can look at it by\ncategory in the attack here, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.680\nIt actually shows me the CnC.\n\n365\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:24.370\nI can even see it by the actual source\nIP address according to what I see here.\n\n366\n00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.030\nAnd then,\nwhere it's actually destined as well.\n\n367\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:33.600\nSo we can even spot all that\ninformation just from that one event.\n\n368\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.270\nI've taken a look at some\nof the different ones.\n\n369\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.392\nSo if I select Connections\nup here at the top and I go,\n\n370\n00:20:40.392 --> 00:20:44.911\nI need to see the Security\nIntelligence Events or try to.\n\n371\n00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:50.930\nIt's just taking its sweet time,\nI guess is what's happening here.\n\n372\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.270\nBut I just have to give it a moment.\n\n373\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.945\nIt should actually drill down into\nsecurity intelligence, there it goes.\n\n374\n00:20:56.945 --> 00:21:02.127\nSee I just have to be patient and\nright now I don't have any,\n\n375\n00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:07.102\nnothing there, let me see if\nI can change that by clicking\n\n376\n00:21:07.102 --> 00:21:10.644\non this link here for a moment, come on.\n\n377\n00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:15.158\nAgain, patience when we're connected to\nCloud technologies is not my particular\n\n378\n00:21:15.158 --> 00:21:17.255\ncup of soup in terms of patience goes.\n\n379\n00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:19.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can kind of see here, and\n\n380\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.820\nit actually doesn't look like I have any,\nso I didn't actually have a big,\n\n381\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.210\ngigantic attack here.\n\n382\n00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.390\nBut you can see where we could find\nout more information even right here\n\n383\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.070\nin the security intelligence,\nif I had anything going on, okay?\n\n384\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.374\nSo, just something like that, that is\nessentially working in the same progress,\n\n385\n00:21:37.374 --> 00:21:41.314\nas the way that our antivirus\nsystems would be carrying out and\n\n386\n00:21:41.314 --> 00:21:42.925\nworking as well, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:47.110\nSo security intelligence,\nthis is a little bit more sophisticated.\n\n388\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.720\nMost of the time, the antivirus,\nif it catches anything,\n\n389\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.820\nit's because it matches up to a\ndestination based on the hash values that\n\n390\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:59.800\nit finds in whatever the attacking\nprogram is, or the attacking file is.\n\n391\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.356\nAnd then, it matches up and\nit sends it off to a quarantine.\n\n392\n00:22:02.356 --> 00:22:05.751\nThe security intelligence\nwill not only do that, okay?\n\n393\n00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:08.968\nWill not only mitigate and\ndo that, it will then rate it,\n\n394\n00:22:08.968 --> 00:22:12.810\nit will then actually say what\nthe disposition should be.\n\n395\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.230\nIt will then take that value and\n\n396\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.660\ncompare it against all of the security\nintelligence that's out there and\n\n397\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.880\navailable to Cisco,\nwhich is huge and gigantic, okay?\n\n398\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.000\nAnd it will also live time update and\ndo anything else that it needs to to\n\n399\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.390\nmake sure that we don't actually\nhave to worry about that again.\n\n400\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.430\nOnce it decides on a disposition and\nwhatever it needs to, it just says,\n\n401\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.060\nall right, I'll take care of it and\nwe don't have to worry about it again.\n\n402\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.683\nIt will simply log it here if it needs to.\n\n403\n00:22:38.683 --> 00:22:40.713\nAnd that way we can go back and\n\n404\n00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:44.526\nexamine the actual threat\nagain if we need to, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:49.390\nAll right, so that's a big part of what\nwe can also end up seeing if I had any\n\n406\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.522\nreal data going on here, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:51.522 --> 00:22:55.361\nThe next one,\nwe recently just did a show about this.\n\n408\n00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:58.414\nSo the reason why I don't\nactually have a live one,\n\n409\n00:22:58.414 --> 00:23:03.455\nis because this particular lab I've been\ntrying to generate information, it takes\n\n410\n00:23:03.455 --> 00:23:08.920\nabout 24 hours to generate that particular\ndata, just to make something show up.\n\n411\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.450\nSo the gracious and\n\n412\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.000\nthe great thing is, from that\nearlier show that Zach and I did.\n\n413\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I was able to take a screenshot\n\n414\n00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.750\nof something that you may end up seeing,\n\n415\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.315\nas far as what we call of\ncourse Netflow Data, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:27.640\nNetflow data really allows us to be\nable to establish the baselines of what\n\n417\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.975\nwe normally can see, as far as data\nflowing between two different source and\n\n418\n00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:37.000\ndestination addresses is\nwhat we end up seeing, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.690\nIt shows a session data and that's\nwhat we're also looking at right here.\n\n420\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.041\nThe ability to actually have that\nsession data and what is flowing.\n\n421\n00:23:45.041 --> 00:23:49.980\nFrom this, we can also generate\nstatistical data at different points\n\n422\n00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.679\nin the day or for our entire network\nto find out what we need, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:54.679 --> 00:24:00.160\nHigher traffic volume, from something\nlike what we see in CISCO's netflow here.\n\n424\n00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.490\nOkay, can normally be seen a lot of times,\nvery easily spotted.\n\n425\n00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.040\nBut it may indicate something, especially\nif we have the idea of higher business\n\n426\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.340\ntraffic or higher traffic than we think\nduring off hours of that business.\n\n427\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.140\nSo all the time when you\nsee something like that,\n\n428\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.950\nit again is actually an indication\naway from the normal.\n\n429\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.490\n&gt;&gt; And so, Ronnie, this net flow,\nthis is out of Stealth Watch or\n\n430\n00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.700\nwe're not looking at Stealth Watch yet?\n\n431\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.680\n&gt;&gt; Yep, no, this is actually the same\nthat comes out of Stealth Watch.\n\n432\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.668\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; For us because\n\n433\n00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:31.042\nStealth Watch is designed to be\nable to handle the net flow data.\n\n434\n00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:31.858\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n435\n00:24:31.858 --> 00:24:34.070\nit's designed to handle all\nversions of the net flow data.\n\n436\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:39.210\nThis is just an example, I think of\nversion five info, is what we see here.\n\n437\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.420\nSo this is the one we took\nright out of the show.\n\n438\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Right out of the show.\n\n439\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.290\n&gt;&gt; And I said this is what we\nreally need to focus in on as well.\n\n440\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.250\nNow, you can take this and then pivot it,\n\n441\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.150\nonce again into some type\nof statistical shot where\n\n442\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.640\nyou can compare it against other flows of\ndata that you have around you, too, okay?\n\n443\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.730\nBut something like this can even show us,\n\n444\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.840\nespecially if we start monitoring\noff-hours, like we said.\n\n445\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.330\nAnd then all of a sudden we spot why\nare we transferring a ton more data during\n\n446\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.400\noff business hours than we\nare during business hours?\n\n447\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.930\nIt again may indicate an intrusion of\nsome sort in that way as well, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.340\nSo, in taking a look at this\nparticular bit of information, right?\n\n449\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.090\nAnd talking about the ideas of something,\nthe logs that we've been talking about and\n\n450\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.340\nthe proxy servers.\n\n451\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.480\nAnd now even the anti-virus loaded,\nwe didn't spend a lot of time there,\n\n452\n00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.330\nbut you kind of get the idea on that one.\n\n453\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.900\nBut, this NetFlow data,\n\n454\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.470\nthis is something that you should be\nmaking sure that you take a look at.\n\n455\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.940\nNow, if you go, all right so\nlet me copy that down,\n\n456\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.920\ndon't worry about copying down,\ndo a screenshot if you need to.\n\n457\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.670\nBut you can actually find this\ntype of data, once again,\n\n458\n00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.950\nall over the Internet if you\ndo a screenshot capture.\n\n459\n00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.350\nJust type in netflow v5 data, and\n\n460\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.400\nyou'll actually [INAUDIBLE],\nyou just put that up for us.\n\n461\n00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.382\nSo you can do a nice wide screenshot.\n\n462\n00:25:55.382 --> 00:25:58.928\nSo that you can examine the actual\ndata that's coming across something\n\n463\n00:25:58.928 --> 00:25:59.704\nlike this too.\n\n464\n00:25:59.704 --> 00:26:03.863\nSo don't [INAUDIBLE] and\ngo I don't have access to Stealth Watch,\n\n465\n00:26:03.863 --> 00:26:06.950\nnot a lot of us do unless we work for\nbig company.\n\n466\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.610\nOr we actually do have the entire\nCisco Fire Power Management Suite\n\n467\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.770\nalong with Stealth Watch implemented.\n\n468\n00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.540\nBut you can kind of see where\nall this can come together and\n\n469\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.745\nactually provide a lot more details, okay?\n\n470\n00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:19.831\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n471\n00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Now, Zach, as we continue to actually\nsee just a few more technologies, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.170\nWe still need to look at\na lot of different events.\n\n473\n00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:34.090\nBut at this point here, we probably need\nto go into a part three because I realize\n\n474\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.880\nI only have just a few minutes left and\nwe can't do justice\n\n475\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.810\nto our next one on IDS's and\nIPS's if we don't do that.\n\n476\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.625\nSo let's go into a part three on this.\n\n477\n00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:46.165\n&gt;&gt; And that's perfectly fine because\nRonny, you are taking us through this\n\n478\n00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:49.025\nstep by step and I rather,\nwe do this then anything else.\n\n479\n00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:50.245\nYou did a marvelous job.\n\n480\n00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:53.175\nIntrusion of event technologies part two,\nthere will be a part three.\n\n481\n00:26:53.175 --> 00:26:57.185\nMake sure you see part one, and\nbefore we move on, Ronny, any last words.\n\n482\n00:26:57.185 --> 00:27:00.875\n&gt;&gt; Nope, just make sure you take\nadvantage of what we have access to,\n\n483\n00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:03.992\nright, if you go I'm not\ngonna be able to do this.\n\n484\n00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:08.550\nUse screenshots right now, especially\nin preparing for the exam, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:14.860\nDo not handicap yourself to just going,\nI'm just not gonna worry about it.\n\n486\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.650\nYou're gonna see this more often than\nyou think and inside of your workplace,\n\n487\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.360\nyou should be familiar with it.\n\n488\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.280\nBefore you become that analyst inside\nthat security operation center and\n\n489\n00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.020\nunderstand what data you're\nactually looking up to.\n\n490\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.840\nSo take your time,\nmake sure you get this down,\n\n491\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.430\nit's gonna count pretty\ngood on the exam for you.\n\n492\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.920\nSo don't overlook it.\n\n493\n00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Good advice as always, Ronnie.\n\n494\n00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.760\nAnd go to our course library, and\n\n495\n00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.090\nyou can check out every single episode\nof Cisco SECOPS in that series.\n\n496\n00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.540\nAnd when you're there,\n\n497\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.640\ntake a look at all the hundreds of videos\nthat are available to help you go further.\n\n498\n00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.910\nAnd tell all your friends about ITProTV.\n\n499\n00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.390\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n500\n00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.830\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n501\n00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.566\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n502\n00:27:53.566 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:07.425\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:08.467\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.024\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:13.599\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.220\nchoosing ITProTV helping you\nlearn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco SecOps,\n\n9\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.580\nas also continue on with intrusion\nevent technologies part three.\n\n10\n00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.040\nMake sure you see part one and\npart two, but this is part three.\n\n11\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.890\nAnd Ronnie Wong has decided to\ncome on back here and help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.400\nThanks for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show, Zach,\n\n14\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560\nas we continue to take a look\nat some of these different\n\n15\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.430\ntechnologies that help us\nto spot the intrusions.\n\n16\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.977\nThe great thing is we've already to talk\nabout some of them in depth a bit in\n\n17\n00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.330\nearlier episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.360\nNow we're just going back and we're\ntaking a look as a reminder of what else\n\n19\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.750\nwe can see here and some of the different\ntechnologies that are available.\n\n20\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.780\nAnd we're back into\nCisco's Firepower Management Center\n\n21\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780\nto take a look at the utilities that\nit really does gather together for us.\n\n22\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890\nCisco Firepower Management Center and\nFirePOWER is a neat technology, but\n\n23\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.400\nit also is kind of a hubbed\ntechnology as well.\n\n24\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.294\nIn which, multiple different\ntechnologies can communicate and\n\n25\n00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:12.930\nthey can be used together.\n\n26\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.852\nAnd then, of course, it means we can\nalso get information out of them that\n\n27\n00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:20.333\ncorrelate, that allow us to\nactually see that information, but\n\n28\n00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.120\nfrom one particular location and place.\n\n29\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.680\nSo that is what we're also doing as well.\n\n30\n00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.030\nSo previously, in another episode, we did\ntalk about NetFlow a little bit earlier,\n\n31\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.230\nand we even have an entire episode, or\nactually two or three episodes on NetFlow.\n\n32\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.310\nMake sure you check that out as well.\n\n33\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.770\nAnd then now, we're actually going in and\nwe're taking a look at well a couple\n\n34\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.065\nother technologies that\nare available right here.\n\n35\n00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:46.830\nBut take some time, take a look at it and\nthat's what we are going to do.\n\n36\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.040\nSo we wanna move into the room\nof firewalls here and\n\n37\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.840\ntalk about the idea of firewalls.\n\n38\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.630\nFirewalls are kind of\nunusual technology in\n\n39\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.900\nthe very fact that we don't tend to\nreplace them as often as we think, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.510\nSo they tend to work like routers and\nswitches.\n\n41\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.140\nThey are in place, they tend to\nwork insanely efficiently well, and\n\n42\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.260\nin that sense, they're very durable.\n\n43\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.838\nThey don't tend to be\nthe first thing that, ooh,\n\n44\n00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:14.520\nwe've got to replace that technology.\n\n45\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.450\nWe're not always working\nwith the latest and\n\n46\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.860\ngreatest equipment in terms of firewalls.\n\n47\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.670\nWe're working with what is standard and\nwhat is true and\n\n48\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.410\nwhat we actually feel like we're\ncomfortable with a lot of the times.\n\n49\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.840\nAnd that's where we come in, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.010\nWell, in Cisco's world, the firewalls\nthat they had at the beginning,\n\n51\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810\nthey bought a company called Pix and\nPix turned into the Cisco ASA.\n\n52\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.280\nAnd now the Cisco ASA is beginning kind of\nits journey into the kind of background.\n\n53\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.640\nAnd that's because, well now you have\nwhat we call Cisco's ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n54\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.800\nAnd that is FirePOWER is in\nitself is a threat containment or\n\n55\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.300\na threat management system that includes\nin all these other advanced security tools\n\n56\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.510\nand not just the ability\nto do what a firewall does.\n\n57\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.780\nSo in today's firewalls, you may hear\nthe term next generation firewall.\n\n58\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.535\nThat's because it really is combining\nin elements of an intrusion prevention\n\n59\n00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:16.074\nsystem, intrusion detection system,\nas well as the firewall capacities\n\n60\n00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:20.467\nthat are there to help us to be able to\nstop as much of the intrusion as we can\n\n61\n00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.089\nright at the perimeter of our network and\neven before that.\n\n62\n00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.883\nAnd we're also using\nthe thread intelligence and\n\n63\n00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:29.410\nwe're learning from the information that\nwe have out there on the Internet too.\n\n64\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.290\nSo this is why it's important\nthat we understand this.\n\n65\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.350\nA lot of this is also going\nto be managed through\n\n66\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.100\nCisco Firepower Management Console.\n\n67\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.665\nSo let's take a look here at what\nwe can normally end up seeing.\n\n68\n00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.545\nSo I pulled up the Connections and\nthe Events here as well and\n\n69\n00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:47.450\nyou can actually see it\nin two different ways.\n\n70\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.960\nThe security intelligence events\nas well as the events here.\n\n71\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.540\nSecurity intelligence also\ndeals with the idea of\n\n72\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.570\nunderstanding more about\nthe malware that's out there.\n\n73\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.320\nSo that's a part of it.\n\n74\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.170\nBut the events, this is where you start\nseeing more of actions and reasons, and\n\n75\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.780\nwhat type of data was actually\nallowed through here.\n\n76\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.770\nAnd that's what we're seeing.\n\n77\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270\nThese are actual events that we're, oops,\nI kinda went too far and too fast and\n\n78\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.500\nkinda zoomed out of the scope there.\n\n79\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.275\nBut you're actually seeing all this.\n\n80\n00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:19.321\nAnd you can see that there's actually,\nwell,\n\n81\n00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:24.900\n7,516 different rows of data and\nthis is just the firewall.\n\n82\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.186\nIt's actually seeing every single one\nof these pieces of traffic here and\n\n83\n00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.968\nmaking a decision on whether to allow it\nor to deny the traffic from going through.\n\n84\n00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:37.060\nAnd that's pretty much\na firewall's perspective.\n\n85\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.978\nYou add Cisco's FirePOWER into this,\nit now examines the data that's in it.\n\n86\n00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:44.261\nIt now examines files\nthat are coming across.\n\n87\n00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.525\nAnd now, it actually takes a look\nat all that information and\n\n88\n00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:51.980\ntries to actually mitigate it if it's\nactually in action at that point.\n\n89\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.900\nSo you can start to see this,\nand you also, of course,\n\n90\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.800\nif you had the old console.\n\n91\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.640\nNow I don't have a connection to the old,\nold console any more.\n\n92\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.590\nThey've actually\ndisconnected it from here.\n\n93\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.048\nLet me see if I can get to this thing,\nfor a moment.\n\n94\n00:05:08.048 --> 00:05:12.620\nBut we all use to run\nthis guy which is called\n\n95\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.500\nthe Cisco ASDM to get us\naccess into our Cisco ASAs.\n\n96\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.830\nThis would launch a Java utility\nthat would give you the interface\n\n97\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.000\nto configure your firewall to make it do\nwhat you actually want it to do here.\n\n98\n00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.740\nIt actually did give you a little bit\nof information to be able to do that.\n\n99\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.990\nToday, because it's actually bound up\ninto the Firepower Management Center,\n\n100\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.460\nI just access it through a web browser and\n\n101\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.390\nit makes the connection then and now we\nhave a lot more detailed information.\n\n102\n00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.140\nIf I scroll across, notice that there's\nactually even more information and\n\n103\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.370\nthat is how much more data\nthat Cisco Firepower,\n\n104\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.350\nas well as all of the other elements,\nhave in place for this\n\n105\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.390\nidea of what the actual firewall can\ndo as an intrusion prevention device.\n\n106\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.690\nSo not only are we looking\nat the firewall itself,\n\n107\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.560\nwe're also looking at the idea of\nthe intrusion prevention device.\n\n108\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.360\nSo firewalls then do help us to\nspot the session data as well.\n\n109\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.270\nNetwork address translation\ndata if we need to.\n\n110\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.730\nWe can even take a look at capture files.\n\n111\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.410\nThere's a lot of times where if you go I\nneed to look at this in something like I\n\n112\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.650\ncan run Wireshark instead,\nyou can even create pcat files out of what\n\n113\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.460\nyou end up seeing here, and then you\ncan go into Wireshark and see this too.\n\n114\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.990\nAnd then it also is partly the idea of\nusing the intrusion prevention system\n\n115\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.650\nas well, which normally is based\non the same things, rules and\n\n116\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.180\nalerts to help us to spot what's going on,\ntoo.\n\n117\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.840\n&gt;&gt; And, Ronnie, this will help you if\nyou have even more than one firewall?\n\n118\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt, it just\ndepends on how they're actually set up.\n\n119\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.630\nBut normally, there's a reason for\n\n120\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.780\nyou setting up multiple\nfirewalls into your network.\n\n121\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.835\nAnd so, if there is,\nthen yes, it can do it.\n\n122\n00:07:07.835 --> 00:07:12.180\nCisco's Firepower Management Center\ncan do multiple firewalls as well.\n\n123\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.810\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n124\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.740\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's great in terms of how we can do this.\n\n125\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.430\nIs it expensive?\n\n126\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.720\nYes, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.420\n&gt;&gt; You said that multiple times.\n\n128\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not a cheap\nutility that's out there,\n\n129\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.090\nbut it is one if your network can\nafford it and invest into it.\n\n130\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.310\nIt also means that you might take some\ntime to actually invest into the training\n\n131\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.250\non something like Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n132\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.880\nAnd right here at ITProTV, we not\nonly have somebody that actually says\n\n133\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.320\nI know FirePOWER, we actually had\nTodd Lammle who's a world famous\n\n134\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.920\nCisco FirePOWER instructor\nthat does this stuff.\n\n135\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.775\nAnd he came in and he did a show for\nus on just learning about Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n136\n00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:50.680\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's in the course library isn't it?\n\n137\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.637\n&gt;&gt; That is in our course library.\n\n138\n00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.220\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n139\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.000\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you check out those\nparticular episode episodes too.\n\n140\n00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.860\nAnd that will help you out as well.\n\n141\n00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.680\nSo it's a combination here is\nwhat we're taking a look at.\n\n142\n00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.790\nSo it's more than just a regular firewall\nthat we would just see certain events.\n\n143\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.180\nNow this idea of actually being that, it\nis kind of a combination of a firewall and\n\n144\n00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.330\nan intrusion prevention system as well.\n\n145\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n146\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Along with this\nparticular technology then,\n\n147\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.420\nit also then has to include\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n148\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.492\nSo not only do we talk about the idea\nof intrusion prevention, but\n\n149\n00:08:23.492 --> 00:08:27.573\nwe did kind of an entire show on\nalso intrusion detection as well.\n\n150\n00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:31.120\nBut we took a look at something,\nthis is not the right one, there it is,\n\n151\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.860\nsecurity is, I'm like why does that\nnot look like the security and login?\n\n152\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.020\nAnd this particular product\nhere is called Squeal.\n\n153\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.140\nSqueal is a nice intrusion detection\nsystem, which shows us the information\n\n154\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.910\nthat we really are looking for\nwhen we start making connections.\n\n155\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.600\nSo here's an example, we'll see,\nit won't let me select both of these here.\n\n156\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.872\nBut let me zoom in on those two rows,\nif I can.\n\n157\n00:08:56.872 --> 00:08:59.310\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, Squeal is something\nthat you don't have to pay for.\n\n158\n00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.580\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to pay for it.\n\n159\n00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:08.710\nIt is actually freely available to you as\nan actual distribution on Security Onion.\n\n160\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.324\nSo you can actually take a look at\nSecurity Onion, follow their instructions.\n\n161\n00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:17.172\nIf you are gonna download this and put it\ninto a virtual machine like I am using, or\n\n162\n00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:20.340\nmake sure you actually,\nif you're gonna load it onto a computer,\n\n163\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.970\nfollow those instructions as well and\npay attention.\n\n164\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.292\nRemember that what we are looking for\nhere is the 5-tuple information,\n\n165\n00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:30.922\nand we can see this is actually\na pretty good example.\n\n166\n00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:35.620\nAs you start noticing the same port\nnumbers, and the same destination and\n\n167\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.140\nport IP addresses, as well.\n\n168\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.610\nAnd then even the protocol.\n\n169\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.438\nThis is protocol 6.\n\n170\n00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:45.330\nThat particular type of information\nallows us to know that this is a single\n\n171\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.100\nparticular attack that we have.\n\n172\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.640\nAnd this is an intrusion\nthat was detected here.\n\n173\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.100\nAnd it actually allows us then to\ncoordinate this with other types of\n\n174\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:01.220\nsecurity monitoring systems that are also\nout there and available with us as well.\n\n175\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.550\nSo being able to take a look\nat this data is also key in\n\n176\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.090\nunderstanding what your normally looking\nfor and just about everything, right?\n\n177\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.880\nWe've kind of emphasized IP\n5-tuple information pretty\n\n178\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.730\nmuch throughout just about every other\nshow, if not every show that I've done, or\n\n179\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.740\nevery episode that I've done for\nthis particular series.\n\n180\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.440\nAnd that's because it is key to being able\nto spot a lot of these different things\n\n181\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.460\nwhen you start seeing\nunchanging information.\n\n182\n00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.750\nIt normally is a sign that somebody\nhas actually manually manipulated\n\n183\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.350\nsomething too.\n\n184\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.800\nSo those are kinda the big technologies\n\n185\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.840\nas far as the intrusion\ndetection technologies.\n\n186\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.540\nThere's only one more that\nwe're going to mention here.\n\n187\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.670\nAnd we're just going to mention it,\n\n188\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.800\nwhich is the idea of what we call\nnetwork application control.\n\n189\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.530\nAnd sometimes, you also hear the idea of\nnetwork access control, or identity and\n\n190\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.970\naccess management.\n\n191\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.570\nSo both of those terms kind of come\nin when you start to hear that.\n\n192\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.170\nSo it depends on the way that\nis actually interpreted.\n\n193\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.430\nNetwork application control is\nessentially preventing, applications\n\n194\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.050\nthat you don't want to be on your network\nto actually not be on your network.\n\n195\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.827\nAnd at that point it goes back to the kind\nof fundamental rule that we've been\n\n196\n00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:19.662\ntalking about.\n\n197\n00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:23.547\nSo I don't have a network application\ncontrol technology to show you, but\n\n198\n00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:26.470\nthey are out there, and\nthey are available.\n\n199\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.110\nBut take a look, look for\nthose screenshots if you need to.\n\n200\n00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.970\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwould Cisco ISE be on the exam?\n\n201\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Cisco ISE is actually the other\npart that we're about to talk about.\n\n202\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.009\nSo yeah, this why I said\nthere's kind of two different-\n\n203\n00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:40.010\n&gt;&gt; I just jumped the gun.\n\n204\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.203\nAnd that's because this is\nnormally abbreviated as NAC, and\n\n205\n00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.790\nnetwork application control is one.\n\n206\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.296\nAnd it was just me not filling\nout the rest of my notes here and\n\n207\n00:11:50.296 --> 00:11:52.773\nthat is why Zach is asking about ISE here.\n\n208\n00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:57.890\nNetwork application control is like\nwhat I've just spoken about here.\n\n209\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.300\nThe very fact that you have application,\nand\n\n210\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.312\nthere's certain applications that\nyou don't want on your note.\n\n211\n00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:08.290\nFor example, we all know something,\nthat today, running Adobe Flash,\n\n212\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:15.120\nas great as a display that it gives you,\nit is a completely vulnerable application.\n\n213\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.290\nRunning anything with\nJava in the background,\n\n214\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.910\nit is a completely vulnerable application.\n\n215\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.590\nYou can update it all that you want, but\n\n216\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.570\nsomebody is still running some older\nversion of Java in which is vulnerability.\n\n217\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.580\nThey update it constantly,\nthat's because they keep finding more and\n\n218\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.580\nmore vulnerabilities out there for it.\n\n219\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.550\nSame thing with Flash,\nit's just completely vulnerable.\n\n220\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.850\nSo it might be where you go, look, I need\nto prevent people from downloading this\n\n221\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.980\nstuff In to our network,\ncuz it's just finding it's way there.\n\n222\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.340\nWell, network application\ncontrol says let's not do that.\n\n223\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.770\nThen there's the other side of this.\n\n224\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.890\nYou also see that the term NAC as\nbeing network access control, as well.\n\n225\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.798\nAccess control has to do\nwith identity management,\n\n226\n00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:57.914\nwhich is where Zach is coming\nin with the Cisco ISE here.\n\n227\n00:12:57.914 --> 00:13:03.427\nAnd you actually might see something\nlike this as well when you do this.\n\n228\n00:13:03.427 --> 00:13:05.092\nSo when we take the look here on,\n\n229\n00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:08.920\nI'm trying to make sure I can\nfind what I'm looking for.\n\n230\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.390\nOops, so here on my screen,\nif I select Users.\n\n231\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.022\nLet's see if I can do this.\n\n232\n00:13:17.022 --> 00:13:19.220\nAll this falls underneath that system and\n\n233\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.520\nin the background is an engine that\nactually helping us manage identity.\n\n234\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.823\nAnd this one is what it is about here.\n\n235\n00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:30.037\nSo instead of the idea of applications,\n\n236\n00:13:30.037 --> 00:13:33.541\nthis is all about access and\nwho can do what.\n\n237\n00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:37.462\nSo if I go to Users, this is part of\nwhere it's actually pulling from,\n\n238\n00:13:37.462 --> 00:13:39.570\nwhat Zach was talking about.\n\n239\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.710\nIn the Integrated Services Engine\nthat's actually their\n\n240\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.130\nIdentity Services Engine that's there.\n\n241\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.840\nAnd it pulls all that\ninformation together,\n\n242\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.600\nwhich then can pull it in from\nyour Active Directory network and\n\n243\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.210\nother directory services that\nare out there and available too.\n\n244\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.550\nSo all of this information\nis available and\n\n245\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:03.050\nwhat we're hoping to spot is when we start\nseeing names that we don't understand.\n\n246\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:08.194\nSo let's take, for instance here,\nas I start to take a look at this,\n\n247\n00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:13.106\nthere's no doubt that somebody's\nfirst name could be mordiac.\n\n248\n00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:15.894\nSo let's just-\n&gt;&gt; That used to be my name,\n\n249\n00:14:15.894 --> 00:14:16.684\nI changed it to Zach.\n\n250\n00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:19.110\n&gt;&gt; So let's just say something like that.\n\n251\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.734\nSo that might be first initial, last name.\n\n252\n00:14:22.734 --> 00:14:25.256\nBut this one though s scratchy.\n\n253\n00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:27.510\nProbably not so much.\n\n254\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.555\n&gt;&gt; That was my uncle.\n\n255\n00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:31.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there you go so or\n\n256\n00:14:31.316 --> 00:14:33.826\nyou know the pun on it scratchy.\n\n257\n00:14:33.826 --> 00:14:35.075\n&gt;&gt; Right that I got.\n\n258\n00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:38.512\n&gt;&gt; I mean you know very, very much\nprobably not exactly what we would think\n\n259\n00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:41.180\nas being someone's first\ninitial last name.\n\n260\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.260\nSo in that sense,\n\n261\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.410\nit might indicate there's some particular\ncompromise might have happened.\n\n262\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.230\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans.\n\n263\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.038\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it always has,\nso don't get me wrong,\n\n264\n00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:53.858\nthis might be a totally legitimate\naccount inside this lab.\n\n265\n00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:56.014\nBut, if I were looking at it and\nI would be going,\n\n266\n00:14:56.014 --> 00:14:59.080\nwho would actually make\ntheir username scratchy?\n\n267\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.703\nExcept for the guy really named scratchy.\n\n268\n00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:01.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or itchy,\n\n269\n00:15:01.332 --> 00:15:02.430\nwhose just trying to get back at scratchy.\n\n270\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or itchy.\n\n271\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.290\nBut you kind of get that idea.\n\n272\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.910\nMost of us don't use nicknames\nas far are username goes.\n\n273\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.787\nI am not saying it can't happen,\nbut if your nickname is Scratchy,\n\n274\n00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:13.267\nyou're probably dealing with\nmore than just intrusion.\n\n275\n00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:17.410\nSo just kind of realize that\nsomething else might be happening.\n\n276\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.540\n&gt;&gt; And we need some talcum.\n\n277\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.578\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, this is where the Cisco ISE\nmight come into play as well.\n\n278\n00:15:24.578 --> 00:15:26.550\nBut notice that everything\ncan be managed and\n\n279\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.320\nseen pretty much through\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Center, so\n\n280\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.940\nthere are a lot of things\nthat are available to you.\n\n281\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.361\nTake a look at screenshots, if you go I\ndon't have access to Cisco Firepower,\n\n282\n00:15:39.361 --> 00:15:43.482\nunderstand it is an expensive device,\nit is expensive equipment to run.\n\n283\n00:15:43.482 --> 00:15:46.965\nAnd even if you do get it, you don't\ntend to have any data on it right away.\n\n284\n00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:50.473\nSo if you don't have that then\ntrying to set all that data up and\n\n285\n00:15:50.473 --> 00:15:54.861\nget it all to work together, it still\ntakes a bit more time than just going I'm\n\n286\n00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.851\njust going to turn it on and run it.\n\n287\n00:15:56.851 --> 00:15:58.789\nIf there's nothing there,\nthere's nothing there.\n\n288\n00:15:58.789 --> 00:16:03.347\nSo in the lab environment,unless you\nreally have actually manipulated it and\n\n289\n00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:08.042\nset up a network that has some particular\ncompromises going on that you can test it\n\n290\n00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:10.405\nout, it doesn't really show you a lot.\n\n291\n00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:12.720\nSo you do actually have to\nhave some things set up.\n\n292\n00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.730\nBut take a look at screenshots\nfrom around the Internet, and\n\n293\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.720\nthat will probably help you out\nas well being able to identify\n\n294\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.704\nthis technology as well as\nthe events that you're seeing.\n\n295\n00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:24.420\nAnd that's the goal of this\nparticular exam objective.\n\n296\n00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.139\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic show.\n\n297\n00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:29.300\nIntrusion Event Technologies,\nParts 1, 2 and 3.\n\n298\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.830\nGreat information, revisit all of them.\n\n299\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.400\nTake a look at those screen shots cuz\nthat'll be helpful for you on that exam.\n\n300\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.570\nAnd before we move on\nRonnie any last words?\n\n301\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.790\n&gt;&gt; Well no, this is the point in which\nit really does take time and patience.\n\n302\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.340\nMost of us don't like going I'm\njust looking at a static image.\n\n303\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.320\nBut observing it and going okay that came\nfrom Cisco Firepower Management Center.\n\n304\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.650\nUnderstanding that identity and\n\n305\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.200\nthat process of matching\nthat up is gonna be key.\n\n306\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.570\nUnderstanding what types of data\nthat you normally see from this\n\n307\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.000\nequipment is also gonna be key as well.\n\n308\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.998\nSo for example, if you think\nabout the idea of session data.\n\n309\n00:17:06.998 --> 00:17:12.703\nWell, if all of sudden that's what your\nlooking for and your supervisor says,\n\n310\n00:17:12.703 --> 00:17:17.046\nwe need to spot all the session\ndata between this equipment,\n\n311\n00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:19.446\nbetween this user and this user.\n\n312\n00:17:19.446 --> 00:17:22.812\nYou need to know what particular equipment\nbrings something like that up, and\n\n313\n00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:24.510\ncan you actually spot it.\n\n314\n00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.250\nSo do a little bit more research,\nmake sure you do pay attention to not\n\n315\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.400\nonly what we've been talking\nabout here in the show,\n\n316\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.960\nbut you have to dive\na bit deeper into this.\n\n317\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.710\nThis is more of an introduction into all\nof these different technologies, because\n\n318\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.340\nif not, I could probably go another\n40 episodes on just this equipment,\n\n319\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.800\nand I don't wanna do that.\n\n320\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.120\nSo we're not gonna take\nthat time to do that,\n\n321\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.430\nbut just realize that cuz there's\na lot more for us to go on this exam.\n\n322\n00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.450\nBut pay attention to that stuff, and\nthat will help you get through and\n\n323\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.620\nat least get a good start on preparing for\nthe exam.\n\n324\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Once again, great job, and\nthank you for the advice, Ronnie.\n\n325\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.152\nAnd make sure you visit\nour course library so\n\n326\n00:18:01.152 --> 00:18:04.006\nyou can see all the episodes\nin the Cisco SecOps series.\n\n327\n00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.020\nAnd look at all the hundreds\nof other videos there.\n\n328\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.600\nThey are all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n329\n00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.156\nAnd don't forget to tell your friends\nabout ITProTV, they'll thank you for it.\n\n330\n00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:13.832\nI'm Zach Memos,\n&gt;&gt; I'm

SecOps.\n\n8\n00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:25.590\nAnd in this episode,\nintrusion impact analysis.\n\n9\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.650\nAnd once again,\n\n10\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.891\nRonnie Wong is joining us because he has\nprepared this incredible lecture for us.\n\n11\n00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n12\n00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:34.574\nall the information we need\nis right there, right there.\n\n13\n00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:35.522\nHe's got it.\n\n14\n00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:39.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Zach, well thank\nyou again for helping us and for\n\n15\n00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:43.809\nallowing me to come back on this show\nas we take a look at the idea here of\n\n16\n00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.664\nintrusion impact analysis.\n\n17\n00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.893\nNow, if you've been watching the show\nalong the way the you've been\n\n18\n00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:49.623\nrecording it.\n\n19\n00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:53.018\nWe spent a lot of time taking\na look at intrusion analysis\n\n20\n00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:57.729\nespecially diving into the headers,\ndiving into all of the little details.\n\n21\n00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.917\nAnd just try to point out some of the\npalaces that an analyst needs to be able\n\n22\n00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:04.970\nto look and be able to find\nwhere the attacks can go on.\n\n23\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.288\nIt doesn't mean that you have to\nknow every single one of them, but\n\n24\n00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:11.965\nit does at least point you in the right\ndirection when we start to talk about\n\n25\n00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:13.533\nintrusions end up happening.\n\n26\n00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:18.784\nToday though, Zach, we're actually\ntalking about something just a slight\n\n27\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:23.974\ndifferent path here when we now go into\nthe idea of the impact of intrusions.\n\n28\n00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:28.311\nSo Zach, we have to actually think\nabout this idea a little bit more.\n\n29\n00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.914\nWe understand that intrusions happen,\nokay?\n\n30\n00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.770\nBut we also have to understand whether or\n\n31\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.736\nnot that intrusion really is something\nthat ends up happening too us.\n\n32\n00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.589\nIs it something that's damaging or\n\n33\n00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:44.940\nnot and that's actually gonna be\ninteresting as we get into it.\n\n34\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.872\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna be looking at what\nfalse positives are too right, Ronnie?\n\n35\n00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:50.350\nWe're gonna be looking at a couple\nof different things here and\n\n36\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.577\nthis is what I want to get into.\n\n37\n00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:52.324\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n38\n00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:55.077\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWhen it comes down to network security\n\n39\n00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:59.905\nmonitoring, the overall scope pretty much\nof what we tend to do as the analysts\n\n40\n00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.333\nworking security operations center.\n\n41\n00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.134\nThere's gonna be a couple of different\nphilosophies we're gonna run into\n\n42\n00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:06.806\nright away.\n\n43\n00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:09.659\nAnd one is not more right than the other.\n\n44\n00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.170\nIt's more of a preference\nthan anything else, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.850\nSo depending on where you get\nyour start in the IT world,\n\n46\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.097\nsecurity in the sense if you started\noff on the path to security.\n\n47\n00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:25.004\nYour goal is relatively simple, that's\nwhere your foundations came in which is to\n\n48\n00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:29.647\nessentially set up a structure that's\nnot gonna be penetrated at all, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:34.776\nIn doing something like that we try and\nmake sure that we follow under compliance.\n\n50\n00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:36.061\nWe do best practices.\n\n51\n00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.543\nWe harden our machines.\n\n52\n00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:39.563\nWe harden everything on our network.\n\n53\n00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:42.531\nWe then make sure that we put\nsecurity devices in place.\n\n54\n00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:46.023\nWe've talked about this in the security\nfundamentals in terms of defense\n\n55\n00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:46.878\nin depth, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:49.667\nSo actually, Zack, I think that's one\nof the very first shows that you and\n\n57\n00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.297\nI did together.\n\n58\n00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:52.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Was taking a look at that idea of\n\n59\n00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:53.275\ndefense in depth.\n\n60\n00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:54.233\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n61\n00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:56.875\n&gt;&gt; And so,\nwhen we actually talk about something like\n\n62\n00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.589\nthat\n&gt;&gt; That's normally our posture if we're\n\n63\n00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.833\nnow coming into an analysis phase.\n\n64\n00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:05.418\nAnd what we don't understand the idea\nof actually tracking a lot of different\n\n65\n00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.861\nthings, especially impact.\n\n66\n00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.153\nBecause our goal and our desire right,\n\n67\n00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:12.706\nis to never have any impact at\nall from any intrusion, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:17.614\nBut the reality is something that even\nCisco's kind of prime person said in terms\n\n69\n00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.489\nof security.\n\n70\n00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.970\nExcept there's really two types\nof companies in the world Zach.\n\n71\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.670\nThere are those that have been hacked and\n\n72\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.934\nthey are those who don't\nknow they've been hacked.\n\n73\n00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:27.458\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n74\n00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:31.527\nin other words an intrusion probably has\nhappened on the system at some point and\n\n75\n00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:35.432\ntime and you've actually got two\ndifferent perspectives that we can take.\n\n76\n00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:40.319\nZach, the one is actually his particular\nstatement is probably the reality.\n\n77\n00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.854\nThe actual one that we\ndon't want to take is go\n\n78\n00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:48.519\nthere's no way that an attack\ncould have happened, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.277\nWell, if you're looking at it from\nthat particular standpoint saying,\n\n80\n00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:54.219\nno I know the security I have in place,\nthere's no way an attack could happen.\n\n81\n00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.164\nYou're gonna be blindsided if\nan attack is already going on.\n\n82\n00:03:58.164 --> 00:04:04.697\nSo instead, in network security\nmonitoring let's assume, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:09.135\nAnd this is not everybody's assumption but\nlet's take it from the standpoint and\n\n84\n00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.299\nlet's assume that you and I,\nhave been attacked, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.475\nOn our network there has\nbeen an attack that goes on.\n\n86\n00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:16.336\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n87\n00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:19.323\n&gt;&gt; Now once we actually assume that and\nwe go okay,\n\n88\n00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:24.100\nan attack has gone on at that point,\nwe have to actually be able to understand\n\n89\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.351\nthe difference between is that really an\nattack that is something that can harm us.\n\n90\n00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.068\nOr is it an attack that is just\nsomething that's kind of just there,\n\n91\n00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:34.840\nthat's just floating around.\n\n92\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.130\nSo we use a sports analogy Zach,\nthat we can talk about,\n\n93\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.824\nlet's just use an analogy of boxing just\nto kind of get us started here, right?\n\n94\n00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:43.656\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n95\n00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:47.026\n&gt;&gt; The idea of us facing off and boxing,\none of us is gonna get hurt, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.377\nIt just depends on how-\n&gt;&gt; That'd be me [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:52.519\n&gt;&gt; But I mean in boxing,\none of the opponents gets hurt, right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.990\nWell, the idea though is the impact, okay?\n\n99\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.546\nWhich one not only is gonna get hurt.\n\n100\n00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:02.741\nBut how much damage does it cause and\nthat's what you tend to hear.\n\n101\n00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:07.268\nThe idea of actually somebody stepping\ninto a jab, it stings a little bit and\n\n102\n00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:08.483\nthat's an impact.\n\n103\n00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:12.234\nBut that's not like somebody coming\nacross your chin with a right hook, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:16.202\nWhich knocks you out,\nwhich is a greater impact, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:17.602\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n106\n00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:21.249\nIt is not what we have to think about.\n\n107\n00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.450\nSo, we know that in a boxing match,\nsomebody is going to get usually\n\n108\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.785\nboth sides kinda gets a little\nbit hurt in that sense.\n\n109\n00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:32.660\nWell, if we assume then from our\nstandpoint of network security and\n\n110\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.753\nmonitoring this.\n\n111\n00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:37.455\nLet's just assume that we're going to\nfind various attacks going on inside our\n\n112\n00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:37.963\nnetwork.\n\n113\n00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:42.691\nSo we have to now actually think about\nthe idea of how we spot them and\n\n114\n00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:47.083\nthen of course, if it's a real attack,\nhow do we stop them but\n\n115\n00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:52.511\nif we actually spot something and\nwe're not sure it's a real attack or not.\n\n116\n00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:55.351\nThen we've got now actually\nkind of discovered.\n\n117\n00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.138\nWhether or not it's a real attack or not,\n\n118\n00:05:57.138 --> 00:05:59.650\nwhether something actually\nhas been compromised or not.\n\n119\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.703\nSo, that's where we have\nto kind of run through at\n\n120\n00:06:02.703 --> 00:06:06.872\nleast a value judgment in the sense\nthat we're gonna be analyzing.\n\n121\n00:06:06.872 --> 00:06:10.258\nNow, the great thing about\nthis particular analysis,\n\n122\n00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:12.503\nit's just a baseline for you right.\n\n123\n00:06:12.503 --> 00:06:15.436\nIf you're starting to work in\na security operation center,\n\n124\n00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:18.711\nyou're gonna have a guideline that's\ngonna kind of help you out and\n\n125\n00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.761\nthey're gonna say yes, we gotta monitor-\n&gt;&gt; Best practices.\n\n126\n00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:24.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you're not gonna be\nable to monitor for everything.\n\n127\n00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:28.141\nYou, as one analyst,\nis not gonna be able to run over every\n\n128\n00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:32.560\nsingle packet of traffic that comes\nacross is almost impossibility.\n\n129\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.061\nAnd we talked about this the other day,\nwhen we did another show,\n\n130\n00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:37.471\nin the previous episode.\n\n131\n00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:40.807\nWhere I showed you like we did\na wire capture on Wireshark for\n\n132\n00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:43.500\njust 90 seconds, 5, 6,000 packets.\n\n133\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.236\n&gt;&gt; At least.\n\n134\n00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:47.259\n&gt;&gt; Expecting to be able to analyze all\nof that and find every single one.\n\n135\n00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.315\nNot saying that it's not possible but\nis highly improbable,\n\n136\n00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:53.972\nat least humanly, to be able to do that.\n\n137\n00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:59.145\nSo, you and I have to come up with home\ntype of ability to actually be able\n\n138\n00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:04.257\nto understand what that impact is,\nand how do we analyze that impact?\n\n139\n00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.015\nAnd that's when we can kinda put it\ninto a grid or a matrix to help us out.\n\n140\n00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:12.239\nAnd let's take a look at my screen and\nwe'll work at it from the most basic\n\n141\n00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:16.812\nlevels, okay, that we can here which is\nthe idea of actually talking about and\n\n142\n00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:20.239\ncontrasting and\ncomparing what we call false positives.\n\n143\n00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:24.585\nAnd false negatives, as well as true\npositives and true negatives here, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:25.420\nSo, Zack,\n\n145\n00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.775\nthis is not only applicable inside of\nthe realm of network security, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:34.586\nThis is [INAUDIBLE] just about every where\nin our lives where we tend to actually\n\n147\n00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:37.591\nhave to deal with value judgements and\ndecisions that go on.\n\n148\n00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.869\n&gt;&gt; True [INAUDIBLE].\n\n149\n00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:43.082\n&gt;&gt; So we're not actually taking a look\nat from you know the most technically\n\n150\n00:07:43.082 --> 00:07:47.245\nstand point but it is something that\nwe want to understand here, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:50.928\nSo when it starts off here,\nas far as network detection or\n\n152\n00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.786\nintrusion detection goes.\n\n153\n00:07:52.786 --> 00:07:54.952\nLet's use it in that\nparticular standpoint.\n\n154\n00:07:54.952 --> 00:07:59.400\nNotice, I've actually got our\nlimitations here or our categories.\n\n155\n00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.100\nThe intrusion, is it a real intrusion,\nwhich would make it a positive,\n\n156\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.035\nor is it not a real intrusion?\n\n157\n00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:10.022\nSo, I actually just used\nthe words positive or negative.\n\n158\n00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:14.092\nThe other part of an intrusion\ndetection system, of course,\n\n159\n00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:18.944\nit works on the basis of setting up rules\nto match what we actually have to be\n\n160\n00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:23.327\nable to understand, and do, and\nthat's something we also want to\n\n161\n00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:26.571\nbe able to make sure that\nwe take a look at as well.\n\n162\n00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.527\nWhen we set up some type of\nintrusion detection system,\n\n163\n00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:35.422\nthis is where we go, all right,\nhow do I spot these types of attacks?\n\n164\n00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:39.633\nWell, we set up a rule that says,\nif the attack looks like this, or\n\n165\n00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:44.924\nif this type of data comes in, match it\nup, and if it matches, it's gonna be true.\n\n166\n00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.807\nIf it doesn't look like that,\nlet's go ahead and mark it as a false.\n\n167\n00:08:48.807 --> 00:08:51.057\nSo that's what happens.\n\n168\n00:08:51.057 --> 00:08:55.477\nNow the great thing is, with a lot of\nthe products that we buy today, and\n\n169\n00:08:55.477 --> 00:09:00.563\nthe utilities that we buy, they're set up\nwith at least the most fundamental kind\n\n170\n00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:05.672\nof basic best practices that we can think\nof, and they go ahead and give us a start.\n\n171\n00:09:05.672 --> 00:09:10.569\nSo we're not starting from zero, and\ntrying to monitor every single packet that\n\n172\n00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:14.964\ncomes in at the beginning, but\nthey normally give us, kind of, here's\n\n173\n00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:19.812\nthe standard set that should be taken a\nlook at here, and they set this stuff up.\n\n174\n00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:23.573\nThe goal of everything that we\ntake a look at from now on,\n\n175\n00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:28.384\nas far as intrusion detection systems go,\nis relatively simple here.\n\n176\n00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:33.028\nWe really want to focus in, and\nwhat we want for everything to happen,\n\n177\n00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:37.923\nis to actually be what we call\na True-Positive or a True-Negative here.\n\n178\n00:09:37.923 --> 00:09:42.121\nThat is the goal, is that we want\nanything that passes through,\n\n179\n00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:46.101\nit either really is, or\nit really isn't what we think it is.\n\n180\n00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:49.301\nSo that's what we really,\nwant but the reality is,\n\n181\n00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:53.519\nbecause the utilities that we end\nup using, or the tools that we use,\n\n182\n00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:58.760\nthey're setup very generically for every\nform factor that's out there, very small\n\n183\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.689\nnetworks all the way to the largest\nnetworks, well that's an impossibility.\n\n184\n00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.939\nSo they try and\nkind of cover the middle ground and\n\n185\n00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:12.491\nthen allow you at the edges there, of that\nspectrum that they're trying to cover,\n\n186\n00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:17.323\nto adjust or to tune your particular\ntool to do what it needs to, to try and\n\n187\n00:10:17.323 --> 00:10:22.160\nget you as close as possible to make\nsure that everything is 99.9% or\n\n188\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.186\n99.8% true everything, okay,\nis what we hope to do.\n\n189\n00:10:26.186 --> 00:10:30.252\nSo the reality though is that there are\nmany different layers of this that we have\n\n190\n00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:31.051\nto go through.\n\n191\n00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.180\nI wanna talk about each one of these.\n\n192\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.892\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nLet's go.\n\n193\n00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:35.779\nWell, Ronnie, I'm very excited about this.\n\n194\n00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:36.454\nI think it's a great topic.\n\n195\n00:10:36.454 --> 00:10:38.200\nSo where are we gonna get started here?\n\n196\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.563\nI know you've rearranged\na couple of things.\n\n197\n00:10:39.563 --> 00:10:40.246\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n198\n00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:43.416\nI just realized that my labels\nwere kind of a little bit off.\n\n199\n00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:46.324\nSo let's go and take a look at what\nI've actually changed here for a moment.\n\n200\n00:10:46.324 --> 00:10:50.282\nSo, I had actually had intrusion\nover here on the left-hand side and\n\n201\n00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.997\nrule match up here on the top.\n\n202\n00:10:51.997 --> 00:10:55.585\nSo I'm gonna switch that around to\nmake sure that it actually does\n\n203\n00:10:55.585 --> 00:10:58.273\nmatch up to what I really\nneed to talk about this.\n\n204\n00:10:58.273 --> 00:10:58.881\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n205\n00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:01.758\n&gt;&gt; But when we start talking\nabout it inside of a network, and\n\n206\n00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:03.757\nsome of the different things they want,\n\n207\n00:11:03.757 --> 00:11:06.873\nespecially with an intrusion\ndetection system, we wanna make\n\n208\n00:11:06.873 --> 00:11:10.956\nsure that we understand this idea of the\nrule match, and of course the intrusion.\n\n209\n00:11:10.956 --> 00:11:15.142\nSo with the intrusion,\nis the intrusion actually happening or\n\n210\n00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:20.282\nis it not happening, and then on intrusion\ndetection system the rule match.\n\n211\n00:11:20.282 --> 00:11:23.444\nWe set up rules to make sure that we\ncan match the traffic that we need to.\n\n212\n00:11:23.444 --> 00:11:25.063\nThat's going to give us the right thing.\n\n213\n00:11:25.063 --> 00:11:25.615\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n214\n00:11:25.615 --> 00:11:28.702\n&gt;&gt; So in other words, if it's an actual\npositive match, that means hey,\n\n215\n00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:29.428\nit did match up.\n\n216\n00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:31.650\nIf it's negative, then it didn't match up.\n\n217\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.420\nSo in that sense, everything hopefully,\nat this point, is set up, and we are gonna\n\n218\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.284\nstart off from right over here, and we'll\ntalk about false positives to begin with.\n\n219\n00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:41.798\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n220\n00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:44.393\n&gt;&gt; So we take a look at this matrix idea.\n\n221\n00:11:44.393 --> 00:11:45.733\nFalse-positive for\n\n222\n00:11:45.733 --> 00:11:50.203\nus is something that we definitely\nwant to understand here, in the very\n\n223\n00:11:50.203 --> 00:11:54.758\nfact that it can tell us an intrusion\nthat may not actually be happening.\n\n224\n00:11:54.758 --> 00:12:00.519\nSo the rule alerts whatever system that\nwe're on to say that a match did occur,\n\n225\n00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:04.643\nbut there really wasn't\nan actual attack that goes on.\n\n226\n00:12:04.643 --> 00:12:08.652\nNow if we think about that\nidea of the false-positive,\n\n227\n00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:11.734\nthen, you go well, what's the big deal.\n\n228\n00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:14.814\nSo an attack didn't happen.\n\n229\n00:12:14.814 --> 00:12:19.949\nSo Zach, let's think about it from\nthis standpoint, let's say, and\n\n230\n00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:25.256\nwe've all had this happen, we wake up\nrelatively early to come to work and\n\n231\n00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.674\nto do everything that we need to.\n\n232\n00:12:27.674 --> 00:12:31.490\nHave you ever, just by accident,\non a Friday, been so tired and then go,\n\n233\n00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.880\ngood, I don't actually have to worry about\nsetting my alarm for tomorrow morning.\n\n234\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.828\nSaturday, a nice weekend for us,\nand then actually set it, and\n\n235\n00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:42.034\nthen Saturday morning it went off?\n\n236\n00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:43.782\nWhat was your feeling about that?\n\n237\n00:12:43.782 --> 00:12:45.488\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, darn.\n\n238\n00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:49.544\n[LAUGH] I was the angry faced\nguy up there on your chart.\n\n239\n00:12:49.544 --> 00:12:50.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so\n\n240\n00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:55.673\nwhy would that actually be something that\nwe would actually have to worry about?\n\n241\n00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:58.766\nNow, when we're just talking about\nan alarm that wakes us up on a day\n\n242\n00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:00.449\nthat we don't wanna really wake up,\n\n243\n00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.828\nit is annoying,-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n244\n00:13:01.828 --> 00:13:02.526\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong.\n\n245\n00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:05.970\nYou go, ugh, I can't believe I woke up\nand, you just kind of turn it off, and\n\n246\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.613\nthen you kind of fall back to sleep for\n\n247\n00:13:07.613 --> 00:13:09.593\nthe next six hours that\nyou wanted to sleep.\n\n248\n00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:11.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're off and you're ready to go.\n\n249\n00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:17.255\nBut remember now that we're talking about\ninside of an intrusion detection system,\n\n250\n00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:21.683\nevery false-positive,\nwe as analysts, or we as people that\n\n251\n00:13:21.683 --> 00:13:26.310\nare monitoring this network,\nwe still have to treat it as what?\n\n252\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.251\n&gt;&gt; As if it was real.\n\n253\n00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:31.303\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we have to, right,\nwe can't just go [SOUND].\n\n254\n00:13:31.303 --> 00:13:34.985\nYeah, let's just hit the snooze\none more time, and let it go.\n\n255\n00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:38.955\nWe always have to respond as if it's real.\n\n256\n00:13:38.955 --> 00:13:39.604\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n257\n00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:44.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you think about\nthe impact that, just in terms of,\n\n258\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.675\njust that, okay, that is enough.\n\n259\n00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:51.115\nOnce again, if we now start talking about\nthe volume of data that comes across our\n\n260\n00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:53.069\nnetwork,-\n&gt;&gt; Daunting.\n\n261\n00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:57.488\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can imagine then that\nthe more false-positives that end up on\n\n262\n00:13:57.488 --> 00:14:01.762\na network because the intrusion\ndetection system is picking up on this\n\n263\n00:14:01.762 --> 00:14:06.618\nfalse-positive, and reporting it,\nwell that's when we kind of get really,\n\n264\n00:14:06.618 --> 00:14:11.707\nreally upset because everything now has\nto be examined that is a false-positive.\n\n265\n00:14:11.707 --> 00:14:16.301\nSo we used to joke before I worked with\nITProTV, and worked for another training\n\n266\n00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:20.691\ncompany, we got one of the early,\nI shouldn't say it's early, but for our\n\n267\n00:14:20.691 --> 00:14:25.426\ncompany we got one of those printers that\nwould report back to the administrator,\n\n268\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:30.020\nhow many sheets of paper were actually\nprinted, you name it, who printed it and\n\n269\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.547\nall that stuff, and so we always joked,\nbecause I was one of the people that set\n\n270\n00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:39.139\nit up, and I could say to our manager at\nthat point, I was like, I can have it send\n\n271\n00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:43.237\nan email on every single sheet of paper\nthat we print off if you want to.\n\n272\n00:14:43.237 --> 00:14:45.954\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you can imagine that that would be\n\n273\n00:14:45.954 --> 00:14:48.805\na little bit annoying,\nif what his job is, a big part of it,\n\n274\n00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.439\nis monitoring for email messages,\nthat would be bad.\n\n275\n00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:54.464\nWell the same thing here in\nterms of the false-positive,\n\n276\n00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:56.383\nthe impact is greater than we think.\n\n277\n00:14:56.383 --> 00:15:01.258\nSo even a false-positive, something that\ndidn't really happen as an intrusion,\n\n278\n00:15:01.258 --> 00:15:05.648\nwell, on the other side of it, an analyst\nhas at least taken a look at it, and\n\n279\n00:15:05.648 --> 00:15:10.181\nthat now becomes a bigger impact when\nthey might actually have spent their time\n\n280\n00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:14.330\nbetter at looking at things that we\nreally want them to look at instead.\n\n281\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.555\nSo that's why we want to be\naware of understanding this,\n\n282\n00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:21.820\nthat false-positive, and realize them.\n\n283\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.856\nSo this one doesn't have the happy face.\n\n284\n00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.159\nLet's take a look at the guy again.\n\n285\n00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:29.462\nHe's a little bit steamed about the idea\nthat something actually isn't happening\n\n286\n00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:32.118\nand you would think that\nhe'd be happy about that.\n\n287\n00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:35.716\nYou're probably happy the first time,\nat least it's a false-positive,-\n\n288\n00:15:35.716 --> 00:15:36.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank goodness.\n\n289\n00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:38.976\n&gt;&gt; The thousandth time,\nyou get a little bit more annoyed.\n\n290\n00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:41.151\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n291\n00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:45.235\nyou kind of have to take that\nboth those with a grain of salt.\n\n292\n00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:50.080\nNow I'm gonna kind of go in\nthis backward c shape here.\n\n293\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.848\nSo I'm going to go from here and then\nlet's talk about the true-positive and\n\n294\n00:15:52.848 --> 00:15:53.536\ntrue-negative.\n\n295\n00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.032\nI'm gonna leave this\nfalse-negative one here for last.\n\n296\n00:15:56.032 --> 00:15:59.159\nAnd because, well, that's the way I wanna\ndo it, and that's what we're gonna do.\n\n297\n00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:03.110\nSo let's talk about this idea\nof the true-positive then, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.787\nNow, a true-positive is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n299\n00:16:03.787 --> 00:16:09.955\nOkay, this is what we\nreally are monitoring for.\n\n300\n00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:13.344\nAnd we're grateful that our\nintrusion detection system says,\n\n301\n00:16:13.344 --> 00:16:16.996\nall right, I got a rule that matches it,\nso I know that I'm doing it.\n\n302\n00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:17.782\nAnd I'm sending a positive alert\nthat it matched something.\n\n303\n00:16:17.782 --> 00:16:18.620\nSo I'm sending an alert, and\nit actually is happening.\n\n304\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.316\nWell, these are things\nthat makes us happy, okay,\n\n305\n00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:31.576\nbecause we're saying the system is\ndoing what we paid for it to do.\n\n306\n00:16:31.576 --> 00:16:32.195\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:35.082\nAnd we're glad because we'd\nhate to have overpaid for\n\n308\n00:16:35.082 --> 00:16:38.303\na system that's really not\ndoing what it's designed to do.\n\n309\n00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:42.723\nOkay, so here we do get a small fire,\nand maybe even a big fire.\n\n310\n00:16:42.723 --> 00:16:47.287\nBut the system did alert us to\nthe very fact that something is\n\n311\n00:16:47.287 --> 00:16:50.956\nactually happening, and\nthat is a good thing.\n\n312\n00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:52.730\nMost systems work very well.\n\n313\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.165\nIt can spot the real things that are\nhappening, okay, and that's really good.\n\n314\n00:16:57.165 --> 00:17:00.086\nIt's on the edge of those\nthings that we really can't do.\n\n315\n00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:03.842\nSo this is where we want to make\nsure that we understand that.\n\n316\n00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:08.880\nSo in contrast, if we take a look at both\nof these positives here, okay, and I'll\n\n317\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.937\nzoom in as much as I can just on both of\nthem, and I'm thinking about this, right?\n\n318\n00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:14.811\nOne, of course,\nis that the event is happening, and\n\n319\n00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:15.627\nthe other is that the event\nisn't happening, but\n\n320\n00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:16.417\nthat we have a rule that\nsays that they both are.\n\n321\n00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:21.775\nSo in this particular sense,\nwe're glad for\n\n322\n00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:25.730\nthe way that the system is set up.\n\n323\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.433\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n324\n00:17:26.433 --> 00:17:28.287\n&gt;&gt; That it's catching the true things, but\n\n325\n00:17:28.287 --> 00:17:31.044\nwe're really not happy with\nthe way that the system is set up,\n\n326\n00:17:31.044 --> 00:17:34.174\nthat it's not catching those\nfalse-positives that come in as well.\n\n327\n00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:34.881\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n328\n00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:39.400\n&gt;&gt; So this does make a bit of difference\nwhen we start to take a look at\n\n329\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.770\nthat particular portion and\nidea of it as well.\n\n330\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.899\nAll right, now let's just slow\ndown a little bit more, and\n\n331\n00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:52.940\nlet's talk about this idea\nof the negatives here, okay?\n\n332\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.232\nNow, a true-negative is another\nthing that we really do value, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:58.232 --> 00:18:02.690\nWe value this fact, that it's true and\nthat we actually don't have something.\n\n334\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.653\nSo in this sense,\nwe might not get an alert that says, okay,\n\n335\n00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:11.967\neverything is good, but the very fact is\nit's not really making us do anything.\n\n336\n00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:15.166\nSo we might actually say, hey, here's all\nthe regular traffic that's coming through,\n\n337\n00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:18.251\nand that's actually being filtered out in\nthis way, or it's matching this traffic.\n\n338\n00:18:18.251 --> 00:18:23.055\nBut it's not the harmful traffic that\nwe want to, so it does help us out.\n\n339\n00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:25.923\nMost of us that are brand new to this,\nin terms of networking,\n\n340\n00:18:25.923 --> 00:18:28.955\nwe don't normally see a lot of this,\nas far of a marker that says,\n\n341\n00:18:28.955 --> 00:18:32.790\nthis is a true-negative, this is\na true-negative, this is a true-negative.\n\n342\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.195\nBut for those of you that are just\nfinishing your CCNA Routing and\n\n343\n00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:41.111\nSwitching, or\nyou've just gone through your CCT exam,\n\n344\n00:18:41.111 --> 00:18:44.554\nand you're now working with a router and\nswitch.\n\n345\n00:18:44.554 --> 00:18:49.527\nIf you work with access control lists,\nokay, at the end of that, right,\n\n346\n00:18:49.527 --> 00:18:51.704\nthere's an implicit deny all.\n\n347\n00:18:51.704 --> 00:18:55.043\nIn other words, it's designed to\nactually go deny all the traffic, okay,\n\n348\n00:18:55.043 --> 00:18:56.359\nthat actually goes through.\n\n349\n00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:59.202\nThat's the very last rule in that list,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:18:59.202 --> 00:19:00.257\nWell, how do you know if something\nactually is getting denied or not?\n\n351\n00:19:00.257 --> 00:19:05.572\nWell, it doesn't tell you.\n\n352\n00:19:05.572 --> 00:19:08.473\nYou can actually do this,\nshow output that you need to,\n\n353\n00:19:08.473 --> 00:19:10.833\nto show you what it\nactually says I'm doing.\n\n354\n00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:13.722\nBut it's not gonna show you\nthat it's denying everything.\n\n355\n00:19:13.722 --> 00:19:17.812\nSo in that sense,\nit could be a true-negative as well.\n\n356\n00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:18.946\nIt actually is working, and\nis actually denying those things as well.\n\n357\n00:19:18.946 --> 00:19:23.638\nSo nothing is actually really happening,\nbut\n\n358\n00:19:23.638 --> 00:19:26.775\nis the rule actually working?\n\n359\n00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:27.710\nSo that's what you're testing for.\n\n360\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:32.347\nWell, the way that you can change that,\nand especially in that access control\n\n361\n00:19:32.347 --> 00:19:35.874\nlist, is that you just add in\nthe word log at the end of that.\n\n362\n00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:40.365\nSo instead of making an implicit denial,\nyou type it out,\n\n363\n00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:46.611\nthe access control rule that you need, and\nthen you add in the word log at the end.\n\n364\n00:19:46.611 --> 00:19:50.902\nAnd then when you run it again, it will\nthen display for you the number of packets\n\n365\n00:19:50.902 --> 00:19:55.258\nor the number of bytes, whatever it is,\nI can't remember off the top of my head,\n\n366\n00:19:55.258 --> 00:19:59.702\nthat has gone through and has hit that\nparticular rule and it's denied access in.\n\n367\n00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:04.057\nSo even though you don't tend to see a lot\nof it, is it still working against a rule?\n\n368\n00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:08.001\nProbably, okay, and is it actually\nworking the way that I want it to?\n\n369\n00:20:08.001 --> 00:20:10.795\nYes, so sometimes you do need to see that,\nand if you do,\n\n370\n00:20:10.795 --> 00:20:12.618\na lot of times, you can turn that on.\n\n371\n00:20:12.618 --> 00:20:16.313\nBut most of time,\nwe don't need to see that much data, so\n\n372\n00:20:16.313 --> 00:20:18.394\nwe tend not to turn it on as well.\n\n373\n00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:22.089\nSo both of these on this side,\nokay, the true-positive and\n\n374\n00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:26.221\nthe true-negatives, this is what\nwe hope for everything inside of\n\n375\n00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:30.510\nour intrusion detection systems to\nreally be able to point out for us.\n\n376\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.817\nOkay, on the other side, we really don't\nwant anything, but we still get them.\n\n377\n00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:38.213\nSo the reality is that not everything\nis gonna be set up perfectly.\n\n378\n00:20:38.213 --> 00:20:42.314\nNow, I left this one for\nlast here, the false-negative,\n\n379\n00:20:42.314 --> 00:20:47.243\nbecause this one is the one that's\na little bit more worrisome, okay?\n\n380\n00:20:47.243 --> 00:20:50.853\nSo Zach, let's see if we can\nkind of figure this one out, so\n\n381\n00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:55.637\neven if we don't have a lot of networking\nknowledge in our background, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:55.637 --> 00:21:00.867\nSo what I'm telling you is that\nan intrusion may not have happened,\n\n383\n00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:06.766\nokay, and it says that here, on the rule,\nit didn't actually match here.\n\n384\n00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:13.306\nOkay, so in this sense, why would this\nbe something that we worry about, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:16.376\nWell, this is the one that\nsays I can't detect it, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:19.009\nSo in other words, I can't tell\nyou if this is a negative or not.\n\n387\n00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:22.393\nSo in that sense,\nit's actually stealthy in this way,\n\n388\n00:21:22.393 --> 00:21:27.365\nwhere it's not matching anything, and\nit's not matching anything that at all.\n\n389\n00:21:27.365 --> 00:21:29.632\nWe don't know what actually it could be.\n\n390\n00:21:29.632 --> 00:21:33.348\nSo that's where that false-negative\nreally is kind of harmful for\n\n391\n00:21:33.348 --> 00:21:34.921\nwhat we want to be able to do.\n\n392\n00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:35.951\n&gt;&gt; I think it would be.\n\n393\n00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:40.416\n&gt;&gt; It really would, so\nno rule is present, but\n\n394\n00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:45.488\nwe can actually think about\nthe idea here that what\n\n395\n00:21:45.488 --> 00:21:50.790\ncould end up happening\non the false-negative.\n\n396\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.105\nI did twist that around a little bit,\ndidn't I?\n\n397\n00:21:54.105 --> 00:22:01.557\nThis one should be up here where\nI am working that out, yeah.\n\n398\n00:22:01.557 --> 00:22:03.478\nSo the false-negative, no, that's right,\n\n399\n00:22:03.478 --> 00:22:05.359\nI just wanna make sure\nI'm telling you right.\n\n400\n00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:08.545\nNo rule is matched, but\nthen this one, though,\n\n401\n00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:12.370\nis actually even telling you\nthat the intrusion is false.\n\n402\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.358\nNow, the reality of this, right,\n\n403\n00:22:14.358 --> 00:22:17.754\nis that we don't know if\nan intrusion is really false or not.\n\n404\n00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:18.311\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n405\n00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:22.398\n&gt;&gt; So it could be still that idea\nthat it is actually not happening, or\n\n406\n00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:25.980\nit is happening as well, so\nthis one we may not know at all.\n\n407\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.702\nNow, you might go, well,\nwhy is it still doing that?\n\n408\n00:22:28.702 --> 00:22:31.818\nAnd it's because nothing is tuned\nthe way that it needs to be, so\n\n409\n00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:34.262\nthat's why we want to be\ncareful on these as well.\n\n410\n00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:37.436\nOkay, this one could be\nthe worst one as well.\n\n411\n00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:41.949\nThe very fact that we could have something\nthat says, hey, it's not actually going\n\n412\n00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:46.226\non, but the rule actually isn't catching\nit and something is really going on.\n\n413\n00:22:46.226 --> 00:22:48.282\nThat's when we have an issue, okay, so\n\n414\n00:22:48.282 --> 00:22:51.800\nthat's why we want to make sure that\nwe pay attention to those, too.\n\n415\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.167\nSo it's not every time that an actual\nintrusion does end up happening, but\n\n416\n00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:58.172\nthere are times when it does happen,\nand when it doesn't happen.\n\n417\n00:22:58.172 --> 00:23:00.893\nBut we need to know what's\ngoing through that device.\n\n418\n00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:04.400\nSo our intrusion detection systems,\nhow do we overcome this?\n\n419\n00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.057\nWell, we overcome it by what we\ncall doing some tuning to the way\n\n420\n00:23:08.057 --> 00:23:09.587\nthat the rules are set up.\n\n421\n00:23:09.587 --> 00:23:13.350\nSo this is where you do have to\ndo a couple of different things.\n\n422\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.315\nMake sure that if you're using,\nof course, the intrusion detection system\n\n423\n00:23:17.315 --> 00:23:21.169\nupdates that are out there for your\nsystem, make sure those are up to date.\n\n424\n00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:24.978\nBut if you have the ability to\nturn on what we call heuristics,\n\n425\n00:23:24.978 --> 00:23:26.308\nit will also happen.\n\n426\n00:23:26.308 --> 00:23:31.252\nHeuristics, of course, it actually comes\nfrom the Greek word eureka, which means\n\n427\n00:23:31.252 --> 00:23:36.006\nI found it, and this means that it is a\nsystem that actually learns what they are.\n\n428\n00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:39.985\nIt takes a long time to be able to get\nthis to the place that it needs to, but\n\n429\n00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:42.286\nthis is the most effective way to do this.\n\n430\n00:23:42.286 --> 00:23:46.085\nBut at the same time, you're gonna get\nmore false-positives then, and you may,\n\n431\n00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:49.140\nof course, even get false-negatives\nthat come through as well.\n\n432\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.044\nBut once that system of learning is over,\nthe false-positives will end up reducing,\n\n433\n00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:57.078\nand the false-negatives\nwill end up reducing down.\n\n434\n00:23:57.078 --> 00:24:01.674\nTo where you'll hit more of the true\npositives and the true negatives,\n\n435\n00:24:01.674 --> 00:24:05.129\nis what we want to be able to\nunderstand and do as well.\n\n436\n00:24:05.129 --> 00:24:07.962\nSo just be aware that as\nfar as the impact goes,\n\n437\n00:24:07.962 --> 00:24:11.242\nyou'll have these things\nthat will end up matching.\n\n438\n00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:15.053\nAnd that's something that we really want\nto make sure that we understand here.\n\n439\n00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:18.106\nSo when we do have the matches\nthat end up going on and\n\n440\n00:24:18.106 --> 00:24:23.005\neverything else is happening here, we've\ngot to be aware of that type of impact,\n\n441\n00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:25.361\nand contrast and compare them as well.\n\n442\n00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:29.343\nBecause that's gonna be helpful when\nunderstanding what has to be done.\n\n443\n00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:34.497\nEverybody always believes, especially as\na beginner, that we buy these systems,\n\n444\n00:24:34.497 --> 00:24:37.992\nwe turn it on, and it just works,\nthe majority of it may.\n\n445\n00:24:37.992 --> 00:24:42.626\nBut if you do find yourself where there's\na ton of false positives coming back in,\n\n446\n00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:46.521\nit probably means that the system\nneeds to be tuned a little bit better\n\n447\n00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:50.957\nto actually match the patterns that your\nnetwork traffic is gonna generate and\n\n448\n00:24:50.957 --> 00:24:52.737\ndo what we need it to do as well.\n\n449\n00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:56.878\nNow once we actually have\nthis information down, Zach,\n\n450\n00:24:56.878 --> 00:25:02.068\nonce we get everything here down,\nI'm like okay, so what do I do next?\n\n451\n00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:04.046\nWell this is where that\ntuning comes in and\n\n452\n00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:06.882\nwe're not getting into the aspects\nof setting that all up.\n\n453\n00:25:06.882 --> 00:25:11.186\nBut we do want to show you where you\ndo see this type of information coming\n\n454\n00:25:11.186 --> 00:25:15.224\nacross and even how that actually\ngets evaluated that way as well.\n\n455\n00:25:15.224 --> 00:25:17.187\nAnd we'll actually do that and\n\n456\n00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:22.323\nwe'll use Cisco's Firepower Management\nCenter to help us to be able to show that\n\n457\n00:25:22.323 --> 00:25:27.252\nthe way that they register impacts that\nare happening on their networks too.\n\n458\n00:25:27.252 --> 00:25:29.054\nNow just when I say something like that,\nand\n\n459\n00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:30.964\nI'd love to get into it\nto show you right away.\n\n460\n00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:36.201\nBut I realize that we are coming close\non the time limit for this episode Zach.\n\n461\n00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.279\nSo it looks like we'll have to\npick up then in part two here.\n\n462\n00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:41.128\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\ntaking step by step is the best way to go.\n\n463\n00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:43.908\nIntrusion Impact Analysis part one,\nthere will be a part two.\n\n464\n00:25:43.908 --> 00:25:46.158\nBefore we move on, though,\nI had a question for you,\n\n465\n00:25:46.158 --> 00:25:48.011\nyou mentioned heuristics, is that right?\n\n466\n00:25:48.011 --> 00:25:50.284\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So where do we find that?\n\n467\n00:25:50.284 --> 00:25:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in terms of heuristics,\nthere's actually different features inside\n\n468\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.346\nof those intrusion detection systems,\nand they're designed to do heuristics.\n\n469\n00:25:57.346 --> 00:26:00.311\nThat means that they can\nactually learn your system and\n\n470\n00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:03.416\nthe patterns of behavior that\nwill allow them to do that.\n\n471\n00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:06.589\nSo, in other words,\nit is set up as being a learning process.\n\n472\n00:26:06.589 --> 00:26:08.598\nAnd they'll start sampling your data,\n\n473\n00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:11.921\nwhich will actually include those\nfalse positives a lot of times.\n\n474\n00:26:11.921 --> 00:26:15.044\nThey'll get more of them at the beginning,\nbut once they start learning that\n\n475\n00:26:15.044 --> 00:26:17.512\npattern and you start marking,\nthese are false positives.\n\n476\n00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:20.613\nAfter a while they will go all right,\nI figured that one out, and\n\n477\n00:26:20.613 --> 00:26:22.350\nwill start eliminating that down.\n\n478\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.748\nSo different systems will give you\ndifferent levels to be able to do that.\n\n479\n00:26:25.748 --> 00:26:30.185\nBut just realize if you're going to set up\nheuristics, it takes longer in times of\n\n480\n00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:33.226\nthe true ramp up to the production\nthat you want it to do.\n\n481\n00:26:33.226 --> 00:26:36.156\nSo don't expect it to go overnight,\nwe're done,\n\n482\n00:26:36.156 --> 00:26:40.741\nit takes a little bit more monitoring,\nit takes a little bit more time to set up.\n\n483\n00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:43.577\nAnd you've got to pay attention to\neverything that comes across there.\n\n484\n00:26:43.577 --> 00:26:46.450\nAnd you want a better system at\ngiving you, as close as possible,\n\n485\n00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.657\nto you true negatives and\nto your true positives.\n\n486\n00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:52.215\n&gt;&gt; Which we're going to delve into in\nintrusion impact analysis part two,\n\n487\n00:26:52.215 --> 00:26:54.564\ngreat information Ronnie,\nthanks very much.\n\n488\n00:26:54.564 --> 00:26:57.147\nAnd why don't you check\nout our course library so\n\n489\n00:26:57.147 --> 00:26:59.796\nyou can see every single\nepisode of Cisco SECOPS.\n\n490\n00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:01.453\nI mean, you'll be glad you did, and\n\n491\n00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.835\nalso there's hundreds of other videos\nin there too to help you go further.\n\n492\n00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:09.101\nAnd by the way, tell a friend about\nITProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n493\n00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:10.648\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n494\n00:27:10.648 --> 00:27:11.479\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:10.963\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:13.799\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.169\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:21.623\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, and this is\nCCNA SECOPS, with me is Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:25.040\nAnd we're gonna be plumbing the depths\nof incidence response elements,\n\n8\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.455\naren't we, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:27.575\n&gt;&gt; We really are, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:29.305\nThank you, again, for\nhaving me on the show as we-\n\n11\n00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.914\n&gt;&gt; Continue on, and\nwe take a look, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:35.295\nat now the idea of incident response.\n\n14\n00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:40.209\nAnd this is kind of a larger field of\nthings than what we're probably used to\n\n15\n00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:41.224\ndealing with.\n\n16\n00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.900\nIn security, we think about details a lot.\n\n17\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.894\nAnd we think about of course a lot of\nthe actual technical challenges to\n\n18\n00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.463\nwhat needs to be done, so\nthat we are more secure.\n\n19\n00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:55.681\nBut now when we move into\nthe idea of incident response,\n\n20\n00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.797\nnotice that it's not that we don't\nhave technical details involved.\n\n21\n00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:05.000\nBut this is more of our response, or\nour response, I should say properly.\n\n22\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.900\nAnd that means that it actually\ninvolves a human element,\n\n23\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.060\nin terms of managing what happens\nwhen an incident actually comes up.\n\n24\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.965\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\nthis is in the NIST SP 800-61 plan,\n\n25\n00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:18.707\nincident response plan, is what\nwe're going to be looking at right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:22.142\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we're actually gonna\nget some guidance when we start\n\n27\n00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:26.078\ntalking about this idea of incident\nresponse, right, from, of course,\n\n28\n00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:28.395\nthe special publications in terms of NIST.\n\n29\n00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:32.327\nAnd this is important, that we\nunderstand what's happening here, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:35.044\nwhy we're actually using\nthis guidance as well.\n\n31\n00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:38.832\nBecause learning about the technical\ndetails and what I was referring to just\n\n32\n00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.637\na little bit earlier,\nwe can get all that set up, right?\n\n33\n00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:45.568\nWe can take classes or\nwe can watch shows right here in ITProTV,\n\n34\n00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:48.546\nwe can understand\nthe technology a lot better.\n\n35\n00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:52.062\nBut what about actually\ndeveloping teams that help\n\n36\n00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:56.200\nyou to respond with a security\nincident does happen?\n\n37\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.986\nWell, that's not exactly outside\nof the scope of what we can do.\n\n38\n00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.675\nBut most of us may not have experience,\nespecially even at the associate level,\n\n39\n00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:04.986\nin which we're looking at.\n\n40\n00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:08.693\nIn other words, like an entry-level\nperson going into cybersecurity.\n\n41\n00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:12.551\nTo understand what it is that\nactually has to come together for\n\n42\n00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:16.794\nthose teams to do what they need to,\nand even have some type of plan.\n\n43\n00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:20.392\nSo the great thing is we can turn to,\nwell, the idea is here is NIST,\n\n44\n00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:23.551\nright, National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology,\n\n45\n00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.080\nthis is where we're\ngoing to find guidance.\n\n46\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer screen, and\n\n47\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.313\nthis will help us out as we go through,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:35.620\nSo what we're looking at specifically\nis the special publication\n\n49\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.050\nthat Zach was referring to, 800-61,\nand there's a revision too, out.\n\n50\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.200\nAnd that's the one that's focused in,\nat least for the exam, what's called out.\n\n51\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.960\nAnd this is the one you want to go out\nhere to, of course, NIST itself and\n\n52\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.850\ndownload.\n\n53\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.420\nNow if you don't know what the link is,\n\n54\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.380\nI'm gonna leave it right here just for\na moment.\n\n55\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.575\nThat will give you a chance\nto either do a screenshot or\n\n56\n00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:00.347\nto write down this link\nthat will get you here.\n\n57\n00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.806\nAnd once you actually are here,\n\n58\n00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.650\nnotice it will bring you to\nthe Computer Security Resource Center.\n\n59\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.939\nAnd then the first section of\nthis is under Publications,\n\n60\n00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.226\nand we are taking a look at\nthe NIST Special publications,\n\n61\n00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:18.268\nunder the 800 series here,\non computer security.\n\n62\n00:03:18.268 --> 00:03:20.175\nSo when I select this, and\n\n63\n00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:25.227\nallow you to go to their particular\npublication search, zeroes in.\n\n64\n00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:30.100\nAnd the numbers actually are going\nto be descending at this point,\n\n65\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.590\nso notice how it's actually 800-195 here.\n\n66\n00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.169\nIf I scroll all the way down,\nI'm looking for number 61,\n\n67\n00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.384\nit's a little bit of a quicker zoom here.\n\n68\n00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:47.739\nI'm getting close, 68,\n64, 63, and there it is.\n\n69\n00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.515\nSo the one I'm looking for is right\nhere which is the 800-61, Revision 2.\n\n70\n00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:57.656\nAnd it tells you that this is the computer\nsecurity incident handling guide.\n\n71\n00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:00.581\nAnd it gives you, of course,\nthe ability to download this.\n\n72\n00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.931\nNow I recommend that you download this,\nespecially when getting ready for\n\n73\n00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.558\nthe exam.\n\n74\n00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:09.443\nAnd it is something that you're\ngoing to have to be ready for and\n\n75\n00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:13.060\nhave available to you on hand,\nas you go through.\n\n76\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.257\nOnce you've downloaded it,\nand here's on my screen,\n\n77\n00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.609\nI don't know why the little\nlogo didn't show up right now.\n\n78\n00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.168\nBut it should verify,\nSpecial Publication 800-61, Revision 2.\n\n79\n00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:28.470\nThis is the one that is called out on the\nexam, make sure you get a hold of this.\n\n80\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.320\nAnd this is something that is\ngoing to be unusual, Zach.\n\n81\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.718\nI normally don't, and I am not going to,\nokay, I don't say hey,\n\n82\n00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:36.510\nlet's read through this entire document.\n\n83\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.191\nBut I do want to make an exam\nnote at this point, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:44.254\nWhen you are preparing for\nyour SECCOPS exam, okay,\n\n85\n00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:50.820\nthere's no way to get around this, you\nmust read through this entire document.\n\n86\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.880\nAs you notice the number of pages in terms\nof the electronic format that I have,\n\n87\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.210\nI'm on page 1 of 79, Zach.\n\n88\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n89\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.580\nI would love to tell you, there's some\nother publications that we'll go through-\n\n90\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.503\n&gt;&gt; There's no CliffsNoteson\n\n91\n00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:07.229\nthis, or anything?\n\n92\n00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.266\n&gt;&gt; No, not easily, but there are some\nother publications in which we'll head.\n\n93\n00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:17.548\nThe 800-86, I think, is the one we'll\nactually take a look at as well,\n\n94\n00:05:17.548 --> 00:05:21.680\nthat you may only have to\nlook at brief sections of it.\n\n95\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.600\nBut for the exam, and for\nthis particular publication,\n\n96\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.590\nyou've just got to read the entire thing,\nokay?\n\n97\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.833\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; And there's no other way around it.\n\n98\n00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:36.044\nAnd the reason why is that the way that\nthe exam objectives call out on this\n\n99\n00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.436\nparticular document.\n\n100\n00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.340\nIs it makes you search\nthrough the entire document,\n\n101\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.540\nto correlates things that are in\ndifferent parts of the document.\n\n102\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.178\nSo you can't just get to one section and\ngo, I have got it.\n\n103\n00:05:48.178 --> 00:05:51.541\nAnd then you'll actually see the next\nexam objective that is called out.\n\n104\n00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:56.450\nThey'll say, make sure you can map this\nto what you have previously learned here.\n\n105\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.730\nAnd then also make sure that you can\ndo this with these elements that you\n\n106\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.650\njust mapped.\n\n107\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.580\nAnd the only way for you to do that is by\nreading through the entire document, and\n\n108\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.330\nmaking notes as you actually do that.\n\n109\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.794\nNow of course we're not going to stand\nhere and, at least Zach and I aren't,\n\n110\n00:06:10.794 --> 00:06:12.143\nunless Zach really wants to.\n\n111\n00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:14.596\nHe can read the entire document\nif he wants to out loud, but\n\n112\n00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:15.709\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n113\n00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Recommendations of the National,\nno, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n114\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Let's not do that, yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.716\nSo, but we're not going to do that, but\n\n116\n00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:22.697\nwe do want to point out\nsome of those elements.\n\n117\n00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:26.753\nBut don't bypass the idea of reading it,\njust because we\n\n118\n00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:31.747\ngo over the elements in the way that\nare really called out for the exam.\n\n119\n00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:34.880\nAt the same time, you are not\ngoing to get all the context for\n\n120\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.028\nit by me just kind of saying, here are\nsome of these elements we need to look at.\n\n121\n00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:41.759\nWe will give you some context,\nbut the only way for\n\n122\n00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.478\nyou to get the full context of it is\nto read through the entire thing.\n\n123\n00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:48.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but here we're\ngoing through some of the basics,\n\n124\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.806\nsome of the more nuts and\nbolts that you really need to know right?\n\n125\n00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:54.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep,\nthat is what we're hoping for.\n\n126\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.485\nSo as I scroll through here, let me get\nto the contents is what I want to get to.\n\n127\n00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:03.499\nAnd that's where we are going\nto begin to take a look at here,\n\n128\n00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:06.907\non the table of contents and\nwhat it's showing us.\n\n129\n00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:10.217\nNow let me zoom that out just a little\nbit more, so that we can see.\n\n130\n00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:12.181\nNot so\nworried about the introductory stuff,\n\n131\n00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:13.902\nwhich we've just kind of gone through.\n\n132\n00:07:13.902 --> 00:07:16.251\nBut beginning with the Organizing\n\n133\n00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.387\na Computer Security Incident\nResponse Capability, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:25.081\nWell, they are assuming at this point,\nokay, if you are not familiar with\n\n135\n00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:30.391\nincident response, how do you develop\nthat capability within your organization?\n\n136\n00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:32.992\nAnd that actually begins\nby doing a process, and\n\n137\n00:07:32.992 --> 00:07:37.182\nunderstanding elements that they want\nyou to actually understand as you start\n\n138\n00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:40.686\nplanning out your incident\nresponse capabilities here, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:44.149\nSo at the beginning, you can see\nthings like Events and Incidents,\n\n140\n00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.740\nwhat's the need of it, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.551\nAnd then it's right here,\nreally in this section here,\n\n142\n00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:54.055\nat 2.3 here or, yeah, 2.3.\n\n143\n00:07:54.055 --> 00:07:58.603\nIncident Response Policy, Plan,\nand Procedure Creation, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.548\nHere's where the nuts and\nbolts of it really does come in to\n\n145\n00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:06.670\nwhat we're really going to\nactually dig into, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.741\nAll these elements right here are things\nthat we really want to at least\n\n147\n00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.234\nkind of focus in on certain elements here.\n\n148\n00:08:13.234 --> 00:08:16.497\nAnd that is because this exam\nobjective calls out really of\n\n149\n00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:19.636\nthe idea of these elements\nthat it talks about, right?\n\n150\n00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:21.798\nWe're not gonna worry about so\nmuch on the policy.\n\n151\n00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:23.822\nAnd those are things you can\nactually take a look at.\n\n152\n00:08:23.822 --> 00:08:28.410\nBut it's really about the planning\nelements that we want to begin with.\n\n153\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.000\nSo not only are we talking\nabout here's the policies and\n\n154\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.680\nwhy we're establishing them, but\n\n155\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.822\nactually these plan elements right here\nas well as the procedural elements too.\n\n156\n00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:41.690\nWe're gonna briefly talk about,\nof course, the response team structures.\n\n157\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.640\nAnd what it allows us to do as well.\n\n158\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.831\nAnd then we'll go through and take a look\nat the idea of how the analysis happens.\n\n159\n00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.969\nIn other words, once you got,\nonce you have, once you got.\n\n160\n00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:55.072\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once you have your instant response\n\n161\n00:08:55.072 --> 00:08:59.608\nteam and your plan of action settled in,\nright, you have to know that there\n\n162\n00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:04.450\nare certain activities that\nare categorized when an incident happens.\n\n163\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.962\nSo this is where we begin in this third\nsection here where it says Handling\n\n164\n00:09:07.962 --> 00:09:08.665\nan Incident.\n\n165\n00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:13.925\nAnd notice how it's broken apart into\nPreparation, Detection and Analysis,\n\n166\n00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:20.220\nContainment, Eradication, and Recovery,\nand Post-Incident Activity, as well, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.098\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll actually take a look at that\n\n168\n00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:28.040\nagain as we kind of go through what\nwe need to for this show, as well.\n\n169\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.060\nThe fourth element is coordination and\n\n170\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.670\ninformation sharing,\nbecause we start to learn something\n\n171\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.970\nwhen we get more experience in terms\nof dealing with instances, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:43.270\nAnd this is the very fact and nature of\nit is that it's gonna change every time.\n\n173\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.830\nAnd that is because\nthe attackers get smarter.\n\n174\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.217\nThe way that we handle incidences have\nto change because our network has\n\n175\n00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:49.956\nchanged a bit.\n\n176\n00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:50.816\nAnd so in this,\n\n177\n00:09:50.816 --> 00:09:55.060\nthere might be a coordination now,\nwhereas when you were in the small shop,\n\n178\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.398\nyou might've only relied internally on\npeople and resources that you knew.\n\n179\n00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:03.626\nBut as your shop grew bigger, as your\nparticular company grows bigger and\n\n180\n00:10:03.626 --> 00:10:07.512\nyou start adding more elements into it and\ncloud elements into it and\n\n181\n00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:09.715\nother types of services that come in.\n\n182\n00:10:09.715 --> 00:10:12.137\nYou might find yourself\nneeding to expand and\n\n183\n00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:15.780\ncoordinate with other security\nprofessionals that are out there.\n\n184\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.308\nAnd what type of information\nare you going to share,\n\n185\n00:10:18.308 --> 00:10:21.296\nhow much information are you\ngoing to share, between those,\n\n186\n00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:24.301\neven though they're not really\na part of your organization?\n\n187\n00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.778\nSo here they talk about\nthe coordination effort and\n\n188\n00:10:26.778 --> 00:10:30.540\nsome of the different techniques\nthat are also there as well.\n\n189\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:36.080\nAnd this is unusual, but\nyou don't want to skip the appendices.\n\n190\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.280\nI know it sounds like, are you joking me?\n\n191\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.237\nNo, I'm not, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:44.048\nYou don't wanna skip the appendices\nbecause it's right here that you'll\n\n193\n00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:48.797\nend up seeing a lot of information,\nput it into the context of scenarios.\n\n194\n00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:52.871\nWhich is what really gets it set in your\nbrain on some of the things that have to\n\n195\n00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:54.665\nactually take place and handle.\n\n196\n00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:58.123\nSo I would make sure that I take\na look at these elements as well.\n\n197\n00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:01.299\nAnd don't worry about memorizing them.\n\n198\n00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:04.310\nBut just again make sure\nyou read through these and\n\n199\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.035\nunderstand at least those major\npoint that you think, yeah,\n\n200\n00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.860\nthis is something that I can\nactually see and understand.\n\n201\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.560\nAnd of course, there's even\nFrequently Asked Questions there,\n\n202\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.980\nCrisis Handling Steps.\n\n203\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.190\nThis is all about, of course,\ngiving you more information, so\n\n204\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.020\nthat when you do have to actually do\nincident response, you have, at least,\n\n205\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.200\na solid basis of framework\nthat you can begin with.\n\n206\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.113\n&gt;&gt; And once again,\nthe NIST information, the website,\n\n207\n00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe information they're\non is free of charge.\n\n208\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.469\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, it is free of charge,\nso you can go and download that,\n\n209\n00:11:36.469 --> 00:11:38.867\nas I did here as a PDF,\nand it allow to do that.\n\n210\n00:11:38.867 --> 00:11:41.397\nAnd the only charge is,\nif you happen to print it out,\n\n211\n00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:44.732\nit's gonna take you about 80 pages\nof paper and a lot of time, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:46.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's really about the only charge.\n\n213\n00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:48.550\nAnd if you like reading them that way,\nI understand,\n\n214\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.843\nI used to do that a lot of times here.\n\n215\n00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:53.858\nDownload and then read it again on paper,\ncuz I like being able to mark up stuff.\n\n216\n00:11:53.858 --> 00:11:57.509\nBut after I while, I found that actually\na lot easier just to read on the screen,\n\n217\n00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.541\nespecially if you have multiple monitors.\n\n218\n00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:01.190\nActually it makes a lot easier\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n219\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.378\n&gt;&gt; And you can actually use this search\nfeature, which is what I also like too,\n\n220\n00:12:05.378 --> 00:12:06.761\nas being able to do that.\n\n221\n00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:07.436\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n222\n00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.379\n&gt;&gt; Se we are going to,\nof course then, focus in and\n\n223\n00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:15.234\nmake sure that we can describe some of\nthese elements that need to be included in\n\n224\n00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:18.200\nthis incident response\nplan at the beginning.\n\n225\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.612\nSo that means I have to kind of have\nto scroll down through here and\n\n226\n00:12:21.612 --> 00:12:22.886\nget to a certain point.\n\n227\n00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:25.357\nAnd the point that I want is actually in,\n\n228\n00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:29.804\nI have to actually look at the table\nof contents again to help us out here.\n\n229\n00:12:29.804 --> 00:12:33.082\nSo under the second section,\nI'm looking for, what,\n\n230\n00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:35.469\n2.3 is the one that I'm looking for.\n\n231\n00:12:35.469 --> 00:12:38.688\nSo I use my find feature there,\nI could type in 2.3, and\n\n232\n00:12:38.688 --> 00:12:41.792\nit starts to find the elements\nthat are involved there.\n\n233\n00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:45.148\nAnd hopefully in just a moment here,\nthere we go.\n\n234\n00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:49.239\nWe're actually going into that\nparticular portion of our document.\n\n235\n00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:53.406\nIncident Response Policy,\nPlan, and Procedure Creation.\n\n236\n00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:57.073\nI'm not gonna worry so\nmuch about the policy elements right now.\n\n237\n00:12:57.073 --> 00:12:59.875\nYou don't skip this in your own reading,\nokay?\n\n238\n00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:05.382\nBut for the exam purposes and making sure\nthat we can get our show done as well,\n\n239\n00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:09.726\nwe're really looking at these\nelements right here, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:09.726 --> 00:13:10.910\nUnder the Plan Elements.\n\n241\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.519\nNotice the way that it describes\nwhat it's talking about.\n\n242\n00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:18.398\nIt's not talking about the technical\nelements that we have to\n\n243\n00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:19.748\nactually get set up.\n\n244\n00:13:19.748 --> 00:13:22.063\nBut notice the way it's\nactually describing it.\n\n245\n00:13:22.063 --> 00:13:25.326\nOrganizations should have a formal,\nfocused and\n\n246\n00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:29.297\ncoordinated approach to\nresponding to incidences, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:29.297 --> 00:13:33.840\nAnd this includes, of course,\nincident response plans that provide\n\n248\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.162\nthe roadmap for implementing\nthe incident response capability.\n\n249\n00:13:38.162 --> 00:13:41.152\nSo what they're saying is if\nyou have the capabilities,\n\n250\n00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:45.340\nyou should have a consistent plan to\nbe able to apply those capabilities.\n\n251\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.170\nMake sure it's actually done,\n\n252\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.780\nrecognizing the fact that every\norganization is unique, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.780\nAnd that, of course, changes due\nto these mission size, structure,\n\n254\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.370\nfunction of your organization,\nmakes sense here.\n\n255\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.230\nBut the plan itself should make sure\nthat we include the necessary resources,\n\n256\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.370\nas well as management support.\n\n257\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.180\nAnd include these following elements,\nokay?\n\n258\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.700\nSo, Zach, let's just talk about this\nidea of the following elements to\n\n259\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.530\nour instant response plan that we're\nactually gonna be talking about, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.850\nSo the first one that they show\nus here is the idea of a mission.\n\n261\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.361\nThis is where most of the time\nsomeone getting started and\n\n262\n00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:26.443\ntrying to build this up\ngets a little bit muddled.\n\n263\n00:14:26.443 --> 00:14:31.290\nThey do not know what the purpose of the\ninstant response team is going to be or\n\n264\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.818\nthe plan is going to be.\n\n265\n00:14:32.818 --> 00:14:36.111\nAnd it turns out just to\nbe a generalized security\n\n266\n00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:40.898\nacknowledgment that we have\nto pay attention to security.\n\n267\n00:14:40.898 --> 00:14:46.110\nWell, what NIST is trying to say is,\ncome up with a way and\n\n268\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.680\nwith a mission statement for your instant\nresponse to develop and to happen.\n\n269\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.132\nSo it may be where you don't have all of\nthe formalized structure where somebody\n\n270\n00:14:56.132 --> 00:14:58.191\ncan actually spend 24 hours a day or\n\n271\n00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:01.655\nactually their entire work\ndedicated to incident response.\n\n272\n00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:03.157\nBut it may be where you go in,\n\n273\n00:15:03.157 --> 00:15:07.724\nyou have a team of your professionals that\nyou're working with that they're actually\n\n274\n00:15:07.724 --> 00:15:11.058\npart of that Incident Response\nteam when an incident happens.\n\n275\n00:15:11.058 --> 00:15:15.970\nAnd you essentially just call them\nout of their regular work to do so.\n\n276\n00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.510\nBut you have to come up\nwith that direct mission\n\n277\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.290\nthat helps us to do a couple of things,\nokay?\n\n278\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.595\nThe first one is actually right here,\nthe goals and strategies.\n\n279\n00:15:24.595 --> 00:15:27.678\nSo not only do we need a mission\nstatement, essentially, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:30.023\nBut we also need to know\nwhat is the strategy,\n\n281\n00:15:30.023 --> 00:15:33.255\nwhich I don't know why that sounds\nfunny in my head as I say it.\n\n282\n00:15:33.255 --> 00:15:37.866\nBut the word strategy, okay,\nwe need actually strategies and\n\n283\n00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:43.089\ngoals for this particular plan, and\nwhat we hope it does for us, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:45.693\nNow the overall goal is simple, right?\n\n285\n00:15:45.693 --> 00:15:48.572\nWe want to essentially either prevent or\n\n286\n00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:52.307\nhandle incidences that\nactually end up happening.\n\n287\n00:15:52.307 --> 00:15:53.777\n&gt;&gt; Or block or stop.\n\n288\n00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:54.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, block or stop, yeah.\n\n289\n00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:58.830\nThe idea of prevention is where we're\nheading there, but if it does happen,\n\n290\n00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.147\nWe don't want this idea of, just now,\nten of us coming together or\n\n291\n00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:05.683\nfive of us coming together and saying,\nall right, what do we do next?\n\n292\n00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:07.973\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We wanna have an action plan in hand,\n\n293\n00:16:07.973 --> 00:16:12.480\nregardless of who's there, that we can\npull out a playbook if we need to, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.640\nOr, we can actually refer to a guiding\ndocument that will help us out to do this.\n\n295\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.531\nAnd it actually provides a strategy for\nus to actually formalize that and\n\n296\n00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:25.120\nto make it consistent between all\nthe team members as well, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.060\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n298\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.950\n&gt;&gt; So it is helpful when we\nhave both of those approaches.\n\n299\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.740\nOnce we do that, notice right here it\nsays an organizational approach to\n\n300\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.420\nincident response.\n\n301\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.490\nNow, this is a little bit more unusual.\n\n302\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.790\nWhat they're also saying is, don't\nthink of this as just being a technical\n\n303\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.210\nunderstanding of how to handle instances.\n\n304\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.970\nBut you may actually find out that\nyour organization has to take\n\n305\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.360\nan active part in it as well, so\neven the people that aren't involved.\n\n306\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.190\nSo let's take for an example,\nhere at ITProTV, even though Zach and\n\n307\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.380\nI are edutainers here at ITProTV,\n\n308\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.320\nwe have a whole production team that's\nactually supporting what we do.\n\n309\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.940\nWe have a whole marketing\nteam that's supporting us.\n\n310\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.779\nWe have a whole business development\nteam that's actually out there.\n\n311\n00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:12.073\nYou name it, we have a ton of\npeople that if an incident happens,\n\n312\n00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:16.160\nit's not just the responsibility of those\nthat are technically handling all of\n\n313\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.890\nthe capabilities there.\n\n314\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.950\nBut it may be where all of us have to\nget involved in some way, somehow.\n\n315\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.325\nAnd to have an organizational approach\nof saying, here's the incident\n\n316\n00:17:25.325 --> 00:17:28.938\nthat's happened, and then who needs to\nbe on board to get it working, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:28.938 --> 00:17:35.440\nSo it can't be where Zach goes, it's not\nmy responsibility, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n318\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.100\nSo here, they're emphasizing this idea\nthat you may actually have to have\n\n319\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.500\nbeyond your approach, or just having\ntechnical experts available to you, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.690\nSo that's the other one that\nwe also have here, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.400\nAlso, let's take a look here, how the\nincident response team will communicate\n\n322\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.640\nwith the rest of the organization,\nand with other organizations, too.\n\n323\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.511\nIf the incident is large enough, or deep\nenough, or damaging enough, depending on\n\n324\n00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:03.914\nwhat you need, you also need to make\nsure that everybody is on the same page.\n\n325\n00:18:03.914 --> 00:18:08.843\nAnd this handling of this communication,\nokay, it shouldn't come from everybody.\n\n326\n00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:13.250\nWe should kind of think about what\nis our plan of communicating that?\n\n327\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.101\nSo a great example, Zach, we were just\ntalking about this before the show.\n\n328\n00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:22.365\nAs of the recording of this show,\nright, a famous singer, okay,\n\n329\n00:18:22.365 --> 00:18:26.496\nat least yesterday, okay,\na famous singer was reported dead.\n\n330\n00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:29.025\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then through the evening,\n\n331\n00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:33.515\nwe found out maybe, but no,\nhe may still be hanging on.\n\n332\n00:18:33.515 --> 00:18:37.189\nAnd as of this morning,\nwe're actually getting reports of both.\n\n333\n00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:37.735\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:42.458\n&gt;&gt; Well, what's happening there is\nthere's not an organized way in\n\n335\n00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:46.520\nwhich the information is\ncoming from anybody official.\n\n336\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.978\nSo everybody's taking whatever they hear,\nand it's just getting passed along.\n\n337\n00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:54.945\nWell, in an incident that happens,\nespecially some type of security incident,\n\n338\n00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:56.447\nwe don't want that to happen.\n\n339\n00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:58.239\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Where one person says,\n\n340\n00:18:58.239 --> 00:18:59.550\nit's not that bad.\n\n341\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.550\nAnother person is screaming, my gosh,\nit's the worst thing that's ever done.\n\n342\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.150\nHave an approach, have a defined-\n&gt;&gt; Designated parties involved.\n\n343\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Something, yeah, some way that\nwe want to, that organizes us.\n\n344\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.600\nAnd then how do we also communicate\nwith others outside of the organization?\n\n345\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.700\nWe have partner teams,\n\n346\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.970\nwhatever it might be, that there\nhas to be some organization for it.\n\n347\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.465\nNot only, of course, is that necessary.\n\n348\n00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:27.135\nNotice that the other one that's also\nlisted here is the metrics as well.\n\n349\n00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:32.315\nSo the metrics for measuring the incident\nresponse capability and its effectiveness.\n\n350\n00:19:32.315 --> 00:19:35.024\nAnd that also tells us something else,\ntoo,\n\n351\n00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:37.745\nthat we also need to\njudge how it was handled.\n\n352\n00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:41.587\nSo Zach, let's just use the event\nthat we were talking about, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:41.587 --> 00:19:45.612\nIf you were to rate, and this is not\na highly technical rating, or anything.\n\n354\n00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:49.168\nBut Zach, on a scale of one to five,\nfive being highest, one being lowest,\n\n355\n00:19:49.168 --> 00:19:52.515\nin the news that we've received\nabout that famous singer, all right.\n\n356\n00:19:52.515 --> 00:19:57.044\nOkay, I'm not gonna mention him, cuz all\nof a sudden, he might still be alive, so\n\n357\n00:19:57.044 --> 00:19:58.354\nlet's do this, okay?\n\n358\n00:19:58.354 --> 00:20:00.815\nSo on the information,\nnow that you've heard all of it,\n\n359\n00:20:00.815 --> 00:20:03.034\nwhat would you judge that on,\nin terms of a metric?\n\n360\n00:20:03.034 --> 00:20:07.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, first of all,\nour thoughts and prayers are with them and\n\n361\n00:20:07.048 --> 00:20:08.079\ntheir families.\n\n362\n00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:12.226\nBut I would say three, because at one\nmoment, he's deceased, the next moment,\n\n363\n00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:13.501\nit's clinging to life.\n\n364\n00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:15.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The next moment is on life support,\n\n365\n00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:20.152\nthe next moment, off life support, so\nI mean, no, this is not handled well.\n\n366\n00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:24.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is not a criticism,\nin terms of the information,\n\n367\n00:20:24.552 --> 00:20:27.275\ncuz everybody gets their information.\n\n368\n00:20:27.275 --> 00:20:31.909\nBut how it was actually reported out,\nthat's what it's a criticism of, and\n\n369\n00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:35.129\nthen the way that the information\ngets distributed.\n\n370\n00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:40.059\nIf it's an incident that's gonna cost my\ncompany a little bit of its reputation,\n\n371\n00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:44.419\nor some money that has to be involved,\nwe want it to actually be something\n\n372\n00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:48.008\nthat's coherent and official,\nmore than anything else.\n\n373\n00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:50.315\n&gt;&gt; Coherent is a very important word.\n\n374\n00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.696\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n375\n00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:54.963\nthe idea of actually understanding\nthe metrics then behind that,\n\n376\n00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.545\nas well as the communication,\nis also key, right?\n\n377\n00:20:57.545 --> 00:21:01.651\nGiving a measurement of how an incident\nwas handled at that point may be\n\n378\n00:21:01.651 --> 00:21:05.699\nsomething, and absolutely is\nsomething that we want to learn from.\n\n379\n00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:08.814\nSo not only do we want the proper\nkind of team response, but\n\n380\n00:21:08.814 --> 00:21:12.704\nwe also want a metric for measuring\nhow we actually handle the response.\n\n381\n00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.747\nWe may find out that when we go and\n\n382\n00:21:14.747 --> 00:21:19.669\neverybody reported that there is a\nresponse, that we all gather together and\n\n383\n00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:23.246\nwe think that we're ready to\ndo our incident handling.\n\n384\n00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:25.691\nWe might find out it was\nreally nothing in the end.\n\n385\n00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:30.053\nWell, then how do we actually give\na measurement for how we responded to it,\n\n386\n00:21:30.053 --> 00:21:31.633\nhow quickly we responded?\n\n387\n00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:35.635\nWhatever we actually did is\nanother part of it as well, okay?\n\n388\n00:21:35.635 --> 00:21:40.225\nAlong with this, in terms of the element\nof the plan, is this idea of a roadmap for\n\n389\n00:21:40.225 --> 00:21:42.870\nmaturing the incident response capability.\n\n390\n00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.082\nNow, Zach, that's a lot of words\nto actually say something.\n\n391\n00:21:47.082 --> 00:21:51.198\nNow, Zach, think about what it says,\nroadmap for\n\n392\n00:21:51.198 --> 00:21:54.953\nmaturing the incident response capability.\n\n393\n00:21:54.953 --> 00:22:00.264\nOkay, so if we try to break that down,\nokay, let's think about this, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:00.264 --> 00:22:02.935\nMaturing the instant response capability,\nokay?\n\n395\n00:22:02.935 --> 00:22:04.993\nWell, what does that even mean, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:04.993 --> 00:22:09.560\nWell, that we want it to grow older,\nis that what it actually means here?\n\n397\n00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, the idea is,\n\n398\n00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:15.548\ncompared to what we have, what we've just\ndone, okay, how do we make it better?\n\n399\n00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:20.102\nI don't know why they chose to do that,\nbut essentially, it's the same thing.\n\n400\n00:22:20.102 --> 00:22:22.310\nIt's the idea of lessons learned.\n\n401\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.005\nWhat did we learn from this\nincident that makes the next time,\n\n402\n00:22:26.005 --> 00:22:29.789\nif something like this were to happen,\nhow do I make it better?\n\n403\n00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:31.163\nAnd notice how they describe it.\n\n404\n00:22:31.163 --> 00:22:34.262\nWhat we should end up with\nis a roadmap for doing so.\n\n405\n00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:36.906\nIt's not just,\nI should have done this, this time.\n\n406\n00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:40.726\nIt's like, what did we actually\nthink about while we were doing\n\n407\n00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:43.068\nthe incidents that we were doing here?\n\n408\n00:22:43.068 --> 00:22:47.083\nSo that we actually understand what is\nour path to actually making sure that,\n\n409\n00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:51.616\nas we handle the incident, that we're also\npreparing for the future at the same time?\n\n410\n00:22:51.616 --> 00:22:55.957\n&gt;&gt; It occurs to me, it's like a process\nusing the past, or history, as a gauge.\n\n411\n00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:56.633\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n412\n00:22:56.633 --> 00:22:58.996\n&gt;&gt; And it's exactly what it does, right?\n\n413\n00:22:58.996 --> 00:23:03.654\nCuz what we're trying to say is\ndon't just fling whatever thing\n\n414\n00:23:03.654 --> 00:23:07.544\nthat you know to do at it,\nand just go, hope it works.\n\n415\n00:23:07.544 --> 00:23:12.387\nOkay, the idea, of course, is try\nsomething, in a methodical approach,\n\n416\n00:23:12.387 --> 00:23:17.309\nthat leads you to actually being able to\ndo better the next time when something\n\n417\n00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:18.535\nhappens, right?\n\n418\n00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:22.084\nSo we're always, constantly\ntrying to improve our process, or\n\n419\n00:23:22.084 --> 00:23:25.762\nwe're trying to improve the actual\ntechnology that we're doing,\n\n420\n00:23:25.762 --> 00:23:28.616\nwhatever it is,\nthat there's a roadmap behind it.\n\n421\n00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:32.442\nIf we find out that we didn't have\nthe right technology in place, well,\n\n422\n00:23:32.442 --> 00:23:36.644\nit might be where, when we do end up now\nfinishing up and doing everything that we\n\n423\n00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:40.000\nwant to, we go, here's the technology\nthat we need in place.\n\n424\n00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.688\nOr, it may be where it's like,\n\n425\n00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:45.825\nwhat we really needed was somebody that\nhad more technical skill in this area.\n\n426\n00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:49.402\nAnd that might be where we have\nsomebody that's contracted to come in\n\n427\n00:23:49.402 --> 00:23:53.103\nif someone like this actually does appear,\nthat we can turn to and say,\n\n428\n00:23:53.103 --> 00:23:55.093\nhere's what needs to be done, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:55.093 --> 00:23:57.551\nSo you name it,\nthat's also another part of, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:57.551 --> 00:23:59.678\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Our last particular element here\n\n431\n00:23:59.678 --> 00:24:03.170\nthat we want to focus in on,\njust briefly, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:07.200\nIs how the program fits into\nthe overall organization.\n\n433\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.230\nNow, that's kind of a hefty thing here,\nokay?\n\n434\n00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.460\nIn other words, they're trying to tell\nus that the incident response that we\n\n435\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.900\nare trying to do, right,\nis not supposed to be just an addition.\n\n436\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.960\nIt's not an add-on.\n\n437\n00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.690\nIt's not a band-aid.\n\n438\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:28.370\nIt is a part of the overall\norganizational plan that we have in place,\n\n439\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.290\nand that it should be treated as that,\nokay?\n\n440\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.680\nAgain, just kind of a business\nworld approach, right?\n\n441\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.740\nIf you take this idea that if teams\nare getting their budgets raised, well,\n\n442\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.310\nthis is another one in which we might\nhave to think about, at the same time, of\n\n443\n00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.900\nsaying, okay, there's not a lot of change\nin terms of the people that are gone.\n\n444\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.990\nBut what do we actually need to\nconsider in the next year's budget for\n\n445\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.700\nsomeone like this if we need to?\n\n446\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.570\nSo, it's not just an add-on like,\nwe should've thought about that.\n\n447\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.010\nWe don't have any room for it.\n\n448\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.200\nBut the great thing is,\nit's only an add-on to our organization.\n\n449\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.210\nIt's trying to say that this idea of\nincident handling and response, right?\n\n450\n00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.680\nAnd the elements in our plan-.\n\n451\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it's a security best\npractices really, right, Ronnie?\n\n452\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it is part of those\nbest practices that we do need\n\n453\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.100\nto be aware of as well, okay?\n\n454\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.390\nSo those are kind of the basic elements,\nokay?\n\n455\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.550\nWhen we take a look at\nthis entire list here.\n\n456\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.370\nThat they really want us to\nmake sure that we know and\n\n457\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.490\nthat we understand that's gonna be\nincluded in an incident response plan.\n\n458\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.080\nNow when I say that, right, you can kind\nof condense this in a couple of ways here.\n\n459\n00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.362\nSo let me try to do that.\n\n460\n00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:38.030\nOkay, so here I've kinda condensed\nthe wording a little bit and\n\n461\n00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.510\nputting it into your own wording is\na way to get it into your head and\n\n462\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.550\nas what you want to be able to do, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.970\nSo, over here on the left-hand side,\nnotice I have Mission,\n\n464\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.820\nI have Strategies and Goals.\n\n465\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.290\nApproach, or Organizational Approach\nto the Incident Response.\n\n466\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.430\nIncident Response Team Coordination and\nCommunication Plan, IRT,\n\n467\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.930\nyou might see that abbreviation.\n\n468\n00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.675\nMetrics for Incident Response, IR is\nanother abbreviation, Capabilities and\n\n469\n00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:03.980\nits Effectiveness.\n\n470\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.080\nRoad map for maturing\nIncident Response Capabilities, and\n\n471\n00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.010\nhow the program fits into\nthe organization, okay.\n\n472\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.820\nNow, when you actually put\nall that together, and\n\n473\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.560\nyou kind of summarize it,\nyou're kind of identifying\n\n474\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.050\nwith these elements inside of your\nincident response plan, okay.\n\n475\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.000\nYou also want to be able to\nessentially break this up and\n\n476\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.190\nunderstand what they help you do.\n\n477\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.850\nSo, for example,\nI put a question out here to the side.\n\n478\n00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.560\nWhich two elements here help\nto determine the structure\n\n479\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.300\nof an organization's incident\nresponse capabilities?\n\n480\n00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:46.161\nNow, I'm using the actual language from\nwithin the actual NIST SP800-61R2 here.\n\n481\n00:26:46.161 --> 00:26:49.338\nBecause I want us to actually\nbe able to note something and\n\n482\n00:26:49.338 --> 00:26:52.713\nto actually kind of point out\nsomething as an exam hint here,\n\n483\n00:26:52.713 --> 00:26:57.320\nthat you may find yourself having to\nanswer questions very similar to this.\n\n484\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.060\nI can't tell you that this is a question\nthat you will answer on the exam.\n\n485\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna ask that.\n\n486\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it is actually\nsomething that you might find\n\n487\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.490\nvery similar which-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n488\n00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.270\nYou now have a whole list of options.\n\n489\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.180\nOptions A, B, C, D, E, F, G,\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n490\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.800\nYou might find yourself with\na whole bunch of options.\n\n491\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.280\nAnd you might actually be\nasked to choose either one or\n\n492\n00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.280\nmultiple answers here to answer\nquestions like this, okay?\n\n493\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.430\nSo when you start seeing that,\n\n494\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.230\nyou might be going,\nhow the heck do I figure that out?\n\n495\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.200\nWell, let me go back over here, and\nnow I wanna show you something.\n\n496\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.420\nAnd this is from reading the document,\nright?\n\n497\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.950\nOkay, so this is not from anything else,\nit's from reading the document.\n\n498\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.016\n&gt;&gt; Read the document.\n\n499\n00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:36.180\nVery important.\n&gt;&gt; Read the document, yep.\n\n500\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.350\nIt actually does help you out, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.050\nSo now once you have this,\nlet me see if I can highlight this.\n\n502\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.544\nJust a moment here, Zach.\n\n503\n00:27:43.544 --> 00:27:44.044\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n504\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.440\nOf course it's not highlighting.\n\n505\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.320\nWhy would it highlight?\n\n506\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.097\nSo there we go.\n\n507\n00:27:48.097 --> 00:27:49.040\n&gt;&gt; That would be too easy!\n\n508\n00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.023\n&gt;&gt; That would be silly, and easy to do.\n\n509\n00:27:54.718 --> 00:27:57.100\nSo now, [INAUDIBLE] it's not gonna do it.\n\n510\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.898\nFollow the arrow, is what we're gonna do.\n\n511\n00:27:58.898 --> 00:28:01.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n512\n00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:06.281\nThe organization's mission, strategies,\nand goals for incident response\n\n513\n00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:11.616\nshould help in determining the structure\nof the incident response capability.\n\n514\n00:28:11.616 --> 00:28:16.026\nWell, you can kind of see I was\nable to come up with question\n\n515\n00:28:16.026 --> 00:28:19.448\ndirectly from reading the document itself.\n\n516\n00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:21.857\nOkay, so it's not that, ooh, dang,\n\n517\n00:28:21.857 --> 00:28:26.614\nRonnie kind of just threw these one out\nthere and he pulled that out of the air.\n\n518\n00:28:26.614 --> 00:28:28.120\nIt's not that, right.\n\n519\n00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.150\nIt's from within the document itself\nthat you will find questions like this\n\n520\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.850\nthat tend to, and answer,\nthat's what it's actually doing.\n\n521\n00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.660\nIt's answering.\n\n522\n00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.490\nIt's saying, you have a whole\nlist of these elements over here.\n\n523\n00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.405\nWell, which two helped you determined\nthe structure at this point?\n\n524\n00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:46.580\nWell, I went back over here and I found\nthe answer in the very next paragraph\n\n525\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.280\nwhere it says mission,\nstrategies, and goals.\n\n526\n00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.847\nHelp me to determine the structure of\nthe organization's IR capabilities.\n\n527\n00:28:55.847 --> 00:28:58.320\n&gt;&gt; If you were gonna ask me, the first\none I was gonna choose is mission.\n\n528\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nNo that would.\n\n529\n00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.780\nYeah, it's kind of interesting when we\nstart seeing the elements like this, okay?\n\n530\n00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.580\nSo when you start to take a look at\nthis document, don't just go around,\n\n531\n00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.580\nRonnie just said,\nlook at this portion here.\n\n532\n00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.600\nIt's not just looking at a portion,\nit is showing you that there is a lot more\n\n533\n00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.320\nthat's actually right there\nthat can help you out.\n\n534\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.750\nAnd on this exam, especially,\nokay, you're not gonna get away\n\n535\n00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.962\nwithout you reading through this\ndocument and understanding it.\n\n536\n00:29:26.962 --> 00:29:29.820\nIt's gonna take you through it probably\na couple of times, believe it or\n\n537\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.550\nnot, in the way that we take a look at\nthe exam objectives that are laid out.\n\n538\n00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.400\nThere's no other way for you to do this\nbesides you knowing this document.\n\n539\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.873\nSo I wish I could tell you, here's\nthe simple things you've got to know, and\n\n540\n00:29:41.873 --> 00:29:44.451\nthere you go,\nyou don't have to worry about it anymore.\n\n541\n00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:45.847\nIt's not gonna be like that.\n\n542\n00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:49.405\nFor the exam you're gonna see probably\nmore questions than you think.\n\n543\n00:29:49.405 --> 00:29:52.783\nEspecially on something like this and\ndon't put it past them to do just\n\n544\n00:29:52.783 --> 00:29:56.059\nsomething like what I showed you\nright there, very easily as well.\n\n545\n00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:59.141\nNow, Zach, there is,\nI know this whole show.\n\n546\n00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:00.106\n&gt;&gt; Just touched the surface.\n\n547\n00:30:00.106 --> 00:30:02.868\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis whole show that we've done so far,\n\n548\n00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:06.683\nwe really only covered one of\nthose particular exam objectives.\n\n549\n00:30:06.683 --> 00:30:09.000\nAnd there's actually\na couple of them to go.\n\n550\n00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.539\nSo, Zach, we may actually\nhave to head into a part two,\n\n551\n00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:14.202\ncuz I notice that we're actually\nrunning low on time now.\n\n552\n00:30:14.202 --> 00:30:17.165\n&gt;&gt; And that's okay,\ncuz you're doing a marvelous job, Ronnie.\n\n553\n00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:19.862\nAnd it's very procedural, so\nwe have to take it step by step.\n\n554\n00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:22.086\nIncident response elements part two,\ncoming up.\n\n555\n00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.361\nYou've seen part one.\n\n556\n00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:24.518\nAnd of course,\n\n557\n00:30:24.518 --> 00:30:29.592\nthere is a whole bunch of videos you\ncan see in the CCNA sec op series.\n\n558\n00:30:29.592 --> 00:30:31.010\nMake sure you watch every one of them.\n\n559\n00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.566\nAnd in fact, visit our course

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:13.007\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.096\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.823\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nthis is CCNA's SECOPS and\n\n6\n00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:23.122\nIncident Response Elements Part 2.\n\n7\n00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:26.940\nAnd we're looking to our IT expert\nRonnie Wong for some answers.\n\n8\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.233\nRonnie tell us what we need to know.\n\n9\n00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Zach, well thank you\nagain for having me back on the show as we\n\n10\n00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:36.770\ncontinue on taking a look at\nthe idea of incident response here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.019\nAnd we are basing this off, of course, of\nthe NIST Special Publication SP 800-61 R2.\n\n12\n00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.742\nAnd we've already talked in\nprevious episode at least on taking\n\n13\n00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:51.120\na look at the elements inside\nof an incident response plan.\n\n14\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.603\nAnd we're now going to still be\ntalking about that a little bit, but\n\n15\n00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.200\nin a different manner as well.\n\n16\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.217\nAnd so now we're actually taking\na look at, well, the procedures or\n\n17\n00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:03.485\nthe categories that we also\nfind in incident response.\n\n18\n00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.900\nAnd that's what we need to address\nnow as we continue to move forward.\n\n19\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.020\n&gt;&gt; And so as I understand it Ronnie,\n\n20\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.700\nwe're gonna be looking at steps\nof analysis maybe up front?\n\n21\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.834\n&gt;&gt; We are, we're gonna of course make sure\nthat we understand that now that we have\n\n22\n00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.140\na response plan in hand.\n\n23\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.936\nIt means that different elements are gonna\nhappen when we deal with the incidents\n\n24\n00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:22.815\nthemselves.\n\n25\n00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n&gt;&gt; And that's gonna be important.\n\n26\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.682\nSo if we think about the idea, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:32.810\nThat now that we have a plan ready to go,\nokay?\n\n28\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.155\nOur hope of course is that we really\ndon't ever have to deal with it,\n\n29\n00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:39.442\nas far as it being an after the fact or\n\n30\n00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:43.440\nbeing a mitigation in a response\nto an ongoing attack, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.673\nThat's the whole goal,\nis that we just set up everything so\n\n32\n00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.100\nthat we don't ever really have to do it.\n\n33\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But what happens if we need to do it?\n\n34\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.980\nWhat happens when we have to make\nsure that everything is going wrong?\n\n35\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.367\nWell, this is where we step up and\nwe start to take a look and\n\n36\n00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:06.023\nfind some guidance inside of that\nSP 800-61 that is going to help us.\n\n37\n00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:10.327\nAnd also using some of those elements\nthat we saw in the previous episode and\n\n38\n00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.078\nthat we talked about and discussed.\n\n39\n00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:16.920\nThat that's gonna help us to make sure\nthat we are also ready to do what\n\n40\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770\nwe need to do.\n\n41\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.530\nSo in that particular sense, right?\n\n42\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.570\nWe wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at the actual SP 800 here.\n\n43\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.368\nAnd I'll show you a diagram and\nwhat we're actually gonna be doing, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:28.966\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So here on my screen,\n\n45\n00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:32.970\nthis is actually the incident\nresponse life cycle.\n\n46\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.250\nThis is directly from\nthe Special Publication\n\n47\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.970\nthat we've been mentioning here.\n\n48\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.160\nAnd we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand these elements in particular.\n\n49\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.720\nI was gonna actually remake this diagram.\n\n50\n00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.470\nI was like, well,\nit's actually right there and\n\n51\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.900\nI'm showing the actual diagram, so=\n&gt;&gt; It's very pretty too.\n\n52\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's actually much better than\nwhat I could actually have ever made.\n\n53\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.005\nAnd let's make sure we understand\nthe element and then we'll go back,\n\n54\n00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.440\ndo little more breakdown these kind\nof concepts just a little bit.\n\n55\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.098\nAnd we'll talk about what we need to\nunderstand about the elements and\n\n56\n00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:02.240\nthe way that these all fit\ntogether as well, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.025\nWhen an incident happens, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:10.490\nOur response needs to also happen in terms\nof what we consider a life cycle, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.830\nIt is not just a punch, counter punch\nidea that we are dealing with here, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.970\nAn incidence happens, we respond,\nand that's pretty much it, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.750\nThe whole goal behind this, right?\n\n62\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.150\nIs to make sure that we talk about\nthose elements once again, or\n\n63\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.570\nto meet those elements, those goals, and\nthose strategies that we've talked about.\n\n64\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.880\nEnsure that our purpose is actually there,\nand that we're maintaining it,\n\n65\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.770\nas well as to have that uniform\nresponse to whatever we do.\n\n66\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.650\nSo here,\neverything that we do in incident response\n\n67\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.435\nhappens in terms of a life cycle that\nhopefully we can learn from as well, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:48.500\nSo here's how the initial reaction begins,\nokay?\n\n69\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.581\nIf we do come across a security event that\n\n70\n00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:57.391\nrequires us to handle it as an incident,\nokay?\n\n71\n00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:02.053\nWe now take all the preparation work\nthat we've been doing for a long time,\n\n72\n00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:06.345\nwhen we said here's what we want to\ndo to make sure that we are ready for\n\n73\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.710\neverything, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.510\nSo we take all that, and\nnotice here in the green box,\n\n75\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.480\nwe now put it into action with this\narrow as it moves through, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.990\nAt that point the real work of incident\nresponse really begins to happen here.\n\n77\n00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.990\nAnd these middle two types of analysis\nsituations that we're really talking\n\n78\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.990\nabout, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.300\nThe detection and\nthe analysis portion of this,\n\n80\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.020\neven though you might put them\nin order to detect first and\n\n81\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.390\nthen analyze, they just group\nit together right here, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.430\nSo the goal here is simple.\n\n83\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.570\nWe detect it, we try and\nfigure out what's actually happening here.\n\n84\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.349\nWe break it down to it's components and\n\n85\n00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.993\nthen we come up with what we can\ndo to either contain what happens.\n\n86\n00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:53.992\nAnd we might find out that that's actually\nthe situation that we want so that we can\n\n87\n00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:58.991\nevaluate a little bit more and to try and\nunderstand what has actually occurred and\n\n88\n00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.370\nwho the bad actors are in this\nparticular incident that goes on.\n\n89\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.270\nIt may be where we just need to get\nrid of it, the eradication part, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.300\nBut we also might need to determine,\nof course, the damage and\n\n91\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.740\nrecover from that damage as well.\n\n92\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.630\nWe might find out something, that our\ninitial response in terms of containment\n\n93\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.410\ndid not do everything, but actually\ngave us at least a hint on what to do.\n\n94\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.070\nSo we start that process over for\nthe next part if we need to.\n\n95\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.960\nWe continue to go through this\ncycle right here in the center\n\n96\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.730\nuntil we are completely satisfied.\n\n97\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.140\nThat we have actually either contained\neverything that we need to eradicate it.\n\n98\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.590\nAnd we have our process of recovery.\n\n99\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.390\nSo that we can get back to\nthe productivity that we need within our\n\n100\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.820\norganization, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.610\nSo all that actually does end up working,\nand when we are satisfied at that point,\n\n102\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.310\nthat allows us then to move onto\nthe post incident activities.\n\n103\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.230\nAnd this is where we start\nto actually reevaluate or\n\n104\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.420\ndebrief on the actual\nsituation that we're facing.\n\n105\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.650\nTaking a look at the elements of\nthe idea of lessons learned, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.110\nAnd who is involved and\nwho needs to know what?\n\n107\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.300\nEssentially for us here and what we're\nseeing here in the entire lifecycle.\n\n108\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.324\nIt is a projectized response,\nis what we're looking for, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:22.674\nAnd the whole goal behind that projectized\nresponse is that it makes it simple and\n\n110\n00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.060\neasy for a couple of things to happen.\n\n111\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.470\nOne, let's say that Zach and\n\n112\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.550\nI are on an incident response team along\nwith three or four other people, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.940\nAnd we've actually been the ones to put\nit together and the preparation time,\n\n114\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.720\nall that we put together, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.120\nActually does work and\nwe've all been heavily involved.\n\n116\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.960\nBy projectizing this and\n\n117\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.950\nactually providing solid foundational\nlife cycle steps here, Zach or\n\n118\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.140\nI could leave the company or end up being\nmoved off of that incident response team.\n\n119\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.079\nSomebody else can actually\ntake our place and\n\n120\n00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.262\nstill follow this process through\nwith whatever has happened.\n\n121\n00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:03.643\nSo it doesn't break the continuity\nof service that we have\n\n122\n00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:06.590\nin terms of responding to the incidents.\n\n123\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.442\nIf it's just about me seeing it or\nZach seeing it?\n\n124\n00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:12.560\nAn incident happens,\nZach sees it right then.\n\n125\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.940\nAnd then he goes let me\njust fix it right then and\n\n126\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.340\nhe never mentions it\nagain to anybody else?\n\n127\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.295\nWell I can't go back and reproduce that.\n\n128\n00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:21.480\nZach can say yeah, I did.\n\n129\n00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.290\nWhat did I do?\n\n130\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.180\nLet me remember what I tried to do here.\n\n131\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me try and fix that.\n\n132\n00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:29.339\nZach, you've probably never had that\nhappen where you actually fix something\n\n133\n00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:33.650\nand then you kinda go no I don't remember\nwhat I did to fix it but it's working now.\n\n134\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.935\n&gt;&gt; Forgot the steps, right?\n\n135\n00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:36.225\nI forgot the steps [LAUGH].\n\n136\n00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:38.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you knew that you fixed it.\n\n137\n00:07:38.775 --> 00:07:40.505\nBut you forgot what\nthe steps were to do so.\n\n138\n00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:43.945\nBy projectizing this,\nessentially is what we're doing here,\n\n139\n00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:47.955\nit really allows us to essentially be able\nto replace those elements to do that.\n\n140\n00:07:47.955 --> 00:07:51.028\nThe other thing is it makes\nramp up time quicker.\n\n141\n00:07:51.028 --> 00:07:54.000\nWhoever Zach or\nI are replaced with, right?\n\n142\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.311\nIt's not that they have to actually obtain\nevery bit of knowledge that we have as As\n\n143\n00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:02.559\nfeeble as it is, the amount of knowledge\nthat you and I combined may have in this,\n\n144\n00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:04.390\nit allows them to ramp up quicker.\n\n145\n00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.260\nWhy?\nBecause\n\n146\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.900\nwe're actually feeding the process,\nwe're not feeding\n\n147\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.100\na special little secret sauce that only I\nhave access to or that Zack has access to.\n\n148\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.420\nIt is about the entire process itself.\n\n149\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.500\nSo that's why we want to make sure\nthat we follow something like this\n\n150\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.560\nas we continue to move forward from there.\n\n151\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.500\nSo understanding those,\nand notice that I'm not\n\n152\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.490\ngoing into any real detail about any one\nof those in particular at this point, but\n\n153\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.050\njust kinda realize that each one does\nhave steps that are involved in it.\n\n154\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.890\nAnd the only way that they're\ngonna find out about it, Zack,\n\n155\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.090\nI mentioned it in the previous episode.\n\n156\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.330\nHow are they gonna find out about all\nthe details in these steps here with\n\n157\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.170\nthis document?\n\n158\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.395\n&gt;&gt; They have to read the document.\n\n159\n00:08:47.395 --> 00:08:50.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very importante.\n\n160\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is the only way, there is\nno other way that I can tell you that.\n\n161\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.220\nYou're gonna gain all the knowledge\nfrom just this one diagram here but\n\n162\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.110\nwhat you gonna do though is you're gonna\nuse this to help you guys as you move\n\n163\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.270\nthrough the document to find those\nimportant elements that are gonna be key\n\n164\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.150\nto your instant responses,\nyou continue to more forward.\n\n165\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.320\nNow the other part of this that\nwe also needed to take a look at\n\n166\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.660\nIs where did those elements that we\ntalked about earlier fit into this idea?\n\n167\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.370\nSo let's go back to my screen just for\na moment.\n\n168\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.400\nI just switched over to\nmy simple diagram here.\n\n169\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.900\nSo here's the actual steps kind\nof stripped out of that nice,\n\n170\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.610\npretty diagram that we were\njust looking at, right?\n\n171\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.940\nThe preparation, detection and analysis,\ncontainment and eradication and\n\n172\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.328\nrecovery, post-incident analysis.\n\n173\n00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:39.913\nOkay?\n\n174\n00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:44.420\nWell, I need to make sure that I\ncan take these elements here and\n\n175\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.500\nactually know where they do fit\nin to these categories as well.\n\n176\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.050\nAnd so\nhow is it that I break those down and\n\n177\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:58.680\nthat I kind of assign them to each one and\nto each element that we think about.\n\n178\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.630\nSo the way that it's actually easier\nin terms of what I can do here\n\n179\n00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.590\nis it's a tabular form is the easiest\nway that I know how to do this.\n\n180\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:14.080\nI'm going to make a column for\npreparation, detection and analysis,\n\n181\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.750\ncontainment eradication recovery,\nand post-instance analysis as well.\n\n182\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.860\nNow, at the very beginning here,\nlet me tell you something and\n\n183\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.580\nI think it's going to make sense.\n\n184\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.460\nIn terms of preparation, all of\nthese follow underneath preparation.\n\n185\n00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n\n186\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they all follow\nunderneath preparation, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.860\nSo we know that that's kind\nof the common element.\n\n188\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.750\nWe could put every single one\nof them underneath preparation.\n\n189\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.910\nBut if we do, that doesn't really actually\nleave very much room to be able to break\n\n190\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.090\ndown, and to try to figure out where\nthe elements actually are involved\n\n191\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.900\nin these other three elements as well.\n\n192\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.200\nSo we know that every single one\nof them can actually be over here.\n\n193\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.440\nSo let me do something here, and I'm going\nto say, this actually involves everything.\n\n194\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.140\nSo all, oops.\n\n195\n00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.314\nMove the text box so we can see it.\n\n196\n00:11:07.383 --> 00:11:14.119\nAll elements, that'll make it easy, cuz\nI don't wanna type them all over again.\n\n197\n00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:15.419\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:16.734\n&gt;&gt; Is what I don't want to do, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:18.470\n&gt;&gt; No, we wanna see you type everything.\n\n200\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be silly,\nyeah, for me,\n\n201\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.070\nbecause my typing is just as bad\nas anything else that we have.\n\n202\n00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.160\nBut in the preparation time when we start\ntalking about every elements included,\n\n203\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.420\nthat's what really included\nin the preparation.\n\n204\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.650\nEverything that we can do up until that\npoint that we believe that we've handled\n\n205\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.590\nright way, or that we're going to handle,\n\n206\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.450\nit all is involved there in\nterms of the procedures or\n\n207\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.240\nthe categories, and I think the actual\ndocument calls them categories.\n\n208\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.680\nI just call them procedures though.\n\n209\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.780\nHere, categories, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.720\nSo when we start to take a look then, and\nwe start to move down here, okay, right.\n\n211\n00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.200\nSo let's kind of go over the preparation\njust a little bit as well,\n\n212\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.580\nto make sure that we understand\nwhat's happening in this one, and\n\n213\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.220\nthen all of the elements\nthat are involved.\n\n214\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.020\nSo during the preparation,\nin terms of the analysis or\n\n215\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.880\nin terms of the details\nof handling an incident,\n\n216\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.840\nthat preparation time is actually\ndesigned to help us to do two things.\n\n217\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.740\nOne, of course, is to prepare to\nhandle the incidences that may happen.\n\n218\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.200\nAnd then, secondly, is to try and prevent\nas many incidences from happening as well.\n\n219\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.980\nAnd that involves limiting scope,\nlimiting access points.\n\n220\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.920\nTaking a look at attack vectors.\n\n221\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.900\nYou name it,\nbecause all this is actually possible.\n\n222\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.650\nSo when we start to take a look at all\nthose elements, right, the preparation,\n\n223\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.050\nit really does, it involves every\nsingle thing that we talked about here.\n\n224\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n225\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.685\nthat's why we're actually\ngoing to key in on that.\n\n226\n00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:39.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n227\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.330\nnow as we move towards detection and\nanalysis, this is like I said,\n\n228\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.040\nwhere the real grunt work of\nincident response comes in.\n\n229\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.220\nThis is where we might start taking\na look at things like the attack vectors\n\n230\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.930\nthat are open to my company, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.300\nWhere do people attack us,\nwhere can they attack us,\n\n232\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.210\nwhat are things that we haven't considered\nthat might be a potential vulnerability,\n\n233\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.780\nor an exploit that they\ncan take advantage of?\n\n234\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.030\nThese are some of the things we\nneed to discover about our company\n\n235\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.880\nduring this detection analysis side, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.210\nThe second part of this actually becomes\na littler more difficult in terms of what\n\n237\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.180\ndetection analysis involves.\n\n238\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.810\nWe're now looking for\nwhat we call signs of compromise or\n\n239\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.320\nindicators of compromise as well.\n\n240\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.950\nAnd there's actually a couple\nof issues here too, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.220\nThe very fact is simple.\n\n242\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.770\nSome attacks, Zach,\nare really very easy to spot.\n\n243\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n245\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.600\nAll of a sudden, you go, that's an attack\nand they're fairly easy to respond.\n\n246\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.590\nSome though, they're almost\nimpossible to actually spot, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.200\nUntil it's actually happening right then.\n\n248\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.780\nSo you might see where there's some signs\nthat an attack could have occurred, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.720\nYou might see sometimes, there's signs\nin which there's no signs at all.\n\n250\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.767\nAnd even after it's over,\nthere's none at all that it's there.\n\n251\n00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.611\nSo some are very easy to spot.\n\n252\n00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:05.122\nSome are very difficult to spot as well.\n\n253\n00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:10.310\nWhen you start having to deal with that,\nhow do you actually detect things\n\n254\n00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.258\nlike that on such an entire scale and\nrange of detection and analysis?\n\n255\n00:14:15.258 --> 00:14:16.935\nIt's very difficult to ever do.\n\n256\n00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:21.365\nFor example, a spoofing attack that\ncan end up happening on network,\n\n257\n00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.570\nthe person does what he does.\n\n258\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.180\nIf he spoofs it correctly, you may\nnever know once the attack is over.\n\n259\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.710\nIn other words,\nif all of a sudden the attack stops,\n\n260\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.130\ndid the person actually do what he\nwanted to, or did he not do that?\n\n261\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:34.770\nYou don't really know,\n\n262\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.020\na lot of times it actually takes you\ncatching it in the act of what it's doing.\n\n263\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.200\nOther signs, such as somebody leaving.\n\n264\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:48.870\nAdding in elements of a back door into\na particular machine, for example.\n\n265\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.720\nYou find this strange account\non the computer and you go, hey,\n\n266\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.700\nKevin's account wasn't?\n\n267\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.695\nThere's nobody that works\nhere that's named Kevin!\n\n268\n00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:55.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n269\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.670\nthat may actually kind of indicate,\nand that's fairly easy to spot,\n\n270\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.020\nwhen you start doing interesting\nelements like that as well.\n\n271\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.270\nSo when you start to see things like that,\n\n272\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.190\nwell there are some elements that we\ncan actually kind of bring up here\n\n273\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.050\nthat make sure that we can\nassociate with that as well.\n\n274\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.000\nIn that detection and\nthat analysis part of what we do,\n\n275\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.180\nwe may want to take a look at this idea of\nthe communication and coordination, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.020\nAs being part of that detection and\nanalysis, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.680\nAnd that is because it does,\n\n278\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.660\nit may actually require us\nto coordinate with others.\n\n279\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.962\nAs well as communicate that an attack\nhas gone one, and that everything\n\n280\n00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:40.692\nis actually not, I may not have all the\nknowledge that I need to get it done, but\n\n281\n00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:44.155\nit's right here that we can\nalso add that in here as well.\n\n282\n00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:49.462\nThe other part that we can also\nadd as we detect and analyze,\n\n283\n00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:55.090\nis the road map for maturing,\nthe instant response capability\n\n284\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:16:00.742\ninformation response So\nthe instant response capabilities.\n\n285\n00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:03.280\nSo both of these can fall\nunderneath the analysis.\n\n286\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.490\nNow there's not a clear and\ndefined category.\n\n287\n00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.510\nIt doesn't fit neatly into a box.\n\n288\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.595\nBut it is here, too.\n\n289\n00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:12.745\nBecause I can also see Roadmap for\nmaturing coming underneath\n\n290\n00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:18.100\nPost-Incident Analysis, after everything's\ndone, realizing we should have had this.\n\n291\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.260\nAnd then getting that back on hand,\nI could see that as well.\n\n292\n00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.055\nBut let's just put it right here and\nwhen we need to copy,\n\n293\n00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:26.630\nwe'll actually copy it again\nwhen we see so as well.\n\n294\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.478\nAll right, so\n\n295\n00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:32.500\nthat is another aspect of something\nthat we can also take a look at, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.850\nNow the Containment,\nEradication, Recovery,\n\n297\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:41.980\nthis is really the action plan that we now\nput in place after our detection analysis.\n\n298\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.950\nHow do we deal with the incident itself,\nin terms of containment, and\n\n299\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.400\nof course, in terms of the recovery and\nthe eradication?\n\n300\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.290\nNow this is a little bit unusual in\nthe very fact that when we start to\n\n301\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.030\nlook at this one, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.216\nWell, for us, this probably actually\nbegan, let me make sure I'm telling that\n\n303\n00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:07.151\nright, okay, with the strategies and\nthe goals, That we\n\n304\n00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:11.794\nhad set up from the very beginning that we\nhad to have a strategy for containment or\n\n305\n00:17:11.794 --> 00:17:16.730\neradication, and even our recovery\nafter the event that we might have.\n\n306\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.481\nAnd then the other one\nthat I also put here,\n\n307\n00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:24.156\nmaking sure I'm telling you the right\none here, is the metrics, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:24.156 --> 00:17:25.860\nCan I tell very easily, or\n\n309\n00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:31.970\ndo I have something that allows me to know\nthat I've handled this effectively, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.637\nSo I can even see that one also going\nthere as well, and that kinda leaves me\n\n311\n00:17:36.637 --> 00:17:41.552\nwith these three, okay, that we can also\ntake a look at and do as well, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:41.552 --> 00:17:45.336\nNow notice that the Organizational\napproach to IR, remember that all this\n\n313\n00:17:45.336 --> 00:17:49.690\nactually does fall, so all the elements\ndo fall underneath Preparation.\n\n314\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.980\nBut it's over here that we might also\ntake a look at the fit of our program.\n\n315\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.014\nSo did everything fit nicely\ninto the organization\n\n316\n00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.867\nthe way that we thought it did?\n\n317\n00:18:03.867 --> 00:18:08.804\nIf not, we may have to actually\ntake a look at the overall\n\n318\n00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:13.229\nmission as well as the approach\nthat we have to IR.\n\n319\n00:18:13.229 --> 00:18:15.119\nWe might find out that the answer and\n\n320\n00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:19.460\nresponse we had was totally inadequate\nto what we were actually facing.\n\n321\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.530\nWe might find out that we\nwere really not on mission.\n\n322\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.510\nWe might find out that what we\nthought was actually a good fit,\n\n323\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.150\ndidn't turn out to be a good fit at all,\nokay.\n\n324\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.330\nSo all those are possible elements that\nwe can actually bring in and be able to\n\n325\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.610\ncategorize those elements underneath the\nway that these categories are listed for\n\n326\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:42.890\nus inside of SP 800-61 that could\nalso help us out here, too.\n\n327\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.300\nSo there's a lot of information\nhere as we start to take a look\n\n328\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.850\nat what we're looking at, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.260\nSo with that in mind,\n\n330\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.400\nnow comes the important part that\nwe also have to think about, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.520\nAll this works, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.700\nSo we're seeing how the planning comes\ntogether and how it actually can break\n\n333\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.970\ndown even into each of these elements and\nthese spots that we're talking about.\n\n334\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.730\nBut what makes this all work, though,\n\n335\n00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.698\nZach, is the people that are involved,\nokay?\n\n336\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.655\nSo who's actually going to be involved\nin these particular elements as we\n\n337\n00:19:18.655 --> 00:19:20.514\nstart to take a look at them?\n\n338\n00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:26.116\nNow Zach, this is where I'm\ngonna go back to the SPA 800-61,\n\n339\n00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:31.250\nand this is where it is a little\nbit more where you have to read.\n\n340\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.290\nIt's not gonna list out, except in one\nsection where it's gonna list out certain\n\n341\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.410\nthings, but it's not gonna list out who's\nactually involved in every element.\n\n342\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:44.515\nThe only place that it does it, right,\nis in those paragraphs in between, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:44.515 --> 00:19:47.361\n&gt;&gt; A-ha!\n&gt;&gt; So in other words, you have to read it.\n\n344\n00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:48.610\n&gt;&gt; You have to read it, yeah.\n\n345\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.861\nIt's important to read the black\npart not the white part.\n\n346\n00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:51.917\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.367\n&gt;&gt; Yes, trying to read the white part\n\n348\n00:19:53.367 --> 00:19:55.700\nwould probably hurt your\nbrain a little bit more.\n\n349\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.140\nNow I'm gonna scroll\ndown here toward the end.\n\n350\n00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.316\nAnd the reason why I want to do\nthat is I want to get into the,\n\n351\n00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:05.974\nwhat are they called, appendices.\n\n352\n00:20:05.974 --> 00:20:08.330\nI was like what is the word for\nthat thing?\n\n353\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.460\nIt's called the appendix here.\n\n354\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.630\nLet me make sure here.\n\n355\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.440\n&gt;&gt; You emphasized to begin with, very\nimportant that you read the appendices.\n\n356\n00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you wanna make sure that\nyou read the appendices here.\n\n357\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.890\nAnd if I can get to it,\nwhich I should see fairly soon.\n\n358\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.880\nI'm trying to make sure.\n\n359\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.380\nThere it is.\n\n360\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.200\nYep, there we go, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:33.018\nSo here under Appendix A,\nIncident Handling Scenarios, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:37.060\nWe do have in exam objectives where we'll\ntalk about this later on a little bit\n\n363\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.406\nmore, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:38.406 --> 00:20:41.451\nBut I want you to take a look\nat these scenario questions,\n\n365\n00:20:41.451 --> 00:20:43.805\nespecially as you start to prepare, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:45.188\nAnd you're gonna notice something.\n\n367\n00:20:45.188 --> 00:20:48.158\nIt's not gonna give you the answer\nthat you want me to give you,\n\n368\n00:20:48.158 --> 00:20:50.460\nwhich is just tell me\nwhat you want me to know.\n\n369\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.800\nAnd I can't do that.\n\n370\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.670\nYou have to read this document to\nmake sure that you can get it.\n\n371\n00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.540\nBut make sure you do read through this.\n\n372\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.270\nAnd they even have scenarios\nafter these questions here.\n\n373\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.590\nBut underneath each one of these,\nnotice how it divided it up, Zach,\n\n374\n00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.190\nPreparation, Detection and\nAnalysis, Containment,\n\n375\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:15.020\nEradication and Recovery,\nPost-Incident Activities.\n\n376\n00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.130\nZach, does that sound familiar,\nthose categories?\n\n377\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.260\n&gt;&gt; It sounds very familiar.\n\n378\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange how they chose to\ngo, here's how you handle a scenario,\n\n379\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.210\nand here's some general questions that\nyou might ask in this scenario, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.950\nSo in this particular exam objectives\nthat we're talking about at this point,\n\n381\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.920\nit's saying, look, who are the\nstakeholders that are essentially involved\n\n382\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.800\nin each of these elements, right?\n\n383\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.310\nAt each one,\n\n384\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.360\neach of these particular categories\nhere is what we're seeing, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.320\n&gt;&gt; So you might find out and\nwe'll kinda take a look at this first one.\n\n386\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.330\nNotice the actual interrogative here.\n\n387\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.160\nNow if you're going, Ronnie,\nyou're going into some grammatical terms.\n\n388\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.241\nThe first words, right?\n\n389\n00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:57.050\nWould, okay, what, all right?\n\n390\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.180\nWho, what, where-\n&gt;&gt; When, where.\n\n391\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Who, we started with who, right, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Who.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n393\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.520\n&gt;&gt; So notice that in the preparation\nit doesn't emphasize who.\n\n394\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.320\nSo let's come back to that one.\n\n395\n00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.210\nAs I scroll down through here, okay,\n\n396\n00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.420\nI might find,\nlook at this question number 5.\n\n397\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.332\nTo which people and\ngroups within the organization, okay,\n\n398\n00:22:20.332 --> 00:22:23.329\nwould the team report the incident?\n\n399\n00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:26.167\nAnd notice here, Zach,\nit kind of helps me out a little bit.\n\n400\n00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:30.560\nIt says Section 3.27.\n\n401\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.075\nI wonder, Zach,\nif I needed to find out who was involved\n\n402\n00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:39.881\nas a stakeholder in detection and\nanalysis, if I could find\n\n403\n00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:43.234\nthe answer by maybe reading-\n&gt;&gt; 3.27.\n\n404\n00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:44.369\n&gt;&gt; Section 3.27.\n\n405\n00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:45.426\n&gt;&gt; I believe so, Ronnie.\n\n406\n00:22:45.426 --> 00:22:47.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I get the jist of that jib.\n\n407\n00:22:47.597 --> 00:22:50.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou're starting to see some elements here.\n\n408\n00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:53.525\nNow Ronnie, you're probably saying,\njust tell them no,\n\n409\n00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:57.355\nbecause a part of this is you having\nto actually read it and find it.\n\n410\n00:22:57.355 --> 00:23:00.080\nThat's how I read it and\nthat's how I found it, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.320\nSo you have to do the work here.\n\n412\n00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, keeps you up many nights late,\nvery late.\n\n413\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so you can also see under\nContainment and Eradication.\n\n414\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.580\nMake sure I'm telling you here.\n\n415\n00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.752\nYep, there's actually\na couple of them as well.\n\n416\n00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:18.850\nZach, number 4.\n\n417\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.255\nLook, which personnel would be involved?\n\n418\n00:23:22.255 --> 00:23:27.228\n[LAUGH] So Zach, I'm hoping you're kinda\nseeing that the personnel involved in this\n\n419\n00:23:27.228 --> 00:23:28.840\nmight be a stakeholder?\n\n420\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would think so.\n\n421\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.910\n&gt;&gt; I would think so as well.\n\n422\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n423\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.620\nI don't know if I could find exactly\nwhere I might find that information or\n\n424\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.750\nnot but I think that yeah,\nthey're kinda helping me out here.\n\n425\n00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.140\n&gt;&gt; It's quite possible\nthat it's right there.\n\n426\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.130\n&gt;&gt; It might just be there for you to\nbe able to actually find out as well.\n\n427\n00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.851\nOkay, now look at this one, Zach.\n\n428\n00:23:47.851 --> 00:23:51.307\nOn post-incident activity, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:51.307 --> 00:23:55.501\nWho would actually attend lesson learned?\n\n430\n00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:56.677\nA stakeholder, I think.\n\n431\n00:23:56.677 --> 00:23:58.149\n&gt;&gt; A stakeholder.\n&gt;&gt; A stakeholder, okay?\n\n432\n00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:00.643\nSo you can find this out.\n\n433\n00:24:00.643 --> 00:24:05.308\nYou can actually take a look at this\nparticular, especially the append.\n\n434\n00:24:05.308 --> 00:24:07.702\nSo see why I am the size\nof the appendix now.\n\n435\n00:24:07.702 --> 00:24:08.272\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n436\n00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:12.364\n&gt;&gt; Why it can really help you\nto figure this document out and\n\n437\n00:24:12.364 --> 00:24:17.170\nyou can see how it can help you\nin getting ready for the exam.\n\n438\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.430\nBut this document really is foundational.\n\n439\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.299\nAnd this is,\n\n440\n00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:25.132\nlike I said at the beginning of\nthe previous episode that we did, right?\n\n441\n00:24:25.132 --> 00:24:28.390\nWhen I said, there's no way you\nare gonna get by without reading this,\n\n442\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.200\ncuz it's interwoven in the document.\n\n443\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.270\nIt just doesn't say a list.\n\n444\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.634\nNow, one of them actually has a whole\nlist there that you could write out.\n\n445\n00:24:34.634 --> 00:24:37.420\nBut I'm not gonna point that out,\nbut you can kinda see that.\n\n446\n00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.119\nAnd there's only one thing, now let\nme see if I can point this one out,\n\n447\n00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:42.013\ncuz I do want to.\n\n448\n00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.496\nLet me make sure I'm\ntelling you the right one.\n\n449\n00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:48.134\nSo we're gonna go to 3.27,\nlike Zack pointed out here.\n\n450\n00:24:48.134 --> 00:24:50.515\nAnd instant notification,\nright here, okay.\n\n451\n00:24:50.515 --> 00:24:53.310\nSo here's the one place I lied, Zack,\n\n452\n00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:58.327\nhere is a list of them right here,\nokay, that we have available to us.\n\n453\n00:24:58.327 --> 00:25:01.755\nNow, I'm not gonna read the whole list cuz\nyou don't need me to read the whole list,\n\n454\n00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:02.490\nthis right here.\n\n455\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.799\nIt's in the document that, hopefully,\nyou've downloaded by now and\n\n456\n00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:07.797\nthat you're able to look through as well.\n\n457\n00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:12.256\nAnd you can see that I learned this 3.27\nfrom what we actually just looked at in\n\n458\n00:25:12.256 --> 00:25:13.510\nthe appendix, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:19.005\nThe only one that is a point\nof controversy here,\n\n460\n00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:24.646\nokay, is this one right here,\nUS-CERT, okay?\n\n461\n00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:28.989\nAnd the reason for that is that it's\nnot recommended that you actually\n\n462\n00:25:28.989 --> 00:25:32.384\nreport your incidences\ndirectly to US-CERT, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:32.384 --> 00:25:34.421\nThe US-CERT,\n\n464\n00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:42.893\nit is the United States Computer\nEmergency Response Team here.\n\n465\n00:25:42.893 --> 00:25:43.694\nThey're not gonna help you,\n\n466\n00:25:43.694 --> 00:25:45.457\nthey're pretty much just gonna\nsay do your own research, okay,\n\n467\n00:25:45.457 --> 00:25:48.380\nis what they're gonna say here, well-\n&gt;&gt; Well would you, Ronnie, would you\n\n468\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.453\nrecommend that they seek out that,\neven though it's not recommended, or no?\n\n469\n00:25:52.453 --> 00:25:55.785\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't, so\nthis is where I would disagree with, and\n\n470\n00:25:55.785 --> 00:25:57.961\nit's on the exam, it is here, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:57.961 --> 00:26:01.819\nSo these are one of those other\nparties that you may also see,\n\n472\n00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:05.766\nespecially if you actually want\nto take a look at that as well.\n\n473\n00:26:05.766 --> 00:26:09.270\nBut notice all these actually\ndo seem fairly logical in terms.\n\n474\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:13.310\nPublic affairs, if your incident does\ngo beyond where it kind of wrecks\n\n475\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.830\nyour company a little bit, you wanna\ntake public affairs, law enforcement.\n\n476\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.300\nIf it's something illegal,\nmake sure you kind of do that as well.\n\n477\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.550\nBut you kind of get the idea, okay, so\nyou won't see a lot of lists like this.\n\n478\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.982\nIn all the places that I point out,\nmore than likely you'll see it anywhere.\n\n479\n00:26:29.982 --> 00:26:34.408\nIt may actually be within these\nparagraphs they have that are floating\n\n480\n00:26:34.408 --> 00:26:37.343\nthroughout the entire document, like this.\n\n481\n00:26:37.343 --> 00:26:41.334\nWhere you actually find those particular\npeople that are actually involved, or\n\n482\n00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:43.571\nstakeholders in each\none of those elements.\n\n483\n00:26:43.571 --> 00:26:47.942\nOr each one of those categories\nthat we've just talked about.\n\n484\n00:26:47.942 --> 00:26:52.130\nSo Zach,\neven though you take a look at this.\n\n485\n00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:55.463\nI'm hoping that you can see why I\nemphasize reading this document is\n\n486\n00:26:55.463 --> 00:26:59.439\nabout the only way you're going to get\nthrough understanding at least those exam\n\n487\n00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:01.678\nobjectives that we've been covering here.\n\n488\n00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:04.931\n&gt;&gt; No, I absolutely see that,\nand in fact, I would even say,\n\n489\n00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:07.353\nor caution don't just use the appendices.\n\n490\n00:27:07.353 --> 00:27:10.911\nBecause I suppose you could just go to\nthe appendices and go, like, cliff notes.\n\n491\n00:27:10.911 --> 00:27:15.269\nNo, read the whole thing first,\nand then read the appendices.\n\n492\n00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:18.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's very important\nthat we understand that.\n\n493\n00:27:18.143 --> 00:27:22.871\nNow it is something that's gonna\nhelp you out as you read it.\n\n494\n00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:27.387\nBecause you'll provide better context\nthan me just pulling elements out here.\n\n495\n00:27:27.387 --> 00:27:31.646\nAlso, in the rest of the appendices after\nthat, they really do give you real world\n\n496\n00:27:31.646 --> 00:27:35.307\nscenarios that allow you to kinda\nsee the way that they're thinking.\n\n497\n00:27:35.307 --> 00:27:39.083\nIt doesn't mean you have to ask every one\nof those questions that we just looked at.\n\n498\n00:27:39.083 --> 00:27:42.200\nBut you actually see the breakdown\ndepending on the type of attack.\n\n499\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.594\nOr depending on the type of event that\nyou're actually having to respond to\n\n500\n00:27:46.594 --> 00:27:47.160\nas well.\n\n501\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.708\nAnd we'll see that in a little bit\nlater on in our show as well, okay?\n\n502\n00:27:49.708 --> 00:27:54.160\nSo Zach, at this point, I think we've\ncovered this document fairly well.\n\n503\n00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.255\nAnd that we are now ready and prepared for\n\n504\n00:27:57.255 --> 00:28:03.183\na little bit more incident handling as\nwe move forward into the SecOps world.\n\n505\n00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:03.842\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n506\n00:28:03.842 --> 00:28:08.770\nWonderful job as usual, Incident Response\nElements Part 2, there is a Part 1.\n\n507\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.075\nMake sure you watch both of them,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n508\n00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:15.683\nAnd make sure you watch everything in the\nCCNA SecOps series, that's very important,\n\n509\n00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:17.251\nand go to our course library.\n\n510\n00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:22.447\nCheck out all the hundreds of videos,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n511\n00:28:22.447 --> 00:28:25.662\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n512\n00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.052\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n513\n00:28:27.052 --> 00:28:27.953\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n514\n00:28:27.953 --> 00:28:30.371\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n515\n00:28:30.371 --> 00:28:36.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n516\n00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:39.323\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:05.348\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:11.388\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:12.632\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.720\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.634\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nand this is CCNA SecOps,\n\n8\n00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:23.780\nand this episode is CSIRT Goals.\n\n9\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.968\nAnd we've asked Ronnie Wong\nto come on by and\n\n10\n00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.644\ntell us everything we need\nto know about CSIRT Goals.\n\n11\n00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:31.140\nRonnie, good to see you,\nsir, thanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show, Zach,\n\n13\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.250\nas we continue forward here\ninside of your CecOps series.\n\n14\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.200\nWe'll now taking a look at\nsomething which is, well CSIRT now.\n\n15\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.780\nWe've thrown a ton of acronyms at\nyou throughout the entire series.\n\n16\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.310\nAnd here's another one\nthat we've of course-\n\n17\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.690\n&gt;&gt; More alphabet soup.\n\n18\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we need to actually be able\nto pay attention to and know as well.\n\n19\n00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.507\nAnd this is where we're\ngonna be taking a look at,\n\n20\n00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:58.720\nwhat we call a CSIRT or a C-S-I-R-T.\n\n21\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.770\nThat's the only way that you actually\nsee it spelled a lot of times.\n\n22\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.111\nAnd what that actually means, of course,\nwe want to take a look at that and\n\n23\n00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:08.690\nwhat it helps us do.\n\n24\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.590\nWe're in this section of our exam\nobjectives where we're taking a look at\n\n25\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.400\ninstant response.\n\n26\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.023\nAnd now we're actually right here where we\nhave to take a look at one of these groups\n\n27\n00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:19.311\nthat's kind of a self appointed group.\n\n28\n00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.011\nAnd the way that the world, and\n\n29\n00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:25.510\nthe things actually operate to give\nus a better type of instant response.\n\n30\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.500\nSo the easiest way for us to do this is go\nto their website and to take a look here.\n\n31\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.835\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nand let me go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:38.746\nzoom in right up here so\nthat you can also go to it as well, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:46.790\nSo here, you can see www.csirt.org is the\none that you want to be able to get to.\n\n34\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.790\nAnd once you're actually here,\nthe site is actually relatively tiny,\n\n35\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.000\nI don't know why, I'm at 125% and\nyou can see, it's actually small, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.830\nBut if we take a look at\ntheir nice logo here, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.030\nComputer Security Instant Response Team.\n\n38\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.244\nAnd they've essentially set up a kind\nof voluntary format that, when you\n\n39\n00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:17.795\nstart talking about the idea here of\ninstant response teams and making them and\n\n40\n00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:22.868\ncreating them and trying to coordinate\nthem in the way that you need to.\n\n41\n00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:26.779\nWell, they've got a lot of\ndocumentation to help you out and\n\n42\n00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.856\nto understand what is going on.\n\n43\n00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:33.668\nBut there's a bunch of terminology as\nwell that you need to pay attention to,\n\n44\n00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:36.680\nand at least have\nan understanding of it too.\n\n45\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.609\nAs well as what the goals of these\ndifferent types of CSIRTs are going to\n\n46\n00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.280\nbe, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.180\nSo CSIRT has been out there for quite a\nwhile, but one of the first things I want\n\n48\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.558\nto actually point out before we\nreally get started into anything.\n\n49\n00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:53.878\nIs that we were referring to in\na previous episode at some point, or\n\n50\n00:02:53.878 --> 00:03:00.540\nfor you it may be a future episode\nwhere we were referring to SP.800-61r2.\n\n51\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.500\nAnd in that one it actually says, hey,\nwhen you have a security incident it\n\n52\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.563\nmay be one of the stakeholders that you\nmight want to report information to.\n\n53\n00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:14.943\nIs gonna be the us-cert or\nC-E-R-T which is\n\n54\n00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:20.120\nthe United States Computer\nEmergency Response Team.\n\n55\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.070\nThey're saying hey, you can report it\nthere and they might actually help you.\n\n56\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.263\nThis is according to\nthe special publication, and\n\n57\n00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:28.150\nthey're saying that's the official one.\n\n58\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.610\nBut now, right at the top,\nwhich is kind of, right here,\n\n59\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.910\nright next to the logo, so\nyou have gotta think it's important.\n\n60\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.190\nIf I zoom in on this, notice that\nthey bold it and underline this.\n\n61\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.680\nWe wouldn't recommend reporting\nany incidents to US-CERT.\n\n62\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.940\nThey will not be able to help\nprovide you any assistance or help.\n\n63\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.425\nKind of bold statement here that they're\nsaying, but you can see here, it says,\n\n64\n00:03:55.425 --> 00:04:00.080\nthank you for contacting US-CERT,\nso they've already tried this.\n\n65\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.659\nIn reference to your request for\ninformation unfortunately,\n\n66\n00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.490\nwe cannot share actor information\nwith non-government entities.\n\n67\n00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.156\nI would recommend you conducting your\nown open-source research to gather\n\n68\n00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:10.500\nthe information you need.\n\n69\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.405\nIn other words they're telling you to\nGoogle it is what they're actually telling\n\n70\n00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:14.973\nyou to do-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:16.155\n&gt;&gt; When you start to try and\n\n72\n00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.410\ndeal with them.\n\n73\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.071\nSo this is one of those unusual things\nwhere this particular organisation\n\n74\n00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.560\nessentially is saying look here it is.\n\n75\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.191\nI know that you might see this\nas official documentation, but\n\n76\n00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.240\nwe don't recommend it at all,\nbecause they won't be able to help you.\n\n77\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.641\n&gt;&gt; I have a question just\nright over the bat Ronnie.\n\n78\n00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:33.406\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n79\n00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:37.243\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing US-CERT but\n\n80\n00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:41.084\nthese is CSIRT why is that?\n\n81\n00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:47.193\n&gt;&gt; Well, once an official government\norganisation especially the US-CERT here,\n\n82\n00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:53.190\nwell a CSIRT kind of the self evolved\none which they've kind of come up with.\n\n83\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.590\nAnd this is more international\nthan we realize.\n\n84\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.910\nToday worldwide you actually do have\ndifferent ones that are out there\n\n85\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.730\ntoday that allow you to do this, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.930\nSo the goal behind this, and\nthey even talk about customers as well.\n\n87\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.707\nNow, the weird thing is,\nI don't see where you can actually pay for\n\n88\n00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:09.750\nanything on their site.\n\n89\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.690\nBut they might have it, and\nit's just somewhere I don't understand.\n\n90\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.861\nBut notice that this is a privately\nheld company that's actually located in\n\n91\n00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:19.152\nWaldorf, Maryland that is what is here.\n\n92\n00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:25.633\nAnd it says it provides 24/7 Computer\nSecurity Incident Response Services\n\n93\n00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:30.680\nto any user, company,\ngovernment agency or organization.\n\n94\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.992\nAnd their goal as far as the overall\norganization is provide a reliable and\n\n95\n00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:38.476\ntrusted since point of contact for\n\n96\n00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:42.000\nreporting security\ninstances worldwide okay?\n\n97\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.290\n&gt;&gt; That's very cool.\n\n98\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they really want you\nto actually understand that.\n\n99\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.610\nThat's what their goal and\nheart is to do as far as the overall goal,\n\n100\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.880\nis to provide this idea of\na single point of contact for\n\n101\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.810\nreporting all the instances\nthat are reported to them.\n\n102\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.613\n&gt;&gt; And Cisco finds it important enough\nthat you should be reading this as\n\n103\n00:06:01.613 --> 00:06:02.156\nwell, yes?\n\n104\n00:06:02.156 --> 00:06:06.616\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is actually a good site\nthat you want to at least go to and\n\n105\n00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.770\npoke around in a little bit.\n\n106\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.762\nIt's not the most intuitive site for\nyou to go to and find information.\n\n107\n00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:16.461\nBut at least it will help\nyou to get started and\n\n108\n00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.470\nwhat they want you to be able to,\nall right.\n\n109\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.934\nSo here this is actually very good at\nsome of these different services as well.\n\n110\n00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:28.424\nSo their particular goal is that, is that\nthey really want to be able to provide\n\n111\n00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:33.136\neverything that they can and to make sure\nthat everybody can get what they need to.\n\n112\n00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.761\nThe problem is, of course,\n\n113\n00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.762\nthat means other organizations that\nmight follow the same standard,\n\n114\n00:06:38.762 --> 00:06:42.950\nthey always have to funnel everything\nupto CSIRT itself as well.\n\n115\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.305\nAnd then you can also have\ninternal CSIRT organizations too,\n\n116\n00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.306\nin other words stuff that's only for\n\n117\n00:06:48.306 --> 00:06:52.260\nyour company that you may not choose\nto forward on to them as well, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.771\nSo, when you start to see this on\ntheir site, they even talk about risk\n\n119\n00:06:56.771 --> 00:07:01.065\nmanagement and this is where a big\npart of it comes in as well.\n\n120\n00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:05.845\nThey want you to follow essentially a risk\nmanagement type of strategy as you start\n\n121\n00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:11.725\nto use things too, and then the website\nis kind of their big event or\n\n122\n00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:16.035\ntheir big site they go to,\nthat they funnel everything through.\n\n123\n00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.480\nAnd then of course,\ntheir concentration is on handling.\n\n124\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.916\nThe coordination of instant handling,\neliminating duplication of effort.\n\n125\n00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:26.474\nThey wanna mitigate\nthe potentially serious\n\n126\n00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:30.250\neffects of a severe computer\nsecurity-related problem, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.594\nFor them to achieve this goal,\nwe concentrate our efforts not\n\n128\n00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:37.338\nonly on the capability to react,\nbut also on the resources to alert.\n\n129\n00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:40.420\nSo at this point,\nthat's what they're trying to do, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.980\nSo their overall goal in nature is at,\n\n131\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.070\nwhen you start to talk\nabout the idea of CSIRT.\n\n132\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.581\nSo as an organization, it is that\ncentral point of focus where they can\n\n133\n00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.418\ndisseminate all that information as well.\n\n134\n00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:54.764\nOver on the left hand side,\n\n135\n00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:58.524\nthey of course have navigation to\ndifferent resources that are available.\n\n136\n00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:03.393\nAs well as how you actually report an\nincident, security bulletins that may have\n\n137\n00:08:03.393 --> 00:08:08.250\nissued virus watches, even other incident\nresponse teams that are out there.\n\n138\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.370\nLet's select that one just for a moment.\n\n139\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.470\nA vulnerability reconnaissance\nis what this one is and\n\n140\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.200\nallows you to actually be\nable to look through and\n\n141\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.730\nto take some of their tools that\nare available for you to use it.\n\n142\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:27.500\nThere's other partners that are also out\nthere that you can take a look at and\n\n143\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.580\nbecome a partner if you choose to.\n\n144\n00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.868\nSo they've got a lot of information.\n\n145\n00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:33.020\nUnder Incident Response,\n\n146\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.810\nnotice there's additional publications,\ncomputer forensics, documents, and\n\n147\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.760\nthey even, of course, list the NIST and\nsample policies that you can come up with.\n\n148\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.820\nSo in that sense everything\nis kind of right here.\n\n149\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.310\nThe document that I was actually really\ninterested in is right here because\n\n150\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:55.520\na lot of companies may not have\ntheir own instant response team and\n\n151\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.440\nmay not even know where to begin.\n\n152\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So right here it actually gives you\n\n153\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.051\npublications, forming\nan instant response team.\n\n154\n00:09:02.051 --> 00:09:06.930\nYou simply click on Learn More Here,\nand then they have a whole publication\n\n155\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.653\nthat you can download and at least give\nyou a starting point of what you may\n\n156\n00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:16.702\nactually want to make sure that you are\ntaking a look at as you go through here.\n\n157\n00:09:16.702 --> 00:09:18.963\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing that all of\nthis is free of charge Ronnie.\n\n158\n00:09:18.963 --> 00:09:20.020\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n159\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.530\nYeah, as far as I know,\nI really didn't see where,\n\n160\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.940\nat least on their site, even though\nthey do talk about customers at times,\n\n161\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.645\nI didn't see where it was\ncharging you anything.\n\n162\n00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So they may have it, if they do,\n\n163\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.140\nit might be something that\nyou contact them about and\n\n164\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.625\nthen they tell you what it is, but.\n\n165\n00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I don't see anything right now that's\n\n166\n00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.760\nout there that really does say that.\n\n167\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.010\nNow, it might be on the training though.\n\n168\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:48.155\nSo they even have official C-cert training\nthat apparently has not scheduled at all.\n\n169\n00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:49.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n170\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.400\nRIght?\n\n171\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.180\nSo that is the [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Meaty.\n\n172\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.490\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty much the main idea.\n\n173\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:00.170\nNow, speaking of that, do most people\nreally tend to fall underneath this thing?\n\n174\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.820\nWell, probably not.\n\n175\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.720\nSo other organizations, though, what they\ndo is they take the same concepts, and\n\n176\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.780\nthey use them, like we said, internally.\n\n177\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.740\nSo you develop your own incident\nresponse team at that point.\n\n178\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.060\nAnd the idea of the internal CSIRT is\nto serve the entire organization, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.050\nThe goal of having an internal CSIRT\ninstead of just this idea of actually\n\n180\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.040\nhaving that main organization is\nto speed up that organization's\n\n181\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.140\nability to identify, analyze,\nand respond to an incident, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.250\nAnd that is key, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.630\nWe don't want to actually have to wait for\nmaybe CSIRT or\n\n184\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.560\nanother organization that may\nbe industry recognized to go,\n\n185\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.210\nlet me take the time to do analysis and\nthen give you information back.\n\n186\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.000\nBut you might have your own internal one\nto help speed up that process as well.\n\n187\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.700\nWhen you do that, it also lowers\nthe cost of the overall response\n\n188\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.760\nplan as well as maybe limiting\nthe damage because you're catching\n\n189\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.020\nthe incident actually quicker on the draw\nthan you would be if you were waiting for\n\n190\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.510\na response to come back as well.\n\n191\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.010\nYou then on the internal CSIRT that\nyou have inside your organization\n\n192\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.410\nwill give you the ability\nto deploy a team rapidly.\n\n193\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.530\nTo the response that is happening as\nwell as get recovery efforts started.\n\n194\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.010\nIt is the key to what has to happen.\n\n195\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.910\nAlso, if you have an internal team,\nthat may actually help you especially if\n\n196\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.190\nyou follow along the guidelines\nthat CSIRT has provided for you.\n\n197\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.580\nThe ability to have better coordination.\n\n198\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.375\nYou may actually end up finding out\nthat your particular internal server\n\n199\n00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.675\nmight be too small for\na company that's very large.\n\n200\n00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:42.143\nSo you may end up, of course,\ndividing that up into each department or\n\n201\n00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:47.069\neach particular section of your company,\nhaving their own CSIRT team as well\n\n202\n00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:50.570\nto be able to handle\nthe instances that you go on.\n\n203\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.600\nBut at that point, right,\nit is really about that.\n\n204\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.350\nThe whole goal, right, is to have\na rapid response for your company or\n\n205\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.260\nyour department as you choose to, and\nmake sure it can handle what it needs.\n\n206\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.960\n&gt;&gt; And so once again, CSIRT,\nnot to be confused with US-Cert, right.\n\n207\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nit's not to be confused with that one.\n\n208\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.120\nCuz that is an organization\nthat can do things but\n\n209\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.190\nit's normally responding in\nthe way that we think about.\n\n210\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:21.610\nNow, technically according to CSIRT\nit is part of a CSIRT organization,\n\n211\n00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.680\nso US CERT, there's the one for\nJapan, there's one for Korea,\n\n212\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.220\nthere's one for a bunch of different\ncountries that are actually around.\n\n213\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.050\nand when you start to do that,\nright, and they're responding for\n\n214\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.910\nthe entire nation, and\npretending for the entire nation,\n\n215\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.380\nwell that is considered a national CSIRT\ninstead in terms of category, and their\n\n216\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.650\nparticular service of course is to the\nentire country and its infrastructure, and\n\n217\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:50.620\nwhat it needs to do to handle instances or\nthat whole country as well, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.300\nThe problem that we have regardless\nof whether it's the internal CSIRT or\n\n219\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.650\nwhether it's actually the a national one,\n\n220\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:03.710\nis the overall volume of\ninstances that you have to handle.\n\n221\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:08.230\nOkay, most of the time as you're just\nbeginning, you just kind of realize and\n\n222\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.440\nget a taste of it.\n\n223\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.660\nBut as your company starts making\nmore of a footprint in the world and\n\n224\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:19.160\nbecomes a target, you might find out that\nthe volume is simply overwhelming for\n\n225\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.530\nmost teams to handle.\n\n226\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.180\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n227\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.350\nyou have to actually be careful there,\nand so you can hit as much as you can,\n\n228\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.340\nbut just realize that you might actually\nfind yourself having to deal with the very\n\n229\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.160\nfact that theres a lot of instances.\n\n230\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.220\nAnd then for the national SIRTs,\nof course, or CSIRTs that are out there,\n\n231\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.320\nits the same thing.\n\n232\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.670\nThe entire volume of it,\nit can be, you know,\n\n233\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.270\nwe just probably don't have enough people\nto handle the actual number of instances\n\n234\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.050\nthat are really out there on the planet\ntoday, attacking even your own country.\n\n235\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.090\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of bad actors.\n\n236\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo there are those types of organizations\n\n237\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.080\nthat are also out there\nin terms of national.\n\n238\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.970\nNow CSIRT also calls out what\nwe call coordinating centers or\n\n239\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.040\ncoordination centers, too.\n\n240\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.890\nNow coordination centers are really\nabout the idea of delegation, okay.\n\n241\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.960\nAs much as they can, okay.\n\n242\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.820\nSo as organizations come on board and\nthey start following this idea,\n\n243\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.320\nthe way that CSIRT has things set up and\nthey might go and\n\n244\n00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.170\nannounce that they are able to handle so\nmuch.\n\n245\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.280\nWell, this is where those coordination\ncenters through CSIRT can really help out\n\n246\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.430\nand say we need you to handle this or\nwe need you to take this on and\n\n247\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.590\nreally distribute the work\nout between them as well.\n\n248\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.620\nSo the goal, of course is to\nprovide coordinated response and\n\n249\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.490\nwell as coordinated resources.\n\n250\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.140\nThat each team can also be able to\nuse when handling instances across\n\n251\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.380\ndifferent CSIRTs that may be\nout there in the world as well.\n\n252\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.970\nNow a lot of that of course then\ncomes in to once we actually start to\n\n253\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.360\nunderstand that we're gonna\nbe handling instances, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.890\nIs that sheer volume is kind of that\noverwhelming thing that has to happen.\n\n255\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.730\nAnd the reason why it slows down\nis what we call the analysis\n\n256\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.390\nof all of these instances.\n\n257\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.070\nThe analysis helps us to\ndetermine its impact as well as,\n\n258\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.750\nis it actually something serious\nthat we have to worry about?\n\n259\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.850\nOr is it something that we\ncan not worry about as much?\n\n260\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.830\nSo they also introduced\nthe concept of analysis centers\n\n261\n00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.210\nthat you also take a look at too.\n\n262\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.350\nThe analysis center is a little bit\nunusual, okay, in the very fact that it\n\n263\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.600\ndoesn't go in with the purpose\nof mitigating an attack.\n\n264\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.171\nI know that that sounds unusual, right?\n\n265\n00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:44.098\nThe idea of the analysis thought,\nis to provide additional information so\n\n266\n00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:49.024\nthat the people working in these types\nof analysis centers are able to start\n\n267\n00:15:49.024 --> 00:15:53.504\nspotting trends among the actual\ntype of instances that are there.\n\n268\n00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:56.824\nSo that in the future,\nwe might be able to predict,\n\n269\n00:15:56.824 --> 00:16:01.322\nor even prevent Future activities,\nsuch as what has just occurred.\n\n270\n00:16:01.322 --> 00:16:04.069\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So their particular analysis is more\n\n271\n00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:08.970\nbased on forecasting and predictions as\nmuch as they can, just like weather men.\n\n272\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.560\nHopefully, they actually\nhave a better goal, or\n\n273\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.130\na better accuracy rate than a lot of\nthe weather men that are out there.\n\n274\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.395\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So but yeah, that's the goal, right.\n\n275\n00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:21.190\nSo his goal is not to\nactually just prevent one.\n\n276\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.340\nIt's happening right now.\n\n277\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.089\nBut as to be able to trend\nthat information, so\n\n278\n00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:28.700\nwe can see where the attacks\nmay actually be happening.\n\n279\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.520\nAnd maybe even prevent one in the future\nas we start to take a look at it and\n\n280\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.602\nmove forward from that point.\n\n281\n00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:35.696\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n282\n00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:38.930\n&gt;&gt; Now, there is actually only really\ntwo terms that are left that we\n\n283\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.120\nreally need to understand.\n\n284\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.690\nBut this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky.\n\n285\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:46.000\nLet me go back, and now on my screen,\nI've kind of defined these terms.\n\n286\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.840\nThese are more common than\nwhat we normally see here,\n\n287\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.060\nespecially on the way that\nthe exam calls this out, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.500\nSo of course,\nyou wanna know this acronym, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.640\nThe big one is CSIRT here, Computer\nSecurity Instant Response Team, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.061\nThen there's also what is called a PSIRT.\n\n291\n00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:07.526\nGo figure.\n\n292\n00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:10.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Product security incident\n\n293\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960\nresponse team.\n\n294\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.765\nNow, for the exam objectives what they\nactually call it here is what we call\n\n295\n00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:17.855\nvendor teams instead, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:18.405\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n297\n00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:21.335\n&gt;&gt; Well, this should make sense, right?\n\n298\n00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:23.815\nIf you as a company,\nyou buy a particular product.\n\n299\n00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:24.945\nLet's say from Cisco.\n\n300\n00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:25.563\nWhich makes sense.\n\n301\n00:17:25.563 --> 00:17:26.935\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's where all my Cisco show here.\n\n302\n00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:27.695\n&gt;&gt; Cisco rocks.\n\n303\n00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:30.855\n&gt;&gt; You buy a product from Cisco, okay, and\n\n304\n00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:35.620\nwhat they've also done internally\ninside of Cisco is they have their own\n\n305\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.770\nresponse team for different attacks\nthat occur on their equipment, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.110\nSo that they can be the ones\nto troubleshoot that\n\n307\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.680\nif you have an issue with their particular\nequipment handling that response.\n\n308\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.680\nSo, they have experts on hand to\nhelp you out with that, as well.\n\n309\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.450\nVendors like doing this because it allows\nthem to correct even product line, so\n\n310\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.375\nthat in the future as they sell more,\nthey've already corrected it too.\n\n311\n00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So you might hear instead of vendor\n\n312\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.700\nteam, you might hear\nthe term PSIRT instead.\n\n313\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.850\nSo it is very possible.\n\n314\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.750\nAnd you might hear that product\nsecurity instant response team\n\n315\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.325\ninstead of the vendor teams\nthat are out there, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Six one way, half a dozen the other,\n\n317\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.680\nthey mean the same thing, okay,\nis what they really mean, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.980\nThe other one that is also called out.\n\n319\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.650\nAnd this is actually our final one here,\n\n320\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.680\nokay, is the incident response provider,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.820\nNow, incident response provider,\nyou also see MSSP.\n\n322\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.090\nManage security service provider, okay.\n\n323\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.970\nAnd this manage security service provider,\n\n324\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:48.240\nokay, this is instead where you might\noutsource your instant response team.\n\n325\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.045\nEither as a co incident response kind of\nteam that comes in to help you out or\n\n326\n00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:56.830\nyou've contracted them to be\nessentially an advisor or supervisor or\n\n327\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.350\nsomething like that.\n\n328\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.078\nBut, they are out there.\n\n329\n00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:04.170\n&gt;&gt; And running that, wouldn't that be\nrecommended to have an objective team\n\n330\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.990\nif the incident was sufficient\nenough to warrant that?\n\n331\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes, if it's sufficient enough\nto do that, but it is also expensive.\n\n332\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.130\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n333\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.090\nYou should never base it on\nthe fact of is it expensive or not.\n\n334\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.460\nSame time the reality is,\ncan you afford to do it, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.310\nHaving this team essentially\nspecialized in something like this,\n\n336\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.930\nit does mean it's gonna\ncost you a little bit,\n\n337\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.590\nbut they're essentially saying we'll\nhandle the actual incident for you.\n\n338\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.800\nThey're essentially saying this then, that\nthe term is probably similar to service or\n\n339\n00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.345\nsubscription as a service.\n\n340\n00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n341\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.190\n&gt;&gt; So you essentially pay a fee and they\nprovide you that service instead of you\n\n342\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.530\nhaving actually having to mountain your\nown team and keep that up and and going.\n\n343\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.760\nThey actually provide\nthe analysis that you need and\n\n344\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.330\neverything to continue to move forward and\ndo what they need as well.\n\n345\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.180\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n346\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.140\n&gt;&gt; So this is normally a subscription\nbase when you see the MSSP or\n\n347\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.892\nyou hear that term,\nIncident Response provider, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:00.892 --> 00:20:05.615\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; They're contractors is\nwhat they are and they help you out too.\n\n349\n00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n350\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.540\nSo take a moment and\ngo back an look at the CSIRT\n\n351\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.720\nwebsite and try and understand its\ngoal and its focus, and realize that\n\n352\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.120\nnot everybody is gonna automatically\nfunnel everything through them.\n\n353\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.220\nBut understanding some of those different\nterms especially when you're reading\n\n354\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.890\ndocumentation is going to help you out\nin understanding the goal of your own\n\n355\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.710\ninternal CCERT organization, as well as it\nwas coordinated with other ones out there.\n\n356\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.500\nThese are some of the terminologies\nyou need to be familiar with\n\n357\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.220\nas you actually prepare for\nthe SecOps exam.\n\n358\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.350\nSo Zach, that pretty much covers just\nabout everything that we're gonna be\n\n359\n00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.385\ntalking about in terms\nof CCERT at that point.\n\n360\n00:20:42.385 --> 00:20:43.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n361\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.660\nwe are kind of at the end\nof this right here.\n\n362\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.950\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you very much, Ronnie.\n\n363\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.470\nWonderful information as usual, and\nCCERT goals, re watch it, play it back,\n\n364\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.350\nfreeze frame it.\n\n365\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.220\nAnd then, by the way, see, every single\nepisode in the CCNA SecOps series.\n\n366\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.380\nGo to our course library,\n\n367\n00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.500\nreview the hundreds of videos there\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n368\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.490\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPRO.TV\nthanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos,\n\n369\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong\n\n370\n00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.649\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you very soon.\n\n371\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:18.302\n[MUSIC]\n\n372\n00:21:18.302 --> 00:21:20.702\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

about?\n\n10\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.700\n&gt;&gt; Sure thing Zach, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\n\n11\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.620\non to take a look at, well,\nthis idea of elements and frameworks.\n\n12\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.150\nNow, what we're specifically\ntalking about here is that there's\n\n13\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.640\na couple of different exam objectives that\nwe're really covering in one episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.120\nNow, normally I do break them up\ninto a couple of different episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.160\nIn other words, a topic for each episode,\nbut these are relatively small.\n\n16\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.670\nSo, instead I kinda say, well,\nlet me combine them together,\n\n17\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.570\nthe idea of cybersecurity.\n\n18\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.230\nI wanna talk about,\n\n19\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.290\nof course, elements that we use in things\nlike server profiling a little bit.\n\n20\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.350\nAnd we're just gonna run\nsome of the commands.\n\n21\n00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.800\nNow we've already seen\nthese commands before.\n\n22\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.340\nBut this is more of\na refresher than anything else\n\n23\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.480\nthat you might actually\nhave to be able to run.\n\n24\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.570\nSo we're gonna look over some\nof those commands again and\n\n25\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.050\nthe outputs that they give us.\n\n26\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.920\nAs well as talking about, of course,\n\n27\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990\nsome of the compliance frameworks that you\nmay also find yourself having to deal with\n\n28\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.550\nas you work in a cybersecurity operations\ncenter, is what we're taking a look at.\n\n29\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.455\n&gt;&gt; So server profiling, right?\n\n30\n00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:26.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We're looking at that and so\n\n31\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.640\nthis is all encompassing.\n\n32\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.548\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point, right?\n\n33\n00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The whole goal and\n\n34\n00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:35.420\nthe whole idea is to understand what your\nserver is really doing at that point\n\n35\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.430\nin time.\n\n36\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.460\nSo we wanna make sure that we point out\nat least some of the different utilities\n\n37\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.750\nthat we're actually going to,\n\n38\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.660\nmaybe, look at as we are suspecting\nconnections that are happening.\n\n39\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.743\n&gt;&gt; Of course understanding what is running\nin the background in terms of applications\n\n40\n00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.395\nprocesses.\n\n41\n00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.180\nAnd understanding things like that.\n\n42\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540\nBut all of this is just important elements\nthat we just wanna make sure that\n\n43\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.190\nwe do know.\n\n44\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.340\nNow, remember that this\nis more of a refresher.\n\n45\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.236\nBecause, in previous episodes, and even\nall throughout the security fundamentals\n\n46\n00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:09.590\nseries that we've done, we've actually\ndone quite a bit of this, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.510\nOver and over and\n\n48\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.330\nover, so we're not gonna actually do\na full-blown kind of thing again.\n\n49\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.580\nCuz if I did that, it'd probably\ntake me another six episodes to do.\n\n50\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.135\nBut overall though, just kinda realize\nthat it's just kind of a reminder here.\n\n51\n00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:22.571\nAnd it gets called out on the exams.\n\n52\n00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:25.855\nAnd sometimes, that's what will\nend up happening is that we'll see\n\n53\n00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.470\nthat there is overlap in those exams,\nbetween exams.\n\n54\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.830\nBut even just in the concepts, themselves.\n\n55\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.460\nAnd this one just happens to be that way,\nand that's why we're doing this.\n\n56\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, thank you.\n\n57\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.404\n&gt;&gt; So Zach, as we begin here,\n\n58\n00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:42.085\nwhat we want to do is we wanna take a look\nat that idea of what is it normally\n\n59\n00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:46.712\nthat we're looking at in terms of\nprofiling here and what we wanna do?\n\n60\n00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:49.795\nThe first thing that we're\nactually going to talk about here\n\n61\n00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:51.980\nare identifying listening ports, okay.\n\n62\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.090\nAnd remember that the idea\nof using port numbers,\n\n63\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.920\nright, is how others connect to us.\n\n64\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.085\nAnd we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that when we have listening\n\n65\n00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.596\nports, it is saying hey, here's a sign\nI am ready for a connection to do so.\n\n66\n00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:09.230\nAnd you do need to at least be able\nto identify that on your machine.\n\n67\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.170\nSo the great thing is most of us have\nactually kind of figured this out before.\n\n68\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.580\nBut there's a few\nutilities that we can use.\n\n69\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.840\nAnd of course, when getting ready for\n\n70\n00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.880\nthe exam, you need to be able to identify\nthe utility that you would end up using.\n\n71\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.520\nSo for example,\nlet's go to my machine here.\n\n72\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.004\nI'm running a Kali Linux box\nbecause it was up and it was easy.\n\n73\n00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.975\nAnd it will actually help us to\ndemonstrate what we need to.\n\n74\n00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.880\nBut you can run this on a Windows\nmachine if you want to as well.\n\n75\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.775\nAnd this will all work too.\n\n76\n00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:38.420\nSo if I needed to identify listening\nports on Kali Linux machine,\n\n77\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.550\napparently I double clicked on this thing.\n\n78\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.700\nLet me just click on it one time.\n\n79\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.290\nAnd there we go,\nthat'd make it actually easier.\n\n80\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.558\nWell, the utility that I'm probably gonna\nend up using is kinda the utility that\n\n81\n00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:54.286\nwe've been using for pretty much\na long time here, which is gonna be.\n\n82\n00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:58.580\nLet me zoom in here a little bit,\nwhich is gonna be netstat, okay?\n\n83\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.760\nNow, netstat, itself, is actually quite a,\n\n84\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.490\npretty sizable tool that\nwe can end up using.\n\n85\n00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.420\nBut it does show us quite\na bit of information,\n\n86\n00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.370\nespecially when we start using the options\nthat we can see along with this.\n\n87\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.260\nSo notice I just typed in netstat -a,\nwhich just means all.\n\n88\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.340\nSo if I press Enter from that point,\n\n89\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.840\nnow you can see that it actually does give\nme quite a bit of output that goes on.\n\n90\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.520\nAnd from right here, we can see currently\n\n91\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.470\nActive Internet connection (servers and\nestablished) at this particular point.\n\n92\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.300\nSo it allows us to take a look at the\ninformation that we see, not only up here,\n\n93\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.250\nand these are the ones\nthat are established.\n\n94\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.100\nBut what I'm also looking for\nis the ones that are in listening state,\n\n95\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.610\nwhich is how people can connect.\n\n96\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.230\nAnd what we actually need\nto be able to find out.\n\n97\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.513\nSo inside of, let's say if you were\ntaking a look at a Windows box,\n\n98\n00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:56.384\nwhat you would end up finding out, right,\nis that you might see established,\n\n99\n00:04:56.384 --> 00:05:00.280\nyou might see listening, you might see\nclosed, wait, whatever it might be.\n\n100\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.250\nBut the listening ones are the ones that\nyou're really needing to pay attention to.\n\n101\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.590\nHere, of course,\nare some that are connected.\n\n102\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.570\nSo at least knowing that listening and\n\n103\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.360\nwhere you might suspect that\nsomebody is able to attack.\n\n104\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.100\nWell, that's what you want\nto be able to identify\n\n105\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.140\nat the very beginning using netstat.\n\n106\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.200\nNow if you're not sure,\nof course, about all\n\n107\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.760\nof the options that are available\nyou can always do netsat -help.\n\n108\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.450\nAnd then if I scroll down a little bit,\nyou can see some of the additional\n\n109\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.030\noptions here that we can run\nalong with netstat itself.\n\n110\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.017\nSo for example,\nthe one that I chose is right here, all.\n\n111\n00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:41.830\nAnd now lot of times of course,\nthat's just too much information.\n\n112\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.290\nSo instead, if I wanted to identify\nthe ones that were listening, and\n\n113\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:52.130\nyou saw it right here -l,\nit displays listening sever sockets.\n\n114\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.630\nWell that might actually help\nme a little bit more than\n\n115\n00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.862\nwhat I wanted to be able to do.\n\n116\n00:05:55.862 --> 00:06:00.430\nSo let's scroll all the way down here,\nor up I should say.\n\n117\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.410\nIf i scroll up, you'll see that right now,\n\n118\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.470\nI only really have one that looks\nlike it's a active connection here.\n\n119\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.690\nBut all the rest of these,\naccording to what we're seeing,\n\n120\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.580\nare listening states as well.\n\n121\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.070\nSo that is another filter that we\ncan use to help us to provide at\n\n122\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.730\nleast a little bit more information\non the listening ones that we need.\n\n123\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.640\nSo this will allow us to at\nleast see that information, too.\n\n124\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.762\nNow that's not all, right?\n\n125\n00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:26.305\nWe wanna filter this\na little bit more as well.\n\n126\n00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:30.238\nSo if I do the same thing,\nwhich is a netstat -l, let me stop that,\n\n127\n00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:32.997\nbecause that looks weird\non the screen there.\n\n128\n00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:34.730\nLet me scroll down here.\n\n129\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.340\nI can use this in combination\nwith some of those other options.\n\n130\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.659\nFor example, I do the listening, I can\neven say I wanna limit this to TCP ports.\n\n131\n00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.187\nAnd all I have to do\nis actually do the LT.\n\n132\n00:06:48.187 --> 00:06:51.570\nAnd now it's actually showing\nme I don't have any of them.\n\n133\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.230\nSo remember that, and\n\n134\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.510\nwhen we start talking about\nthe later four protocols, right?\n\n135\n00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.730\nWe have TCP,\nthe transmission control protocol.\n\n136\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.800\nAnd there's also UDP,\nthe user datagram protocol.\n\n137\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.920\nI can even go in and\nfind that out if I want to.\n\n138\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.701\nIf I wanted to do the user datagram\nprotocol, I instead can do a -lu.\n\n139\n00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:13.635\nAnd that would also show me something if I\ndid have some type of connection there off\n\n140\n00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:15.800\nand going and ready to use.\n\n141\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.330\nSo those are all different, at least, some\nof the things that we can do to help us,\n\n142\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.140\nto kind of pinpoint what\nwe're really looking for\n\n143\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.360\nwhen we're talking about listing ports\nthat are actually available, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.440\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n145\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.250\n&gt;&gt; Now the other one that we can also\nend up taking a look at, of course is,\n\n146\n00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.707\nlet me do the help again, netstat -help.\n\n147\n00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:44.770\nAnd what I'm looking for to remind\nmyself is statistical information, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.751\nSo I can even see some statistical\ninformation based on some of the same\n\n149\n00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.735\nelements that we were\njust looking at as well.\n\n150\n00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:55.281\nSo for example,\nif I now go back instead and\n\n151\n00:07:55.281 --> 00:08:01.454\nI type in netstat [LAUGH] -s for\nthe statistics.\n\n152\n00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:05.210\nI can also just run that.\n\n153\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.960\nAnd now take a look at\nthe information that displays for me.\n\n154\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.620\nI can of course see the IP information and\nthe packets received.\n\n155\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.810\nIncoming as well as outgoing.\n\n156\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.100\nICMP, another protocol.\n\n157\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.220\nNotice Tcp active connection\nopenings right now, 14 failed ones,\n\n158\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.730\nresets, connections established,\nreset messages.\n\n159\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.460\nNotice that Udp also has\nthat same information.\n\n160\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.730\nAnd you can continue to scroll down and\nfind out some more information.\n\n161\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.490\nIf I hit my up arrow one time and\nI see that statistical information.\n\n162\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.420\nBut what if I only wanted\nto see the Tcp itself.\n\n163\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.556\nWell, I simply add in an st and\nnow when I do that notice that it\n\n164\n00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:52.676\nreally does limit me from st up here,\nnetstat-st.\n\n165\n00:08:52.676 --> 00:08:56.572\nAnd now all I'm seeing of course is just\nthat filtered out information instead of\n\n166\n00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:57.860\neverything.\n\n167\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.810\nZach, the reason why this is important\nis that regardless of which one of these\n\n168\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.870\ncommands are already done, right?\n\n169\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.320\nIn a situation which\nyou were doing analysis\n\n170\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.650\nseeing too much information is probably\njust as bad as not seeing any information.\n\n171\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Agree.\n&gt;&gt; Because you can get overwhelm by\n\n172\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.860\nthe amount of information.\n\n173\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.638\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n174\n00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:17.930\n&gt;&gt; No one how it actually figure out and\ndisplay really well you want to see.\n\n175\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.870\nAs kind of the beginning\nstep in process of realizing\n\n176\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.210\nthat I knew that I should use\nmy time a bit more efficiently.\n\n177\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.950\nI need to make sure that I\nknow what I'm looking for.\n\n178\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.070\nSo you can isolate down that\nconnection that you're looking for, and\n\n179\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.030\nyou go I know this is a Tcp connection.\n\n180\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.710\nWell, why are you still looking at\nUDP statistics or UDP connections.\n\n181\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.551\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n182\n00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:39.160\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n183\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.722\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we want to at least be\nable to understand and kind of run and\n\n184\n00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:46.092\ndo some of this stuff as well, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:49.773\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Same principle here right if we want to\n\n186\n00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:53.409\nlimit to UDP instead of netstat-st.\n\n187\n00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:57.627\nI would do a dot,\ndash using not dot, -su and\n\n188\n00:09:57.627 --> 00:10:02.181\nnow notice once again,\nUdp information only and\n\n189\n00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:07.230\neven Udplite and\nof course the IpExt for that.\n\n190\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.670\nThat ends up also showing up.\n\n191\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:15.011\nBut it allows me to focus in exactly\non what I really want to be able to do.\n\n192\n00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:19.488\nSo netstat is a utility that we should\nbe very comfortable on running and\n\n193\n00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:20.466\ntake a look at.\n\n194\n00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:21.814\nAnd the great thing is,\n\n195\n00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:26.075\nthere's many different sites out there\non the Internet that can help you.\n\n196\n00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:29.714\nAnd I recommend the ones that really\ndo focus in on this, because this is\n\n197\n00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:33.791\nreally what will help you identify the\nconnections that are going on right now.\n\n198\n00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:37.586\nAnd even some of the vulnerabilities on\nyour machine just by looking at the list\n\n199\n00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:38.810\nthat netstat gives you.\n\n200\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.570\nAnd that stand is fairly universal like I\nsaid between Windows, as well as Linux.\n\n201\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.080\nAnd even inside of Mac OS,\nyou can still run these commands and\n\n202\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.580\nthey pretty much work about the same.\n\n203\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.080\nI'm not gonna say that they're identical\nbut they do work just about the same.\n\n204\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.950\n&gt;&gt; Just about the same,and the next to\nthat is a pretty used utility, right?\n\n205\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep, normally that's built in\na lot of time just another utility that\n\n206\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.800\nwe see packaged into the operating system.\n\n207\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.450\nSo we're actually gonna see that as well.\n\n208\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Which is even better.\n\n209\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.060\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Free's a good word.\n\n210\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is, so that's something\nelse that you might also be able to do.\n\n211\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.310\nNow, Zach another particular\nIssue that may run into\n\n212\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:18.340\nthat we don't realize is that what if\nI needed to reboot a server, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.530\nWell, that sounds not like a big deal at\ntimes, but it really depends on the server\n\n214\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.860\nitself and whether or\nnot the user's actively using the server.\n\n215\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.700\nSo it could be that multiple\npeople are actually\n\n216\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.080\nusing that server at the same time.\n\n217\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.496\nIt's possible because we can have\ndifferent user profiles, but how do I\n\n218\n00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:41.312\nknow who's actually using the server,\nwho I'm logged in as sometimes as well.\n\n219\n00:11:41.312 --> 00:11:43.980\nWell, the great thing is,\ninside of at least Linux here.\n\n220\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.020\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n221\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.923\nI can just use something\nlike the w command.\n\n222\n00:11:48.923 --> 00:11:50.182\nAnd when I press that,\n\n223\n00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:53.910\nit will show me the information of\nthe users that I'm logged in as.\n\n224\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.760\nNow, this is not great practice.\n\n225\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.020\nWe normally don't log in as the root user.\n\n226\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.560\nThat's probably not a good thing for\nus to be able to do, but\n\n227\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.990\nwe're running inside of cal Linux and\nusually that's who you're logged in as.\n\n228\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n229\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.970\n&gt;&gt; So here, we can identify the root USER\nitself right here and be able to see that.\n\n230\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.820\nNot only can I use that w command,\nI can also use the who as well,\n\n231\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.760\nand notice how it actually eliminates\na little bit more information.\n\n232\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.350\nW tended to give me a little bit more\ninformation versus the who command right\n\n233\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.340\nhere, which seems to actually gave me the\ntime stamp of when the user was actually\n\n234\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.335\nlogged in and\nI can also do the whoami as well.\n\n235\n00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:37.122\nAnd notice the amount of\ninformation again, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:42.596\nSo Zack, you see each one seems to give\nme at least some of the same information.\n\n237\n00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.222\nBut notice the level of\ndetail here between them and\n\n238\n00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:48.260\nwhat it is that you're really looking for\nat times.\n\n239\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.380\nThese are some of the things that also\ncan help us as we start to do that.\n\n240\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.960\nAnd there's even one called last here,\nthat can allow us to see this too.\n\n241\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.770\nNow, let me hit the up arrow\njust a couple of times here.\n\n242\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.420\nNotice that the last one that actually\nlogged in and what actually happened here.\n\n243\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.600\nRoot and then also of course\na reboot happened as well.\n\n244\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.319\nSo it's still logged in.\n\n245\n00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:13.564\nThe last one that logged\nin is still logged in and\n\n246\n00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:16.270\nit's still running at\nthis particular point.\n\n247\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.470\nSo you can see a lot of information\neven just using something\n\n248\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.090\nlike this to help you,\nespecially when you check on the idea of\n\n249\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.720\nuser accounts that\nare logged in at this point.\n\n250\n00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.579\nSo just a few commands and\nfew utilities for\n\n251\n00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:32.924\nus a really kind of key\nend process as well, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:32.924 --> 00:13:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n253\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.720\nthere's other things that we also\nhave to be familiar with as well.\n\n254\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.620\nAnd this is where it diverges\njust a little bit more.\n\n255\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.907\nIn the realm of, when we start taking\na look at running processes and tasks.\n\n256\n00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:49.324\nInside of the Windows world, you're\ngonna use the task manager pretty much,\n\n257\n00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:51.500\nis what you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n258\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.796\nAnd in the task manager,\n\n259\n00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:56.144\nyou can also see the processes\nthat are running at the same time.\n\n260\n00:13:56.144 --> 00:14:00.156\nWell, you can also add in third party\nutilities that are also in there that you\n\n261\n00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:02.547\ncan add into Windows and\nhelp you to see more.\n\n262\n00:14:02.547 --> 00:14:07.070\nIn some Linux world we actually have\na couple of them we can use, but the one\n\n263\n00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:13.255\nthat's built in natively Into most of the\noperating system here is one called top.\n\n264\n00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:15.057\nLet's take a look at top here formal.\n\n265\n00:14:15.057 --> 00:14:19.960\nNow, top is a little bit overwhelming if\nyou're rushing not use to seeing this.\n\n266\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.952\nAnd if you're not as familiar with\ntopic you got in this point, and\n\n267\n00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:25.633\nyou got it well and\nyou really don't know much about topic.\n\n268\n00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:28.650\nMake sure you may go back and\ncheck out our security fundamentals show.\n\n269\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.750\nWell, we did actually kind\nof break open top and\n\n270\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.300\ndived into it much deeper than\nwhat we're doing right here.\n\n271\n00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.020\nAnd now, you can see that if you're\nused to the Windows world and\n\n272\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.218\nyou're coming in, it’s similar.\n\n273\n00:14:40.218 --> 00:14:43.026\nI'm not gonna tell you everything\nis exactly the same but\n\n274\n00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:45.789\nit’s similar to what you're\nnormally used to seeing.\n\n275\n00:14:45.789 --> 00:14:49.190\nYou have your process ID and\nof course the user that's running it.\n\n276\n00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.760\nYou also have some different\nother statistical information and\n\n277\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.670\nthe packets that are also coming in.\n\n278\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.880\nYou can see the time as well as\nthe commands that are running.\n\n279\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.610\nAnd so,\nthis is the kind of very most basic\n\n280\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.135\nof the statistical things\nthat we can end up running.\n\n281\n00:15:05.135 --> 00:15:08.130\nThere's some that even\ncolorize an element here.\n\n282\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.320\nBut that's an add on package like htop.\n\n283\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.740\nI was trying to remember saying\nthat I want, one called htop.\n\n284\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.621\nThat will colorize it to make\nit a little bit fancier, and\n\n285\n00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:19.510\nallow you to see that more.\n\n286\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:24.110\nSo being out actually used this to help\nidentify processes that are running\n\n287\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.780\nis also a key one that\nwe can also count on.\n\n288\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.640\nNow I'm gonna stop that because we're\nnot really digging that deep into it,\n\n289\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.390\nbut remember that top is one that we can\nuse to help us identify that as well.\n\n290\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.610\nThe other one that's out there\nof course is ps- capital A.\n\n291\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.184\nNow, this one is much simpler\nin terms of the output.\n\n292\n00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:50.421\nBut it just really gives me the process\nID, the time, and the command,\n\n293\n00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.716\ninstead of all the additional\ncolumns in between as well.\n\n294\n00:15:54.716 --> 00:15:58.382\nSo, a different level of\ninformation that we see.\n\n295\n00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:02.700\nDepending on what we need to be able\nto take a look at as well, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.363\nSo all of these again are more about\nthe focus in terms of analysis of what you\n\n297\n00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:12.420\nneed to see rather than just go, I know\nthe command that will show me everything.\n\n298\n00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.680\nDon't get me wrong, digging through\na needle in the haystack is, well,\n\n299\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.955\ntime consuming, and it can be good to\nmake sure you don't miss anything.\n\n300\n00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:22.050\nBut if it's something time-sensitive,\n\n301\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.560\nyou need to kind of pay attention to\nwhat you really do need to know, and\n\n302\n00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.540\nmaybe even know the right commands that\nwill kind of help you to filter that out.\n\n303\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.265\n&gt;&gt; And like anything else,\nof course, it's familiarity.\n\n304\n00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:33.888\nI mean, the more you get in there and\njust play around with it or\n\n305\n00:16:33.888 --> 00:16:36.170\ncheck it out the easier it's gonna be,\nright, Ron?\n\n306\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep, and that's what happens.\n\n307\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.510\nAnd once again,\nplenty of utilities out there.\n\n308\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.430\nAnd the websites out there\nto help you out, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.990\nWhat about the idea of going into the\nprocesses a little bit more in finding out\n\n310\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.260\nsome information?\n\n311\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:54.766\nIf I use that, let me see if I can get\nout there, I'm off, I'm zoomed in.\n\n312\n00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:58.620\nWhy am I not able to do what I wanna do,\nwhich was to show that, all right,\n\n313\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.970\nthere we go.\n\n314\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.522\nSo here, if we run ps -Ax.\n\n315\n00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:07.330\nNow you're probably going, Ronnie,\nwhere are you getting all this from?\n\n316\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:12.392\nWell, if you're not sure, type in ps dash,\nmake sure I'm only doing one space there,\n\n317\n00:17:12.392 --> 00:17:15.490\ndash help, and now you'll actually see,\n\n318\n00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.430\nit's double dash here, sorry my fault,\ngreat thing is it helps you out here.\n\n319\n00:17:20.852 --> 00:17:22.429\nMaybe I'm lying to you, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:24.387\nSo there it is, simple.\n\n321\n00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:25.630\n&gt;&gt; I've actually debugging.\n\n322\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that, yeah.\n\n323\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.853\nYeah, okay, so here's some simple commands\nfor us, figures that I would do that.\n\n324\n00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:35.030\nSo here you get just basic options,\nI forgot to see the rest of that list,\n\n325\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.540\nit says one of these has to be there.\n\n326\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.343\nSo, you can see where you get these basic\noptions, there's the A for all processes.\n\n327\n00:17:42.343 --> 00:17:47.078\nAnd now notice here is the X that I also\njust mentioned that we would type in,\n\n328\n00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:50.102\nprocess without the controlling ttys,\nokay?\n\n329\n00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:55.872\nSo now if I do the ps- Ax and\nall these, oops, all right,\n\n330\n00:17:55.872 --> 00:18:03.420\nZach, so obviously I'm not actually\ntyping this incorrectly here.\n\n331\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.220\nI did realize what I did\nfinally after a couple of\n\n332\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.074\ntimes of trying this ps-A x, and-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n333\n00:18:12.074 --> 00:18:14.483\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit better,\nlike teachable moments.\n\n334\n00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:17.997\nYeah, I know, but for me writing,\nI actually take a look at my handwriting,\n\n335\n00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.011\nit's a little challenging than I thought.\n\n336\n00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here we can start to see, well,\n\n337\n00:18:22.826 --> 00:18:25.200\nmore information, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.230\nSo not only do we have of\ncourse the process ID,\n\n339\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.090\nnotice this one that says STAT here.\n\n340\n00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.310\nNow if you are unsure, and\n\n341\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.810\nthere's actually quite a few\ndifferent marks, right?\n\n342\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.840\nThere’s a capital S,\na capital S with the less than symbol.\n\n343\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.928\nI thought I saw a different one up\nhere a little bit, there, yeah,\n\n344\n00:18:43.928 --> 00:18:45.315\nthere's an S and an N.\n\n345\n00:18:45.315 --> 00:18:47.755\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And I just scroll down here.\n\n346\n00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:52.310\nLook at that, S and a lower case s, that's\ngotta blow your mind a little bit more.\n\n347\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:59.700\nAn S lower case sl, look at that, even\nplus signs that start adding it in here.\n\n348\n00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.540\nYou name it, it is starting to look\nmore challenging as we go along and\n\n349\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.490\nwe start seeing this type of information.\n\n350\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.831\nIt is starting to kind of get a little\nbit, here at the very bottom, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:15.023\nOne more which was the very end\ncommand that we're running here,\n\n352\n00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:15.529\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n353\n00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.355\n&gt;&gt; And it even has a plus R.\n\n354\n00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:19.745\nWell, how do I find out\ninformation like this?\n\n355\n00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:23.703\nWhen you simply actually go to\nthe man page or the manual page here,\n\n356\n00:19:23.703 --> 00:19:24.245\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:19:24.245 --> 00:19:28.836\n&gt;&gt; Or ps, and now this is where you have\nto, of course, as you go down through\n\n358\n00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:33.152\nhere, is essentially the guide,\nthe user guide, for everything.\n\n359\n00:19:33.152 --> 00:19:33.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n360\n00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:36.690\n&gt;&gt; And this is where you can\nalso get other information.\n\n361\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.530\nAnd this is the most\ncomprehensive guide that we have.\n\n362\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:44.590\nAnd this is where you, actually, will end\nup putting together all this information.\n\n363\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.210\nAnd you'll have to look these things up to\nend up giving you what you actually want\n\n364\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.320\nit to be able to do, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.550\nSo all of this is available right\nthere for you inside of your\n\n366\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:01.946\nLinux commands here, let me do the q here,\nq for quit, there we go.\n\n367\n00:20:01.946 --> 00:20:03.710\nAt some point, I was gonna quit.\n\n368\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.296\nSo those are just some of the basic things\nthat we can do to help us in profiling\n\n369\n00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:09.104\nour servers just a little bit better.\n\n370\n00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:09.639\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n371\n00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:12.890\n&gt;&gt; But remember, don't just check this\none now if you're kind of going, and\n\n372\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.910\nthat's kind of a light touch here.\n\n373\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.240\nMake sure you go back and\nrewatch these episodes,\n\n374\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.840\nand even the security fundamental show.\n\n375\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.956\nYou'll see we hit some of these\nin pretty much in-depth here, but\n\n376\n00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:26.832\nat this point it's just a refresher,\nright?\n\n377\n00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:30.620\nNow, the other topic that we\nwanted to talk about here, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.450\nActually involve some of the compliance\nmeasures that we also have to take.\n\n379\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.380\nLook at our compliance frameworks.\n\n380\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.780\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nas I've just kind of put those up\n\n381\n00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.370\nthere as well, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.445\nOver on the left-hand side, I have\nlisted kinda the three big ones that\n\n383\n00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.495\nyou should be familiar\nwith as you're working.\n\n384\n00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:49.125\nAnd the reason why, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:51.685\nIs this, when we start to take a look\n\n386\n00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:56.105\nat the information that we're given\nover on the left-hand side, okay?\n\n387\n00:20:56.105 --> 00:21:00.647\nPCI, Payment Card Industry, well, that\nobviously sounds like credit cards, okay?\n\n388\n00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:01.215\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, Mm-hm.\n\n389\n00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:04.002\n&gt;&gt; HIPPA, if you break down the acronym,\n\n390\n00:21:04.002 --> 00:21:08.321\nHealth Insurance Portability and\nAccountable Act, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:09.910\nOr probably accountability act as well,\nokay?\n\n392\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.175\nSo when you actually break that down,\nthat sounds like healthcare.\n\n393\n00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:16.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:19.932\nSarbanes-Oxley, that may be the one\nthat's a little bit more difficult for\n\n395\n00:21:19.932 --> 00:21:23.739\nus to kind of identify with because most\nof us probably don't deal a lot in terms\n\n396\n00:21:23.739 --> 00:21:27.143\nof publicly traded companies, but\nit actually are of course rules and\n\n397\n00:21:27.143 --> 00:21:29.568\nregulations about publicly\ntraded companies and\n\n398\n00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:33.430\nthe information that is kept\nessentially in electronic storage.\n\n399\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.390\nAnd so this is all this information\nthat you're seeing over here\n\n400\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.940\non the left-hand side.\n\n401\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:43.060\nEach one of these forms\na compliance framework for you and\n\n402\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.000\nme to essentially follow if we're working\nin that particular industry, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.830\nNow, the way to actually be\nable to identify those, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.770\nAs we look over on the right-hand side,\nZach, I've kind of put\n\n405\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:03.907\nthe definitions a little bit more in\nkind of Ronnie Wong's definition, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:05.730\n&gt;&gt; I like Ronny Wong's definition.\n\n407\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.609\n&gt;&gt; Is what ends up happening instead.\n\n408\n00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:11.260\nAnd when we start to see\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.137\nWhat we want to actually\nbe able to do is make sure,\n\n410\n00:22:14.137 --> 00:22:18.659\nof course, that we can match up what we\nthink is actually correct here, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:19.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n412\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.040\n&gt;&gt; So, for instance, when I take a look at\nPCI, Payment Card Industry, here, okay?\n\n413\n00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.590\nWhen I take a look at that, well,\n\n414\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.020\nI'm gonna link that all the way\ndown to this one, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.067\nIs what I'm going to do.\n\n416\n00:22:35.232 --> 00:22:41.820\nAnd I'll change the size of that thing,\nsay for that.\n\n417\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.329\nNow that's what I believe\nis the correct one, right?\n\n418\n00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Nicely done, sir.\n\n419\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.340\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nProtects cardholder data when, excuse me,\n\n420\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.510\nwherever is processed, stored,\nand transmitted, okay?\n\n421\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.760\nSo that's actually important that we\nunderstand that concept and that idea.\n\n422\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.999\nIt's not only about keeping\nyour credit card number safe,\n\n423\n00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:05.146\nit's about also making sure that\nthe cardholder data itself is processed,\n\n424\n00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:09.000\nstored and transmitted, and\nprotects all that information, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And that is key, so\n\n426\n00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.690\nit's not only about one location during\nthe transmission, whenever it's processed,\n\n427\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.080\nwherever it's processed, and\nthat means point of sale.\n\n428\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.240\nSo at the time that you're actually,\nwhen Zach goes out to eat at his\n\n429\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.640\nfavorite restaurant,\nthat point of sale right there.\n\n430\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.962\nIt needs to be protected from that point-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:23:27.962 --> 00:23:30.830\n&gt;&gt; All the way through the time\nthat's actually transmitted,\n\n432\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.520\nall the way through to where that\ninformation essentially gets stored,\n\n433\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.040\nthat whole process needs to be protected.\n\n434\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.170\nThe Payment Card Industry framework\nis what allows us to do that, okay?\n\n435\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.272\nThe other one here, HIPPA, okay?\n\n436\n00:23:44.272 --> 00:23:47.838\nWell, we already talked about this as\nbeing more healthcare like than anything\n\n437\n00:23:47.838 --> 00:23:48.643\nelse that we saw.\n\n438\n00:23:48.643 --> 00:23:53.447\nSo here, we wanna be able to\nidentify that, provides health\n\n439\n00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:58.363\ndata privacy security and\npatient confidentiality, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:58.363 --> 00:24:01.151\nSo those HIPAA terms there, it's not so\n\n441\n00:24:01.151 --> 00:24:07.370\nmuch the terms as you understanding what\nthe HIPAA Act really does, okay, right?\n\n442\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.240\nSo for us, it's about privacy,\nsecurity, and confidentiality\n\n443\n00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.770\nof the information that you actually have\nwith your health care provider, okay?\n\n444\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.950\nFinally, that kinda leaves us with\nthe eliminative process here, right?\n\n445\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:26.860\nSo through the process of elimination,\neven if didn't know what last one was,\n\n446\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.450\nin theory, that should actually\nmatch up pretty good here.\n\n447\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.420\nWhere we can say Sarbanes-Oxley,\nokay, protects shareholder and\n\n448\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.900\ngeneral public from accounting errors and\nfraudulent practices, okay?\n\n449\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.770\n&gt;&gt; That's a mouthful.\n\n450\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.290\n&gt;&gt; It is a mouthful here, but it is kinda\nthe key concepts that come out now.\n\n451\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.320\nThe real laws and\ndefinitions of the stuff, right?\n\n452\n00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.790\nThey're written by lawyers and\nlegislators and stuff.\n\n453\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.768\nI kind of condensed it a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n454\n00:24:54.768 --> 00:24:58.780\nSo all of these really have more\ndetail behind them than you think.\n\n455\n00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.658\nBut at the end here,\nunderstanding that general process.\n\n456\n00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:02.560\nBeing able to match up,\n\n457\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.880\nof course, the acronym that we showed\nyou over here on the left-hand side with\n\n458\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.190\nthe proper definitions is a good thing\nto remember, because it is important.\n\n459\n00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:18.740\nOkay, now we need to dig into the PCI\na little bit more though, Zach, okay?\n\n460\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.180\nSo in this, I tried to make it\na little bit trickier, okay, for\n\n461\n00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.870\nus to actually be able\nto do this right here.\n\n462\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.490\nSo Zach, let's start off with a question,\nis what we want to do, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.114\nSo here, when we take a look at\nthe question up at the top, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:34.114 --> 00:25:38.977\nThe PCI-DSS, okay, and\nthis is the payment card industry data\n\n465\n00:25:38.977 --> 00:25:44.301\nsecurity standard, protects which\nof the following data elements?\n\n466\n00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:48.093\nSelect all the ones that apply, okay?\n\n467\n00:25:48.093 --> 00:25:51.859\nNow that's a little bit trickier here,\nbecause one, you and\n\n468\n00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:56.871\nI haven't gone over what each of these\nelements are that it would protect, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:01.490\nSo this is actually two actions\nthat you have to be able to do.\n\n470\n00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.080\nOne, of course,\n\n471\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.130\nis you have to have the knowledge of\nwhat it really does protect, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.670\nSecondly, that also means you\nhave to actually be careful,\n\n473\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.330\nbecause something will sound very similar,\nand you don't know whether or\n\n474\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.950\nnot it's actually correct or not.\n\n475\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.350\nSo you gotta actually kind of be able\nto eliminate what it doesn't protect,\n\n476\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.130\nas well as identify what\nit does protect too, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.770\nSo when we start to do this,\nZach, let's see, I will actually\n\n478\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:33.608\nmake us a marker tool here so\nwe can actually put a dot by something.\n\n479\n00:26:33.608 --> 00:26:37.500\nSo Zach,\ndon't worry about getting it right or\n\n480\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.590\nwrong, cuz I haven't told you\nwhat the answers are, Zach.\n\n481\n00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.580\n&gt;&gt; No, he has not.\n\n482\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.300\n&gt;&gt; So at this point, right, Zach-\n&gt;&gt; This is a surprise.\n\n483\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.200\n&gt;&gt; It is a surprise.\n\n484\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a guess here, okay?\n\n485\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.380\nSo here in the left-hand column,\nnotice that all of these are just kind of\n\n486\n00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.870\nacronyms, alphabet soup,\nas you call them, okay?\n\n487\n00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.410\nSo Zack, of these that you see,\nis there one,\n\n488\n00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.351\ntwo, or do you think all of them-\n&gt;&gt; I think\n\n489\n00:27:00.351 --> 00:27:02.597\nwe should take the Cardholder Name.\n\n490\n00:27:02.597 --> 00:27:04.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, so yep, okay.\n\n491\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.150\n&gt;&gt; I think it would\nprotect the service code.\n\n492\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.920\n&gt;&gt; The service code,\nright here, all right.\n\n493\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.856\n&gt;&gt; And that's it.\n\n494\n00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:11.550\n&gt;&gt; And that's it?\n\n495\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.820\nNow what about the rest of this stuff?\n\n496\n00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.270\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it would\nprotect those things.\n\n497\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.580\n&gt;&gt; You don't think it would\nprotect those things?\n\n498\n00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.474\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a trick.\n\n499\n00:27:17.474 --> 00:27:19.390\n&gt;&gt; You think it's a trick, all right.\n\n500\n00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.452\nWell Zach,\nthe good is you got two right, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:22.452 --> 00:27:23.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n502\n00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.670\nthat's awesome, that's awesome.\n\n503\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.179\nBut yeah, we didn't go over this,\nokay, but Zach, overall though, okay,\n\n504\n00:27:29.179 --> 00:27:31.535\nif we want to actually take\na look at this too, okay?\n\n505\n00:27:31.535 --> 00:27:34.390\nIt also protects something called a PAN.\n\n506\n00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.860\nNow notice, this is a little bit tricky,\ncuz I have WAN and\n\n507\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.850\nMAN, which we've used in networking\nterminology a lot of times, right?\n\n508\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:41.720\nMetro area network,\n\n509\n00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.920\nwide area network, but PAN here stands for\npersonal account number.\n\n510\n00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.004\nNow this is actually your particular\ncredit card or whatever the card is, okay?\n\n511\n00:27:51.004 --> 00:27:53.558\nIt actually has a unique ID number.\n\n512\n00:27:53.558 --> 00:27:56.585\n&gt;&gt; Well see now, Ronnie, you tricked me,\nI thought you're talking about Peter Pan.\n\n513\n00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:57.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did, yes, exactly, okay?\n\n514\n00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.730\nThe other thing that it\nalso should protect,\n\n515\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.610\nof course, Is even your PIN number.\n\n516\n00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.290\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is your PIN number, okay?\n\n517\n00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:09.670\nNow, over here on, let's see,\non this particular column.\n\n518\n00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.250\nNow, Zach was right,\ncard holder name and service code, okay,\n\n519\n00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.678\nit does protect those two things.\n\n520\n00:28:16.678 --> 00:28:18.670\nRemember that service code?\n\n521\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:19.840\n&gt;&gt; It's that little number on the back.\n\n522\n00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually,\nthere's a couple of them, right?\n\n523\n00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.930\nSo there's actually a service code that's\nactually a little bit different here,\n\n524\n00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.340\nokay, that we have.\n\n525\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.590\nAnd then there's actually\nthe expiration date,\n\n526\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.230\nyou don't wanna give away\nyour expiration date.\n\n527\n00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.610\nWe don't care when you open the account so\nmuch.\n\n528\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.195\nBut that card security code,\nthat's the one on the back.\n\n529\n00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:39.553\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's on the back, yeah.\n\n530\n00:28:39.553 --> 00:28:40.211\n&gt;&gt; That's the one that's on the back here.\n\n531\n00:28:40.211 --> 00:28:43.990\nAnd what about the card provider name,\ndo we really care about that?\n\n532\n00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.569\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, not really.\n\n533\n00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:47.750\nYou don't care if it's this company or\nthis company.\n\n534\n00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.702\n&gt;&gt; The number usually\nidentifies what it is.\n\n535\n00:28:49.702 --> 00:28:52.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so yeah,\nyou don't really care about that.\n\n536\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.660\nBut overall, though, Zach, I wanna\nmake sure I'm telling you right here.\n\n537\n00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.070\nYep, those are all the ones\nthat it does protect here.\n\n538\n00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.326\n&gt;&gt; Well I meant to tell\nyou all the other ones.\n\n539\n00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:00.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but overall, now-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:29:00.317 --> 00:29:01.079\n&gt;&gt; Zach, I didn't do\n\n541\n00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:02.324\nthat to embarrass you, okay?\n\n542\n00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:07.771\nThe goal was this, right, if you\nare taking a look at taking the exam here,\n\n543\n00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:13.750\nthe idea is that you might actually be\ngiven more data than you think, okay?\n\n544\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.889\nAnd for you to be able to identify this,\nit's not as easy as going,\n\n545\n00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:18.360\nlet me just list all these out.\n\n546\n00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.870\nNow it could be, okay?\n\n547\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:24.300\nBut overall though, it might be\nfinding the right information among\n\n548\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.270\na plethora of different\noptions that you have.\n\n549\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.940\nAnd being able to identify those is key.\n\n550\n00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.430\nAnd the only way you can do that\nis by actually studying and\n\n551\n00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.970\nknowing the elements here.\n\n552\n00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.560\nAnd researching that, and\nthen understanding that, as well.\n\n553\n00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.670\nSo that's actually the key\nin what I wanted to show.\n\n554\n00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:45.300\nSo as an exam tip, be ready, be aware,\nfor even some simple things like that.\n\n555\n00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.710\nEasy enough, Zach,\nwe could have gone over the whole list.\n\n556\n00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.951\nIt's no big deal, but at the same time, it\ndoesn't really put things in the context\n\n557\n00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:54.660\nthat you might be facing\nthem in the future, as well.\n\n558\n00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.630\nSo I'm not gonna tell you that's exactly\nhow they will gonna come at you on exam.\n\n559\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.420\nCuz I'd be lying to you if I could\nactually tell you that, but I can't.\n\n560\n00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.510\nBut I can at least tell you that you\nwill face questions that are like that.\n\n561\n00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.880\nWhen there are multiple answers,\ndon't expect that it's just a simple list.\n\n562\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.400\nEven if it is just a simple list that\nthey give you, you're gonna find out.\n\n563\n00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.602\nIt may not be in the right order, and\nwe did that earlier in another show, or\n\n564\n00:30:17.602 --> 00:30:19.220\nanother episode as well,.\n\n565\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.456\nWhere, it was like,\nwhatever order it might be in, but\n\n566\n00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:24.180\nremember the order is important,\nthe order is important.\n\n567\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.750\nYou can't skip that either.\n\n568\n00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.910\nSo understand these elements, right,\nare really going to help us out.\n\n569\n00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.290\nUnderstanding those frameworks is also\ngonna be very important on the exam.\n\n570\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.130\nAs well as, depending on the industry\nthat you end up working in.\n\n571\n00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:40.100\nSo don't overlook them just because they\nsound easy enough to remember, okay?\n\n572\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.300\nSo Zach, that's pretty much it\nin terms of the elements and\n\n573\n00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.240\nframeworks that we're going\nto be taking a look at.\n\n574\n00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job, Identify Cyber\nSec Elements and Frameworks,\n\n575\n00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.232\nwonderful episode.\n\n576\n00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:50.570\nRewatch it,\nI think it's important that you do.\n\n577\n00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.995\nAnd make sure you watch every\nsinge episode of CCNA SECOPS.\n\n578\n00:30:53.995 --> 00:30:56.960\nRonnie's doing amazing with\nhis teaching here, and\n\n579\n00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.660\nit's good information that you'll need for\nthat exam.\n\n580\n00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.220\nGo to our course library, take a look\nat the hundreds of videos there.\n\n581\n00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.740\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n582\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.560\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be mighty glad you did.\n\n583\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.000\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n584\n00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n585\n00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.040\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n586\n00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.969\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:21.923\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.088\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:16.176\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing ITPROTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:19.655\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nthis is CCNA Sec Ops.\n\n6\n00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:23.815\nAnd on this episode,\nwe're gonna describe data normalization.\n\n7\n00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.235\nAnd the person who can help us do that,\nI know him, you know him, and\n\n8\n00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.610\nyou love him, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.270\nHere he is.\nHey, Ronnie, good to see you again.\n\n10\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.660\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you again too, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.510\nThank you again for\n\n12\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.940\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on with CCNA sec ops here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.259\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Zach,\n\n14\n00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:42.590\nas we start that, we wanna talk about\nthis idea of data normalization.\n\n15\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.310\nThat term's gonna kinda\nbe a little bit unusual.\n\n16\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.630\nThe term normalization.\n\n17\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.302\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty broad.\n\n18\n00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:52.050\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty broad as we\nstart to think about this.\n\n19\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.510\nIn the realm of IT, most of the time we\nhear about the idea of data normalization,\n\n20\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.360\nwe normally don't hear it\nin the context of security.\n\n21\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.780\nWe don't hear it in terms of\nsecurity operations a lot.\n\n22\n00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.685\nWe normally hear it in terms of database\nterminology is where we hear about it.\n\n23\n00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.270\nWhen we start building databases and\n\n24\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.580\nwe talk about keeping all of our data\nnormalized is what we normally keep here.\n\n25\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.360\nAnd the goal behind that idea,\nright, inside of databases\n\n26\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.660\nis that we can end up with unusual\nthings that end up happening with that.\n\n27\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.480\nAnd the same thing that happens with data\ninside of databases happens to us also\n\n28\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.320\nin the world of security and monitoring\nand doing all these other stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.670\nSo let me kinda give you an example\nof something here, Zach, as we work.\n\n30\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.150\nLet's say that you and I are, at some\npoint, we're given a contact, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.920\nSomeone comes here to the office.\n\n32\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.280\nLet's say it's somebody relatively,\nlet's say very famous instead.\n\n33\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You and\n\n34\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.490\nI are both given the contact information\nbut on separate occasion, right, but\n\n35\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.360\nit's for the same person, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.210\nNow, Zach, at the very end of that day,\nonce you and I are given it,\n\n37\n00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.980\nand let's say that we entered it into\nour smartphone into the contacts there.\n\n38\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.268\nAnd Zach, you typed in the name\nof whoever that person is.\n\n39\n00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:11.938\nWho would you like to meet, Zach?\n\n40\n00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:12.655\nWho?\n\n41\n00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.742\n&gt;&gt; Irving Berlin.\n\n42\n00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:15.919\n&gt;&gt; Irving Berlin.\n\n43\n00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:16.769\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n44\n00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.670\nlet's say it's Irving Berlin, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.540\nSo Zach and I for one reason or another\nright here at ITPRO.TV studios are meeting\n\n46\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.950\nIrving Berlin, and Zach gets his contact\ninformation and his phone numbers.\n\n47\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.360\nAnd Irvin says, call me when you want to.\n\n48\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.443\nZach writes that down.\n\n49\n00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.700\nHe says the same thing to me, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.877\nBut when I show Zach something,\nZach goes, wait a minute,\n\n51\n00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:41.063\nthat's not the right number.\n\n52\n00:02:41.063 --> 00:02:44.966\nAnd Zach shows me his number and\nthe numbers are different.\n\n53\n00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:49.550\nSo Irving Berlin was kind of given\nus the wrong and false, maybe, or\n\n54\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.850\nat least one of us the wrong information.\n\n55\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.240\nNow who would it, do you think it'd\ngive me the false information or you?\n\n56\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.845\n&gt;&gt; I think I get the wrong information.\n\n57\n00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:02.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, but see-\n&gt;&gt; Also because he's long since passed,\n\n58\n00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:03.885\nit's probably a really\noutdated phone number.\n\n59\n00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably really that, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:05.503 --> 00:03:09.130\nSo that's not exactly great but\nit works okay.\n\n61\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.570\nSo in this instance,\nwell, what has happened?\n\n62\n00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.310\nWell, let's say that we got\nthe information, but it was duplicated.\n\n63\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.880\nBut for Irving when he wrote it down,\nor he typed it in,\n\n64\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.990\nwhatever it is,\nhe just mistyped something.\n\n65\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.630\nBut it's supposed to be\nthe same information,\n\n66\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.355\nit's supposed to be one\npiece of information.\n\n67\n00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:27.180\nHis contact information, but we've got it\nstored in two different locations, well,\n\n68\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.590\nwhich one's actually right?\n\n69\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.400\nYou are I are not gonna be able to tell\nvery easily, okay, who's actually right,\n\n70\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.560\nand who's wrong at some point, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.170\nSo there is a problem then in trying to\nfigure that out, except for us to call and\n\n72\n00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.330\nsee and calling Irving Berlin would\nbe a really long distance call.\n\n73\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.715\nYeah, it would be a very\nlong distance phone call and\n\n74\n00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:46.130\nwe probably wouldn't get an answer,\neither.\n\n75\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.929\nOn either number, we probably\nwouldn't get an answer at this point.\n\n76\n00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n77\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.440\n&gt;&gt; So, that's what we have, right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.130\nSo, that's a problem when data gets stored\nin a couple of different places, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.400\nAnother thing, though, that could happen,\nZach, as we start to take\n\n80\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.350\na look at the information, did it actually\nget corrupted at some point, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.490\nSo let's say that Zach wrote it\ndown on the back of one of these\n\n82\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.550\npaper napkins instead.\n\n83\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.330\nAnd then he got one of those donuts that\nare sitting around here at the office\n\n84\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.955\nalmost on a daily basis.\n\n85\n00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:15.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n86\n00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:18.040\none of those with the jelly-filled stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.550\nAnd he wipes his mouth with it,\nand he goes, my gosh,\n\n88\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.320\nthere's the number, it's gone.\n\n89\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.670\nWhat if he did that?\n\n90\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Interesting visual.\n\n91\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be that now he\ndoesn't have the number anymore, right?\n\n92\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's compromised and in that instance,\n\n93\n00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.840\nif that was only in, and there it is.\n\n94\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.750\nZach has the only information for\nthis contact for this famous person.\n\n95\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.250\nAnd now he's just rubbed his\njelly-filled donut lip on that,\n\n96\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.020\nand he can't read the number anymore,\nokay?\n\n97\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Can't read it at all.\n\n98\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.340\n&gt;&gt; So there, again, data is compromised.\n\n99\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.060\nSo we have to worry about stuff like that\nin terms of data integrity as well, okay?\n\n100\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.335\nAnd it could be ambiguous too.\n\n101\n00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:59.480\nZach, the numbers three and the numbers\neight, when you write them down on\n\n102\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.210\na napkin, may be a little hard\nto distinguish at times, right?\n\n103\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Three, five, eight, yeah,\nall the look the same to me.\n\n104\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.030\n&gt;&gt; So when you start seeing stuff and\nyou're like, my gosh,\n\n105\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.740\nwhat does this number even mean?\n\n106\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\n\n107\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.610\nwe have to actually start\nseeing stuff like that.\n\n108\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.440\nAnd that leads to ambiguity\nin our data as well, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.440\nSo inside of databases,\nwe deal with the same thing.\n\n110\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.190\nBut now imagine,\nlet's turn this around, Zach,\n\n111\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.870\nback into the context of what we're\ntalking about here in terms of security.\n\n112\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.220\nAn event happens, okay, and\n\n113\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.070\nnow Zach is the one that\neverybody's actually reporting to.\n\n114\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.880\nAnd I go, Zach, we actually have this\nparticular thing that may be this attack.\n\n115\n00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.100\nAnd now all of a sudden some other person\ncomes in and says, Zach, Ronnie and\n\n116\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.380\nI were working together and\nwe have this attack.\n\n117\n00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.540\nAnd we both wrote down.\n\n118\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.420\nWe were actually writing\ndown notes at the same time.\n\n119\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.950\nYou got two different sets of that, well,\nwhich one are you gonna choose, Zach?\n\n120\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.060\nSee, that's something else that\nwe actually have to think about.\n\n121\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.880\nSo all of that is actually trying to get\nus to this point of data normalization.\n\n122\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.070\nAnd that means that for\nus to be very good at doing this, right,\n\n123\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.430\nwe want systems that are in place\nthat help us to normalize our data,\n\n124\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.910\nokay, that we are feeding into a system.\n\n125\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.810\nThat we are putting in there, so\n\n126\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.720\nthat the data can actually\nexist in one location, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.720\nIt can reduce any ambiguity that we have.\n\n128\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.190\nWe're not seeing duplicate information,\n\n129\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.680\nwhich we're not sure which one to\nactually be able to choose, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.830\nAnd when we start doing that, we hope that\neverything is actually structured in a way\n\n131\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.920\nthat will make sense, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.590\nSo let's take a look at this process here\nof data normalization just briefly, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.470\nNow the only way to kind of take\na look at this, believe it or\n\n134\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.640\nnot, they do use database terminology\nto a point in doing this, right?\n\n135\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.330\nSo there's normally, what they try to\ngo through especially in databases\n\n136\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.820\nis what we call First, Second,\nand Third Normal Form.\n\n137\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.760\nSecond, first,\nI don't know where my mind was going.\n\n138\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.250\nFirst, Second, and Third Normal Forms\nof data normalization, okay?\n\n139\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.000\nNow the whole goal behind\ngoing through all three, and\n\n140\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.930\nyou wanna make sure you get\nthrough all three of these, right?\n\n141\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.700\nIs it should rid us of any data\nredundancy that exists out there, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.700\nWe should also be able to\nkeep data integrity, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.740\nData should reside in the single location,\nand eliminates ambiguity.\n\n144\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.530\nNow what is it about the data\nresiding a single location?\n\n145\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.410\nIt is now because it becomes\nthe authoritative source\n\n146\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.090\nof where we get the data from.\n\n147\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.355\nNot because you saw Ronnie had scratched\ndown something on the back of his hand.\n\n148\n00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it literally is\n\n149\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.880\nthat we have an authoritative place for\nour information, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.464\nSo when we start talking about First,\nSecond, and Third Normal Form, okay,\n\n151\n00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.393\nwell, we're not going to\nget super deep in this.\n\n152\n00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:45.527\nThe first normal form here, okay,\n\n153\n00:07:45.527 --> 00:07:50.437\nmeans that the data that is\nstored should actually exist\n\n154\n00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:55.351\nin what we call the smallest,\nmeaningful form, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:58.542\nNow, that may not mean much to you and me.\n\n156\n00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:00.903\nWe don't know much about the data.\n\n157\n00:08:00.903 --> 00:08:02.928\nThe database terminology, but\n\n158\n00:08:02.928 --> 00:08:07.700\nwe can actually put too much\ninformation in a single field of data.\n\n159\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.190\nSo let's take for example and\n\n160\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.080\nnow I'll use database terminologies\nbecause it makes it easy.\n\n161\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.570\nLet's take the idea of actually getting\nthat contact information again.\n\n162\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.700\nIf I put first name and last name and\nthen the address and phone number\n\n163\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.440\nall as one piece of information, well\nthat's not the smallest meaningful form.\n\n164\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.610\nI could actually break that\ndown into first name and\n\n165\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.570\nlast name and then I could\nbreak down the street address.\n\n166\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.270\nThen from that point I could\nactually break out the city and\n\n167\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.180\nthe state as well as the zip code which\nI couldn't remember for the life of me.\n\n168\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.420\nZip code and then contact information,\nemail, you name it.\n\n169\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.450\nYou break that up.\n\n170\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.120\nWell all data should exist in\nthe smallest meaningful form.\n\n171\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.550\nYou might wanna know\nwhy is that important?\n\n172\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.250\nBecause if we are entering this into\na management system of some sort of\n\n173\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.450\nwhich most of you will\nend up working with,\n\n174\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.885\nwe have to be able to\nsearch through that data.\n\n175\n00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:58.630\nWell, do I wanna search for\nit by the whole contact information,\n\n176\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.430\nwhich means I have to actually know\nall that before I can do a search for.\n\n177\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.320\nOr would actually rather instead\nsearch for and go, I don't remember\n\n178\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.940\nmuch about anything else that is coming\nI do remember is actually Zach Memos.\n\n179\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.380\nSo, I could actually go into that system\nand just type in Memos, and there it is.\n\n180\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.315\nIt pops up with all the other information,\nokay, so\n\n181\n00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:22.868\nthat's why I wanna store things in the\nsmallest meaningful form as well, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:30.160\nThe second normal form here, okay, is kind\nof more abstract than this way, okay.\n\n183\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.016\nSo, the second one,\nmake sure I'm telling you here.\n\n184\n00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:39.832\nAll, Fields,\n\n185\n00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:49.510\nAre dependent, On the primary key.\n\n186\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.490\nNow, that's not gonna make much\nsense if you don't know much about\n\n187\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.810\nthe idea of databases as well.\n\n188\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.980\nNow let me kind of put this together for\nyou, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.990\nThat means that the data should\nbe interrelated somehow, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.705\nAnd that means they should be meaningful\nto that record that we're keeping, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:09.577\nSo it is contact information that\nshould all be related to the contact\n\n192\n00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:10.425\nZach Memos, okay.\n\n193\n00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:13.455\nAll of that should be\nrelated to that contact.\n\n194\n00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:16.495\nAnd really the primary key\nthat makes Zach's Memos'\n\n195\n00:10:16.495 --> 00:10:19.745\ncontact in my database unique.\n\n196\n00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:24.080\nEvery field in there should be related\nto that one thing that makes it unique.\n\n197\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.290\nAnd that's how we actually discover\nthe exact right record, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.940\nSo that's what this is all about, as well.\n\n199\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.560\nNow, the third one is\nactually closely related.\n\n200\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.810\nYou can't get to the third one\nwithout going through the first and\n\n201\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.275\nsecond forms either, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The third one, it says that no data\n\n203\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.030\nshould be dependent upon another field\nof data, okay, besides a primary key.\n\n204\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:52.215\nSo here, no data,\nField should be dependent,\n\n205\n00:10:57.864 --> 00:11:03.982\nYeah, should be dependent on another\nfield besides the primary key.\n\n206\n00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:15.100\nAll right, now that doesn't really mean\nmuch when you look at it like that.\n\n207\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.370\nThat's a little bit confusing, Ronnie.\n\n208\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.360\nI understand, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.340\nBut the goal and the idea here is\nas we enter in information in for\n\n210\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.010\nour instant management system,\nwhatever it is, okay.\n\n211\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.770\nAll those fields that we have\nto enter in should actually\n\n212\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.480\ngive us that single incident, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.050\nSo it doesn't matter\nwhich field that I pick.\n\n214\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.320\nIt should at least relate me back that one\nincident that I'm actually reporting at\n\n215\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.410\nthis point.\n\n216\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.410\nSo I don't want it to\nactually give me the date\n\n217\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.110\nof something that may relate only because\nthis other field exists in that record.\n\n218\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.290\nBut everything normally reports\nback to that one point or\n\n219\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.310\nthat one instant in my\ndata that I want to, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.340\nSo this is why we want the data that we\nactually use to be in what we like to call\n\n221\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.250\nnormalized form, okay.\n\n222\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.500\nNow, the great thing is, you and\nI don't really have to worry about this\n\n223\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.030\nunless we were actually developing the\napplication to track all this information.\n\n224\n00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.010\nNow, if you are, then yeah, you gotta\nworry about this a little bit more.\n\n225\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.880\nBut most of the time, they just\nwant you to have an understanding\n\n226\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.890\nthat data should actually exists\nto get rid of these redundancies,\n\n227\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.300\nto keep the data integrity, to make\nsure it resides in single location and\n\n228\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.810\neliminate the ambiguities,\nyou'll be perfectly fine.\n\n229\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.540\nBut this is some background information\nthat may help you out as well.\n\n230\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.810\nAnd I hate to say it,\nyou may even see it on the exam, so\n\n231\n00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.770\nI wish I could tell you you're\nnot going to, okay, but I can't.\n\n232\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.860\nSo you may actually remember that too.\n\n233\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.150\nAll right, so that's actually a big\npart of understanding this idea\n\n234\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.660\nof data normalization too okay?\n\n235\n00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.950\nNow, along with this,\nwhen we start talking about this,\n\n236\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.690\nonce we get all of the data to that\npoint where we believe it's normalized,\n\n237\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.230\nwe also need to be able to do\nsomething else as well okay?\n\n238\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.430\nWe want to make sure that the data\nthat comes from the different\n\n239\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.970\ncomponents inside of our security systems,\nokay,\n\n240\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.700\nactually allow us to be able to\nbe interrelated somehow, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.820\nNow what do I mean by that?\n\n242\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.410\nWell if you have a, let's say,\na firewall and its a pfSense firewall.\n\n243\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.130\nAnd yet on your network your\nusing Cisco's switches.\n\n244\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.075\nAnd then you decide you're\ngonna add in the idea of\n\n245\n00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:25.470\nFirepower Management center\nto do something else as well.\n\n246\n00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.440\nAnd then you add in other components\nfrom different vendors all around.\n\n247\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.940\nIt doesn't mean that all of\ntheir information is going to\n\n248\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.060\nbe able to coalesce together and\ngive us all that information, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:42.420\nSo in that sense, right, I might actually\nend up in Firepower Management Center.\n\n250\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.740\nI might be able to pull out certain\ndata from some of these devices, but\n\n251\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.850\nnot everything that I want, and\n\n252\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.800\nyou can see how much the Firepower\nManagement Center really did give us.\n\n253\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.050\nIt was a ton of information\nthat it gives us, but\n\n254\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.010\nit doesn't all necessarily\nreport in that same way.\n\n255\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.390\nSo what we want is we want some ability\nin which if this system says is this,\n\n256\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.220\nthat there is a way that it can\nmatch up to the way that Cisco\n\n257\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.000\ndescribes it in their systems.\n\n258\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.930\nSo we have a way to interpret that data\ninto a more uniform type of format, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.340\nTo, at least for the most common\nvalues to help us to do that.\n\n260\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.830\nOkay, now along with that,\nif we take a look back at my screen, here,\n\n261\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.320\njust briefly, okay.\n\n262\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.190\nSo we need that interpreter, okay and that\ncommon of common data values to help us.\n\n263\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.050\nSecondly, we also need what we\ncall a good data model, as well.\n\n264\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.580\nAnd that means that the data,\nwhen we structure it and\n\n265\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.210\nwhen we store it It should\nbe hierarchical, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.300\nSo it might be where the way that we\nactually choose to have the data reported\n\n267\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.070\nis by device and then within\nthe device we have the operating system\n\n268\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.720\nthat reports whatever it needs to and\nthen from that point,\n\n269\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.800\nall the different software components and\nhardware components as well.\n\n270\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.470\nSo we have to have a hierarchical data\nmodel that allows us to structure\n\n271\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.610\nthe data in a way that will make sense,\nokay.\n\n272\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.530\nNow in a real world type\nof example of that instead.\n\n273\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.320\nLet's take for example that we\nare using something like NetFlow.\n\n274\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.694\nWe have an intrusion prevention\nsystem on our network.\n\n275\n00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:16.230\nWe also have other server\nlogs that are out there.\n\n276\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.280\nWe also are running firewalls\nthat are out there as well.\n\n277\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.420\nThese two in the middle, I don't know\nwhy this one didn't, let's get it going.\n\n278\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.500\n&gt;&gt; Box?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n279\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.860\nIt didn't go into a box but\nwhatever, that's probably me,\n\n280\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.440\nI did something weird somehow, some way.\n\n281\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.370\n&gt;&gt; That's a very nice box.\n\n282\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:32.900\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n283\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.040\n&gt;&gt; More of a rectangle, but whatever.\n\n284\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that will work, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.521\nSo these two systems right here in\nthe middle, they actually can communicate\n\n286\n00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:44.901\nwith all of these different types\nof data that's coming into them.\n\n287\n00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:49.143\nThey can interpret, but they actually\nprovide a model that says send it to me,\n\n288\n00:15:49.143 --> 00:15:52.163\nbut let's make sure we break\nthis stuff down as well, so\n\n289\n00:15:52.163 --> 00:15:56.084\nthat I can actually use it and then\nspit out the information that we want,\n\n290\n00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:58.691\nthat Zach wants to actually\nbe reported out on.\n\n291\n00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:01.463\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie could you once\nagain explain what SIEM is?\n\n292\n00:16:01.463 --> 00:16:06.456\nYeah that's actually our idea here\nof a monitoring system, the security\n\n293\n00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:11.784\nintrusion event management or a security\nincident event management system.\n\n294\n00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:16.237\nAnd essentially is our main dashboard that\nallows us to get communications from all\n\n295\n00:16:16.237 --> 00:16:20.980\nthese different things that will help us\nto manage and report on these things too.\n\n296\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.969\nSpLunk pretty much does kind\nof the same things as well.\n\n297\n00:16:23.969 --> 00:16:26.772\nSo all these can actually tie together,\nand\n\n298\n00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:31.394\neven though all these may be different\nhardware venders they have a way of\n\n299\n00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:37.125\nhierarchically reporting their information\nthat these systems can make sense of them.\n\n300\n00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:40.120\nSo, in a sense,\nit has to work together in this way.\n\n301\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.320\nSo all of those other systems,\nthey go ahead and say,\n\n302\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.060\nwhen we send data out,\nwe're gonna send it out\n\n303\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.570\nin a way that can be interpreted\nas these common data values.\n\n304\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.180\nSo, we have methods and most of\nthe components say that work have those\n\n305\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.310\nbuilt in, but\nwe also need a good data model.\n\n306\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.560\nThat's pretty much gonna be hierarchical.\n\n307\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.495\nWell, if we go back to the practical\nexample here, well, both of these systems\n\n308\n00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:14.411\nright here in the middle essentially\nare the good data models.\n\n309\n00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:16.206\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you can take what we actually give\n\n310\n00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:18.290\nand report what we want to.\n\n311\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:23.990\nAll these other systems\nare already reporting and\n\n312\n00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.620\ninterpreting those events in the common\nvalues that we can understand and know.\n\n313\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.456\nNow this actually leads us to\nanother topic in which we do adjust,\n\n314\n00:17:32.456 --> 00:17:37.109\ninside of [INAUDIBLE] here, which we\ntalk about the idea of the vera schema.\n\n315\n00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:37.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n316\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the vera schema.\n\n317\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.970\nSo because a lot of systems and\nmore vendors are coming onboard,\n\n318\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:49.100\npretty much every day, to help us out,\nthat what they're starting to do,\n\n319\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.440\nwhat a lot of vendors are starting to do\nis say hey, we're gonna report our data in\n\n320\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.430\nthat vera schema, and then software that's\nactually designed to handle these reports,\n\n321\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.458\nthey're also gonna follow that\nvera schema model as well.\n\n322\n00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:05.350\nSo instead of really having to actually\njust do the interpretation now,\n\n323\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.890\nall vendor, not every vendor, but\na lot of vendors are actually saying,\n\n324\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.690\nlet's do that, let's use this vera schema\nto help us to make sure that we're doing\n\n325\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.340\nall that information and\nshowing all that as well.\n\n326\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.620\nNow once we get that all done here,\nI'm trying to see right there, so once all\n\n327\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:27.010\nthat is actually done, then that's where\nwe start to actually use those systems\n\n328\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.400\nthat we have in place to be able to check\nand understand the data that comes in.\n\n329\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.480\nDon't take for granted that when you\nenter something into a search that it's\n\n330\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.890\nhappening just because it's magically\nhappening in the background.\n\n331\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.398\nIt is because data normalization\nhas already occurred, and\n\n332\n00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:47.142\nthe reason why is that all those systems,\nwhat they really are in the background,\n\n333\n00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:51.542\nZach, is a big gigantic database is\nwhat they really are in the background,\n\n334\n00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:56.014\nand then the management consoles, and\nthe information that we're seeing,\n\n335\n00:18:56.014 --> 00:19:00.390\nall that really is the idea of the data\nmodel in which it reports it out to us.\n\n336\n00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.199\nSo it does give us everything that we\nnormally need, but just realize that's\n\n337\n00:19:04.199 --> 00:19:08.301\nwhat works hand in hand, is understanding\na little bit about the theory behind it,\n\n338\n00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:12.111\nand then of course seeing the end result,\nand we've seen it multiple times,\n\n339\n00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:15.277\nwhether we've been using the threat\ngrid management there, or\n\n340\n00:19:15.277 --> 00:19:17.681\nthe FirePower Management Center,\nyou name it,\n\n341\n00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:20.707\nall those things are possible\nin what we actually need to do.\n\n342\n00:19:20.707 --> 00:19:22.742\nBut Zach that's actually\na good understanding-\n\n343\n00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:23.286\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n344\n00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:27.317\n&gt;&gt; Of idea of the data normalization,\nas well as the data models that we might\n\n345\n00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:30.647\nactually encounter inside of\nSecurity Operations Center.\n\n346\n00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job as usual Ronnie.\n\n347\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.270\nDescribe data normalization,\nwonderful episode, and\n\n348\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.550\nmake sure you watch all\nthe episodes of CCNA sec ops.\n\n349\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.682\nVisit our course

Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.160\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.740\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nand this is CCNA SECOPS.\n\n7\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.140\nAnd we're gonna describe five-tuple\ncorrelation with the one and\n\n8\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.290\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.057\nHe's right here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.414\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I understand that we're\n\n11\n00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:27.770\nstarting off with a quiz.\n\n12\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.180\n&gt;&gt; We really are, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.962\nWe've already talked about this idea\nof the five-tuples really throughout\n\n14\n00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:33.959\nthe entire series.\n\n15\n00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:35.250\n&gt;&gt; Lots of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n16\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.260\n&gt;&gt; And I have mentioned it, like I said,\nI know probably 30 times at least.\n\n17\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.310\n&gt;&gt; At least.\n&gt;&gt; Throughout the series as well.\n\n18\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.370\nAnd it is something important.\n\n19\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.210\nYou might be going well,\nwhy are you doing it again then, Ronnie?\n\n20\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.120\nWell, cuz even though we've actually\nshowed it to you in the context,\n\n21\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.292\nwe also just need to make sure that\nwe get across just a few concepts.\n\n22\n00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:53.970\nNot gonna take long, so\n\n23\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.490\nyou already feel like I already\nunderstand about five tuples,\n\n24\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.600\nyou're probably not gonna hurt my feelings\nif you skip this particular episode.\n\n25\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.750\nOf course, love for\nyou to watch the whole thing.\n\n26\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.080\nSo let's start off with this\nwhole idea of a quiz, so\n\n27\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.790\nlet's go back here and\nwe'll start to take a look.\n\n28\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.030\nSo if you haven't been watching the entire\nseries back to back back to back\n\n29\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.970\nback to back.\n\n30\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.410\nAll the way through, you might actually\nbe a little bit troubled by this one.\n\n31\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.830\nSo which of the following elements, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700\nWhich of the following are elements\nof the 5-tuple information?\n\n33\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.440\nSo it's likely, Zach,\nthat if I were to throw a whole list\n\n34\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.000\nof different things, okay, that we would\nactually want to make sure here, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.140\nThat we could identify some\nof these elements here and\n\n36\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.790\nunderstand which of these are actually the\npart of that five tuple of information.\n\n37\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now you have a couple of things thatyou\n\n38\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.240\ncan do, right,\nif you're facing something like this.\n\n39\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.779\nAnd let's say in the near future\nthat you might be able to do.\n\n40\n00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.269\nIf you don't know exactly which one it is,\nyou haven't watched this show because I\n\n41\n00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:59.600\nknow I've mentioned at least like I said,\n30 times or so at some point.\n\n42\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.810\nBut you can do some of the processes\nelimination that you might right now.\n\n43\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.340\nI don't think it's the Timestamp, so\nI can actually kind of eliminate that one.\n\n44\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.850\nAll right, Zach, did that help much?\n\n45\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there you go.\n\n46\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.040\nSo we can actually do something like that.\n\n47\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.150\nNow the other thing that I can also do is\nthat I know some of the technology here.\n\n48\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.120\nThe SigID right here, right,\nwhen we start to take a look at that,\n\n49\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.580\nI know that that's probably not in my\n5-tuple of information specifically.\n\n50\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.120\nBut I do see it along with\nthe 5-tuple of information.\n\n51\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.860\nWhen I take at well, logs inside\nof something like an IPS, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.700\nIn an IPS, normally because it based\n\n53\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.710\noff a signature definitions,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n54\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.640\n&gt;&gt; Has to signal the signature ID or\nthe SigID here,\n\n55\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.630\nyou might see that as well along\nwith the 5-tuple of information.\n\n56\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.670\nBut remember, it's not necessary\na part of that 5-tuple of information.\n\n57\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.800\nThat 5-tuple of information itself.\n\n58\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.857\nNow on a firewall, you're not\ngonna see a signature ID at all.\n\n59\n00:02:59.857 --> 00:03:06.080\nBut in IPS though, you might, so\nthat can actually do that as well.\n\n60\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.630\nNow, the other things I noticed,\nlike on Cisco switches and\n\n61\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.460\non Cisco routers,\nI do know that there are severity levels\n\n62\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.490\nin terms of the information that\nwe do get from our systems.\n\n63\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.200\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n&gt;&gt; Through the login that they have.\n\n64\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.890\nBut that's not part of\nthe 5-tuple as well.\n\n65\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n66\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.110\n&gt;&gt; So that really does leave me now with,\nthe great thing is,\n\n67\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.040\nit looks like if I've done this right,\nZach.\n\n68\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.800\nSix choices and\nfive of them have to be correct, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n70\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.400\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n71\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.140\nZach, when we start to take a look here,\nI can probably figure it out.\n\n72\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.510\nNow if you're watching the show,\nthis is a breeze.\n\n73\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.250\nIf you haven't,\n\n74\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.820\nthat's a little bit more costly in terms\nof what you might be facing in the future.\n\n75\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.370\nBut this one, if I eliminate this,\nthe app ID, okay.\n\n76\n00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.740\nNow that one I just made up.\n\n77\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.170\nSo in other words,\nI don't remember looking at logs and\n\n78\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.970\nseeing App ID anywhere.\n\n79\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it might be,\n\n80\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.200\nI don't care what it is.\n\n81\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.762\nIt might say green elephant for\nall I know, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:06.221\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't pick the one that you go and\n\n83\n00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:07.880\nthat makes you chuckle.\n\n84\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.768\nIf you pick the one that makes\nyou chuckle, you're wrong.\n\n85\n00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:10.440\n&gt;&gt; It's probably wrong.\n\n86\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably not good, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.510\nSo now hopefully what is left, right,\nby the process of elimination itself\n\n88\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.830\nare going to be part of your\n5-tuple of information.\n\n89\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.570\nWhich includes source IP and\nof course, the source port,\n\n90\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.280\ndestination IP, and\nthe destination port as well, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.140\nSo we should see that, and\nthen the last one here is protocol.\n\n92\n00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.140\nBut remember that when\nyou see most systems,\n\n93\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.800\nespecially one we're looking at, right?\n\n94\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.940\nWe're seeing it inside of WireShark,\nwe're seeing it inside\n\n95\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.870\nof FirePower Management Center,\nwe're seeing this in IPS entries.\n\n96\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.210\nWe're seeing this in, and\nI said firewalls, right?\n\n97\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.160\nSo you're seeing it on different places,\nand\n\n98\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.510\nthe whole goal of course is to actually\nfigure out some other information.\n\n99\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.010\nBut right here at least know that if you\n\n100\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.220\nhave somehow gotten all\nthrough SecOps to this point.\n\n101\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.810\nI really don't know what\nthe 5-tuples are ,then\n\n102\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.170\nI think that somewhere along the line\nyou did skip just a few episodes.\n\n103\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.720\nIn between here and there, so this is kind\nof at least one place that you can go\n\n104\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.100\nI know what this is actually about.\n\n105\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.780\n&gt;&gt; So running just real quick here.\n\n106\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.045\nLet's say someone is just joining us and\nthey haven't seen previous episodes.\n\n107\n00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:20.557\n&gt;&gt; Right, sure.\n\n108\n00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Tuple, can you explain to us, please?\n\n109\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.000\nTuple.\n\n110\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.817\n&gt;&gt; It's an element of information.\n\n111\n00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's a database terminology.\n\n112\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; About the idea of columns of\n\n113\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.760\ninformation that we have\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.072\n&gt;&gt; More than anything else, but\n\n115\n00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:35.860\nhere that's what they called\nthe five tuples of information.\n\n116\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.840\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n117\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.590\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see where that comes in, too.\n\n118\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.762\nAll right, so Zach, let's kind of\nturn this around a little bit more.\n\n119\n00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:45.210\nOkay, so this is not a long quiz,\njust two questions,\n\n120\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.980\npretty much, cuz one, I couldn't think of\nany more off right off the top of my head,\n\n121\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.650\ncuz we went over it so many times.\n\n122\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.570\nBut here, what is the purpose\nof the 5-tuple data, okay.\n\n123\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.230\nSo, I guess I could've put that all on\none line, I was like why'd I do that?\n\n124\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.780\nSo it's just me typing in\na little bit strangely here.\n\n125\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.160\nWhat is the purpose of 5-tuple data, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.370\nWell, A, does it help me identify malware?\n\n127\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.750\nMaybe, if I haven't been watching\nthe show, that may be a possibility.\n\n128\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.520\nUnresponsive host, and once again and\n\n129\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.258\nI haven't been watching\na channel as possible.\n\n130\n00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; C, I don't know.\n\n131\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.130\nThat sounds neat.\n\n132\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.960\nLet's leave that one as a possible.\n\n133\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.160\nAnd D, the Attacker.\n\n134\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.910\nWell, if I'm working in a security\noperations center, I may just say hey,\n\n135\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.930\nit's gotta be the attacker cuz we're\nsecuring against what, attackers.\n\n136\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n137\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems good, okay.\n\n138\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.710\nNow, if I know what the 5-tuples\nof data are though,\n\n139\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.730\nI can tell which one of these\nare actually the right answer.\n\n140\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.294\nSo if I tell you, Zach,\nthat I am talking about a source and\n\n141\n00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:53.741\nthe destination, IP address and port, and\n\n142\n00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:56.855\nthe protocol that we're using-\n&gt;&gt; I got it, yeah.\n\n143\n00:06:56.855 --> 00:07:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there, okay,\nZach, which one is it?\n\n144\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Data flow.\n\n145\n00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.050\n&gt;&gt; Data flow, yeah.\n\n146\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.060\nSee, there you go.\n\n147\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.580\nVery good, Zach.\n\n148\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.670\nSo there it is.\n\n149\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.990\nAnd that's probably because you've\nheard me say it about 30 times.\n\n150\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.680\n&gt;&gt; 30 times.\n\n151\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.515\n&gt;&gt; At least.\n\n152\n00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:12.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's five tuples of data.\n\n153\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.510\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n154\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.200\nSo when you start to see this idea,\nright, don't be flustered by it.\n\n155\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.700\nBut just kind of realize, if you know that\ninformation, then all you have to do is\n\n156\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.435\nkind of go, all right, if I'm not sure\nexactly, they sound close, right.\n\n157\n00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n158\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.859\n&gt;&gt; You'll be all right.\nBut I'm given IP address, source and\n\n159\n00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:31.410\ndestination.\n\n160\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.532\nIt has nothing to do will malware, okay.\n\n161\n00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:34.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.000\n&gt;&gt; An unresponsive\n\n163\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.640\nhost is not gonna show me either,\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n164\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.940\n&gt;&gt; What a source or destination IP.\n\n165\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.500\nSo that's probably not gonna help me out.\n\n166\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.742\nThe attacker, I probably don't\nhave a source IP as well, so\n\n167\n00:07:45.742 --> 00:07:47.598\nI'm probably not gonna get that.\n\n168\n00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:50.289\n&gt;&gt; And how do you know\n[INAUDIBLE] analyzing the data.\n\n169\n00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:51.508\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n170\n00:07:51.508 --> 00:07:56.230\nall of this is actually fairly easy\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n171\n00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.780\nSo in this aspect, you can see\nwhere the data does correlate and\n\n172\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.330\nwhat we normally use it for,\nis to help us to identify this.\n\n173\n00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now, to take a look at it once again,\n\n174\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.590\nand this time we're gonna use\nthe FirePower Management Center again,\n\n175\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.020\nif I can make it pop back up on my screen.\n\n176\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.587\nWe wanna take a look at where we can\nsee of course, the five tuple of\n\n177\n00:08:17.587 --> 00:08:22.960\ndata working for us inside of\nthe FirePower management center as well.\n\n178\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.830\nIf I select analysis, which I'm going to\ndo right now, and just give it a moment.\n\n179\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.620\nCuz knowing me,\nI get a little bit impatient, and\n\n180\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.590\nthat means the data doesn't\nshow up when I want it to.\n\n181\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.520\nAnd at that point it makes it really\nfrustrating cuz I'm just waiting there.\n\n182\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.780\nSo at this point here, there it goes,\nstarting to show up, we're starting to see\n\n183\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.520\na little bit more information coming in,\nbut it's still loading.\n\n184\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.260\nSo I just need to be a little bit patient.\n\n185\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.540\nI hate to do that, but there it is, okay?\n\n186\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.319\nSo now this all shown up, if I select,\n\n187\n00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:57.280\nmake sure I'm under intrusions and events.\n\n188\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.930\nSo up on the top there,\nintrusions and events here.\n\n189\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.570\nNow I've got to wait one more time and\n\n190\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.690\nactually see some of the other\nevents that we can see.\n\n191\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.780\nAnd then once you take a look at\nthe five tuple of information and\n\n192\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.690\nremember that what this\nreally helps us to do, right?\n\n193\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.550\nIt's because we're\ntalking about data flow,\n\n194\n00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.050\nit can really help us to identify\nespecially we're start seeing a lot of\n\n195\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.610\nthe same five tuple of information\nbetween source and destination.\n\n196\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.300\nIt might really help us to identify\nthat an attack is going on, or\n\n197\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.420\nat least that one stream of data we might\nwant to look a little bit more into it.\n\n198\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n199\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Once I'm inside of the intrusion and\n\n200\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.400\nthe events, I'm gonna switch\nto the table view of events.\n\n201\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.610\nAnd you'll see again, it's the waiting and\n\n202\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.560\njust having to slow down a little\nbit even though I wanna speed up.\n\n203\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.750\nBecause I want you to see\nthe information immediately,\n\n204\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.530\nyou're just not always gonna get that.\n\n205\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.123\nBut we can see it right here.\n\n206\n00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:54.947\n[INAUDIBLE] Pretty, okay.\n\n207\n00:09:54.947 --> 00:10:00.310\nAll right, so Zach, as I start to take a\nlook at some information over here, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.330\nLet's see if we can discover the five\ntuples that we're looking for.\n\n209\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:09.210\nSource IP, Destination IP,\nthese all look the same.\n\n210\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.280\nActually, 224, that actually looks\nlike a multi cast address here.\n\n211\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.180\nLet's see if I can find something,\n\n212\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.090\nactually that will work\njust as an example.\n\n213\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.760\nNow, look at that,\nsource port destination.\n\n214\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.090\nIt's all IGMP, so\nthat's actually the multi cast data there.\n\n215\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n216\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.760\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen I need a protocol somewhere else.\n\n217\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.901\nThere's also a protocol right over here,\ntoo, okay.\n\n218\n00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:36.525\nBy looking taking a look\nat all that information,\n\n219\n00:10:36.525 --> 00:10:40.440\nwe can see and\nit says potentially bad traffic.\n\n220\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.350\nNow what in the world would be sending\nthat much traffic to this multicast\n\n221\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.640\naddress from a single IP\naddress right here, okay?\n\n222\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.260\nSo that's where you can start to go hey,\nthat's kind of unusual.\n\n223\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.010\nAnd the nice thing about the way that\nit's working in FirePower management here\n\n224\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.920\nis when we start to take a look.\n\n225\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.450\nNotice the classification,\nit's already seeing it as potentially bad.\n\n226\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.260\nSo it's not saying I\ndon't know what it is,\n\n227\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.320\nbut it does say it's\npotentially bad at this point.\n\n228\n00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.580\nSo all that traffic, now if I,\nlet me see if I clicked on it again, yep.\n\n229\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.290\nSo now if I click on that,\n\n230\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.536\nI should in just a moment here\nsee some of the other things too.\n\n231\n00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:22.486\nI can also see some of the IP\noptions were also set,\n\n232\n00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:26.154\nwhich is normally [INAUDIBLE]\nwe don't see very often as well.\n\n233\n00:11:26.154 --> 00:11:26.746\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:27.723\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n235\n00:11:27.723 --> 00:11:32.496\nlet's see, actually it don't look like it\nshowed me very much of anything else here.\n\n236\n00:11:32.496 --> 00:11:37.934\nSnort decoder, yep, it looks like it just\nfiltered it out for me, that's all it did.\n\n237\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:39.769\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I had to say that.\n\n238\n00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:42.080\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's fine.\n\n239\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can see where at least this\n\n240\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.100\nis an example and\nthat's what you're looking for, right?\n\n241\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.600\nIs you're looking for\nDNS potential bad as well as known bad.\n\n242\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.450\nAnd then you're gonna see how\nFirePower management center and\n\n243\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.270\nall the other utilities just hook in was\nable to spot it and use that information.\n\n244\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.330\nJust like right here, all the data that\nwe have in place, it was able to use that\n\n245\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.630\nfive tuple of information to,\nwe're gonna see at least at this point.\n\n246\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.850\nTo identify what we needed later on,\n\n247\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.910\nespecially with FirePower\nmanagement center.\n\n248\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.110\nWe'll see if it actually does turn in to\nsomething that is now gonna be identified\n\n249\n00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.580\nas being bad, at that point, it will\nalso do the mitigation without you and\n\n250\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.120\nme having to step in.\n\n251\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.620\nSo the great thing about that information,\nright,\n\n252\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.190\nis that it really does actually involve so\nmany different systems and everything.\n\n253\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.480\nI won't say everything, a lot of things\nare based around having that solid\n\n254\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.450\nbasis of that information\nbetween those two systems.\n\n255\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.190\nAnd once we have that,\nwe can now establish that flow pattern\n\n256\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.530\nbetween the attacker,\nas well as the potential target.\n\n257\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.030\nAnd that's what we wanna do with the tuple\nor the 5-tuple of information too.\n\n258\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job, Ronnie.\n\n259\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.070\nDescribe 5-tuple correlation and\nit's gonna be important on the exam,\n\n260\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.250\nso make sure you go over that again.\n\n261\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.530\nAnd watch every single episode\nof the CCNA Sec Op series.\n\n262\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.340\nVisit our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there,\n\n263\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.850\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n264\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.500\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n265\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.960\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n266\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.274\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.739\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:20.703\nI'm your host Zach Memos, and\nthis is CCNA Firepower Management Console,\n\n6\n00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:22.650\nthe title of the episode.\n\n7\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.592\nAnd we've asked our IT Pro and\nall around good guy,\n\n8\n00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.300\nRonnie Wong to tell us\nall about Firepower.\n\n9\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.982\nLet's hear about it.\n\n10\n00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:33.435\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach, thank you for having\nme back on the show as we take a look at\n\n11\n00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:37.397\nthe idea here with the Firepower\nManagement Console, or Center,\n\n12\n00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:41.680\ndepending on who you ask,\nwhen you start to take a look at this.\n\n13\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.350\nThe reason why we want to dive into it is\nthat we've already seen this, if you've\n\n14\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.670\nbeen watching this series from beginning\nto end, you've seen it multiple times.\n\n15\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.060\nBut once again, toward the end of our\nseries is a little bit of a wrap-up and\n\n16\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.810\nrefresher of some of the things that we\nneed to just keep our minds wrapped into,\n\n17\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.600\nand the details about what we can\nactually look for and find out.\n\n18\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.630\nNow, in the Firepower Management Console\nor Center that you'll end up seeing here,\n\n19\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.150\nright, is that it is probably\none of the best tools that's\n\n20\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.590\navailable out on the market today,\nhands down.\n\n21\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.680\nOkay, I mean, this thing is,\nit really can show you just about\n\n22\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.820\neverything that goes on on your network,\nand it can show you\n\n23\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.220\nevery facet of everything that goes on\nin your network, and it is amazing.\n\n24\n00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.050\nIt is really designed with the ideas here\nof preventing attacks from happening,\n\n25\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.150\nof mitigating attacks even while they're\nhappening, as close as we can get to.\n\n26\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.562\nEven the idea of retrospection,\nother words, what can we do about it after\n\n27\n00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:42.014\nthe attack has gone on, and\nwhat can we learn from it?\n\n28\n00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:46.862\nIt can take all that information and feed\nit into a system that then feeds it into\n\n29\n00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:51.783\nother security intelligence systems to\nmake the product better without you and\n\n30\n00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:54.589\nI having to manually do\na ton of things right.\n\n31\n00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:55.581\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n32\n00:01:55.581 --> 00:02:00.011\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's all based on not only\nthe equipment that you have on hand but\n\n33\n00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:03.910\nalso the software and\nthe process that they've gotten to.\n\n34\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.477\nWhere now you're connected together\nthrough a subscription as well,\n\n35\n00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:11.519\nwhich gives you access to more than you've\never bargained for or thought about,\n\n36\n00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.190\nas you're dealing with some of\nthe different security threats, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.090\nSo, understanding a little bit more\nabout some of the details that you,\n\n38\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.660\nas an entry-level technician might do,\nan analyst might be able to do,\n\n39\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.990\nthat's what we wanna get\nto in this episode, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.690\nIs that,\nif you are given access to Firepower,\n\n41\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.690\nif you're gonna be working with this,\nit's great, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.890\nIt's an opportunity for\n\n43\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.430\nyou to learn a tool that is\ngonna be insanely helpful, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.000\nIt's gonna be so broad-reaching,\n\n45\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.100\nyou're not gonna actually\nbelieve all the stuff it can do.\n\n46\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.170\nBut at the same time,\nlearning how to actually use it and\n\n47\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.980\ngetting better with it, is actually\ngonna help you in the future as well.\n\n48\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.043\n&gt;&gt; Now Firepower, typically,\n\n49\n00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:53.030\nisn't that found in enterprise situations\nbecause it's rather costly, right?\n\n50\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.813\n&gt;&gt; It is rather costly, most individuals\nare not gonna be able to afford Firepower\n\n51\n00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:59.079\nin terms of just something\nto play around with.\n\n52\n00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.579\n&gt;&gt; More expensive than a milkshake then,\nin other words.\n\n53\n00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.527\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little bit more expensive\nthan a milkshake that comes with\n\n54\n00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:09.282\na side of an Escalade, so\njust kind of be aware of that.\n\n55\n00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:13.400\nYeah, it's a little bit on the pricey\nside, it's worth its weight.\n\n56\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.100\nIt really is, especially if you need to\nprotect your network and your enterprise.\n\n57\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.240\nIt is a beautiful conglomeration of things\n\n58\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.660\nthat Cisco has brought together to give\nan advanced threat protection solution.\n\n59\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.500\nYou name it, it all pretty\nmuch is managed through here.\n\n60\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.100\n&gt;&gt; It's worth it.\n\n61\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.990\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we actually\nwant to take a look.\n\n62\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.730\nWe're not gonna be spending a ton of time\non this because we've already gone Much\n\n63\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.990\nmore than what we're doing here, but as\na reminder of some of the things as well.\n\n64\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.900\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at my PC here, and\n\n65\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.600\nthis is normally how you encounter\nis through a web interface.\n\n66\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.920\nNormally when you first log in\nyou'll get this first page here,\n\n67\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.160\nunder overview, and notice that there's\nactually different tabs as we move along.\n\n68\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.080\nLet me zoom in just a little bit more so\nthat we can see it.\n\n69\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.030\nThere's different things,\n\n70\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.560\nand each one as you take a look,\nbesides overview here, right?\n\n71\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.660\nNotice how I hit the Analysis, there's\nactually buttons underneath that go all\n\n72\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.010\nthe way across, and even off my screen\ncuz I'm zoomed in just a little bit more.\n\n73\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.350\nPolicies, Devices, Objects,\n\n74\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.970\nthere's a lot of information that we\nnormally end up seeing right here, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.400\nAnd this particular overview, Shows us so\nmuch information, even underneath.\n\n76\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.180\nNotice that we have networks, threats,\nintrusion events, status, geolocation,\n\n77\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.590\nquality of service.\n\n78\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.310\nThere is so much information,\nit can be overwhelming.\n\n79\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.480\nThere is no doubt we can see it, but\n\n80\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.080\nit's also very helpful as you scroll\ndown here and you see that dashboard.\n\n81\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.540\nIt can show you some different stuff\nthat we're probably not used to seeing,\n\n82\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.010\nusing some of the tools that we might\nhave actually kind of come up with,\n\n83\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.540\ncome along and\ngrowing up in terms of security.\n\n84\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.040\n&gt;&gt; There might be a lot of data there, but\n\n85\n00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.860\nthey've made it very easy to read,\nI think.\n\n86\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.800\n&gt;&gt; They really did, using the dashboard\nmakes it easy for you to be able to see.\n\n87\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.550\nSo for example, traffic by\napplication [INAUDIBLE] categories.\n\n88\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.510\nYou can even see some of these that are\nnetwork protocol services, web browsing,\n\n89\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.160\nemail.\n\n90\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.330\nI mean, just the category of events\n\n91\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.040\nby particular users that\nyou may also end up seeing.\n\n92\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.260\nYou name it, there's actually tons\nof information that we end up\n\n93\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.900\nHaving to take a look at.\n\n94\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.550\nBut what do we really want to be able to\ndo if we're actually gonna be the security\n\n95\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.130\noperations analyst that ends up working,\nokay?\n\n96\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.040\nWell, we might want to be able\nto find out if we can identify\n\n97\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.100\na compromised host on our network, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.480\nThat's pretty much what\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n99\n00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.930\nAnd the way that we do that is we can\nclick on Analysis At least I think I can.\n\n100\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.500\nOkay?\n\n101\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.160\nAnalysis, and inside of analysis,\nI'm gonna leave it as it's default here,\n\n102\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.750\nunder the context explorer.\n\n103\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.150\nOkay?\n\n104\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.290\nNow, when I do this,\nit's loading up the information right now.\n\n105\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.940\nAll the data that's gone by.\n\n106\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.310\nAnd currently in the past hour,\nyou can see all of this information And\n\n107\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.260\nhere's the traffic and the overtime.\n\n108\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.180\nThis is just over the last hour.\n\n109\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.940\nSo my network's been pretty busy according\nto what you are actually seeing here.\n\n110\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.540\nThen you also of course have this\nblue line which also shows you other\n\n111\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.820\ntraffic as well.\n\n112\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.910\nSo you name it, there's actually\ntraffic and then there's events.\n\n113\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.080\nSo it looks like about 10-19 over here.\n\n114\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.190\nA high time of 880 intrusion\n\n115\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.900\npossible events that may have actually\nhappened on the network at one time.\n\n116\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.380\nThis is in the past hour, Zach, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.940\nSo it's a little bit hefty in what you\ncan actually end up seeing here, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.970\nBut notice if I scroll down.\n\n119\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.440\nSo let me not get the run over by the\namount of data that we're seeing there.\n\n120\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But if I scroll down a little bit,\n\n121\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.900\nthis particular section where it\nsays indications of compromise,\n\n122\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.950\nI'm looking for the idea of host.\n\n123\n00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.700\nAnd look at that,\n\n124\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.560\nhost by indication There certain ones\nthat threats have been detected.\n\n125\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.900\nLooks like another kind of threat and\n\n126\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.060\nit's hard to actually see so\nhere let me do that.\n\n127\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.880\nNotice malware detected.\n\n128\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.860\nIn that particular sliver of 7%, 5 hosts\nthey actually detected some malware.\n\n129\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.370\nIf I scroll down here, threat detected\nin the file transfer, about 34%, yikes.\n\n130\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.330\nAnd then here, an impact 2 attack,\nan intrusion event.\n\n131\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.950\nAttempted admin access about 43 or 59%.\n\n132\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.300\nYou know, these are an indication.\n\n133\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Good, Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.140\n&gt;&gt; They are not exactly good and\nexactly what we're looking for, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.900\nBut that helps me to narrow down in\nrealizing there's a lot of attacks that\n\n136\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.400\nhave been happening over\nthe past hour on this network.\n\n137\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.720\nNow what about finding a specific host If\nI scroll over here, okay, to the right and\n\n138\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.720\nwe'll probably have to full screen just\nto make sure that we can see this here.\n\n139\n00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.040\nOkay, now notice Zach that each\n\n140\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.600\none of these actually represents\na particular machine on my network.\n\n141\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.825\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I can go in and I can identify\n\n142\n00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.111\n&gt;&gt; That this one.\n\n143\n00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:13.640\nThis 10.0.47.10 okay?\n\n144\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.630\nIt has almost two indications that\nthere is some type of attack.\n\n145\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.060\nAnother one up here.\n\n146\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.580\nAll of these are ones that I might want\nto go in an examine a little bit more.\n\n147\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.260\n&gt;&gt; As well as these other ones that\nhave a single indication as well, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.320\nBut from here,\nif I wanted to identify that first one and\n\n149\n00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.990\nfind out more information I normally can,\nlet me see, okay.\n\n150\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.580\nI have to kinda single-click.\n\n151\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.180\nI was trying a thing where\nI right-clicked or not.\n\n152\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.960\nBut I just click on it\n&gt;&gt; I can even\n\n153\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.880\nselect these options down here.\n\n154\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.490\nDrill in the analysis itself, view\nthe host information or even Whois there.\n\n155\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.830\nI'm going to select view host information.\n\n156\n00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.060\nWhen I do that, it's now retrieving\nall that datasys is going\n\n157\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.930\nto allow me to see and identify maybe\nthis particular compromised host here.\n\n158\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.460\n&gt;&gt; So it does take a bit of time because\nit's gathering all that information.\n\n159\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.670\nAnd it will bring me up\nto this Host Profile.\n\n160\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.010\nAnd within the Host Profile itself, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.750\nWe can start seeing, I even can tell you\nwho the current user is, right here, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.770\nWe can tell you who the current user is.\n\n163\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.780\nI can even see the indications of\ncompromise, Threat Detected by AMP for\n\n164\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.910\nEndpoints, in other words\nthe antivirus software.\n\n165\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.810\nAnd Threat Detected in File Transfer.\n\n166\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.560\nRelatively easily here, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.420\nAnd it even gives me a description.\n\n168\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.290\nSo this was not generated by Karen or\nanybody else.\n\n169\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.830\nThis was generated by essentially all the\nelements working together with Firepower.\n\n170\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.580\nHost has encountered malware.\n\n171\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.700\nI can see when the first time it was seen.\n\n172\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.420\nOkay, so right around a little\nbit after midnight here.\n\n173\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.640\nAnd the last time it was\nseen about 8 hours later.\n\n174\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.520\nSo seven hours and 33 minutes later or so.\n\n175\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.840\nNotice that it also has another one.\n\n176\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.830\nAbout 2:00 in the morning\nthen again about 8:00 again.\n\n177\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.590\nSo, there's a lot of details\nthat I can see about this.\n\n178\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.180\nCompromised host.\n\n179\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.750\nI can even show something else here.\n\n180\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.670\nLook, they were running Mac OSX.\n\n181\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.350\nOkay?\n\n182\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.920\nI can even tell you what version\nthat they were running, as well.\n\n183\n00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.030\nOkay?\nThe servers that are operating on\n\n184\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.870\nthat machine right now.\n\n185\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.840\nI can see that.\n\n186\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.600\nApplications that are running, and\nnotice a lot of HTTP sites here.\n\n187\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.100\nAnd the user history so far.\n\n188\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.540\nYou know, there's a lot of different\nthings that you end up seeing.\n\n189\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.040\nOkay?\n\n190\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.280\nSo in this one host profile,\nwe are pretty much not done exactly yet.\n\n191\n00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.920\nBut at this point here, that is enough\nto show me that hey, this one has some\n\n192\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.520\nparticular compromise here that you\ncan at least see as well, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.290\nSo this will give you a little bit more.\n\n194\n00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.370\nBut what if I wanted to see like\nThe whole thing pretty much at one time.\n\n195\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.900\nLet's see if I can kind of get\nout of this whole view here.\n\n196\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.405\nWhat did I do?\n\n197\n00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:21.418\nF11, let me see, how do I get out\nof this full screen view here.\n\n198\n00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:28.412\nWindow, nope, that would be View\nas a full screen, there we go.\n\n199\n00:11:28.412 --> 00:11:31.130\nI was gonna say,\nI should be able to get out of this, but\n\n200\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.276\nI wasn't able to get out of it for\na moment.\n\n201\n00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.549\nWe can actually be able to focus in and\nconcentrate just by that.\n\n202\n00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:41.521\nThe other one that we can also do if we\ngo back to the indications of compromise\n\n203\n00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:42.540\nagain, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.564\nIs that once we get to this point, and\nmake sure I'm telling you correctly,\n\n205\n00:11:47.564 --> 00:11:51.191\nI can go to host and\nselect indication of compromised.\n\n206\n00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:52.695\nSo, host at the top, and\n\n207\n00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:57.310\nthen again remember everything is\nactually generated right now live time.\n\n208\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.487\nThis is not something you get to rush and\nmake sure that it shows me something\n\n209\n00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:04.554\nthat looks a little bit less\nthan spectacular, Zach.\n\n210\n00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:05.137\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n211\n00:12:05.137 --> 00:12:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Notice it's like,\nall right so big deal.\n\n212\n00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.870\nNow we're detected, impact to attack.\n\n213\n00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:19.070\nThen set on reel like little cover\nhere at the right-hand side.\n\n214\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.030\nNotice about 70 machines out,\n70 times that actually does go okay.\n\n215\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.120\nOkay I'm starting to see that even\nthough actually it looks like you\n\n216\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.630\nonly reported two different categories\nit's attack is probably quite large\n\n217\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.840\nNow, how can I tell those machines?\n\n218\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.010\nHow do I identify those machines that\nwere possibly under this attack?\n\n219\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.750\nWell up here at the top,\nnotice I have these links up here.\n\n220\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If I select Table View of\n\n221\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:51.320\nHost Indications of Compromise,\nI believe I've clicked on it.\n\n222\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.220\nYup, I have to look for\na little spinning wheel here.\n\n223\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.160\nNow, remember because it has to\nkinda take its time to generate, but\n\n224\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.530\nwhat we're about to see here,\nlook at this Zach.\n\n225\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.560\nThis looks a little bit more-\n&gt;&gt; It's more comprehensive.\n\n226\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.360\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so now we can start to see some\nother things as we start to go down and\n\n227\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.530\nsee, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.750\nSo I know it's a little bit small and\n\n229\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.730\ntiny, let's see if we can zoom in just\na little bit more so that we can see this.\n\n230\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:22.140\nI can see every IP Address,\nthe Category and the Event Type,\n\n231\n00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.490\nFirst Seen,\nDomain that it also occurred in.\n\n232\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.440\nYou name it, there is a lot going on here\n\n233\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.580\nthat we can also end up seeing and\nend up identifying as well.\n\n234\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.020\nSo once we can start seeing\nsome information like this.\n\n235\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.920\nWe may also want to connect this\n\n236\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.460\nup with that security intelligence\nwe've been taking about.\n\n237\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:53.480\nSo if i now go over to connections,\ni can select security intelligence events.\n\n238\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.640\nAnd this is what maps it all together and\n\n239\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.270\nbrings all those elements of compromise\ntogether and also brings in outer\n\n240\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.280\nresources to help us to identify some\ndifferent elements now underneath\n\n241\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.440\nsecurity intelligence looks similar in\nthe information that we are seeing.\n\n242\n00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.050\nBut take a look at this, Zach,\nas we go through here and\n\n243\n00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.440\nstart to look at a few other things.\n\n244\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.920\nLet's just use this first\none as an example, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.865\nSo right here,\nsome type of whatever it is, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Some type of intrusion here,\n\n247\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.830\nit blocked it.\n\n248\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.060\nIt did a DNS block on it.\n\n249\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.190\nI can see who initiated, who responded.\n\n250\n00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.620\nAnd notice in the security intelligence\ncategory, DNS Intelligence Malware.\n\n251\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:44.550\nI can see the source, destination code,\ndomain and even the device that caught it.\n\n252\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:50.700\nSo all this information,\nI can look at the country You initiate it.\n\n253\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.740\nSometimes you actually\nsee another country here.\n\n254\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.340\nThis one that leads to mass tower all of\nthe things bend from the US essentially\n\n255\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.490\nis what we end up seeing.\n\n256\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.490\nAnd there is actually one down\nhere that's a little bit more\n\n257\n00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.230\nsomething that might frighten\nme a little bit more.\n\n258\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.950\nDNS intelligence CnC.\n\n259\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.740\nZack CnC this stands for\nCommand and control, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.180\nAnd that is something a little\nbit that is at least for me.\n\n261\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.270\nI may draw my attention to\nmore because command and\n\n262\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.180\ncontrol means that if they've gone\nthrough that kill chain that we talked.\n\n263\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; Command and\n\n264\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.620\ncontrol is really they've gotten\npretty much where they've\n\n265\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.680\nthought they wanted to be.\n\n266\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.250\n&gt;&gt; They're in there.\n\n267\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, they're pretty much in here.\n\n268\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.610\nSo on this one, I can actually go and\nfilter that information out.\n\n269\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.700\nAnd now I'll start to see some other\ninformation due to that as well, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.940\nSo this is where you\ncontinue to break it down.\n\n271\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.780\nAnd you continue to\nfollow these leads here,\n\n272\n00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.780\nSecurity Intelligence Traffic by Category,\nokay?\n\n273\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.060\nAnd here's all of the CnC information\nthat we've been talking about\n\n274\n00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.270\nSource as well as destination, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:00.840\nYou name it.\n\n276\n00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.700\nThere is just so\n\n277\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.920\nmuch information here that we can take\na look at, it really is staggering.\n\n278\n00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.350\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; How much information that we\n\n279\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.150\ncan see, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.260\nNow, just when you take a look at this,\nright, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.410\nThe problem is simple once again Zach,\nis what I've been pointing out.\n\n282\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.750\nIt can be overwhelming.\n\n283\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.400\nIt can be staggering at how much you see.\n\n284\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.540\nBut the great thing is,\nthat as you get better at doing this.\n\n285\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.430\nAnd we're not doing this right now, we\njust wanted to show you what can happen.\n\n286\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.967\nWe can also set up policies.\n\n287\n00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.386\nNow when we start talking\nabout the idea of policies,\n\n288\n00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:33.508\npolicies are essentially rules-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n289\n00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:35.830\n&gt;&gt; And that's what they actually are.\n\n290\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.210\nNow you can see where there's\nactually been some different policies\n\n291\n00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.050\nthat have been created here for\nwhat we actually are in place in\n\n292\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.150\nterms of the different default ones\nthat are actually right here, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.230\nSo, there's a lot of\npolicies that are in place.\n\n294\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.130\nIf I wanna see how those correlate\ntogether, I can select Correlation, with\n\n295\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.350\nother types of information that I want,\nand then I can even build my own rules.\n\n296\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.680\nNow you can see that there's\nactually some policy managing, so\n\n297\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.700\nthese are the general policies.\n\n298\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.360\nIf I click on Rules, this is where I\ncan also set up not only a policy, but\n\n299\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.210\nrules that actually go into policy too.\n\n300\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.420\n&gt;&gt; So\nrunning Firepower is not just diagnostic,\n\n301\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.930\nit can help you block\nthese bad actors as well.\n\n302\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really designed to be\noverall comprehensive in every aspect of\n\n303\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:30.240\nwhat we think of as far as making sure\nthat we can prevent as many as we can.\n\n304\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.490\nWe, again, do the mitigation\nwhile an attack is going on, and\n\n305\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.310\neven retrospective analysis afterwards,\nthat we can learn from it and\n\n306\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.700\nimprove our particular\nway of doing things.\n\n307\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm very,\nvery impressed with Firepower.\n\n308\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:48.320\nYou can go in and\nyou can create your own rules here too.\n\n310\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.530\nThat way, you actually filter out and\ndo exactly what you need to as well.\n\n311\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.010\nSo, just realize that when\nyou start taking a look at,\n\n312\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.370\nespecially something like this, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.320\nEven though we don't,\nwe've showed you actually quite a bit more\n\n314\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.365\nin earlier episodes, almost every tab,\nif I remember right, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:04.365 --> 00:18:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Showed you some of those\n\n316\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.090\ndifferent things.\n\n317\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.370\n&gt;&gt; Sure did.\n&gt;&gt; But at least at this point, right,\n\n318\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.030\nyou kind of understand its power and\nits ability.\n\n319\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.520\nSo, that means if you do get a chance,\n\n320\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.570\nas you work in a security operations\ncenter, explore a little bit more.\n\n321\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.690\nDon't worry about creating rules cuz\nthat's probably not your particular place\n\n322\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.765\nas an entry level analyst.\n\n323\n00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But you can at least see this\n\n324\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.660\ninformation and then go on and\ncontinue to be able to use even the simple\n\n325\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.360\nthings that we've learned to help you to\nfocus in and identify on what you need to.\n\n326\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.740\nSo Zach, that’s kind of a very good and\nhigh level overview for\n\n327\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.650\nwhat we need to know a little bit more\nabout the Firepower Management Console and\n\n328\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.970\nManagement Center here.\n\n329\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:47.470\nIt really is kind of a very robust tool\n\n330\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.930\nthat you may actually end up being\nable to work with at some point.\n\n331\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.320\nSo, don't overlook it,\ndon't think you'll never have a chance.\n\n332\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.573\nIt is something that you do want to\ndiscover, and it will only help you to\n\n333\n00:18:58.573 --> 00:19:01.680\nactually learn it more as you\ncontinue to move through your career.\n\n334\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.984\nSo Zach, that's pretty much a good wrap\nup for us right there in taking a look at\n\n335\n00:19:05.984 --> 00:19:10.505\nwhat we normally are gonna see in terms\nof Firepower for an entry-level analyst.\n\n336\n00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:12.988\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm very impressed with\nFirepower Management Console, and\n\n337\n00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:15.140\nI'm very impressed with how\nyou presented that, Ronnie.\n\n338\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.580\nThanks very much, and\n\n339\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.290\nmake sure you watch also all\nthe episodes in the CCNA SecOps Series.\n\n340\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.265\nAlso, visit our course library,\ncheck out the hundreds of videos there.\n\n341\n00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:26.662\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further,\n\n342\n00:19:26.662 --> 00:19:30.418\nand tell everybody you know about\nITPro.TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n343\n00:19:30.418 --> 00:19:31.834\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n344\n00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:32.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n345\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.308\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n346\n00:19:34.308 --> 00:19:41.135\n[MUSIC]\n\n347\n00:19:41.135 --> 00:19:44.073\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.088\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.088 --> 00:00:10.964\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:14.030\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.991\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nthis is CCNA SECOPS.\n\n7\n00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:20.381\nAnd on this episode\nwe're gonna compare and\n\n8\n00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:23.750\ncontrast analysis methods with the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.980\nRonnie, thanks for joining us again.\n\n10\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.757\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for having me back as\nwe continue on in our journey together.\n\n11\n00:00:29.757 --> 00:00:35.230\nTaking a look, of course, at security\noperations and the CCNA exam as well.\n\n12\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.469\nAnd today we're gonna be taking a look,\nof course,\n\n13\n00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.227\nat the idea here of different\nanalysis methods that we can use\n\n14\n00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:45.926\nwhen handling data events or\nincidents that we might have.\n\n15\n00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.906\nAnd the reason why we want to\nmake sure that we do this, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:54.140\nIs because it is very easy in the,\nand I don't know how else to put it,\n\n17\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.301\nin the heat of the moment when you\nbelieve that an attack is going on,\n\n18\n00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:02.779\nThat you can't learn anything from it,\nthat your whole idea is simple.\n\n19\n00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:05.860\nIt's a reaction to what is happening.\n\n20\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.667\nAnd when you take that and\nyou make that your main focus,\n\n21\n00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:14.139\nthe problem is all other aspects\nof thinking is pretty much done.\n\n22\n00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.944\nSo in that aspect,\na lot of times as security professionals,\n\n23\n00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.130\nwe actually act more like\nthe way that dogs happen.\n\n24\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.430\nIn which you have to snap them out of\ntheir response before you can get their\n\n25\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.300\nattention.\n\n26\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.686\nTo kind of say, all right,\nnow let's kind of back this back down.\n\n27\n00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.060\nAnd I learned that from Cesar,\nthe dog whisperer, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.564\n&gt;&gt; Right, the dog whisperer guy.\n\n29\n00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.659\n&gt;&gt; So that guy, and that's the same\nthing that happens when you think.\n\n30\n00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.157\nAnd if you're new at this,\nyour whole goal is protection, and\n\n31\n00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:44.447\nyou kind of get offended when somebody\nslips past your particular protective\n\n32\n00:01:44.447 --> 00:01:47.720\ndefenses that you've set up for\nyour network.\n\n33\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.849\nBut if that happens,\n\n34\n00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.375\nwe understand, it is very easy to\nget a little bit more defensive.\n\n35\n00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:57.149\nBut at the same time, you need to take\nsome time to think about the situation.\n\n36\n00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.930\nIn other words, to do some analysis, which\nmeans to break the situation down and\n\n37\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.330\nthen determine what is the best\nthing to actually do at this point?\n\n38\n00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.160\nOr what do we learn from\nthe event that has just happened?\n\n39\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.780\nSo when it comes down to the idea\nof different analysis methods.\n\n40\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.680\nWe kinda fall back on something that we\nlearned way back in school at some point.\n\n41\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.880\nYou took something like probability and\nstatistics.\n\n42\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.340\nYou've probably talked about\ndeterministic methods.\n\n43\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.310\nYou've also talked about\nprobabilistic methods as well.\n\n44\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.580\nAnd normally not so much on retroactive or\nretrospective analysis,\n\n45\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.970\nbut we're gonna actually throw\nthat one in there as well,\n\n46\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.030\njust to kind of sweeten the pot and\nmake sure that everything is done.\n\n47\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.120\nSo we're gonna look at all\nthree just briefly, and\n\n48\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.010\nthen we'll kinda show you an example\non using retrospective analysis and\n\n49\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.360\nwhat it can show us, especially when\nwe're dealing with some type of event.\n\n50\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is there any one\nanalysis better than the other, or\n\n51\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.670\nshould you use all three?\n\n52\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.600\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a good question,\nand the reason why is that\n\n53\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.240\nyou have to actually determine what\nit is that you're trying to do.\n\n54\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.864\nSo in that aspect, it really does depend\non what the situation is at the moment\n\n55\n00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:04.516\nthat you're trying to do.\n\n56\n00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:08.254\nOr it actually kind of lets you do it,\ndepending on where\n\n57\n00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:12.720\nyou are in this lifecycle of\nan event that ends up happening.\n\n58\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.150\nSo remember that when an event happens,\nit's not just it happens and\n\n59\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.480\nit's over with and\nwe're done and we don't know.\n\n60\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.791\nWe've already seen in some\nof the other episodes, or\n\n61\n00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.960\nif you're watching this in the order\nof the way that we have it on the show.\n\n62\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.329\nIt may actually be in a future episode for\nyou.\n\n63\n00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.679\nBut the idea of some type\nof incident happening,\n\n64\n00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.520\ngoes though a lot of different steps.\n\n65\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.284\nWe've talked about the seven\nphases of the kill chain at some.\n\n66\n00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:41.125\nSo when you start seeing that,\nyou kinda realize that an intrusion or\n\n67\n00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:45.165\nsome type of event does happen, and\nit's a process that it happens in.\n\n68\n00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:49.595\nIt's not always where it's just done and\nit's over.\n\n69\n00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.205\nIt always is this process, and it really\ndepends on where we're taking a look at it\n\n70\n00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:57.390\nin that perspective, which one we\nmay choose at some point in time.\n\n71\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.139\nSo I made a kind of chart, I guess,\nto help us to compare and contrast.\n\n72\n00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:02.920\n&gt;&gt; I love these charts.\n\n73\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.895\n&gt;&gt; What we're going to actually see here.\n\n74\n00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:07.372\nSo if we take a look at the screen,\n\n75\n00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:12.593\nit's not exactly graphic rich here,\nbut it should help us to try to and\n\n76\n00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:17.450\nfigure out what methodology that\nwe may end up trying to use.\n\n77\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.940\nAt what particular point in time, as well.\n\n78\n00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.730\nSo let's talk about this\nfirst one over here,\n\n79\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.110\nwhich is the deterministic\nmethod just briefly.\n\n80\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.030\nAnd I'll kind of zoom in so that we can\nsee that a little bit better, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.820\nNow when we start talking about\nthe deterministic method,\n\n82\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.160\nnotice that one of the first\nthings that I list here,\n\n83\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.120\nreally across the top in that\nsecond row that you see.\n\n84\n00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.310\nIt's about the data that you use in\nthis type of analysis here, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.278\nAnd in this one, in deterministic method,\nessentially all the data that is\n\n86\n00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:51.327\nused in the analysis is already known or\nstructured that way.\n\n87\n00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:52.369\nSo in other words,\n\n88\n00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:56.800\nthere's no real deviation to the way\nwe're gonna do the analysis here.\n\n89\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.207\nWe're given all the parameters,\nwe're given all the data that we can use.\n\n90\n00:05:01.207 --> 00:05:04.050\nAnd when we do that analysis,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n91\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.228\nIt essentially allows us to focus in and\n\n92\n00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:09.660\nlimit ourselves to one particular\nperspective that we want.\n\n93\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.462\nAnd in that way, what we should end\nup seeing in terms of the result of\n\n94\n00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:17.600\nthis type of analysis is right here, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.932\nIf we know all the parameters\nthat we're given, and\n\n96\n00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:23.516\nwe've taken a look at the information.\n\n97\n00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:26.249\nAnd we go, all right, here is what it is,\n\n98\n00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.490\nthen in the end result it should\nbe exactly what I expect it to be.\n\n99\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.500\nSo Zach, for example,\n\n100\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.220\nlet's just kind of use an example here\nof something that will help us out.\n\n101\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.680\nIf you go and, because you and\n\n102\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.460\nI love food, let's say you go and\nbuy a breakfast sandwich somewhere,\n\n103\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.390\nat your particular favorite\nrestaurant that's out there, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.538\nAnd you hand them a $10 bill, and\nlet's say that the sandwich costs $5.\n\n105\n00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:53.589\nI don't know if you'd ever pay that much,\nbut me,\n\n106\n00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:55.518\nI'd find a little bit of\na hard time doing that.\n\n107\n00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:57.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the end result of that though,\n\n108\n00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.141\nit should be you get the sandwich and?\n\n109\n00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:00.000\n&gt;&gt; Five bucks.\n\n110\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.620\n&gt;&gt; $5 back, okay, it shouldn't be $4.75.\n\n111\n00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.585\nIt shouldn't be a close to $5, right?\n\n112\n00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.528\nIt should be the sandwich and $5.\n\n113\n00:06:11.528 --> 00:06:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n114\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.683\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of determined,\nbecause of you know how much the price of\n\n115\n00:06:16.683 --> 00:06:21.026\nthe sandwich is, because they've told you,\nhere's what the sandwich cost.\n\n116\n00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:24.055\nHere is what it is and\nyou hand them a $10 bill.\n\n117\n00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:26.640\nWell, the outcome of that\nis relatively simple.\n\n118\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.208\nSandwich, $5 that should\nbe in your pocket.\n\n119\n00:06:30.208 --> 00:06:34.097\n$4.65, would you kinda go,\nthat's close enough?\n\n120\n00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:38.448\n&gt;&gt; I would probably say, I think you need\nto reevaluate your mathematical skills.\n\n121\n00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:39.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n122\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's not close enough, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:44.230\nDeterministic says what?\n\n124\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.741\nI know what the outcome should be, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.412\nSo given the parameters\nthat I have access to, and\n\n126\n00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.840\nwe're not dealing with any other scenario.\n\n127\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.080\nWe're not dealing with any other\nsituation out there, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.206\nHere's what the end result should be,\nmakes sense.\n\n129\n00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:04.895\nSometimes Zach, you may actually choose\nthat particular method and you go, look,\n\n130\n00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:06.790\nI have a coupon today, though.\n\n131\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.906\nThat will get me two sandwiches for\n$5 instead.\n\n132\n00:07:09.906 --> 00:07:12.080\nAnd what that does is add in\nthat second parameter, but\n\n133\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.740\nyou already have that parameter.\n\n134\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.798\nSo now if you did the same thing,\nand you got that buy one, get one.\n\n135\n00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:23.599\nThat idea, the BOGO that we actually\ntalk about here, you get that.\n\n136\n00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.542\nWell, this time you should end\nup with two sandwiches and\n\n137\n00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:33.330\n$5 if you give $10 to the customer\nservice person that's there, right?\n\n138\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.946\nSo it's determined, you're not guessing.\n\n139\n00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:43.090\nYou're not going, I should get two and\na half sandwiches maybe, and $4.35 back.\n\n140\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.474\nIt's predetermined that you\nalready have it situated\n\n141\n00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:49.203\nwhere the outcome is\ngonna be what you want.\n\n142\n00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:53.297\nSo now let's bring that back in then,\nZach, to the idea of analysis and\n\n143\n00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:56.657\nwhat we're talking about in\nSecurity Operation Center.\n\n144\n00:07:56.657 --> 00:07:59.719\nMost of the time when we're\ndoing analysis like this,\n\n145\n00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:03.459\nit's not really after the fact\nthat an event has happened, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:06.385\nIt's not really even during\nan event has happened, but\n\n147\n00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:10.790\nwe've gotta think about here if we're\ntrying to predetermine something.\n\n148\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.425\nit's probably what?\n\n149\n00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:16.853\nPlanning,before anything happens, so\nit might be when we are setting up for\n\n150\n00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:21.780\nintrusion detection, when we\nare actually setting up our defenses in\n\n151\n00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.633\nplace of what we believe should happen.\n\n152\n00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:29.140\nWe wanna put this here because we know\nthat this type of attack is gonna happen.\n\n153\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.750\nSo when we take a look at\nthe diagram again, okay,\n\n154\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.370\nthis will help us out in the end\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n155\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.830\ndeterministic really is about cause and\neffect, right?\n\n156\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.110\nOkay, I know that connecting\nto the Internet is\n\n157\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.220\na bad thing in terms of how many people\nare connecting and trying to attack.\n\n158\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.440\nFor me, let's say that that means for\nmy company,\n\n159\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.640\nI'm going to put a firewall in place,\nokay?\n\n160\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.570\nThat's my automatic response.\n\n161\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.150\nNow are there different\nthings that you can do?\n\n162\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.360\nYes, okay.\n\n163\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.020\nBut let's say what I automatically do\nright away to give me some protection.\n\n164\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.140\nNow, in the cause and\neffect that's what we are thinking about.\n\n165\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.620\nSo when we think about\na particular type of attack,\n\n166\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.200\nit only brings up a defense that we have,\nokay.\n\n167\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.940\nWhen we think about a particular\ndefense that I want to actually have,\n\n168\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.530\nI may also think about the particular\nattack that I'm defending against.\n\n169\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.390\nSo that's what we talk\nabout at that point, and\n\n170\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.340\nthat is normally the planning stage.\n\n171\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.840\nIt doesn't mean it covers everything,\nright?\n\n172\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.310\nWe only know what we're\nactually given at this point.\n\n173\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.840\nWe're not determining\nevery possibility here.\n\n174\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.790\nWe only know what we\nbelieve is already known.\n\n175\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.420\nAnd most of the time, our planning\ncan only really be based off that.\n\n176\n00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.990\nNow, it's not always the only thing\nthat it's based off of, but at least\n\n177\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.880\nup into this point, okay, if you want to\ndo something, if you want to actually\n\n178\n00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.570\nunderstand the term deterministic,\nit's probably more in the planning phases.\n\n179\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.400\nThan in anything during a mitigation or\neven after the attack is over for\n\n180\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.510\nretrospection as well.\n\n181\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.420\nSo that then of course leads\nus into the second one.\n\n182\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.970\nLet me zoom out a little bit so\nwe can see just a little bit better here.\n\n183\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.680\nProbabilistic, which for me, I don't know\nwhy Zach, but we talked about the way that\n\n184\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.285\nword looked funny, that word sounds funny\nwhen I just said it, probabilistic.\n\n185\n00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Probabilistic.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n186\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.660\nthat's exactly what it is probabilistic.\n\n187\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.110\nNow this time we talk about\na probabilistic analysis,\n\n188\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.170\nit doesn't mean that we\ncan't know something, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:35.157\nBut what we mean is that all the data\nthat is used in the analysis is known and\n\n190\n00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:37.871\nsome of it though can be assumed.\n\n191\n00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:42.159\nSo now we've gotten in, we're moving\nin that area of probability, okay,\n\n192\n00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:47.002\nwhich means, hey, it's not that it's\nuncertain, it's not that it's a unknown.\n\n193\n00:10:47.002 --> 00:10:50.660\nIn other words, it's not an x factor\nat this point, to a point it is, but\n\n194\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.000\nwe're actually saying,\nif these things are lining up,\n\n195\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.180\nthen something like this\nshould end up happening, okay.\n\n196\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.330\nAnd that's why the end\nresult of this one right?\n\n197\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.840\nIt is probable, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.710\nSo it's not just possible at this point.\n\n199\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:11.440\nProbable, now we can't do always\nthe idea of probabilistic analysis but\n\n200\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.720\nit does help us, and the reason why,\n\n201\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.810\nis that we can go overboard with\nthe probabilistic analysis in this way.\n\n202\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.130\nOkay, so when we start to think about\nthe end result of this one, right?\n\n203\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.090\nThat all things are probable,\nwell not everything is probable okay?\n\n204\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.090\nEverything may be possible.\n\n205\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.160\nThere are things that you may not have\never thought of that might happen\n\n206\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.340\ngiven the sliver of a chance.\n\n207\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.600\nIt's possible it can happen, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.040\nIf you, what's the, the butterfly effect\nkind of thing that you always hear about.\n\n209\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.930\nThe famous quote is from the dinosaur\nmovie 20, 30 years ago, right?\n\n210\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.270\nA butterfly flaps his wings over in Japan,\nand\n\n211\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.220\nover here in New York City it\ncauses a hurricane to start.\n\n212\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.090\nYou know the rolling of those events,\nright?\n\n213\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.800\nWell that's based off of probability and\nchaos more than anything else.\n\n214\n00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.950\nOr not probability, but possibility,\nand chaos we should say.\n\n215\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.930\nSo anything, it can happen, but\n\n216\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.090\nthe idea of probability though, is more\nof a best guess, an educated guess,\n\n217\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.610\nmore of saying, here's what we do know,\nand here's some of the other thing\n\n218\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:24.400\nthat we believe we actually know, but\nwe're guessing on it at this point.\n\n219\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.960\nAnd now, the end result for\nus should be something that we can\n\n220\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.570\nprobably guess that will end up happening,\nokay?\n\n221\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.400\nSo let's go back to see this\nidea of what if again, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.086\nSo now, when we start talking\nabout different scenarios\n\n223\n00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:40.850\nhere on a probabilistic type of analysis,\n\n224\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.254\nwe actually take a look at\nwhat if scenarios, okay.\n\n225\n00:12:44.254 --> 00:12:49.331\nWhat if scenarios are more common and\nmore likely because it gives us\n\n226\n00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:54.860\nmore of a true probability than all\nof the determinism over it, okay.\n\n227\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.250\nDeterminism says A then B's got to happen.\n\n228\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.590\nBut we've learned something in reality and\nin life, right.\n\n229\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.850\nIf A then B can't happen,\nit's very possible.\n\n230\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.950\nBut there may be other\nchoices such as C okay?\n\n231\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.281\nThere may even be other choices than that,\nsuch as B &amp; C okay?\n\n232\n00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:18.450\nSo in other words those may\nactually all come together and\n\n233\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.820\nmay actually be a combination of things.\n\n234\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.790\nOr what if we actually did A and\nit was neither B nor C.\n\n235\n00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.690\nSo none of the above could\nalso be true as well.\n\n236\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.670\nSo in that sense you gotta think\nabout those particular types of terms\n\n237\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.040\nwhen it comes down to scenarios, too.\n\n238\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.660\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n239\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.650\non the probabilistic method are we\ndealing with percentages here, you think?\n\n240\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.490\nWell, it can be.\n\n241\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of actually using\n\n242\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.410\nthe percentages may help us to determine\na little bit more and try to allow us\n\n243\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.270\nbest possibilities and to figure out\nwhere we can spend money better, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.550\nIt also helps us to prioritize too, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.720\nIn probabilistic types of analysis,\n\n246\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.800\nthis may be at the very beginning\nwhere we do plan for it okay?\n\n247\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.030\nBut the problem is if we do it right then,\n\n248\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.720\nwe'll come out with every\nscenario under the sun.\n\n249\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.870\nAnd one of the scenarios that we might\nnot have even thought about like\n\n250\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.670\nlet's just not even start a business okay?\n\n251\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.640\nIt's just too scary to actually try and\n\n252\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.250\nprotect our network against let's\nnot even think about a defense.\n\n253\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.580\nLet's just wrap up this shot now.\n\n254\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.970\nWell, that's not really the end\nresult that we want to get to.\n\n255\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.810\nThe idea is not to regress all the way\nback to where you're not really even\n\n256\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.590\ntrying to do what you want to do.\n\n257\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.460\nBut the idea here is simple.\n\n258\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.964\nWe want to try and determine what we\nbelieve is the best range of possibilities\n\n259\n00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:44.430\nout there and what can we actually\nnow spend the best bang for\n\n260\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.292\nour buck if we're doing\nplanning at this point.\n\n261\n00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:50.998\nOr if we're taking a look at it\nfrom a mitigation standpoint,\n\n262\n00:14:50.998 --> 00:14:55.513\nokay, and we're looking at all of\nthe elements that are involved, okay.\n\n263\n00:14:55.513 --> 00:14:59.500\nWhatever has happened,\nit may be that this is not the end.\n\n264\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:05.025\nSo it could be that from A, whatever\nthe attack was, it might lead to B or C.\n\n265\n00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.750\nOr it might even lead to\nboth of those attacks.\n\n266\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.640\nOr, is there something I\njust didn't think about\n\n267\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.690\nthat I'm kind of\noverlooking at this point?\n\n268\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.610\nSo, that gives us the idea that\nthere's more than likely which is\n\n269\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.490\nmore reality that turns out a range of\npossibilities that end up happening.\n\n270\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.530\nSo Zach let's kinda take your\nbackground just from a moment, okay.\n\n271\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.790\nIn all your years for working in for TV,\ndid you ever think you'd be working for\n\n272\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.480\nIT tech company doing\nwhat we're doing now?\n\n273\n00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.762\n&gt;&gt; That was not a probability.\n\n274\n00:15:34.762 --> 00:15:36.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah but yet you're here.\n\n275\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah here I am.\n\n276\n00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.460\n&gt;&gt; So it's not that it can't happen right?\n\n277\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.313\nBut the way that everything kind of\na lined up, you wanna thank the stars,\n\n278\n00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:47.441\nyou wanna thank God or\nwhoever it is, it can happen, okay.\n\n279\n00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:52.108\nAnd so in the end, depending on how\neverything lined up, it is probable and\n\n280\n00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:55.293\nactually for\nyou it actually did end up happening,\n\n281\n00:15:55.293 --> 00:15:58.499\nso In this particular method\nis pretty much there.\n\n282\n00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:02.689\nBut there are chances that Zach might of\nhad other opportunities and he just said,\n\n283\n00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:06.530\nnow we wanna go with ITProTV because\nthey're the guys to actually be with.\n\n284\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.330\nAnd that's pretty much\nthe way that we think so too.\n\n285\n00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.170\nSo, that's actually good as well.\n\n286\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.200\nSo, in that probabilistic\ntype of analysis,\n\n287\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.910\nthat's what you're taking a look\nat in terms of the mitigation.\n\n288\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.830\nIn terms of actually trying\nto figure out in the analysis\n\n289\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.190\nof the events that are gong on,\nwhat may likely happen.\n\n290\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.270\nAnd then at that point you\nfigure out the mitigation.\n\n291\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.437\nSo it is possible,\nall that is a good thing.\n\n292\n00:16:30.437 --> 00:16:32.417\n&gt;&gt; What I used to say to\nmy kids all the time is,\n\n293\n00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:35.277\nwhen you ruled out all the possible\nthen you go the probable and\n\n294\n00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:38.000\nif that doesn't work,\nthen you go to the improbable.\n\n295\n00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n297\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.710\nyou are kind of almost quoting\nSherlock Holmes at that point.\n\n298\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Kind of.\n\n299\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just when you start\nlooking at that, it's kinda neat.\n\n300\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.440\nAll right, so let's go to our last\nmethod here and then I wanna show you\n\n301\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.450\nhow it actually works out a lot of times\nin terms of the retrospective analysis.\n\n302\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.470\nNow, literally retrospective,\nright, retro is actually back and\n\n303\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.450\nthen the spective part,\nthe spectacles is looking back, right?\n\n304\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.920\nSo this is a look back analysis.\n\n305\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.260\nSo Zach the idea of\n\n306\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.920\nlooking back on the analysis we've got\nto realize something at this point then.\n\n307\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.715\nEspecially for\n\n308\n00:17:13.715 --> 00:17:18.110\nincident handling and event handling\nthere, this is after the fact, right?\n\n309\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.370\nSo something has already happened, so\n\n310\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:25.940\nI already know what the outcome is,\nand that is key.\n\n311\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.720\nI already know that the thing exploded,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.530\nIt's compromises, whatever it is, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.610\nBut what I don't know at this\nparticular point in time though is,\n\n314\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.928\nwell, how did it get there?\n\n315\n00:17:36.928 --> 00:17:42.600\nHow did it get to that point without one\nof the systems that we put in place,\n\n316\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.660\nit didn't catch it, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.820\nSo at this point in\na retrospective analysis,\n\n318\n00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.070\nwe may be able to actually\nfind out even more information\n\n319\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.850\nbecause it has really gone through\nthe entire kilo chain phase.\n\n320\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.490\nAll the phases and gotten to a success,\nand did exactly what I wanted to.\n\n321\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:05.060\nSo this actually can probably\nprovide the most detailed\n\n322\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.150\nafter the fact analysis for\nus that we can have.\n\n323\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.920\nAnd that's probably more accurate\nthan what we think because\n\n324\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.510\nit is incredibly accurate cuz we can\nfollow traces and everything back as well.\n\n325\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.380\n&gt;&gt; So now's the time for forensics, yeah?\n\n326\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.540\n&gt;&gt; It can be time for the forensics and\n\n327\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.980\nthis is where it does come in a lot of\nthe times in retrospective analysis.\n\n328\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.980\nBut even for\na company just trying to prepare for\n\n329\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.000\nthe next event,\nthis is where it also does too, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So how did we end up getting here?\n\n331\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.653\nAnd all of these different methodologies,\nthey're not gonna fit neatly in\n\n332\n00:18:34.653 --> 00:18:37.250\nthe categories even though I tried to\nput them neatly into categories, but\n\n333\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.440\nthey're not gonna fit that way, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.740\nThere are always gonna be aspects\nof this that you can take.\n\n335\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.430\nWhen we talk about planning a lot of that\ncomes from the very fact that we might\n\n336\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.850\nhave actually had initial retrospection\nbefore we started planning for\n\n337\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.500\nour improvements, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.610\nSo it's really kind of a circular idea\nthat keeps feeding upon itself, that\n\n339\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.300\nwe do see in terms of trying to figure\nout the analysis that we need to do.\n\n340\n00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.340\nSo every event should make us actually\nbetter or more informed, okay.\n\n341\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.840\nShould give us better knowledge of what\nhas happened, should help us to then put\n\n342\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.930\ntogether a plan that gives us a better\nmitigation for what should happen.\n\n343\n00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.475\nThen we should be able to\nstop it earlier as well.\n\n344\n00:19:18.475 --> 00:19:22.642\nS all that really does come into\nplay in this analysis part and\n\n345\n00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:24.520\nthinking in these terms and\n\n346\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.598\nthese ways are really what we want to\na good analyst to be able to do as well.\n\n347\n00:19:29.598 --> 00:19:33.080\nAll right, so how do we do this?\n\n348\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.040\nWell the first two,\nyou can kind of play in your mind and\n\n349\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.030\nwork out with teams and\ndo a lot of whatever you need to do.\n\n350\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.380\nThe third one though is the one\nthat really requires more tools\n\n351\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.460\nthan anything else.\n\n352\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:54.270\nAnd the reason why it's hard for\nyou to kind of game play\n\n353\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.390\nand try to theoretically come up with,\nhere's what just happened and\n\n354\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.260\nthen trying to figure all the events.\n\n355\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.810\nYou need good hard solid data of exactly\nwhere something is actually gotten to,\n\n356\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.480\nand what point did it come in and\nhow do you actually find that information.\n\n357\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.960\nSo retrospective analysis, even though\nwe can do part of it in our mind and\n\n358\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.450\ndo part of it even game playing and\ntalking it out between you and me.\n\n359\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.930\nIn the end though, we really need\nsolid data and solid evidence\n\n360\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.290\nto get us to where we want to go and\nthis is what we're gonna show you, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.780\nWe're only gonna show you one\naspect of retrospective analysis.\n\n362\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.530\nAnd I wanna take you through\nwhere a particular malicious file\n\n363\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.810\nwas actually found on our system.\n\n364\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.790\nAnd how do I know what I can\nactually do with that information.\n\n365\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.540\nSo let me bring up\nthe Firepower Management Center here.\n\n366\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.130\nLet me make sure that I log in.\n\n367\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.640\nLooks like it logged me out at some point,\nokay.\n\n368\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.730\nSo once I get logged in to the Firepower\nManagement Center, we are going to take\n\n369\n00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.950\na look at, well one of the different\nmalware events if I'm telling you, right?\n\n370\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.880\nYup, and that way we'll actually\nbe able to see what we want to see\n\n371\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.220\nfrom the standpoint of a compromised\nfile getting access into my system.\n\n372\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.250\nNow remember that with Firepower,\neven on your own systems at home,\n\n373\n00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.370\nif you actually do this, it ties into\na subscription basis, it does all that,\n\n374\n00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.030\nit takes a few moments to get loaded\nup just like it did right here.\n\n375\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.635\nSo if you have a ton of machines, a ton\nof analysis going on in the background,\n\n376\n00:21:21.635 --> 00:21:24.610\nits still pulling data in from everywhere,\nand\n\n377\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.840\neverything that we're seeing is\nas close to live time as we can.\n\n378\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.430\nCurrently I'm showing\nthe last day's events, so\n\n379\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.711\neverything that's gone on, pretty much\nin the last 24 hours up in this point.\n\n380\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.116\nI want to look at underneath\nthe summary here, just briefly.\n\n381\n00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:45.110\nIntrusion events, okay, so\nlets say that we know that some\n\n382\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.010\ntype of intrusion has gone on and\nyou'll see right here on my network.\n\n383\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:53.670\nThere's been a lot of intrusions,\nso far even in the last days, okay.\n\n384\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.270\nSo the top attackers over here on the left\nhand side, we can see the top sources.\n\n385\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.910\nSome of them from China, United States,\n\n386\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.740\nsome of them actually\nit looks like internal.\n\n387\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.380\nTop targets,\n\n388\n00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.149\nI can also see different targets\nover here, dropped intrusion events.\n\n389\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.290\nYou name it, I can see a lot of\ninformation just in this dashboard.\n\n390\n00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.680\nBut what I wanted to show you like I said,\nwas more retrospection than this.\n\n391\n00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.055\nSo what we're gonna do is,\ninside of Firepower I'm going\n\n392\n00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:30.880\nto select the analysis tab, and\nonce I get into analysis here.\n\n393\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.518\nOnce again you gotta wait for\neverything to load,\n\n394\n00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:33.736\nthat's pretty much the way it goes.\n\n395\n00:22:33.736 --> 00:22:36.570\nAnd of course,\nit will have its own kind of dashboard,\n\n396\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.060\nthey call it the Context Explorer.\n\n397\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.450\nI'm just gonna wait for loading.\n\n398\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.040\nSometimes if I get too impatient,\nit doesn't show me what I want,\n\n399\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.370\nso I just have to be patient and-\n&gt;&gt; That's right, take a deep breath.\n\n400\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.810\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so Zach if we take a look\nat these lines over here, okay?\n\n401\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.590\nThe red one, according to the kind of\nlegend over here on the red, these\n\n402\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:23:00.680\nare events and Zach at this point, this\nis actually only in the last hour, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.490\nThis one's only in the last\nhour that we've actually seen.\n\n404\n00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.390\nSo a few events have actually gone\non at this particular point here.\n\n405\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.488\nSo it looks like right about 9:41 in\n\n406\n00:23:11.488 --> 00:23:16.348\nthe morning at least from where we are,\nokay?\n\n407\n00:23:16.348 --> 00:23:21.630\nAbout 1,102 events have actually\nhappened that we believe\n\n408\n00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.970\ntraffic and\nintrusion events over the last hour or so.\n\n409\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.600\nSo a bit of a spike that you\nactually end up seeing here.\n\n410\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.710\nSo if I go back let's say to the last day,\nand\n\n411\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:39.800\nthat will kind of refocus everything cuz I\ndidn't see, I should have changed it back.\n\n412\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.931\nBut we'll give it just a moment\nhere to give us a days events,\n\n413\n00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:45.958\nthen we'll change it again.\n\n414\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:50.883\nSo now that I've actually gotten\nit over to last day here, so\n\n415\n00:23:50.883 --> 00:23:55.818\nthis is beginning with,\nyou can see 0, which is midnight.\n\n416\n00:23:55.818 --> 00:23:59.116\nGoing all the way up\ninto this point in time,\n\n417\n00:23:59.116 --> 00:24:02.615\nalmost exactly this point\nin time right here.\n\n418\n00:24:02.615 --> 00:24:04.521\nN 24,\nI think it's actually right about, yep.\n\n419\n00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:07.260\nIt's about 10:30 right now,\nI was trying to see how.\n\n420\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.562\nSo within five to six minutes, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:09.562 --> 00:24:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like,\n\n422\n00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.290\nZach, a little bit more events have\nactually gone on within the last hour.\n\n423\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.167\nSo at 9:12 this morning,\n\n424\n00:24:17.167 --> 00:24:21.485\nlooks like it went up at about\n18,002 events, is what we see.\n\n425\n00:24:21.485 --> 00:24:22.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of scary,\n\n426\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.355\nRonnie, I know, yeah.\n\n427\n00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:25.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you.\n\n428\n00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:27.250\n&gt;&gt; Unless you are constantly under attack.\n\n429\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this network right here\n\n430\n00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.790\nis handling its particular attack chip,\nokay?\n\n431\n00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.230\nAll right.\n\n432\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.070\nSo what do we have to do when\nwe take a look at retrospection?\n\n433\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:43.190\nFrom here I'm going to select underneath\nanalysis where it says files and\n\n434\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.160\nthen malware events, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.189\nFiles and malware events.\n\n436\n00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:50.543\nAt least I think I selected it, there.\n\n437\n00:24:50.543 --> 00:24:54.130\nJust again, more patience,\njust have to wait here.\n\n438\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.830\nIt would change over and\ngive us those different malware events,\n\n439\n00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.240\nthat have occurred on our network\nhopefully within the last day.\n\n440\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.820\nAnd let me see here.\n\n441\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.400\nThis is from, yup,\nactually about the last six hours so\n\n442\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.740\nfar, if I'm remembering correctly.\n\n443\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.000\nWe just have to give it a moment,\n\n444\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.210\ncuz it still expanding its\nparticular time element that we see.\n\n445\n00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.980\nBut underneath these malware\nevents that we have,\n\n446\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.010\nthese may not look very familiar\nin terms of the names of things.\n\n447\n00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.760\nBut this one here at the end, Zach,\nI can tell from just the end result here,\n\n448\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.745\nthis xls.\n\n449\n00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:33.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's an Excel document, okay?\n\n450\n00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.950\nAnd the Excel document from\nthe Fire Power Management Center\n\n451\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.930\nlooks like it was marked as being malware,\nokay?\n\n452\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.400\nNow at this particular point in time,\nokay?\n\n453\n00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.360\nI really can't tell much about this event.\n\n454\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.330\nExcept that it caught it,\nwhich means what?\n\n455\n00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.320\nIt's gotten there, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.150\nSo when did this actually happen?\n\n457\n00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.040\nWhat can we find out about the details\nof this particular type of file?\n\n458\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.380\nWell, if I hover over this icon,\nyou can see where,\n\n459\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.900\nlet me see if I can do it again and\nthat way, let me kind of bring it there.\n\n460\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.200\nLet me hover over this, and\n\n461\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.975\nnow it says click here to view\nwhat we call the file trajectory.\n\n462\n00:26:12.975 --> 00:26:14.920\nOr the network file trajectory.\n\n463\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.770\nSo once we do this, this is all\nabout this one file here, Zach.\n\n464\n00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The network file trajectory.\n\n465\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.090\nAnd we'll give it a moment to load,\nme being impatient,\n\n466\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.310\nis what we'll end up seeing here, and\n\n467\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.750\nwait until you actually see this\ngraph that comes about here, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.430\nSo it's right here that we can\nsee a couple of things, okay.\n\n469\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.488\nThe file itself, Zach,\nwas really first seen on the network\n\n470\n00:26:41.488 --> 00:26:46.375\nabout 4 o'clock In the morning.\n\n471\n00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:47.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, 4 AM.\n\n472\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's some\nretrospection right there, okay?\n\n473\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.279\nI know that actually was seen there.\n\n474\n00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:55.000\nLast time it was seen\nwas right about eight.\n\n475\n00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.560\nOkay, and\n117 events actually contributed to this.\n\n476\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.480\nAlong with that as we start to take\na look down here at the bottom,\n\n477\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.410\nyou can now actually even see exactly what\nfile, was actually sent, or excuse me.\n\n478\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.020\nNotice the IP addresses here.\n\n479\n00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.395\nThe IP address and\nit was sent to what particular IP address?\n\n480\n00:27:19.395 --> 00:27:22.530\nNotice the application and\nwhere it ended up happening.\n\n481\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.270\nIf I continue to move through here,\nI'll see that I can follow its\n\n482\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:33.060\npath from here and\nfollow it all the way down through.\n\n483\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.360\nSo I could literally start at the end\nresult here, and there it is.\n\n484\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.791\nSo notice that here at this point in time,\n\n485\n00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:46.110\n4:35, I can now see where\nit was actually sent in.\n\n486\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.270\nAnd I can scroll along through and\ncontinue to look.\n\n487\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.340\nAnd see right here even to the end\nat least from what I have,\n\n488\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.450\nright about 8 or 7:54 in the morning, I\ncan see where it actually came and, wait,\n\n489\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.470\nit's right over here.\n\n490\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.640\nThat's what happens when you zoom in,\nokay?\n\n491\n00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.950\nAnd you're not paying that much attention.\n\n492\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:13.710\nSo we can follow this path all\nthe way back through time.\n\n493\n00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.350\nAnd this gives me that retrospection\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n494\n00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.620\nSo initially it looks like it\ncame in from a website here,\n\n495\n00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:25.230\nwhich was right about here, and\nthen it was a malware cloud lookup, and\n\n496\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.580\nthen we actually have now malware.\n\n497\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.620\nThe system actually caught it\nas malware at this point, but\n\n498\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.650\nit already has made its way through\nquite a few different places\n\n499\n00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.310\nall the way around as we start seeing\nthe different things that are popping up.\n\n500\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.630\nI'm trying to get it where we\ncan see some of the information.\n\n501\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.060\nSo you can follow that\nall the way through.\n\n502\n00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.420\nSo you have a timeline,\nyou have this ability,\n\n503\n00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.610\nif I now select current\ndisposition of malware.\n\n504\n00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.640\nActually that's not.\n\n505\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.260\nLet's see what this one gives me.\n\n506\n00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.665\nIt's weird, you can click on\neither the icon or the word.\n\n507\n00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:00.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it will give you two\n\n508\n00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.050\ndifferent results.\n\n509\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.480\nWhich is weird, okay?\n\n510\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.720\nSo this is not the one I was looking for.\n\n511\n00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.050\nSo this one is just giving us a summary,\nright,\n\n512\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.130\nof the types of malware that's here.\n\n513\n00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.690\nSo notice Office documents and\nexecutables are right here.\n\n514\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.370\nThere's been quite a few.\n\n515\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:14.870\n136 of them.\n\n516\n00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.020\nLet me scroll back here and\nlet's see, if I hover over.\n\n517\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.805\nNow under the threats score,\nsee you know like this.\n\n518\n00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:24.490\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Dynamic analysis summary.\n\n519\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.322\nAnd then you have this very high analysis.\n\n520\n00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:26.831\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n521\n00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:29.049\nif I select this dynamic summary here,\n\n522\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.545\nI can even see some of the threats, and\nthis one's reported as a number four,\n\n523\n00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:41.680\nwhich is much higher than what we even\nhave here on our particular scale.\n\n524\n00:29:43.362 --> 00:29:48.271\nAnd if I select the view full report,\nthis will now bring us into,\n\n525\n00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:52.840\nwell, the threat grid that\nwe've also seen earlier.\n\n526\n00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.830\nAnd gives me analysis of,\nwell, a lot more information.\n\n527\n00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.560\nSo all of this will help us to\ndetermine a little bit more, and\n\n528\n00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.320\nit really is about that\nretrospection as well, okay?\n\n529\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.820\nIt gives us everything that we need.\n\n530\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.690\nWe can see much more information here,\nby simply taking a look,\n\n531\n00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:14.340\nbut on retrospection, need a lot\nmore tools than on the other two.\n\n532\n00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.370\nSo, Zach,\nthat's actually a fairly good coverage.\n\n533\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.830\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; When you start talking about\n\n534\n00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.850\nthe idea of different perspectives\nin the analysis that we do for\n\n535\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.100\nsome type of event handling.\n\n536\n00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.000\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job, Ronnie.\n\n537\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.370\nCompare and contrast analysis methods.\n\n538\n00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.190\nGreat

00:00:05.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.846\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.050\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.820\nI'm your host Zach Memos, and\nthis is CCNA SECOPS Classifying and\n\n8\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.350\nCategorizing Intrusions,\nthe name of the episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.920\nAnd our IT expert whose bringing us\nthe information we are looking for\n\n10\n00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.150\nis Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.410\nRonnie, good to have you here,\nand great to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.505\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for inviting me back\non the show as we continue on,\n\n13\n00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:35.261\nin our CCNA SECOPS.\n\n14\n00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:40.200\nWe are now taking look, of course,\nat this idea of classifying and\n\n15\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.750\ncategorizing intrusions.\n\n16\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.743\nNow the issues that we have,\nespecially in dealing with intrusions,\n\n17\n00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:50.140\nas an IT professional or\nsecurity professional is simple.\n\n18\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.110\nMost of us like this idea\nof protecting our systems,\n\n19\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.160\nbeing relatively responsive when we\nthink about an intrusion happening.\n\n20\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.900\nAnd when we do so,\nwe tend to react very quickly.\n\n21\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.540\nAnd we tend to try and\nfix everything very quickly,\n\n22\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320\nwhich is the way that we want it to be,\nokay?\n\n23\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.300\nBut the problem is,\n\n24\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.910\nafter that intrusion is over, we may\nnot have a plan of action after that.\n\n25\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.910\nDid we learn anything from it?\n\n26\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.990\nDid we actually produce anything that,\n\n27\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.330\nif I were to see this again, I would\nbe able to spot it much quicker, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.180\nSo, instead what ends up\nhappening normally is simple.\n\n29\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.670\nWe stop the attack, we're kind of\ngrateful that we stopped the attack.\n\n30\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.540\nWe're kind of glad that we're\nable to catch it very quickly.\n\n31\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.511\nBut now it happens again\nwhen I'm off duty, and\n\n32\n00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:37.601\nnow somebody else has to stop it.\n\n33\n00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.224\nI'm going,\nwhy didn't they do what I would have done?\n\n34\n00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.992\nAnd it's because we don't have\nany real system to essentially\n\n35\n00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:47.130\nhelp us to standardize within our\nown companies a lot of times.\n\n36\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.210\nAnd so, we don't have a formalized\nprocess, we don't have a system.\n\n37\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.670\nWe don't have something in place that\nallows us to be consistent across\n\n38\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.525\nthe board within our own organization\nin terms of securities and operations.\n\n39\n00:01:58.525 --> 00:01:59.855\nAnd that's why it's\nactually important that\n\n40\n00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:01.505\nwe discuss what we're\nabout to talk about today.\n\n41\n00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.805\n&gt;&gt; So there's a list that we can\nactually refer to, right Ronnie?\n\n42\n00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there is, there's actually\na couple of different things that we're\n\n43\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.705\ngonna be referring to today.\n\n44\n00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:11.010\nThat is going to help us out.\n\n45\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.435\nAnd not only is it pertinent,\nof course, to your organization.\n\n46\n00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.810\nAs your organization continues to grow,\nyou're going to actually need to\n\n47\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.320\ndo something that we've had to\ndo here at ITProTV, as well,\n\n48\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.560\nwhich is to start formalizing the way\nthat we handle things like intrusions and\n\n49\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.495\nincidences and different things like that.\n\n50\n00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:31.475\nSo at the very beginning, let me tell you,\n\n51\n00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:35.075\nZach is one of our most recent\nedutainers that's come onboard.\n\n52\n00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.645\nBut I was here from the very beginning.\n\n53\n00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you were.\n\n54\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when we started ITProTv,\n\n55\n00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:43.995\nor I shouldn't say we,\nI was a part of the original team.\n\n56\n00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:47.455\nBut when it started, right,\nit was really like, all right,\n\n57\n00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.485\nwhat do we need to get started basically?\n\n58\n00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:51.990\nAnd we just kind of did what we needed to.\n\n59\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.770\nAnd we kind of went along and it was like,\nwell how do we stop intrusions?\n\n60\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.845\nWe can't say we'll implement this system,\nwe'll do that system.\n\n61\n00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:02.190\nAnd it might have been between Don and\n\n62\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.720\nI at that point there trying to go okay,\nI'll do this part, Ronnie.\n\n63\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.935\nYou do this part, Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:09.840\nI'll make sure to double check on this,\nand that was it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.520\nIt was just kinda that\ncommunicative process.\n\n66\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.413\nWell now that we're continuing to grow,\nand we're continuing to add on.\n\n67\n00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:19.480\nAnd now we're actually getting to that\npoint where, we're kind of bulging at\n\n68\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.710\nthe seams to a point in terms of\ninfrastructure and what we need, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.397\nWe now need a more formalized process,\nbecause now that we're doing so\n\n70\n00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.110\nmany shows a day by comparison\nto what we did before.\n\n71\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.110\nAnd we actually have to produce so much.\n\n72\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.900\nIt's more difficult for me just to simply\nstop what I'm doing in the middle of\n\n73\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.540\na show and go and check on something.\n\n74\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.310\nAnd just say, hey, look,\nwe're noticing some strange activity here.\n\n75\n00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.230\nIt really needs to be a process to where\nI can hand that off to somebody else,\n\n76\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.490\nan infrastructure team,\nmaybe our own IT staff that actually says,\n\n77\n00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.020\nwe'll check on that,\nRonnie, you do your shows.\n\n78\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.920\nAnd the only way for\nus to that consistently and faithfully and\n\n79\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.860\nmake sure that it's done\nthe way that we want it to,\n\n80\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.230\nis to have some type\nof formalized process.\n\n81\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.210\nOr to understand what has to\nhappen in every process, so\n\n82\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.600\nwe are consistent across the board.\n\n83\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.160\nAnd that is when we can start talking\nabout the actions that need to be done.\n\n84\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.380\nAnd what particular model or\n\n85\n00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.190\napproach that we need to take when we\nstart dealing with things like intrusions.\n\n86\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.590\nNow, in the realm of cyber security,\nright,\n\n87\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.970\nespecially in the realm of working\nin a security operation center,\n\n88\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.290\nit also means that you have\nto follow those processes.\n\n89\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.490\nAnd most security operation centers will\nend up following some that have been\n\n90\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.360\nstandardized pretty much\nacross the industry.\n\n91\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.210\nAnd that's because they found them to be,\nwell, relatively effective.\n\n92\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.560\nThey found them to be easy to implement.\n\n93\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.610\nThey found them to be very\neffective at what they needed,\n\n94\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.290\nwhich was that consistency\nacross the board.\n\n95\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.580\nSo that is what we're actually\nstarting out with, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.540\nWhen we start talking about then\nclassifying and categorizing intrusions,\n\n97\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.560\nwell, first and foremost, we have to\nunderstand what is the overall goal of\n\n98\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.820\nany type of intrusion\nhandling that we do as well?\n\n99\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.520\nAnd for us, that actually comes\ndown to really one thing, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.480\nLet's take a look at my computer here,\nand let's take a look at this\n\n101\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.300\ngoal before we move any more,\ndown anything else on this screen.\n\n102\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.020\nWe're going to look at this\ngoal in particular, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.690\nThe goal of everybody, in terms of\nintrusion, not only intrusion detection,\n\n104\n00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.000\nbut intrusion handling itself, right?\n\n105\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.830\nIs to stop attacks early, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.930\nThe earlier we stop the attack\nfrom happening, okay,\n\n107\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.420\nthe more successful we are at preventing\nthe goal of whatever the intrusion is.\n\n108\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.385\nIn network security monitoring,\nthat's kind of a,\n\n109\n00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:47.160\nI don't wanna say it's a new term or\na new concept.\n\n110\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.080\nBut the goal is simple in\nterms of two things, right?\n\n111\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.970\nStandard security professionals that\nmay learn the fundamentals of security,\n\n112\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.060\nwe focus in on hardening, which\nare all the things we should do, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.530\nBut we always try and\n\n114\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.510\nmake, essentially, this idea of using\nthe defense in depth approach right?\n\n115\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.759\nReally building our castle up so\nstrongly around the fortifications\n\n116\n00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.111\nthat we have that nothing can really\nintrude into where we are, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:18.377\nIn network security monitoring,\n\n118\n00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:22.395\nthe guys have kind of headed up\nthis real foundational idea.\n\n119\n00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:25.350\nThey say, look,\nintrusions are going to happen.\n\n120\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.220\nYour goal is actually\nrelatively simple here.\n\n121\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.740\nIs, don't worry if an intrusion happens or\nnot, so much because it's gonna happen.\n\n122\n00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.790\nBut how do you stop the intrusion?\n\n123\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.198\nAnd how can actually make that\npossible where you stop it sooner?\n\n124\n00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:43.180\nAnd if you stop it sooner,\nyou're most successful at being able to\n\n125\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.190\nprevent them from ever\nachieving their end goal.\n\n126\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.270\nWell, the way that we do that,\nand across the board,\n\n127\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.900\nis using what we call the 7\nPhases of a Kill Chain, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.350\nNow, this actually comes\nfrom Lockheed Martin.\n\n129\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.270\nThey're the ones that really\ndeveloped this process.\n\n130\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.220\nAnd it has now spread just about across\nmultiple industries and governments.\n\n131\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.610\nAnd what they do, but\ninstead of trying to actually look and\n\n132\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.110\ngo, my gosh, something got in, we try and\n\n133\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.500\nactually look at it from the standpoint\nof what happens during an intrusion.\n\n134\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.055\nAnd then, try and figure out where\nwe can start to stop everything.\n\n135\n00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:19.663\nAnd from that point,\n\n136\n00:07:19.663 --> 00:07:23.330\nand that's what we want to actually be\nable to take a look at as well, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.200\nSo we're gonna actually kind\nof break this down first, and\n\n138\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.590\ntalk about this idea of the kill chain.\n\n139\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.090\nAnd these categories or\nclassifications here that we see.\n\n140\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.210\nNow I want you to notice something.\n\n141\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.768\nOver on the left-hand side,\nthese particular phases right here.\n\n142\n00:07:38.768 --> 00:07:44.970\nAnd it is essentially what an intrusion\nends up ultimately trying to do, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.107\nSo when we have this, right, think about\nit from the top to the bottom, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:52.021\nAs an intrusion begins, and\n\n145\n00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:56.903\nthey begin to work their way through\nthese concepts here, As we go down.\n\n146\n00:07:56.903 --> 00:08:01.756\nWhat does that give as far as\nthe intruder the advantage?\n\n147\n00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:05.341\nWhat happens is that the intruder\ncontinues to increase in\n\n148\n00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:10.171\nthe knowledge of the infrastructure,\nas well as your defense capabilities,\n\n149\n00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:14.340\nas well as what the layout is or\nthe typology of your network.\n\n150\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.550\nThey give the intruder so\n\n151\n00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.160\nmuch more information as\nthey proceed down this list.\n\n152\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.390\nSo that's why, as much as we can,\nwe want to actually be able to stop early\n\n153\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:32.100\nas much as we can here, okay, during this\nprocess to be able to do this, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.590\nSo when we do this here,\n\n155\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.200\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nat least what these 7 steps are.\n\n156\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.030\nAnd we're gonna talk about the way that\nthe attacker of course uses these steps,\n\n157\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.070\nand we'll also we where we\ncan defend at this point,\n\n158\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.390\nto help us to understand where\nthe balance is going to be, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:53.010\nSo of course that means for the exam,\nokay, Zach, is relatively easy.\n\n160\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.585\nIf I put a list up here, more than\nlikely it means you need to know them.\n\n161\n00:08:57.585 --> 00:08:59.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, not only that,\n\n162\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.810\nZach, one of the things that is relatively\ntricky on the exam, as well, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.900\nIs I'm leaving this up here for a moment,\nso that either you can screenshot it or\n\n164\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.605\nif you want to, you can write\nthis down for a reason, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:13.605 --> 00:09:14.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n166\n00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.400\n&gt;&gt; If the order doesn't matter,\nI'll probably say that,\n\n167\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.508\nthat the order doesn't matter.\n\n168\n00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.680\nBut, sometimes, Zach, what ends up\nhappening, especially when you see these\n\n169\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.590\nthings listed again, okay,\nis something like this.\n\n170\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:33.220\nOkay, and when you start to do something,\noops, I'm already messing stuff up here.\n\n171\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.270\nWhen you start to do something like this,\n\n172\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.870\nwell do you know that that's\nnot in the correct order, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.720\nWell that's kind of a put your\nexam hat back on here, and\n\n174\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.950\nyou take a look and\nit might be just as simple as,\n\n175\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.750\nwell, are these steps\nin the correct order?\n\n176\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.040\nDo you know the sequence that normally\nhappens in terms of an intrusion?\n\n177\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.615\nOr can you place these things in the\ncorrect sequence if an intrusion happens?\n\n178\n00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:03.519\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna put\nthe cart before the horse.\n\n179\n00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.960\n&gt;&gt; You do not want to put\nthe cart before the horse.\n\n180\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.290\nGood one there Zach.\n\n181\n00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.350\nSo I instead am actually going to just\nmove everything back in the order\n\n182\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.060\nthat it actually needs to be in here,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.330\nSo, make sure you learn\nthese in the proper order.\n\n184\n00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.860\n&gt;&gt; Order.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, without that order,\n\n185\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.950\nit's not gonna work the way that you want\nto and it's not gonna help you to learn\n\n186\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.900\nthe correct order in terms\nof the kill chain, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.210\nSo, that's what you hear.\n\n188\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.566\nSo if you hear the term kill chain,\n\n189\n00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:37.380\nit's referring to these particular,\nphases or steps that you have.\n\n190\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.780\nBut usually the common\nterm here is phases.\n\n191\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.680\nSo Zach, let's just jump into this and\nlet's see here.\n\n192\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.770\nOkay, that the idea of reconnaissance,\nif you are to hear that term and\n\n193\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.490\nyou are to think about how would\nyou define that basic term and\n\n194\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.750\nthinking about\nreconnaissance of something?\n\n195\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.318\n&gt;&gt; You've sent out some sort of a scout,\n\n196\n00:10:57.318 --> 00:11:00.690\nsome sort of a satellite or-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n197\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.319\n&gt;&gt; Something to pull back some basic\ninformation to get the lay of the land.\n\n198\n00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:08.276\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, no, that's exactly right,\nZach, so that's a good terminology for\n\n199\n00:11:08.276 --> 00:11:09.950\nus to think about, okay.\n\n200\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.080\nSo, an intruder, before they can\nactually do any intrusion at all,\n\n201\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.245\nthey scout out the lay of the land, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:19.770\nThey send out either a probe,\nsome type of targeting system or\n\n203\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.220\neven just general observation\nthat happens here, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.960\nAnd the whole goal behind reconnaissance\nis simple, okay, pick the target, okay,\n\n205\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.650\nis what we're doing,\nacquiring whatever target.\n\n206\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.610\nNow, it doesn't mean we don't\nhave an ultimate goal in mind.\n\n207\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.680\nIn other words, here's the company\nthat we really want to attack, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.160\nBut it really is about focusing\nin on what you believe\n\n209\n00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.790\nis gonna be the target of your intrusion.\n\n210\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.730\nSo it's not only about saying, here's\nthe overall objective that we want to\n\n211\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.780\nget inside, but it's also about finding\nwhat that particular target is-\n\n212\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.210\n&gt;&gt; Scoping out vulnerabilities as well.\n\n213\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\nit begins with this idea, right?\n\n214\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.250\nFirst of all, selecting a target.\n\n215\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.410\nSo an attacker goes ahead and\nthey take a look at it.\n\n216\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.650\nIt could be, again a weakness\nin the system that they found,\n\n217\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.650\na proxy server, it could be a firewall or\nrouter or something.\n\n218\n00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.560\nCould be a web server that's sitting\nout there, it could be anything.\n\n219\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.150\nIt could be actually a person\nusing their security badge,\n\n220\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.990\ngetting access into a door, in other\nwords, social engineering, you name it.\n\n221\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.690\nThey select a particular\ntarget at this point.\n\n222\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.310\nOnce they do that,\nwe begin, or they begin,\n\n223\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.560\nI shouldn't say we cuz I'm the attacker.\n\n224\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.520\nIn this instance, I am.\n\n225\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.720\nWe begin to blueprint the target.\n\n226\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.040\nAnd now what do we mean by\nblueprinting the target?\n\n227\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.306\nWe're now establishing that lay of the\nland and we're formulazing it in somehow,\n\n228\n00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:40.900\nwhether I'm taking notes,or\ntaking pictures along the way or\n\n229\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.820\nactually discovering what machines\nare available out there, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:50.030\nI now want to be able to actually find and\nknow exactly where that target is and\n\n231\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.950\nalso try and figure out its\nvulnerabilities like what Zach was\n\n232\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.130\ntalking about as well, which is to\nlook for those vulnerabilities too.\n\n233\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.675\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n234\n00:12:56.675 --> 00:13:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then,\nnotice here okay, what you have to\n\n235\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:05.140\nrealize is that even though at this point\nit maybe more of a passive type of attack.\n\n236\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.580\nWe're not really wanting anybody\nto know that we're doing it,\n\n237\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.510\neven though we've\nsuccessfully gotten inside.\n\n238\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.440\nThen, it's like yes,\nI could go ahead and do all this.\n\n239\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.040\nWe want target be able\nto gain knowledge here.\n\n240\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.950\nThe more knowledge that I gained from the\nreconnaissance at this particular point of\n\n241\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:27.610\ntime the easier and more successful\nmy attack will possibly be,\n\n242\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.030\nbecause I may have actually taken the time\nto really blueprint that target well.\n\n243\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.200\nTo find that not only where operating\nsystem is running on it, but whether or\n\n244\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.390\nnot it has patches, whether or\nnot that operating system\n\n245\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.200\nalso has some particular application\nthat is running such as Java,\n\n246\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.820\nwhich is a very common one or\nsomething Flash based,\n\n247\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.100\nwhich is another common one that I\ncould also take advantage of as well.\n\n248\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.080\nSo I might actually be\nable to find out multiple\n\n249\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.610\nways that I could compromise\nthat particular system.\n\n250\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.620\nBut I'm not going to\ntake advantage of it yet.\n\n251\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.350\nI might find out that\nthat system is unpatched.\n\n252\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:08.480\nI might find out that I can\neasily take over that machine but\n\n253\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.820\nI want to actually leave it alone for\nright now.\n\n254\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.230\nSo I actually discover as much as I can\nabout that machine until I am ready for\n\n255\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.330\nmy particular attack.\n\n256\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.590\nSo what can we do to essentially\ndefend ourselves then,\n\n257\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.810\nwhen we start to take a look at this?\n\n258\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.800\nWell, when we start to do this,\nnotice that the defender here.\n\n259\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.180\nWhat can it really do?\n\n260\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.940\nWell, at this point it really can't\ndo much in terms of an active way of\n\n261\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.060\ndoing anything.\n\n262\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.580\nBut we can try and discover that\nreconnaissance is happening here, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.940\nSo do you know what's happening?\n\n264\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.800\nWell, the easy way and\nthe most vigilant way,\n\n265\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.470\nI'm trying to think of the proper word,\nI know that's, is that popular or not, but\n\n266\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:54.470\nthe easiest, and the most secure, or\nthe best way probably is to assume\n\n267\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.180\nthat your business is under some\ntype of reconnaissance, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.410\nIt's not to say nobody\nis really looking for\n\n269\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.500\nanything on our systems, and then to\nassume that that's what's happening.\n\n270\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.150\nBut is to always think about it, it's not\nalways from the outside of the network,\n\n271\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.710\nit could be a malicious insider, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.892\nIt could be some contractor that\ncomes in from off the network.\n\n273\n00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:20.631\nYou do not know, but always understand\nthat maybe one of the things\n\n274\n00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:25.199\nthat we can do is to accept that we\nmay be having people go ahead and\n\n275\n00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.510\nrunning reconnaissance on us as well.\n\n276\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.334\nAnd so for us if we do so,\nokay, our particular defense in\n\n277\n00:15:33.334 --> 00:15:37.957\nterms of an action that we can\ntake is that we really want\n\n278\n00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:42.902\nactually to discover the nature\nof that attacker, okay.\n\n279\n00:15:42.902 --> 00:15:50.132\nAnd also possibly the attempt,\nthe intent of the actual attacker as well.\n\n280\n00:15:50.132 --> 00:15:53.539\nSo we want to make sure that\nthe attacker that we can identify,\n\n281\n00:15:53.539 --> 00:15:54.792\nwho that attacker is.\n\n282\n00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:56.982\nAnd if possible, the intent.\n\n283\n00:15:56.982 --> 00:16:02.007\nSo Zach, at this point, think about what\nthat gives us if we can actually take,\n\n284\n00:16:02.007 --> 00:16:05.950\njust for a moment, and\nassume that an attack is going on.\n\n285\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.280\nAnd then we can identify\nwho that attacker may be.\n\n286\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.510\nSo Zach, would that actually,\nmight get you to thinking, hey,\n\n287\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.860\nI've got a good chance of actually now\nunderstanding who that person is and\n\n288\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.280\nmaybe even figuring out what they\nwanna do here on our network?\n\n289\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right.\n\n290\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.730\nAnd I think that you are right on\nthe money when you say we need to presume,\n\n291\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.480\nwe have an enterprise situation,\n\n292\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.610\nwe need to presume that we're\nunder attack even if we aren't.\n\n293\n00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.970\nWe need to prepare for it ahead of time.\n\n294\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\ntaking that particular stance,\n\n295\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.230\nright, you may think it's a little bit\nmore hyper-vigilant than anything else,\n\n296\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.660\nbut in today's world,\nyou can't assume that.\n\n297\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.990\nI think you have to\nassume with the safety,\n\n298\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.520\nespecially if your network not only\nincludes the regular infrastructure stuff\n\n299\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.670\nsuch as servers and infrastructure\nthings such as routers and switches.\n\n300\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:57.159\nBut if you've also added in laptop devices\nthat move in and out of your network, if\n\n301\n00:16:57.159 --> 00:17:01.649\nyou also have people connecting and using\nsmart phones and tablets and things that\n\n302\n00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:04.686\nactually move on and off of your network-\n&gt;&gt; Using a wireless system.\n\n303\n00:17:04.686 --> 00:17:06.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, using wireless.\n\n304\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.006\nYou've got to be able to actually think,\nand maybe even say,\n\n305\n00:17:10.006 --> 00:17:13.896\nthe assumption here is that I\ncould possibly discover someone\n\n306\n00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:18.408\nthat is trying to actually find out\nmore about my network, too, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:18.408 --> 00:17:20.316\nOnce you actually discover that, right,\n\n308\n00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:22.870\nyou are also then going to take\na look at your own network.\n\n309\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.570\nSo if we go back to my diagram here,\nyou're gonna look for\n\n310\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.270\nthese vulnerabilities on your own systems\nand start to protect them as well.\n\n311\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.110\nAnd then realize,\nyou're pretty much the same way.\n\n312\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.410\nKnowledge that you gain on the attack or\nthe attacker,\n\n313\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.410\nokay, is actually going to\ngive you some timely defense.\n\n314\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.530\nSo not only can you actually take\na look at the intent here, but\n\n315\n00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.560\nit may actually show you, hey,\n\n316\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.830\nwe're getting more of this activity now\nthat I'm starting to suspect something.\n\n317\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.540\nAnd maybe even provide a timely defense,\nand not only after the fact, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.510\nSo the reconnaissance stage\nwhere we acquire the target,\n\n319\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.030\nyou do have some things you can do.\n\n320\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.300\nBut at this point, there's nothing really\nconcrete except for you setting up and\n\n321\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.590\npreparing for the fact that the attack is\npossibly going to end up happening, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.830\nNow once we actually get through,\nand once the attacker gets through\n\n323\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.400\nwith the reconnaissance, okay,\nhe doesn't attack right away.\n\n324\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.880\nHe actually does something that we call\nweaponizing, okay, or weaponization.\n\n325\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.150\nAnd this is weird because most of us go,\nyou're kind of using these kind of battle\n\n326\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.670\ntactics here or this language that-\n&gt;&gt; Cyber battle.\n\n327\n00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like this we have.\n\n328\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.810\nBut the weaponization part is really\npreparing for the battle, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.380\nSo not every single type of military\ncharge just begins with, all right,\n\n330\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.420\nthere's the target, hit it, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.140\nAt some point before\nsomebody said go ahead and\n\n332\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.000\nrun the attack, or\nmake the charge that you need to,\n\n333\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.310\nsomebody's decided what the ultimate\ngoal is for that particular attack.\n\n334\n00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.260\nThey've prepared, they've actually said,\nwhat do we need to make the attack occur?\n\n335\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.560\nWhatever it is, they planned it out.\n\n336\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.940\nAnd you name it, that's what happens, too,\n\n337\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.280\nwhen we start talking about\nthis idea of that intrusion.\n\n338\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.570\nThe attacker does the same thing.\n\n339\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.368\nHe prepares, plans, and stages the attack,\n\n340\n00:19:10.368 --> 00:19:13.321\nensures that he has the right equipment,\nokay?\n\n341\n00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:16.330\nAnd if he doesn't have the right\nequipment, he gets it.\n\n342\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.180\nSo it may be where there's\na piece of malware out there\n\n343\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.920\nthat is a generalized piece of\nmalware that he can now take and\n\n344\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.940\ngo, I know if I kind of modify this\na little bit, it may help me to\n\n345\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.250\ntake advantage of this particular\nvulnerability a little bit better, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.388\nSo the weaponization also involves how\nthat delivery of the attack is going on,\n\n347\n00:19:37.388 --> 00:19:41.170\nand usually it's some type of malware, so\nthat they can exploit the weakness that\n\n348\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.730\nthey found during the reconnaissance,\nokay?\n\n349\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.470\nSo this weaponization is really more of\nan important part than we think it may be.\n\n350\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.751\nSo the idea of discovering\nreconnaissance is great, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:54.721\nIt's something that we can try and do, but\n\n352\n00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:58.682\nit doesn't necessarily mean that we'll\nactually discover it a lot of times, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:58.682 --> 00:20:02.690\nIf we're vigilant about it, it means\nwe have a more likely chance to do so.\n\n354\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:07.190\nBut even by alerting someone that you are\nmore vigilant about it, you may again just\n\n355\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:12.540\nstem the tide of someone attacking, or\nat least that one individual attacking.\n\n356\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.970\nBut Zach, we've mentioned this before,\n\n357\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.032\nthat the issue that we have is not\nthat we can stop one attacker, okay?\n\n358\n00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:22.390\nThe issues that we actually have\nto deal with is the very fact that\n\n359\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.640\nthere's an overwhelming number\nof attackers versus defenders,\n\n360\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.010\nokay, in terms of intrusions and\nnetworks that go on.\n\n361\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.120\nSo it's not the very fact that you\ncan't stop a single attacker or\n\n362\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.420\neven a few attackers.\n\n363\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.882\nIt's you can't stop the millions\nof attacks that end up happening.\n\n364\n00:20:36.882 --> 00:20:40.820\nIs your network able to actually withstand\n\n365\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.290\n1,000 attacks per day, or\nper hour, if it needs to?\n\n366\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.200\nWell, most of us are probably gonna say\nno, we don't actually know how to do that.\n\n367\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.130\nBut being able to go,\n\n368\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.630\nall right, here's what we can do to do so,\nis gonna help us out, all right?\n\n369\n00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.360\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n370\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.450\nwhat can we do in terms of weaponization\nas a defender, then, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.470\nWell, as a defender, it means,\nlet me see if I can highlight this and\n\n372\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.170\nmove it over so we don't have\nto kind of full screen too much.\n\n373\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.010\nThere we go.\n\n374\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.900\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n375\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.884\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as a defender,\nfirst and foremost, we must look for\n\n376\n00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:13.820\nclues as to the weaponization.\n\n377\n00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.610\nNow what does that mean, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.120\nWell, it means you discover the same\nthing that the attacker does.\n\n379\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.546\nOnce you understand your vulnerabilities\nand your exploits, okay,\n\n380\n00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:26.635\nyou now need to actually figure\nout that's a possible target.\n\n381\n00:21:26.635 --> 00:21:29.546\nOnce you understand what that target is,\nokay,\n\n382\n00:21:29.546 --> 00:21:34.090\nyou might now be able to essentially\nreverse engineer your way back to saying\n\n383\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.003\nwhat attacks take advantage of\nthat particular vulnerability?\n\n384\n00:21:38.003 --> 00:21:41.332\nBut once you actually understand this,\nthe vulnerabilities, right, and\n\n385\n00:21:41.332 --> 00:21:44.723\nyou start to seal those things up,\nharden those types of systems and do that.\n\n386\n00:21:44.723 --> 00:21:49.279\nBut then at the same time, you start\ngaining more knowledge about the types of\n\n387\n00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:54.346\nattacks that have gone on against those\nparticular types of vulnerabilities, too.\n\n388\n00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:55.972\nSo you have to look for clues, or\n\n389\n00:21:55.972 --> 00:21:59.062\nartifacts, that are actually\npart of that weaponization.\n\n390\n00:21:59.062 --> 00:22:02.232\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because your defense\nshouldn't be a one size fits all.\n\n391\n00:22:02.232 --> 00:22:04.143\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's going to depend on what\n\n392\n00:22:04.143 --> 00:22:06.010\nthe situation calls for.\n\n393\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.110\nI mean, right off the top of my head,\nI'm thinking,\n\n394\n00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.240\nwell, having a honeypot or\nmaybe a bunch of honeypots.\n\n395\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.350\nBut that might not be the answer for\neverything.\n\n396\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that we\ncan't think about it all, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:16.515 --> 00:22:20.510\nBut the very fact is we have to\nbe able to prepare for something.\n\n398\n00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.216\nSo here, thinking about it in this way,\nwhere we kind of just go, all right,\n\n399\n00:22:24.216 --> 00:22:26.911\nlet's examine it from\nthe standpoint of the attacker.\n\n400\n00:22:26.911 --> 00:22:29.955\nIf we find those vulnerabilities,\nwe're not gonna take advantage of it,\n\n401\n00:22:29.955 --> 00:22:31.370\nwe're gonna seal that up, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.935\nAnd then we're gonna actually take\na look at how those attacks work, and\n\n403\n00:22:34.935 --> 00:22:36.695\nthen match it against our systems.\n\n404\n00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:41.385\nAnd go, well, where would that work\nagainst my network or my computer system,\n\n405\n00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:46.075\nwhatever it might be, to help prepare for\nthis particular type of battle here?\n\n406\n00:22:46.075 --> 00:22:47.803\nNow up to this point, okay,\n\n407\n00:22:47.803 --> 00:22:52.850\nit really is not something that we\nare countermanding against the attack.\n\n408\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.740\nEverything that we're doing, essentially,\nis a chess move at this point, right?\n\n409\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The reconnaissance does one thing.\n\n410\n00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.826\nWe essentially kind of react and\nwe observe what's going on.\n\n411\n00:23:00.826 --> 00:23:02.637\nAnd weaponization is just preparation.\n\n412\n00:23:02.637 --> 00:23:07.473\nWe're setting up our pieces,\nhopefully in a strong defense order, so\n\n413\n00:23:07.473 --> 00:23:12.725\nthat we can take advantage or we can\ndefend against what attacks come, okay?\n\n414\n00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:18.804\nBut the first time that we really do\nget to kind of defend against anything,\n\n415\n00:23:18.804 --> 00:23:25.188\nokay, is when the attacker actually\ndelivers whatever the attack is, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:25.188 --> 00:23:30.094\nSo the delivery concept is how in\nthe world do we get our attack to run\n\n417\n00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:34.306\non that system, or\nto get our attack inside of a network.\n\n418\n00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:36.104\nWell, believe it or not, Zach,\n\n419\n00:23:36.104 --> 00:23:39.849\nthe most common of these all deal\naround social engineering, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:44.460\nAnd that means manipulating you and\nme is still the most common way.\n\n421\n00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.200\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Opening e-mails?\n\n422\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.279\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there it is.\n\n423\n00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:50.950\nE-mail attachments, phishing\nwebsites that offer you, of course,\n\n424\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.694\ndeals that you can't turn down, and\nyou go, I've gotta find that one.\n\n425\n00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:56.241\n&gt;&gt; Or those fake e-mails that say this\nis from, we'll just use this, Amazon.\n\n426\n00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:23:59.258 --> 00:23:59.960\n&gt;&gt; This is from Amazon.\n\n428\n00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.093\nAnd you go, Amazon?\n\n429\n00:24:01.093 --> 00:24:02.971\nWell, I just ordered He's ordered\nsomething, but it wasn't from Amazon.\n\n430\n00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:05.184\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah and so\nyou're seeing that too.\n\n431\n00:24:05.184 --> 00:24:10.550\nAnd even still,\nUSB keys left in conspicuous locations.\n\n432\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.650\nNow this is one that's\nactually fairly easy.\n\n433\n00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:18.460\nAnd we've seen it done over and over again\nwhere people do just take USB keys and\n\n434\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.650\nthey kind of leave them in conspicuous\nlocations and what does the individual do?\n\n435\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.340\nThey go, I wonder what's on here?\n\n436\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.400\nThey plug it right into their computer\nsystems without ever knowing,\n\n437\n00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.660\nwithout ever checking, without ever\nthinking which is the hard part here\n\n438\n00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.540\nthat they shouldn't do anything like,\nokay.\n\n439\n00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.440\nSo in other words if you don't where\nit's been, it's probably not safe for\n\n440\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.540\nyou to plug it into your systems.\n\n441\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.120\nThough it's probably not a good thing ever\nfor you to actually do anything like that.\n\n442\n00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.566\nIt's still very complicated.\n&gt;&gt; There was this TV show where\n\n443\n00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:46.117\nthey left a CD.\n\n444\n00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:46.894\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n445\n00:24:46.894 --> 00:24:49.662\n&gt;&gt; They put the CD in the system,\nbecause it was this band that I love.\n\n446\n00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:50.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n447\n00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.567\n&gt;&gt; It was like material that was recorded\nlive at some concert they missed.\n\n448\n00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:54.943\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, they really,\n\n449\n00:24:54.943 --> 00:24:56.076\nthey researched this.\n\n450\n00:24:56.076 --> 00:24:57.322\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They knew who they were targeting.\n\n451\n00:24:57.322 --> 00:24:58.436\nThey put it in the system.\n\n452\n00:24:58.436 --> 00:24:59.460\nAnd infected everything.\n\n453\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.530\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, and\n\n454\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.250\nthat's what happens a lot of times\nis that people are just curious.\n\n455\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.340\nSo why not?\n\n456\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.980\nWell, what do we do?\n\n457\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.880\nWell, it's fairly simple here.\n\n458\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.180\nNotice it's really about blocking and\ntackling at this point, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.280\nYou go back to the basics\nwhen the attack happens.\n\n460\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.800\nWhatever your defense plan was at the\nbeginning make sure to set in motion, but\n\n461\n00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.790\nin the end of this,\nright what we want is simple.\n\n462\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.670\nWe wanna block,\nwe wanna tackle what we have left here.\n\n463\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.200\nWe block by doing what?\n\n464\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.930\nBy saying hey let's do some training here.\n\n465\n00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.476\nDon't open up attachments that you're not\nexpecting from someone you don't know.\n\n466\n00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:35.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's basic but yeah, mm-mm.\n\n467\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:36.363 --> 00:25:41.700\nUSB keys that are left around, don't\nplug that into your computer at work.\n\n469\n00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.320\nDo not.\n\n470\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.550\nPlug it in your own machine at home\nif you want, no don't do that either.\n\n471\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.377\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but don't plug it here at work.\n\n472\n00:25:47.377 --> 00:25:50.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do not go to sites that not authorized\n\n473\n00:25:50.197 --> 00:25:53.240\nby you when you're working\nwith your company.\n\n474\n00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.150\nTo go to those sites.\n\n475\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.680\nDon't click on links from emails unless\nyou're expecting it from a particular\n\n476\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.500\nperson, and you know where that\nemail is supposed to lead you to.\n\n477\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.760\nIf you're not sure what that link in that\nemail is supposed to lead you to, hover\n\n478\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.680\nover to the link and verify that it's\nactually giving you the same location.\n\n479\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.101\nIf all of a sudden,\nyou look at that and it's where,\n\n480\n00:26:12.101 --> 00:26:15.696\nactually you go I don't even know what\nthat website's for, don't open it.\n\n481\n00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:17.823\nJust get rid of it, don't do that at all.\n\n482\n00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:22.873\nBut this is kinda really the first\nreal time that we actually\n\n483\n00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:30.290\nhave the ability to stop the attacker\nfrom proceeding or advancing more, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.770\nSo before, right We can kind of look and\ngo, all right,\n\n485\n00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.480\nwe're kinda moving our chess pieces in\nresponse to what the attackers doing.\n\n486\n00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.150\nThis time though,\nwe're starting to try and\n\n487\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.405\ntake pieces off the board instead, okay?\n\n488\n00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:46.420\nSo this is really the first\ntime that we can do so.\n\n489\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.930\nAnd where we block and\nthen we tackle those pieces.\n\n490\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.770\nAnd then we move them off the board so\nthey don't actually proceed any further.\n\n491\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.808\nNow, Zach, we still have a bit of\nour chain to go through, okay?\n\n492\n00:26:57.808 --> 00:27:01.370\nWe've just hit this idea\nof the delivery here, okay?\n\n493\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.485\nBut we're nowhere close to to done.\n\n494\n00:27:03.485 --> 00:27:07.065\nBut I do realize that we're also running\nout of time at the same point here.\n\n495\n00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:10.095\nSo, Zack, it looks like we're gonna\nhave to head into a part two.\n\n496\n00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:14.115\n&gt;&gt; And we want a part two of Classify and\nCategorize Intrusions, and\n\n497\n00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:15.795\npart one's been great,\nand watch them both.\n\n498\n00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:16.722\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n499\n00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:18.342\nCheck out our course library.\n\n500\n00:27:18.342 --> 00:27:21.082\nThere's hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n501\n00:27:21.082 --> 00:27:22.812\nWonderful job as usual, Ronnie.\n\n502\n00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:24.961\nAnd tell everyone you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n503\n00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:25.912\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n504\n00:27:25.912 --> 00:27:26.602\nThanks for watching.\n\n505\n00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:27.392\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n506\n00:27:27.392 --> 00:27:28.262\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

All right, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.211\nThank you again for having me back on the\nshow as we continue to take a look at this\n\n14\n00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.970\nprocess that we've been talking\nabout which, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.880\nis understanding the idea of the kill\nchain and taking a look at those phases.\n\n16\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.480\nSo far, let's go back and\ntake a look just briefly.\n\n17\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.374\nWe've covered the concepts\nof reconnaissance,\n\n18\n00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:52.091\nweaponization and\neven into delivery, okay?\n\n19\n00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:56.020\nAnd when we've started to talk about this,\nwe talked about the idea of\n\n20\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.749\ndelivery really being the first stage that\nwe really have something concrete that we\n\n21\n00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.260\ncan now counteract in some way,\nsomehow, of the services that we have.\n\n22\n00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.661\nAnd this is where we talked about blocking\nand tackling, whatever your defense\n\n23\n00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:13.151\nplan is, whatever strategies or\ntools that you have in place.\n\n24\n00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:16.916\nThis is the time that you are hoping\nthat everything converges and\n\n25\n00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:19.037\nworks the way that you want it to, and\n\n26\n00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:23.710\nthat you can stop it completely at\nthis particular point if you can't.\n\n27\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.540\nNow as we stop it, right,\nwe again are trying\n\n28\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.430\nto prevent the leakage of any more\ninformation about our networks.\n\n29\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.380\nWe're trying to actually make sure\nthat we've got it completely stopped.\n\n30\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.940\nBut if we can't, okay,\n\n31\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.780\nthen the next stage comes into\nwhat we call exploitation, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.560\nThe exploitation is when\nnow the attacker has access\n\n33\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.150\nestablished so they're no longer worried\nabout actually trying to run the attack.\n\n34\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.300\nThe attack has been successful.\n\n35\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.500\nNow they're essentially\nsetting up their own portal or\n\n36\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.520\ntheir own beach head, if we wanna\nkeep using the military terms here.\n\n37\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.930\nThat is their base of operation,\ntheir forward operating base,\n\n38\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.410\nFOB, as they start to move forward here.\n\n39\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.450\nAnd the way that this actually begins\nto happen, right, is that they start to\n\n40\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.600\ntake a look, at least the attacker, okay,\nabout the points of vulnerabilities here.\n\n41\n00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.740\nThat really happened on just about\nevery network that's out there, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.560\nApplications, how do they do that?\n\n43\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.300\nWell, they take a look at\nthe vulnerabilities there and\n\n44\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.170\nthey now understand what application and\nthe vulnerabilities that are there, too.\n\n45\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.890\nOperating system vulnerabilities\nare also a big part for\n\n46\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.857\nthe attacker to take advantage of,\nas well as users, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.725\nAnd the way that they take advantage,\nof course,\n\n48\n00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:46.305\nis by exploiting the vulnerabilities\nthat are already found in those systems,\n\n49\n00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:49.070\nespecially when they are not updated.\n\n50\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.450\nAnd that is a key part of something that\nwe could have done in terms of a defense,\n\n51\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.900\nin terms of that idea of that delivery.\n\n52\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.290\nWhat could we have done to\nblock some of that delivery?\n\n53\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.610\nWell, updating our systems would\nhave been a big one here, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.660\n&gt;&gt; And then 0 Day attacks are also key.\n\n55\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.460\nAnd this is one of those attacks,\n\n56\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.350\nright, in which we don't really have any\nway to kind of judge it until it happens.\n\n57\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.690\nAnd that's why it actually\nis a 0 Day attack.\n\n58\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.530\nIt's really about the first time we\nnotice that the attack goes on sometimes.\n\n59\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.770\n&gt;&gt; So exploiting, taking advantage of\nthose weaknesses they've discovered, yeah?\n\n60\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and once all that is done,\nright, we again want to take a look at it\n\n61\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.250\nfrom the standpoint of what\nhappens with the defender, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.120\nSo it's here a way that we can\nstop it at this particular level,\n\n63\n00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.070\nokay, is to actually think\nabout these systems, right?\n\n64\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.020\nHardening of our actual\nsystems into our computers,\n\n65\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.030\nnetwork infrastructure as well as\nthe perimeter of our network as well.\n\n66\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.310\nMaking sure that we've done\neverything possible, okay,\n\n67\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.730\nto eliminate as many of the weaknesses,\nvulnerabilities or\n\n68\n00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.860\nexploits that can happen on\nthese systems as much as we can.\n\n69\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.790\nThat will actually prevent that\nestablishment of the beachhead\n\n70\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.470\nthrough these systems as much as possible,\nokay?\n\n71\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.700\nThe other thing, of course, is to make\nsure that your systems are updated the way\n\n72\n00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.260\nthat they need to be along with the\napplication's firmware and even the users.\n\n73\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.480\nI know that there's no real update for\nusers.\n\n74\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.910\nBut in terms of training,\n\n75\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.040\nthat is about the only update that we\nhave for users to actually think about.\n\n76\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.030\nIs that they need to be trained to\nunderstand that somebody can take\n\n77\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.960\nadvantage of their goodness.\n\n78\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.470\nIf they are not watching,\n\n79\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.780\nif they're not careful with what\nthey're taking a look at, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.960\nSo it's very important that\nwe start to understand\n\n81\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100\nthat here in this exploitation bar,\nright, if they get this established,\n\n82\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.780\nit means that they feel pretty\nconfident that they've now\n\n83\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.270\ngotten into the system and everything's\nbeen compromised at this point.\n\n84\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.650\nThis is when they now start to\nestablish their own presence,\n\n85\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.960\nwhich is in the installation phase.\n\n86\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.960\nThis is where it is also known\nas the persistent phase.\n\n87\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.720\nThat means that they now have established\neverything and that they are there.\n\n88\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.610\nAnd they have pretty much access to the\nsystem without you ever knowing about it.\n\n89\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.600\nThey establish what we\ncall a backdoor access.\n\n90\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.430\nAnd usually this involves, of course,\nthe idea of remote access as well.\n\n91\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.030\nBut they essentially have\ntheir own system without\n\n92\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.290\nalerting anybody that they're there.\n\n93\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.680\nThey now have a presence on the network.\n\n94\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.700\nYou don't know about it, but\nthey know about it, and that's the key.\n\n95\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.170\nAnd not only is this type of attack\nsomething in which is going to actually\n\n96\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.730\nrun against the machine, they really\nhave established something permanent.\n\n97\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.132\nNotice that what I've\nactually listed here,\n\n98\n00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:37.310\nsurvives system, reboots,\nanti-malware, and anti-virus scans.\n\n99\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.150\nThey figured out how to hide themselves.\n\n100\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.630\nThey now have actually installed\nsomething that survives a reboot,\n\n101\n00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.132\nwhich is pretty good, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:47.045\nAllows them to actually be able to run.\n\n103\n00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:50.910\nEven if you reboot the machine,\nit comes back up and it's ready to go.\n\n104\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.614\nSo this means if they can actually do\nsomething like that, then they have\n\n105\n00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:58.572\ncomplete control over that system,\neven if you don't know about it, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:58.572 --> 00:05:59.780\n&gt;&gt; That's scary looking.\n\n107\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat is pretty scary at this point.\n\n108\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.170\nSo in defending, how do we actually\nknow that this is happening?\n\n109\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.870\nWell, the way that we know this\nis happening is relatively easy,\n\n110\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.940\nbut it's also one of\nthe less exciting parts\n\n111\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.870\nof working in security operations here,\nwhich is monitoring and logging, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.670\nIt doesn't really sound fun to me, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.490\nI don't like looking at\nthe idea of logs to try and\n\n114\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.490\nfind a lot of indications that\na system has been compromised.\n\n115\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.240\nI don't like monitoring a lot.\n\n116\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.830\nI'm glad that there are systems and\nutilities out there\n\n117\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.170\nthat really send me alerts that say, hey,\nwe've monitored this unusual activity.\n\n118\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.592\nBut I really don't like to actually have\nto monitor manually myself to try and\n\n119\n00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:48.460\nfigure out whether or\nnot this presence is there.\n\n120\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.074\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\n\n121\n00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:52.920\nwhy wouldn't you wanna just stop it at\nthis point if you've actually detected it?\n\n122\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, okay, but the problem\nis stopping it at this particular point\n\n123\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.080\nmay lead you to actually go,\nokay, the attack has stopped.\n\n124\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.260\nBut it doesn't really prevent another\nattack, in other words a person\n\n125\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.090\ncan actually give you the same attack\nagain, and do you actually learn anymore?\n\n126\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So yes, you wanna try and\n\n127\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.570\nstop it as soon as you can, but at the\nsame time, if now they've gotten this far,\n\n128\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.080\nyou wanna discover how they\nwere able to get this far.\n\n129\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.190\nWhat did they take advantage of-\n&gt;&gt; Investigative work.\n\n130\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, some more investigative work,\nsome more stuff that has to be done here.\n\n131\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.970\n&gt;&gt; And you also want to, of course,\n\n132\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.670\ncontinue to actually take a look at\nexisting breaches that might be out there.\n\n133\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.470\nThis may not even be your company.\n\n134\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.570\nSomebody writes about\na particular breach and\n\n135\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.990\nwhat has happened,\nlearn from those events, okay,\n\n136\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.230\nthat now allow you to see where somebody\nelse has actually been breached before.\n\n137\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.100\nAnd then, of course, had their particular\nway of actually creating the mitigation\n\n138\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.090\nand you do the same thing, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.554\nSo you being able to create a mitigation\nat this point may also help you\n\n140\n00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.221\nout as well.\n\n141\n00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.011\nBut being able to monitor and log,\nthat is an important of what we do.\n\n142\n00:07:56.011 --> 00:07:59.973\nAnd throughout the series, we've even\nshown you some of these logs We've shown\n\n143\n00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.849\nyou some of the systems that monitor.\n\n144\n00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:07.600\nAnd we've taken a look at the astalt\nwatch before using a net flow.\n\n145\n00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.830\nWe've also showed you the fire power\nmanagement center you name it.\n\n146\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.540\nThere's actually a lot of utilities that\nare very good at doing this kind of stuff.\n\n147\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n148\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.730\nit is important that we do this, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.464\nCuz once they actually do have\na presence on our system,\n\n150\n00:08:21.464 --> 00:08:23.789\nit's not that we don't\nwant them off of it, but\n\n151\n00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:27.012\nwe also want to learn from what\nthey also have gotten into as well.\n\n152\n00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n153\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay now if they've actually gotten to\nthat point, more than likely, okay, they\n\n154\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:39.660\nhave compromised your system, and they now\nactually run what we call a CNC or 2C.\n\n155\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.390\nIs obviously how you can have it\nwritten which is command and control.\n\n156\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.830\nAnd this is the ability to have\nremote control access, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.390\nSo they have compromised\na particular host to that point,\n\n158\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.158\nwhere they now can essentially send\nthe commands that they need to the host.\n\n159\n00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:02.700\nAnd that host can actually run\nwhatever command are issued to them,\n\n160\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.140\nwithout them ever being caught\nas a presence on your network.\n\n161\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.640\nSo they normally establish\na particular channel, so\n\n162\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.620\nthat they can take manual\ncontrol if they need to.\n\n163\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.660\nMost of the time, these types of C and\nC machines, they are manually controlled,\n\n164\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.860\nthey're not set up to do just automation,\na lot of times.\n\n165\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.130\nThey are actually designed so\n\n166\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.480\nthat somebody has to send\nthem commands to do so.\n\n167\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.220\nThe defender at this point,\nhis particular defense, right, is simple.\n\n168\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.950\nCut off the remote control\ncommunications if they\n\n169\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:33.740\ncan-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.180\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you wanna do.\n\n171\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.886\nIf the attacker cannot send\ncommands into the C&amp;C machine,\n\n172\n00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:45.460\nthe C&amp;C machine as compromised as it\nis is not gonna take action on its own.\n\n173\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.180\nSo once you cut off that communication\nchannel where it's sending information\n\n174\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.070\nback to the attacker, and the attacker's\nresponding by sending commands back in\n\n175\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.840\nto that C&amp;C machine, well at that\npoint they still have command.\n\n176\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.722\nBut if you can cut that access off.\n\n177\n00:09:59.722 --> 00:10:03.387\nThen even if they send back and\nsay here's what you can attack, and\n\n178\n00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:07.379\nyou've cut off the communications\nyou're not allowing them to receive\n\n179\n00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:10.732\nany type of communication back or\nany type of commands back.\n\n180\n00:10:10.732 --> 00:10:15.480\nAnd that effectively also stops\nthe actual progress of the attack\n\n181\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.155\nfrom going on as well, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:22.955\nSo, at this point, it's pretty late\nin the game, in terms of intrusion.\n\n183\n00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.535\nAnd they've gotten to\nthis particular point.\n\n184\n00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:29.815\nUsually, once they've gotten to this\npoint, the last phase that we talk about\n\n185\n00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:34.240\nhere, is that they've really achieved\ntheir particular goal, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.720\nThe attacker is now actually getting\nwhat he wants from the systems.\n\n187\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.970\nHe's able to collect the data he chooses,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.700\nOr if he's actually one of those that\nreally wants to hold your system ransom,\n\n189\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.540\nokay, he might be encrypting all\nthe data across all the drives.\n\n190\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.400\nThe shared drives in your network\nwith a very strong encryption and\n\n191\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.320\nthen asking you to pay him whatever\nmoney that he wants you to pay, for\n\n192\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.280\nyou to actually decrypt it as well.\n\n193\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.182\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, have you ever had personally\nworked for a company that had this happen?\n\n194\n00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:06.151\nNot mentioning the name, of course.\n\n195\n00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:10.690\n&gt;&gt; No, one time is that we did\nactually have dealings with this.\n\n196\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.950\nWhere it was like, yeah,\nthere's only two options that you have.\n\n197\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.949\nYou can try and break it more than likely\nit's not gonna happen because there's lack\n\n198\n00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:21.273\nof 4,096 bit encryption which\ncould take you hundreds of years,\n\n199\n00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:23.313\nif not thousands of years to try and\nbreak.\n\n200\n00:11:23.313 --> 00:11:24.972\n&gt;&gt; Too long.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, too long.\n\n201\n00:11:24.972 --> 00:11:27.682\nOkay, and so the other option was-\n&gt;&gt; Shut it all down.\n\n202\n00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:29.450\n&gt;&gt; We don't like to do, yeah.\n\n203\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.760\nWhich is you might have\nto pay their system.\n\n204\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.480\nNow, you're good if you have your backups.\n\n205\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.420\nAnd you know that everything is actually\nrunning and good and that you can do that.\n\n206\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.890\nYou can't just go ahead and say,\nlook, I've got good backups.\n\n207\n00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.010\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n208\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.720\nSo you flush it out.\n\n209\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.490\nBut if you haven't figured out how\nthey got in up into this point,\n\n210\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.720\nthen that means they can\nrun the attack again.\n\n211\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.200\nSo it's not really saving you any if you\ncan't figure out where that went in.\n\n212\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.980\nSo yeah, you do have to actually\ntake some time to figure out,\n\n213\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.140\nbefore I kind of clear this off and\nrestore my backups,\n\n214\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.240\nlet me isolate the system off, and\nmake sure this up and running.\n\n215\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.212\nAnd then, let me see what security\nholes they may have attacked from.\n\n216\n00:12:10.212 --> 00:12:13.377\nThat's where you go back to into\nthe monitors, and you take a look at logs,\n\n217\n00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:15.889\nand you take a look at where\nthese systems might have been and\n\n218\n00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:17.671\nyou take a look at what happened there,.\n\n219\n00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:22.530\nBut yes, this is something that you do\nhave to actually think about, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.170\nAlso, there's the extraction of data,\nof course.\n\n221\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.150\nCompromise of data integrity, this is\nwhere it becomes much more difficult.\n\n222\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.272\nThey may not do anything, but\nsimply manipulate and change your data.\n\n223\n00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:36.633\nSo this is kind of the famous\nmovie script idea here, Zach,\n\n224\n00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:41.074\nwhere the teenager of course gets access\nto the school's computing system and\n\n225\n00:12:41.074 --> 00:12:44.075\nchanges his grade from the D minus-\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say that's\n\n226\n00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:44.712\nwhat it's like.\n\n227\n00:12:44.712 --> 00:12:45.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to the A.\n\n228\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.220\nOf course every parent believes that,\n\n229\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.050\nthat that's what happens overnight is that\na D minus goes to an A just automatically.\n\n230\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.630\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So why not?\n\n231\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.400\nSo there is that data compromise.\n\n232\n00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.840\nAnd then of course even\nthe availability here.\n\n233\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.180\nAlong with the encrypting,\n\n234\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.870\nthe compromise of data availability\nis also key as well, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.960\nSo, that's what\nthe attacker ends up doing.\n\n236\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.280\nSo on the defender side then,\nwe also want to take a look at how we\n\n237\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.230\nnormally defend at this particular\npoint too Well, this is simple.\n\n238\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.410\nIf they're getting this point,\n\n239\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.550\nwe need to of course,\neliminate them from our systems.\n\n240\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.170\nThis is that mission again.\n\n241\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.200\nThat strange militaristic\nterm that I'm putting in.\n\n242\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.550\nSearch and destroy, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.430\nIf you are already having this,\nthat's when these happen.\n\n244\n00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.270\nYou go ahead and\nyou do that search and destroy.\n\n245\n00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.740\nYou go from passive network security\nmonitoring, in other words,\n\n246\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.390\njust trying to see what it is, to active.\n\n247\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.795\nTo really turning on just about every\ntool that you can to get as much\n\n248\n00:13:42.795 --> 00:13:47.360\ndata as you can and get everything set\nup the way that we want to as well.\n\n249\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.150\nSo Zach, let me ask you a question here\nas we continue to move forward, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.590\nSo, here we are, we're kind of at\nthe mission accomplished stage\n\n251\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:01.020\nwhere the attackers are already\ndone active security monitoring or\n\n252\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.530\nactive network security monitoring I\nshould say it doesn't really sound like\n\n253\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.260\nit's gonna accomplish much does it, since\nthe attack is pretty much over, right?\n\n254\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I think as you already\npointed out we need to find out\n\n255\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.770\ntheir vulnerabilities and\ngo back and maybe wreck and order.\n\n256\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.190\nFind out what it is or how it is\nthat they were able to infiltrate.\n\n257\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt Zach, and\n\n258\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.170\nthat's actually great when you\nstart thinking of it that way.\n\n259\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.420\nA lot of times it's just easy.\n\n260\n00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.860\nWe say all right they've kind of won.\n\n261\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.740\nAll we have to do now is\njust kind of recover,\n\n262\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.700\nbut that's not the only part, right?\n\n263\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.104\nUsing that act of security monitoring or\nnetwork security monitoring that\n\n264\n00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:40.453\nwe're talking about, really does allow\nus to learn more information and\n\n265\n00:14:40.453 --> 00:14:43.222\nallow us to maybe even discover\na bit more about our own system\n\n266\n00:14:43.222 --> 00:14:43.934\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't happen again.\n\n267\n00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it doesn't happen again.\n\n268\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.712\nAnd the only other thing, right, about\nthis too that we want to point out, is,\n\n269\n00:14:50.712 --> 00:14:54.105\nalong with that network\nsecurity monitoring, is that,\n\n270\n00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:58.062\nif this is an attack that really\nbreaches some sort of legal thing,\n\n271\n00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:01.122\nwe may also have to go into\nthe realms of forensics.\n\n272\n00:15:01.122 --> 00:15:03.921\nAnd start to actually gather\nthat information as well.\n\n273\n00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.112\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna mention that as well.\n\n274\n00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:09.071\n&gt;&gt; So using something like this, right,\nis not always just about defense, defense,\n\n275\n00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:11.542\neven though that's the way\nwe've talked about it.\n\n276\n00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:15.198\nBut it may be, at this point, that if\nthis is what we're doing with the active\n\n277\n00:15:15.198 --> 00:15:18.770\nsecurity monitoring, is that we now\ngo back and start gathering the logs.\n\n278\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.930\nWe start gathering whatever damages\nthat may have happened, we start\n\n279\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:27.040\nactually taking packet captures about what\nwe actually are seeing on our networks.\n\n280\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.100\nAnd this is stuff that we want to make\nsure, of course, have proper time stamps\n\n281\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.140\nand we wanna make sure that there's\na context to what's happened, and\n\n282\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.290\nthat we set it all up.\n\n283\n00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.230\nBecause we wanna be able to prosecute\nthis at the end of the day.\n\n284\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:43.130\nYou hate to say it, attackers will stop\nwhen you stop them, and that's one thing.\n\n285\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.801\nBut they'll only stop temporarily.\n\n286\n00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:48.737\nIf you really want them to stop, you have\nto be willing to carry it out through\n\n287\n00:15:48.737 --> 00:15:53.244\nthe prosecution and whatever your company\nchooses a prosecution for that end result.\n\n288\n00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.482\nIf they don't,\nthere is no real consequence for them.\n\n289\n00:15:56.482 --> 00:16:00.419\nThey didn't spend any additional\nmoney in attacking your system,\n\n290\n00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:05.470\nwhether it took them two days to do it or\nwhether it took them six months to do it.\n\n291\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.580\nThey're sitting wherever\nthey're sitting and\n\n292\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.270\nthis is their particular life which is\nthat idea, making that attack work.\n\n293\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.930\nSo you're not causing them to lose a job,\nso\n\n294\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.250\nthey're not feeding their family off\nof this, is what's ended up happening.\n\n295\n00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.970\nIn other words, you've got to take the\ntime to literally take them out of their\n\n296\n00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.340\ncomfort and their zone, and the only way\nto do that is by prosecuting them, and\n\n297\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.890\nlegally, to the extent\nof the law that you can.\n\n298\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.740\nSo that's another part of this kill phase,\nso even at the end, when you\n\n299\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.030\nthink that the whole goal of stopping them\nand the point is, of course, to stop them.\n\n300\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.960\nBut what we want to do is\nstop the attack permanently,\n\n301\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.350\nis what we wanna do and\nthat ends with that process.\n\n302\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.560\nNow I want us to take a look at something\nelse here, I made this particular diagram.\n\n303\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.700\nWe'll have the full screen so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n304\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.290\nOver on the left-hand side, these are\nthe terminology that we have been using.\n\n305\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n306\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Now I've kind of categorized them and\n\n307\n00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.870\nthis is where it gets a little bit\nmore muddy in terms of the water.\n\n308\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:14.000\nThe first two and a half, reconnaissance,\nweaponry and part of delivery,\n\n309\n00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.280\nreally indicate that you are targeting\nthat system at that point,\n\n310\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.200\nat least from the attacker's perspective.\n\n311\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.260\nOnce you get into that delivery,\ngoing all the way through installation,\n\n312\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.280\nthis is when the system is\nalready compromised and then,\n\n313\n00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.720\nas far as control goes, and\nthe actions on objectives,\n\n314\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.595\nyou are now in what we call that\nbreaching category, as well.\n\n315\n00:17:37.595 --> 00:17:38.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n316\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Right here in the center,\nthese are also common terms that you may\n\n317\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.420\nhear used, not just in everyday\nblogs that you might read,\n\n318\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.710\nor people might call them out in whatever\ncenter that you're actually working for.\n\n319\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.560\nNotice it is saying here, recon, stage,\n\n320\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.515\nlaunch, exploit, install,\ncallback, persist.\n\n321\n00:17:59.515 --> 00:18:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Notice that all of them, Zach.\n\n322\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.420\nLet's go back to our grammar\nlesson here for just a moment.\n\n323\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.130\nNotice that these are all verbs.\n\n324\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.900\nNow, I'm pointing this out for\na reason, Zach.\n\n325\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So you might go,\n\n326\n00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.610\nwhat do I care about verbs?\n\n327\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:16.860\nWhy does it matter?\n\n328\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.508\nBecause there's only one way that they\ncan ask you questions on the exam, Zach.\n\n329\n00:18:23.508 --> 00:18:25.083\nZach, are you getting my drift here?\n\n330\n00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.411\n&gt;&gt; I get the gist of your jib, yes.\n\n331\n00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:32.348\n&gt;&gt; So being able to associate these\nparticular types of verbs a lot of times,\n\n332\n00:18:32.348 --> 00:18:38.500\nwith maybe those phases, may help you on\nthe outcome of the exam at [CROSSTALK]\n\n333\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.755\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, Ronnie, very good.\n\n334\n00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Or a question in the near future\nthat you might end up facing.\n\n335\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.670\nNow, I'm not gonna say that always, and\n\n336\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.440\nI can't really tell you that that's\nwhat's going to happen, because\n\n337\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.100\nI'd be lying to you, that I'd be able to\ntell you exactly what's going to happen.\n\n338\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Word association is important.\n\n339\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.530\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, understanding how you\ncan actually accomplish some of this,\n\n340\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.200\nespecially on questions that\nmay seem a little bit vague\n\n341\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Understanding the verb association to\n\n342\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.620\nthese action or\n\n343\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.040\nthese phases may actually be key that can\nhelp you actually figure out some things.\n\n344\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.990\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff, Ronnie.\n\n345\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.880\n&gt;&gt; The other thing, of course,\nis you gotta understand the capabilities\n\n346\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.310\nthat you have to combat\nthese phases as well.\n\n347\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.850\nNotice that I do have a whole\nlist of them right here as well.\n\n348\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.380\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n349\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\nincluding Next Generation Firewall and\n\n350\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.700\nNext Generation IPS, this will help us\nduring that reconnaissance stage as well.\n\n351\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.825\nGetting good threat intelligence\nfrom what we've also seen as well.\n\n352\n00:19:29.825 --> 00:19:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n353\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.370\n&gt;&gt; We are able to actually\n\n354\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.710\nsee that through\nthe Firepower Management Center, too.\n\n355\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.070\nIn compromises, to verify that compromises\nhave happened, you may actually have to\n\n356\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.310\ntake a look at your DNS-layer security,\nas well as your email and\n\n357\n00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.018\nweb securities, and\neven your Next Generation IPS out there.\n\n358\n00:19:47.018 --> 00:19:50.150\nYour network anti-malware\nmay tell you more.\n\n359\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.030\nAgain, notice the firewall and the IPS.\n\n360\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.900\nThose are all coming\ntogether because that's\n\n361\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.680\nwhere the Firepower Management Center\nreally finds its power.\n\n362\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Host anti-malware will also help you\n\n363\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.330\nduring the installation part and\nreally at the end here flow analytics, and\n\n364\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.760\nthis is really more about\nnet flow than anything else.\n\n365\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.680\nThese types of capabilities\nhelp us to really countermand\n\n366\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.970\nthe idea of what we're seeing here in\nterms of the way that the attacker\n\n367\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.040\nviews the actual intrusion\nthat's going on.\n\n368\n00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.150\nSo when we can stop this,\nthe earlier that we can stop it,\n\n369\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.260\nthese are the actual capabilities\nthat we have to be able to\n\n370\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.560\ncountermand their particular intrusion\nthat continues to launch forward.\n\n371\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.970\nNow all that by itself,\nZach, is not enough.\n\n372\n00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.520\nI know it sounds like, we've got it,\nwe understand Ronnie, but\n\n373\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.630\nit's not enough to actually\njust understand that point.\n\n374\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.420\nThe reason why is that gives us at\nleast a healthy understanding of,\n\n375\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.520\nI know I need to stop this\nearlier than this if I can and\n\n376\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.100\nit allows us to see that along the way,\nwhat stage we might be stopping that in.\n\n377\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.920\nBut we still don't understand the attack\nitself and how the attack ends up working.\n\n378\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.660\nIn that sense, what you want to do is you\nwant to take each of these phases that\n\n379\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.610\nwe've been talking about right here and\nbe able to actually understand what\n\n380\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:21.070\nis going to happen as we\nmove through an attack.\n\n381\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.050\nAnd the way that we do that is that\nwe actually have to understand\n\n382\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.780\nwhat an intrusion actually involves.\n\n383\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.960\nWe have to be able to analyze an intrusion\nand understand the break down of how\n\n384\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.920\nan intrusion happens in\nthese categories as well.\n\n385\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.980\nNow when we do that, we actually\nend up following another particular\n\n386\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.070\nmodel here that is called the diamond\nmodel of intrusion analysis.\n\n387\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.480\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering when we'd get to that.\n\n388\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Go figure.\n\n389\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.250\nWe actually are going to get to this and\nwe're actually gonna take a look and\n\n390\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.890\nmake sure that we understand\nthis particular model, and\n\n391\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.370\nhow it breaks down for us,\nand what we need to do.\n\n392\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:03.460\nAnd we're gonna associate this with the\nkill chain as well, but the problem is,\n\n393\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.280\nZach, and I saw that you gave\nme the hand signal here.\n\n394\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.550\nHey, I've only got a few minutes left,\nand there's no way I'm gonna be\n\n395\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.300\nable to address all that in\nthe few minutes we have left.\n\n396\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.930\nSo Zach,\n\n397\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.750\nit look like we are heading into a part\nthree, is what's actually happening here.\n\n398\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.840\nZach, let's go ahead and\nsave that instead of trying\n\n399\n00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.920\nto break it off real quickly\nas I begin the process here.\n\n400\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.170\n&gt;&gt; No, we'd rather have a part three,\nClassify and Categorize Intrusions, and\n\n401\n00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:29.775\nmake sure you watch part one and part two.\n\n402\n00:22:29.775 --> 00:22:32.950\nRonnie, you're doing a wonderful job,\ndon't leave any stone unturned and\n\n403\n00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.770\nwatch every episode of CCNA SECOPS and\nvisit our course library, and\n\n404\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.880\nlook at all the wonderful videos there.\n\n405\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.030\nThere's hundreds of them all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n406\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.540\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n407\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.050\nThey'd be glad you did.\n\n408\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.790\nThanks for watching.\n\n409\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.590\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n410\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.410\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.951\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:14.677\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPRO.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.440\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.990\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nand this is CCNA Sec-ops.\n\n7\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.930\nAnd this is classify and\ncategorize intrusions.\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.899\nWait for it, part three.\n\n9\n00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's a part one,\n\n10\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.860\npart two make sure you\nsee the whole series and\n\n11\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.860\nof course, Ronnie Wong is bringing\nall that information that we need.\n\n12\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.317\nRonnie good to see you again,\nand when last we left off, right?\n\n13\n00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:37.239\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We are just\n\n14\n00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.600\nsaid that we're going to\nbe going into the diamond.\n\n15\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.276\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm, model?\n\n16\n00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Model of intrusion, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.145\nBut first-\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you give us a recap,\n\n18\n00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:45.590\nif you could, please.\n\n19\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.467\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah, in the previous\nepisodes, we've talked about this idea of\n\n20\n00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:55.346\nintrusions and needing to stop intrusions,\nand we went through the Kill Chain,\n\n21\n00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.740\nwhich was really kind of first\nmade by Lockheed Martin.\n\n22\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.000\nAnd then, of course,\nexpanding out through the industry.\n\n23\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.240\nAnd the whole goal behind that,\nis the ability to stop intrusions.\n\n24\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.460\nAnd that's what we wanna do.\n\n25\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.100\nWe want to see the actual\nintrusion process, and\n\n26\n00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.950\nthe way that an intrusion actually\ndoes develop and get access inside.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.376\nBut, we also want to use that picker\nmodel to help us stop intrusions,\n\n28\n00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:21.065\nthe earlier along that model\nthat we can stop, is the key.\n\n29\n00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.415\nAnd so,\nwe've actually gotten through that and\n\n30\n00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.930\nnow we're moving into the diamond model.\n\n31\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.906\nSo, let's make sure that we have\nthis idea in mind again, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:33.350\nSo previously, all right, here's what we\nwere looking at, these seven different\n\n33\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.020\nphases, reconnaissance, weaponization,\ndelivery, exploitation, installation,\n\n34\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.830\ncommand and control, and\nof course actions on objectives.\n\n35\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.710\nWe've talked about the other elements to,\nbut, make sure you check out the other\n\n36\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.130\nepisodes, make sure you actually kind of\npay attention to details on that point.\n\n37\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.650\nBut that's what we actually did, and\nthe further down that we go means that,\n\n38\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.890\nof course, the intruder has advanced\nmore into our systems, or our networks,\n\n39\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.090\nthan we realized.\n\n40\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.030\nAnd that means that I've learned much\nmore information and their attack is\n\n41\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.630\ngonna be successful as they continue\nto move on down through this process.\n\n42\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.310\nSo the earlier that we can stop the attack\nfrom happening, along this process or\n\n43\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.185\nthe intrusion from happening the better we\nare of when start to actually defend okay?\n\n44\n00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n45\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.290\n&gt;&gt; So along with this though\n\n46\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500\nis not sufficient,\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n47\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.690\nJust to have this idea\nthat we need to stop-\n\n48\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.110\njust to understand these phases\nis not sufficient enough, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.060\nWe need to understand how\nthe attack actually does occur, or\n\n50\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.560\nthe intrusion occurs, and understand\nthe process that needs to happen.\n\n51\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.350\nAnd the way that we do that is\nby using the diamond model.\n\n52\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.920\nSo we use them as\ncomplimentary to one another.\n\n53\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.260\nThe kill chain, as well as this diamond\nmodel of intrusion analysis here.\n\n54\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.760\nNow, the first one does tell us the steps\nthat it takes in terms of process,\n\n55\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.040\nof what the intrusion, what the intruder,\n\n56\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.640\nexcuse me, is doing through those\ndifferent categories, or those phases.\n\n57\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.230\nBut this allows us to take a look at\nevery one of those phases, and to\n\n58\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.400\nbe able to breakdown the analysis of what\nactually occurred in those phases as well.\n\n59\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.890\nSo let's make sure we can see\nwhat's going on here, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.930\nIn the Diamond Model\nof Intrusion Analysis,\n\n61\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.490\nthere are four different components.\n\n62\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.050\nEasier way to think about it, adversary,\ninfrastructure, capabilities, and\n\n63\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.490\nvictim, all down here.\n\n64\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.470\nThe goal is fairly simple\nin terms of intrusion.\n\n65\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.540\nThe adversary wants to\ncompromise the victim.\n\n66\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.314\nThat's the way how it goes, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:39.137\nThe diamond model pretty much\nessentially establishes a theorem for\n\n68\n00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:44.750\nus that says this, okay, an adversary,\nright up here at the top,\n\n69\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.700\nwill always be able to use whatever\na capabilities that he has at hand.\n\n70\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.691\nTo bring about an attack on an intruder,\nthrough whatever infrastructure\n\n71\n00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.820\nhe has to go through before he can\nactually attack the victim, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.170\nSo whatever ends up happening, is always\nus considering that the adversary\n\n73\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.190\nby himself is not part of just\nthe intrusion, he's a piece of it.\n\n74\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.690\nBut he has to take what\nhe has capabilities of,\n\n75\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.350\nhe has to be able to route that through or\nget through the infrastructure, or\n\n76\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.920\nuse the infrastructure so that he can have\na platform to attack the victim as well.\n\n77\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.060\nNotice that even though the whole goal,\nright, is the adversary\n\n78\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.660\nreally wants to compromise the victim,\nin this particular model, Zach,\n\n79\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.040\nnotice that there is no direct line\nfrom the adversary to the victim, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.550\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhy does that really matter, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.970\nWell, if I want to compromise the attack,\nI have a couple of things that I can do.\n\n82\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.830\nI'm really not gonna compromise the\nAdversary unless I somehow take him out\n\n83\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.330\ndoing something, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.920\nHe's arrested,\nends up falling off his bike or\n\n85\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.850\nhis little four wheeler or whatever it is.\n\n86\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.270\nHe's hospitalized,\nI'm not gonna be able to compromise him.\n\n87\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.880\nCuz I don't even know who he is, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.280\nBut I do know that some\nattackers have more, or\n\n90\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.120\nadversaries I should say,\nhave more capabilities than others.\n\n91\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.970\nSo for me, discovering what\nlevel of capabilities that\n\n92\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.720\nthis particular attacker may have\nallows me to be able to understand.\n\n93\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.160\nAnd possibly even defeat\nthe attacker By doing what?\n\n94\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.300\nRemoving some of the capabilities,\nby defending my network as well,\n\n95\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.480\nwhich means I can also go into my network\nand build better infrastructure, or\n\n96\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.230\nupkeep the infrastructure as well,\nprotecting the victim 2, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.600\nSo depending on what the attacker actually\nhas do, I know that I can't change this\n\n98\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.910\nguy, and I can really hardly\nchange who he wants to attack.\n\n99\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.770\nBut right here, in these two,\nI have the capability,\n\n100\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.890\nexcuse me, and my self or my organization.\n\n101\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.840\nShould have to control the infrastructure,\nat least a part of it, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.100\nOr, I have the capabilities to\nessentially defeat these things as well.\n\n103\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.790\nAnd that should effectively block,\nbecause there's no direct link here, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So in theory,\n\n105\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.270\nwhen we talk about the form of an attack.\n\n106\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.100\nLet me see if I can do this right.\n\n107\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.400\nThere we go, that will actually work.\n\n108\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.150\nLet me, make a mark here and\nI'm gonna change the color and\n\n109\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.570\nwe'll use a highlighter kind\nof looking color, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; For an attacker to\n\n111\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.878\nhave any type of attack, an adversary,\nhe has to essentially come down here,\n\n112\n00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:34.170\npick up whatever capabilities\nhe has of attacking.\n\n113\n00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.540\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n114\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.420\n&gt;&gt; Select whatever infrastructure\nhe's going through\n\n115\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.690\nbefore he can actually end up\nmounting an attack right here.\n\n116\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.760\nSo if you take a look you can\nsee that there is no direct\n\n117\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.540\nlink here to be able to do stuff.\n\n118\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Well there's no direct line\n&gt;&gt; Yea, so\n\n119\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.150\nin these actually you point out something,\nthe term line is actually a technical term\n\n120\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.680\nhere\n&gt;&gt; As well,\n\n121\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.270\nwhere it says \"Here's how they\nare connected\", I don't want to,\n\n122\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.545\nI'm trying to make sure I don't\ndelete the whole diagram.\n\n123\n00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.910\n[laughs] I don't want to do that.\n\n124\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.670\nSo, yeah, the lines are actually important\nin terms of their particular connection.\n\n125\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.790\nThe adversary does have direct access to\nsome of the infrastructure depending on\n\n126\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.390\nwho owns it ok?\n\n127\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.260\nSo, in other words, a company\nmight actually completely own and\n\n128\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.990\ncontrol Their own entire infrastructure,\nwhich is fine and good, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.020\nSo if they do, the adversary could mount\nan attack just to get the infrastructure,\n\n130\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.000\nwhich is one of the victims,\nalso, possible.\n\n131\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.120\nAnd he still has to use\nall the capability there.\n\n132\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.370\nHe can't just attack the infrastructure\nwithout using some capability of his.\n\n133\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.780\nIt could also have, or\nwe could actually have,\n\n134\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.700\nwhat we call co-opted types\nof infrastructures as well.\n\n135\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.940\nAnd this in when we have part\nof our environment on premises,\n\n136\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.740\nas well as part of our environment maybe\ncloud-driven or cloud-based as well.\n\n137\n00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.380\nSo, that's what we talk about\nas being co-opted there.\n\n138\n00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.680\nIt could also be part of\na service provider, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.760\nAnd the service providers\ncan provide what?\n\n140\n00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.580\nOne and two if they need to, where\neverything is actually completely up to,\n\n141\n00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.700\nyou know, the service provider aspect of\nit, which they can either provide type\n\n142\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.040\n1 or type 2 here,\nin terms of the infrastructure, and\n\n143\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.040\nthen you're just, you're buying\nsubscription, is what you're doing.\n\n144\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.560\nThen they can provide everything\nwhen we start to do that.\n\n145\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.750\nUnderstanding the victim, it can actually\nbe individual persons or organizations.\n\n146\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.490\nIt could be network assets,\nlike we talked about.\n\n147\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.360\nOr even something a little\nbit more targeted,\n\n148\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.380\nsuch as email addresses,\nis very possible, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.080\nCapabilities, attackers can,\nof course, use malware, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.500\nThey can use regular hacker tools\nthat down there and exploits, okay,\n\n151\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.050\nthat actually exist out there as well,\nokay.\n\n152\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.490\nAll of these are very\npossible capabilities.\n\n153\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.280\nAn adversary is any threat actor\nthat's actually out there.\n\n154\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.270\nSo in terms of definitions,\n\n155\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.170\nthat's what we actually have to worry\nabout in this idea of the diamond model.\n\n156\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.080\nNow notice over here to the right,\nI kind of put it off to the side here so\n\n157\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.000\nI think this is, yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.730\nLet me get that out of the way.\n\n159\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.850\nThere's other elements\nthat we call metadata.\n\n160\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.150\nThere's an extended version of the diamond\nmodel that essentially goes through and\n\n161\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.750\nsays look, these are also important as we\ntake a look at this diamond model as well.\n\n162\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.600\nIn all these elements in terms\nof an actual intrusion analysis,\n\n163\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.460\nwe might want to include the timestamp.\n\n164\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.590\nThat an intrusion has happened.\n\n165\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.510\nWe might also want to include\nthe phase during the kill cycle,\n\n166\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.210\nin which we're also doing this\nintrusion analysis as well.\n\n167\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:37.410\nSee in direction, results Methodology and\neven resources that were used,\n\n168\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.340\nall of this is actually very possible\nwhen we actually use this to help\n\n169\n00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.680\nus to really zero in and\nfigure out what ends up happening here.\n\n170\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.320\nSo in every aspect of what we were\nlooking at in the kill chain here,\n\n171\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.990\nthat what really ends up happening for\nus TO follow it all the way through,\n\n172\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.080\nlet me see if I can get to where I\nwanna do it, it is right here okay?\n\n173\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.780\nAt every stage, remember that the over\nall goal of the diamond model.\n\n174\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.370\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n175\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Adversary trying to get to the victin.\n\n176\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n177\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, adversary to victin.\n\n178\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.350\nWe may find out that, during that,\nin the intrusion, that we have to\n\n179\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.660\nfollow along that same pattern that I was\nshowing you earlier in the diamond model,\n\n180\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.230\nwhere we go, the adversary,\nthe capabilities, the infrastructure, and\n\n181\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.540\nthen, how is he getting to the victim?\n\n182\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.360\nThat may actually be the first\nstep that we do the analysis.\n\n183\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.450\nWhat kind of reconnaissance did he do.\n\n184\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.820\nSo we actually walk\nthrough that in that step.\n\n185\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.570\nThe same thing through\nthe weaponization part.\n\n186\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.280\nAnd here in delivery, okay,\nnotice that right here,\n\n187\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.055\nZach I have kind of as\nmuch as I could make.\n\n188\n00:10:48.055 --> 00:10:48.560\n&gt;&gt; An off shoot.\n\n189\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this unusual almost\nfaded out dotted look here, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.750\nWhen you see something like this\nspecially in using the diamond model,\n\n191\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.620\nthe straight unbroken\nlines normally indicate\n\n192\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.245\nthat this is an actual attack\nthat has happened okay?\n\n193\n00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:05.840\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n194\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.090\nthis is part of that\nprocess that is going on,\n\n195\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.910\nyou can also use the diamond model for\ntheoretical approaches.\n\n196\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.070\nof what you might think, so\nlets say that in the delivery here,\n\n197\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.270\nwe thought that the delivery actually\nhappened in this way, and we knew that.\n\n198\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.480\nBut now that we're actually at\nthe basis of reviewing this,\n\n199\n00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.120\nwe might also say what else could have\nactually happened in the exploit here, so\n\n200\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.770\nwe can come up with a hypothetical\nway of also doing this And\n\n201\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.480\nwe might also want to list that\nout in terms of an attack.\n\n202\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.360\nSo we might also go ahead and do that.\n\n203\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.505\nThat way we can plan for\nthe future a little bit more.\n\n204\n00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:42.120\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n205\n00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Notice that installation.\n\n206\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.980\nI kind of skipped this step and\nI wanted to.\n\n207\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.080\nAnd the reason why I'm showing this is\nthat you don't have to go through it for\n\n208\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.600\nevery single phase.\n\n209\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.290\nThe installation might have just\nbeen something as simple as,\n\n210\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.500\nthey got it there and\nthat's all that happened.\n\n211\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.480\nCommand and control.\n\n212\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and then it's overall actions.\n\n213\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.460\nDid they actually meet\n\n214\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.160\ntheir goals which has lead them\nto the victim that's possible.\n\n215\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.480\nBut we may also find out that there's\nanother hypothetical down here\n\n216\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.580\nwhich we didn't even think about that\nactually gave them more access that\n\n217\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.000\nwe didn't know about.\n\n218\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.750\nSo when we establish this this is\nactually what we call a vertical type of\n\n219\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.680\nAttack that happens when\nwe actually can chain link\n\n220\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.150\neverything from the actual adversary all\nthe way down through that one victim.\n\n221\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.810\nBut a lot of times this can actually\nbe carried over from a single attacker\n\n222\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.610\nto multiple victims, or even transferred.\n\n223\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.520\nIf we have multiple adversaries at the\nsame time we can actually find that maybe\n\n224\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.840\nat the very end of this, on the attack on\nthe objective This hypothetical might have\n\n225\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.560\nactually led to the possibility\nof another attack forming, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.070\nSo we walk that through the second\nkind of imaginary adversary and\n\n227\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.700\ntry to say, if were to say that,\nit led him here.\n\n228\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.520\nWhat else could he get access into?\n\n229\n00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.460\nAnd now you have the ability not only to\nactually have that kill chain in mind but\n\n230\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.020\nyou can also now do the analysis and\ntry and\n\n231\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.020\nwalk through how the attack had got\nthrough everyone on those stages too.\n\n232\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.110\nAnd by doing that along with the kill\nchain, it also shows you where you could\n\n233\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.430\npossibly stop the attack\nalong the way as well, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.010\nSo this diamond model and being out of\ncategorizing these things together.\n\n235\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.430\nA little bit harder than\nit sounds in terms of\n\n236\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.960\nit's not all gonna fit\nunder the adversary.\n\n237\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.460\nNot gonna all fit under infrastructure.\n\n238\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.195\nIt's not gonna all fit\nunder capabilities but\n\n239\n00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:31.595\nyou can see where it's actually\nused in every stage of this, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.965\nNow, just when you think,\nlike, man, this is weird.\n\n241\n00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:37.315\nIt's, you know,\nit's probably not used at all.\n\n242\n00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:40.825\nThis is used across industries like crazy.\n\n243\n00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:47.815\nThis is a standardized essential, what\nwe call an ad hoc type of adoption here.\n\n244\n00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:51.160\nDe facto,\nI was trying to think of the proper word.\n\n245\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.660\na de facto standard that has pretty\nmuch happened in industries,\n\n246\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.980\nwhere they are using this diamond model\napproach along with the kill chain to\n\n247\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.580\nhelp us to do intrusion analysis, as well\nas to stop intrusions from going on.\n\n248\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:10.220\nIt's only by using them both together are\nwe really going to end up having a full\n\n249\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:16.010\nability to have any type of true intrusion\nIntelligence at all for our networks.\n\n250\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.150\nSo that's the whole goal.\n\n251\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.290\n&gt;&gt; Plus, Ronnie, don't we need to\nknow both of these for the exam?\n\n252\n00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you really do.\n\n253\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.020\nYou need to make sure that\nyou pay attention especially\n\n254\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.570\nto some of the stuff that we showed you.\n\n255\n00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.930\nNow, it doesn't mean that everything\nI showed you is comprehensive.\n\n256\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.730\nIf you take a look, in the diamond\nanalysis there's a full paper on it\n\n257\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.200\nYou can just type in diamond model and\nyou'll see the guy that wrote it.\n\n258\n00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.040\nHis name is Italian.\n\n259\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.430\nI wish I could remember how\nto actually pronounce it.\n\n260\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.630\nBut the guy that actually wrote it,\n\n261\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.260\nvery much a genius in terms\nof understanding this stuff.\n\n262\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.680\nIt takes you through the approach on\nhow he'd actually ends up working and\n\n263\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.060\nhow he'd actually does meld together\nwith that kill chain process as well.\n\n264\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.902\nSo make sure you understand both of them.\n\n265\n00:14:56.902 --> 00:14:59.520\nPay attention specially in\nthe kill of chain to the order\n\n266\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.840\nin which those thing appearing, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.170\nAlso then when you go through,\n\n268\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.680\nunderstand the attacker's point as\nwell as defender's point of view.\n\n269\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.810\nAnd what you can do at each process.\n\n270\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.330\nBring that in to the diamond model,\n\n271\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.990\nunderstanding those elements there along\nwith the metadata that you see and\n\n272\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.320\nit's gonna help you out when you\nget ready for the exam, as well.\n\n273\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.370\nThe analysis or\nthe application of that's right,\n\n274\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.270\nis something that you'll learn when you\nwork in a security operation center.\n\n275\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.040\nWe're here just to make sure you at\nleast understand that concepts and\n\n276\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.770\nthe terms and the capabilities\nof what this can do for you.\n\n277\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.960\nBut remember that that's really where\nthe rubber will hit the road at that\n\n278\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.160\nparticular point.\n\n279\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.313\nWhen you're actually all learning\nabout these picker models here, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:42.309\nAnd you'll see that every shop kind of\ndoes it a little bit differently and\n\n281\n00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:45.930\nthough emphasize something a little bit\ndifferently than the way that I did.\n\n282\n00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.220\nBut overall for the exam, make sure\nyou pay attention to those details.\n\n283\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.290\nIt's gonna help you out when getting\nready for that as well, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.620\nSo Zack at this point,\nwe've actually covered intrusion.\n\n285\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:01.380\nIntrusion elements and intrusion processes\nas well as the intrusion analysis and\n\n286\n00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.010\nthe models pretty well.\n\n287\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.170\nSo that's pretty much all I have\nin terms of intrusion detection.\n\n288\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.880\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, wonderful job as usual.\n\n289\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.000\nThank you very, very, much.\n\n290\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.010\nAnd we sure enjoyed your graphs,\nand your charts, and your diagrams.\n\n291\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.875\nThank you so very much.\n\n292\n00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:16.070\nIs it cause categorize intrusions,\npart three.\n\n293\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.930\nMake sure you see part one and two, and\nwatch all the episodes of CCNA Ssec-ops,\n\n294\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.600\nand also check out all the videos\nin the course library.\n\n295\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.470\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:12.341\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n8\n00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:15.990\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n9\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.039\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nand this is CCNA SECOPS.\n\n10\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.660\nThis episode, ready?\n\n11\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.700\nHere it comes.\n\n12\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.408\nApplying NIST SP 800-61R2 to events.\n\n13\n00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:29.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's only one person I know who can\n\n14\n00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.610\ntell us what that all means.\n\n15\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.410\nIt's Ronnie Wong.\n\n16\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.410\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n17\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.270\nThanks for dropping by.\n\n18\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n19\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.826\nAnd I don't know if I can really tell\nyou what all that means, but we'll try.\n\n20\n00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is what we'll actually take\n\n21\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.340\na look at here.\n\n22\n00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.530\nSo what we're actually gonna dive into\nof course is a special publication from\n\n23\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020\nNIST itself.\n\n24\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.607\nAnd this is the one those publication,\nthe SP, the Special Publications,\n\n25\n00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:55.220\nthe 800-61R2, you must know.\n\n26\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.280\nOkay, I don't know how\nelse to explain this.\n\n27\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.090\nAs you download it from NIST, we've\nalready done a couple of episodes on it or\n\n28\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.950\nat least two different ones.\n\n29\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.670\nI've kinda emphasized especially for\nthis one, you have to read it.\n\n30\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.940\nYou must read it, there's no other way for\nyou to get by and also prepare for\n\n31\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.540\nthe exam without reading it.\n\n32\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.510\nThere's not enough time,\nat least for what we're doing here,\n\n33\n00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.910\neven in getting ready for the exam,\nto kind of read every single bit to you.\n\n34\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.750\nSo we're gonna leave that to you to do but\n\n35\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.480\nwe did point out some of\nthe highlights that you need to know.\n\n36\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.560\nAnd this is also one of those\nsections as well, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.551\nNow, in this one I went ahead and\ndownloaded that particular publication, so\n\n38\n00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:35.832\nlet's take a look here.\n\n39\n00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:40.300\nThis is that Special Publication,\nthe 800-61 Revision 2.\n\n40\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.833\nNow, as you're watching this show,\nwhatever time period after the reporting,\n\n41\n00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:49.312\nyou may see that there might be another\nrevision number after this at some point.\n\n42\n00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:51.890\nIt is possible that they add to it,\nbut for\n\n43\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.780\nthe exam objectives it calls\nout this one specifically.\n\n44\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.381\nSo make sure you don't\ngo with the latest one,\n\n45\n00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.952\nmake sure you go with\nthis one in particular.\n\n46\n00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.981\n&gt;&gt; And read it thoroughly.\n\n47\n00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:03.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes and make sure you read it\nthoroughly because it really does involve\n\n48\n00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:05.971\neverything in that entire document.\n\n49\n00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:12.069\nAnd Zach, again, let me remind\npeople this is not an exciting read,\n\n50\n00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.450\nthis is no Star Wars novel [INAUDIBLE].\n\n51\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.177\nThis is 80 pages, and it really is about,\n\n52\n00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:23.810\nlook Computer Security\nIncident Handling Guide.\n\n53\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.510\nIt really helps you to establish if\nyou don't have everything set up.\n\n54\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.150\nWhat are some of the computer\nsecurity event handling,\n\n55\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.090\nincident handlings guides that\nyou actually want to know about.\n\n56\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.100\nSo we're gonna scroll on down\nthrough to the table of contents and\n\n57\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.620\ntake a look at what this guide includes.\n\n58\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.910\nAnd where we're gonna be\nfocusing on even though we've\n\n59\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.800\nemphasized you've gotta read the whole\nthing, and you definitely need to.\n\n60\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.100\nBut we're gonna be focusing in on\na particular part of this instead is\n\n61\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.810\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n62\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.588\nSo notice it gives us the ability to\norganize computer security incident\n\n63\n00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.110\nresponse capabilities.\n\n64\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.100\nWhich essentially says, hey, if you're\nestablishing a computer incident team,\n\n65\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.780\nfollow through on some\nof the guidelines here.\n\n66\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.700\nThe third section, which we also\nended up taking a look at especially.\n\n67\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.620\nAnd just these particular events\nhere in section number 3.\n\n68\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.000\nWhich, in another episode,\nwe did take a pretty good look at as well.\n\n69\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.370\nSo we'll actually see that and\nthe incident handling in another episode.\n\n70\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.910\nNotice there's also coordination and\nsharing of information as well.\n\n71\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.360\nSo this is something else that we'll\nalso have to take a look at, too.\n\n72\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.270\nSo here we're focusing in\non the list of appendices.\n\n73\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.019\nNow normally this is not a document,\nat least any document that we point to,\n\n74\n00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.620\nwe don't say let's focus in on appendices.\n\n75\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.470\nIt doesn't sound like something\nthat we'd really want to do, but\n\n76\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.160\nit really is something that we're going to\ntalk about, especially in this episode.\n\n77\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd the reason why is that it's right\nhere in pretty much Appendix A,\n\n78\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.040\nthe Incident Handling Scenarios.\n\n79\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.740\nAnd these are important guidelines for us\nand they show us some of the things that\n\n80\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.400\nwe want to make sure that we include when\nwe start talking about incident handling.\n\n81\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.280\nAnd let's say that we're not sure how\nto handle this is a team, what to do,\n\n82\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.190\nthe great thing is,\nthe appendices is gonna help us.\n\n83\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.739\nSo as we have different security\nevents that we have to deal with,\n\n84\n00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.255\nwe have to be able to\nhandle them properly, and\n\n85\n00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:28.080\na lot of times we don't have the guidance\nfor right here in Appendix A.\n\n86\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.800\nIt will give us an example and it'll also\ngive us, essentially, sample questions.\n\n87\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.030\nSample ways that we're working through the\nprocess of using this incident handling.\n\n88\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.730\nSo that's why we're gonna\nfocus in on this section,\n\n89\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.250\nbecause that's really what's called\nout for the exam objective anyways.\n\n90\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.022\nNow the other thing, like I said,\nis that this will help you.\n\n91\n00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:51.817\nSo don't just read through the document,\nand go,\n\n92\n00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:53.740\nI don't worry about the appendices.\n\n93\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.980\nI definitely want to make sure that I go\nthrough and read at least those first two.\n\n94\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.860\nThe glossary,\nyou don't worry about so much.\n\n95\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.510\nThe resources, but overall though,\nthe rest of this actually pretty good,\n\n96\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.470\nbut make sure you actually take\na look at the whole thing.\n\n97\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in previous episode, you did say\nappendices is very, very important and\n\n98\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.280\nalso will guide you to some better\nunderstanding of terms and terminology.\n\n99\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.410\n&gt;&gt; Definitely will.\n\n100\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.100\nSo this is not something you\nwant to overlook in this guide.\n\n101\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.470\nNow, I just clicked on that link that\nyou saw on the Table of Contents for\n\n102\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.270\nAppendix A and\nit automatically brought me right here\n\n103\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.740\nto where it actually says Appendix A,\nIncident Handling Scenarios.\n\n104\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.070\nThe great thing is,\nit's so well documented.\n\n105\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.790\nI'm not saying you have to\nfollow it line by line.\n\n106\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.710\nBut if you do,\nyou're gonna be in a pretty good place,\n\n107\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.550\nin terms of understanding\nincident handling.\n\n108\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.400\nAnd it refers throughout the entire\ndocument anyways to help you make sure\n\n109\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.130\nthat you're doing the things that\nthey suggest as a best practice.\n\n110\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.380\nSo notice right here, Incident Handling\nScenarios provide inexpensive and\n\n111\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.760\neffective ways to build\nincident response skills.\n\n112\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.470\nAnd that's what we want to do.\n\n113\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.155\nWhen giving an incident, we wanna make\nsure that we understand that you have\n\n114\n00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:07.860\nthe skills, identify potential issues with\nthe incident response process as well.\n\n115\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.630\nAnd we also, of course,\nhave scenarios, and\n\n116\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.760\nthen when you're actually\nasked the questions,\n\n117\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.010\nit's not just about asking the question\nof yourself, but asking the team.\n\n118\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.230\nThe team discusses and\n\n119\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.250\ntries to figure out what the most\nlikely answer is going to be.\n\n120\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.796\nThe goal is to determine what\nthe team would really do and\n\n121\n00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.970\ncompare that with policies,\nprocedures, etc.\n\n122\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.132\nSo I don't want to read thing, cuz\nthat's what I'm starting to do here, but\n\n123\n00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:32.488\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n124\n00:06:32.488 --> 00:06:37.269\nThat this guide is really designed to\nhelp to be very practical if you're not\n\n125\n00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:39.910\nsure what to do in these scenarios.\n\n126\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.930\nSo let's take for example that you\ndo have some type of an event that\n\n127\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.100\nessentially happens that\nrequires incident handling.\n\n128\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.600\nLet me scroll down here and\nwe'll come back to these questions.\n\n129\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.360\nNotice that under A2 in Scenarios,\nit lists multiple scenarios\n\n130\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.660\nthat you might want to walk through as\nfar as attested and the guide goes.\n\n131\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.150\nSo if you are actually facing\na scenario where you're\n\n132\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.607\nsuspecting something with the Domain Name\nSystem and the denial of service attacks.\n\n133\n00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:15.020\nNotice they give you a nice scenario read\nand then include additional questions\n\n134\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.070\nalong with the ones that while\nshe talk about in a moment.\n\n135\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.730\nIf you actually want to take a look at\nthe idea here of malware, such as worm and\n\n136\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.890\ndistributed denial of service as well.\n\n137\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.450\nHere's another scenario for\n\n138\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.120\nyou to walk through,\nas well as additional questions to ask.\n\n139\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.960\nStolen documentation,\nagain, another scenario.\n\n140\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.130\nNotice it's relatively diverse in\nthe scenarios that it gives you.\n\n141\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.770\nIt doesn't just say,\nhere's one and figure it out.\n\n142\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.460\nHere it is, compromised database server,\nonce again another one.\n\n143\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.970\nUnknown data exfiltration, that they\nactually got your data outta there.\n\n144\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.070\nUnauthorized access to payroll records.\n\n145\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.908\nLook at all this.\n\n146\n00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:56.792\nDisappearing host that\nactually just goes away.\n\n147\n00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:01.798\nTelecommuting compromises Anonymous\nthreats, peer to peer file sharing,\n\n148\n00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:07.350\nunknown wireless access points,\nrogue access points that end up appearing.\n\n149\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.310\nWell, that's quite a few scenarios.\n\n150\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.360\n&gt;&gt; But it's very comprehensive.\n\n151\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that you can at least walk\nthrough and have an understanding,\n\n152\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.310\nand you might go, well do I really\nneed to walk through all of them.\n\n153\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.490\nAnd that depends on your organization.\n\n154\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.150\nBut doing this in terms of game play,\nin other words,\n\n155\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.640\nthe idea of actually running through it as\nscenario basis for your team, might give\n\n156\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.530\nyou good thought processes as you develop\nyour particular incident handling, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.550\nSo let's go back and see what it is\nthat they choose for us to do, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.460\nSo when we start off, right?\n\n159\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.980\nAnd we start taking at whatever\nscenario that we're given, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.795\nWe always want to make sure that we walk\nthrough those steps according to the NIST\n\n161\n00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:49.130\ndocument here.\n\n162\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.260\nOf what needs to happen, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.060\nWell, there's always this idea\nof preparation time, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.810\nDetection and analysis, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.150\nEach one of these, containment,\neradication and recovery, and\n\n166\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.448\nof course, post-incident activity here.\n\n167\n00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n168\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.820\nlet's just take a look at a sampling\nof some of these questions.\n\n169\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.330\nThey help us out a little bit.\n\n170\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.145\nSo if I thought about that idea of\na compromised server at some point,\n\n171\n00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:13.960\nokay, well here it is.\n\n172\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.790\nWould the organization consider\nthe activity to be an incident?\n\n173\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:23.270\nIf so, what are the policies and what\npolicies are violated during this action?\n\n174\n00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.035\nThey're telling you to think\nabout it in these terms, right?\n\n175\n00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That, hey, how do we handle this?\n\n176\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.670\nWhat is the policy for\nus actually dealing with it?\n\n177\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.250\nDoes the policy state that there's\na particular order that we have to follow?\n\n178\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.460\nPeople or\nstakeholders that we have to contact.\n\n179\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.345\nWhatever it might be,\nwe have to follow those policies.\n\n180\n00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:42.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n181\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.670\nyou think about that a lot of times for\ntechnicians.\n\n182\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.030\nWe normally don't think\nabout the idea of policy.\n\n183\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.730\nSo here is giving us this idea that, hey,\none of the thing you may actually wanna do\n\n184\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.420\nis figure out what policies may validate\nif you are incurring something like this.\n\n185\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.850\nIt's actually a good thing to think about,\nokay?\n\n186\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.940\nSecondly, what measures\nare actually counteractive,\n\n187\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.020\nokay, to what we're actually doing.\n\n188\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:03.640\nOkay.\n\n189\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.420\nSo, in other,\nnot counteractive to what we're doing,\n\n190\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.510\nbut counteractive to the attack or\nto the incident that we're handling.\n\n191\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.270\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.350\n&gt;&gt; So do we have anything in place\nto address this writ, and if we do,\n\n193\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.031\ndo we know what those elements are.\n\n194\n00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.508\nMost of the time if you work for\na large organization,\n\n195\n00:10:16.508 --> 00:10:19.758\nyou may not have a comprehensive\nunderstanding of what elements are in\n\n196\n00:10:19.758 --> 00:10:23.360\nplace to handle certain types of\nscenarios that end up happening.\n\n197\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.110\nBut it is something that if you're part\nof an instant response team though that\n\n198\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.480\nyou may actually choose to learn\na little bit more about it.\n\n199\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.870\nAnd this preparation time is also\nwhat would help you to do that\n\n200\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.520\nas you're handling an incident, or\n\n201\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.260\nat least going over it in the idea of some\ntype of scenario game play to doing this.\n\n202\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.130\nNow, if you are actually having to\ndo this when it happens, right,\n\n203\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:50.470\nthis becomes a little\nbit more time sensitive.\n\n204\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.680\nIn other words, you can't just take\nall the time you've gotta just find\n\n205\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.250\nthe information out quickly.\n\n206\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.030\nBut if you have to, you have to.\n\n207\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.860\nMake sure you document\neverything because in the end,\n\n208\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.200\nit is gonna be something that they'll want\nto have some post-incident activity on.\n\n209\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.550\nNotice the other thing here,\ndetection and analysis as well.\n\n210\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.175\nDid we actually find out what precursors\nthe event actually showed us?\n\n211\n00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:15.040\nYeah, is there anything like that?\n\n212\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.730\nIndicators of the incident that the,\nmight the organization detect.\n\n213\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.790\nSo did we actually find out any indicators\nthat might have actually led us,\n\n214\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.750\ndid we just ignore it?\n\n215\n00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.410\nDid we figure something out here?\n\n216\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.620\nAny tools that we might need?\n\n217\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.390\nAdditional response team analysis,\nokay, that validate this.\n\n218\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.950\nYou need it, it actually tells us,\nagain, what particular situation and\n\n219\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.970\ntools that we might actually end up\nconsidering here as we walk through this.\n\n220\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.040\nHow would the incident response team\nanalyze and validate the incident?\n\n221\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.570\nWhat personnel would be involved?\n\n222\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.170\nDo you have enough resources?\n\n223\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.378\nOkay, especially on people that you need.\n\n224\n00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:56.470\nHow would a team prioritize the handling?\n\n225\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.450\nPrioritization is big because you may have\nmultiple instances at the same time, but\n\n226\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.690\nwhat if you only have one security team,\nokay?\n\n227\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.480\nAnd you only have one team responding,\nhow do you prioritize the event itself?\n\n228\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.270\nOr do you not prioritize it and\n\n229\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.515\nyou split everybody off to try and\nhandle the events that go on, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:20.290\nBut all these are actually very good\ntypes of gamification things that you can\n\n231\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:26.470\nthink about and even go through, the\nforest scenario ends up happening, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.820\nNotice here in containment,\neradication and recovery, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.430\nThis is where you start to see,\na little bit more action here, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:40.320\nIs there a strategy that the organization\nshould take to contain the incident?\n\n235\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.160\nThis is where its actually\na little bit more critical.\n\n236\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.110\nMost of the time especially in a small\ncompany, there is no strategy except for\n\n237\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.720\none, stop it.\n\n238\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.190\nOkay, contain it, do whatever rules\nyou have to, or get rid of it, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.400\nThat is pretty much the only\nstrategy that's in place.\n\n240\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.320\nWell, that itself is not really\na strategy as much as its just saying,\n\n241\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.610\nthrow everything that you can,\nadd it until it stops, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.810\nAnd I guess you could\nconsider that a strategy.\n\n243\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.060\nBut if you stopped it one time and\nyou don't know which of those things\n\n244\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.820\nactually stopped it, well, what prevents\nan attacker from trying it again?\n\n245\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.340\nAnd you still have to throw everything\nat it before it actually stops again.\n\n246\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.230\nWell, that means you haven't\nlearned anything from it.\n\n247\n00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.130\nYou haven't figured out what\nit is that really stopped it.\n\n248\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.850\nYou're just hoping that one of\nthose things ends up happening.\n\n249\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.950\nSo that happens to me\na lot just in my own help.\n\n250\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.380\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to be throwing some\nforensic mud up against the side of a barn\n\n251\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.170\nand hoping something will stick, right?\n\n252\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n253\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.380\nBut that's what we hope for\na lot of times, right?\n\n254\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is that we've done this, this,\n\n255\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.770\nthis, this, this.\n\n256\n00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.150\nBut which one stopped it?\n\n257\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.980\nOne of those, yeah.\n\n258\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.580\nYeah, one of those actually stopped it.\n\n259\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.020\nWell, how does that help\nyou as an organization?\n\n260\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.880\nIt really doesn't.\n\n261\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.600\nSo trying to figure stuff like that out\n\n262\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.310\nreally comes when you do have a strategy\nthat's in place to make that happen, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.840\nWhat is the ultimate end result\nif you cannot get it contained?\n\n264\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.860\nThink about the end result scenario,\nis what you want to be able to do as well.\n\n265\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.440\n&gt;&gt; End game.\n\n266\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.530\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the end game and\nwhat might end up happening.\n\n267\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.440\nDo you have the right tools,\nonce again, to respond to this?\n\n268\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.330\nYou may find out that you don't, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.935\nAnd that means, well, you have to\nactually get the right tools in place.\n\n270\n00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:19.180\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Same thing with the personnel and\n\n271\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.540\nthe involvement here.\n\n272\n00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.430\nSo these two steps are really\nvery active in what they do.\n\n273\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.910\nThe detection and analysis as well\nas the containment eradication and\n\n274\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.520\nrecovery, they may require more resources\nthan we have at hand at the point.\n\n275\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.250\nThey may require more or different people\nwith different skill sets to come in and\n\n276\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.920\nhelp us to determine whether or not we're\nactually headed in the right direction.\n\n277\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.350\nIf all of us aren't sure, then somebody\nelse needs to able to step in and\n\n278\n00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.560\ngo, here's what needs to be done next.\n\n279\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.670\nBut following this guideline can at\nleast help you to get to that point\n\n280\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.720\nwhere you realize,\nI'm in over my head, okay, so\n\n281\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.520\nthat is a big part of understanding\nthat aspect of it as well, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.470\nAll right.\n\n283\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.930\nWhat sources of evidence, if any,\nshould an organization acquire?\n\n284\n00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.200\nHow would the evidence be acquired?\n\n285\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.140\nWhere would it be stored?\n\n286\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.830\nHow long should it be retained?\n\n287\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.520\nThis goes back, once we start getting\ninto the evidence part, right,\n\n288\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.510\nthis goes back to the nature of forensics.\n\n289\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.393\nSo if we are now talking about that\nidea of containment, eradication, and\n\n290\n00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:26.508\nrecovery, and we are gonna be prosecuting\nall of these events that happened,\n\n291\n00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:29.627\nwe have to also think about this as well,\nokay?\n\n292\n00:15:29.627 --> 00:15:33.383\nSo if we know that that's part\nof the strategy at the end,\n\n293\n00:15:33.383 --> 00:15:36.357\nis not only to stop it but\nto actually learn and\n\n294\n00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:41.470\nfigure out what tools stopped it to try\nthis particular methodology to do so.\n\n295\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.130\nAnd in the end, the goal and\nresult is not just to stop it but\n\n296\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.850\nto be able to prosecute or\nto be able to have evidence.\n\n297\n00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.800\nSo that in the future if a case is brought\nagainst the attacker then we have that.\n\n298\n00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.426\nWe also have to think of place of storage.\n\n299\n00:15:56.426 --> 00:15:58.031\nWhere are we storing that?\n\n300\n00:15:58.031 --> 00:16:00.212\nHow long is it gonna be stored for?\n\n301\n00:16:00.212 --> 00:16:03.159\nHow do we actually protect that\ninformation for future use,\n\n302\n00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:04.270\nwhatever it might be?\n\n303\n00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.626\nThis is where you might also have\nto go into law enforcement and\n\n304\n00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:08.135\nask how long should we keep this stuff?\n\n305\n00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:11.090\nAnd actually figure all that out as well.\n\n306\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.950\nThis other part here,\nPost-Incident Activity.\n\n307\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.800\nWho should attend the lessons learned\nmeeting regarding this incident?\n\n308\n00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.240\nThis was actually a little bit more\ngeneralized than you believe, and\n\n309\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.410\nthat's because it's not only the security\nteam that's responding to these instances\n\n310\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:34.380\nthat really need to know about,\nof course, the overall incident itself.\n\n311\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.310\nUsually, there has to be, of course,\nsome level of education or\n\n312\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.450\nsome level of information\nthat gets passed out.\n\n313\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.220\nIt doesn't mean that everybody\nneeds to know everything, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.960\nBut it does actually give you\na little bit of an example here,\n\n315\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.160\nthat maybe on the technical side,\nyour internal response team\n\n316\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.100\ndoes need to know all of the details and\nelements of what happened.\n\n317\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.434\nBut maybe the manager just needs to know\nthat not only did we know exactly what\n\n318\n00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:04.017\nhappened, this is how we stopped it, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:04.017 --> 00:17:06.202\nThis is how long it took us to stop it.\n\n320\n00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:07.842\nThis is what would have made it faster.\n\n321\n00:17:07.842 --> 00:17:11.766\nThen the manager could take that to\nsomebody that makes decisions in terms of\n\n322\n00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:12.757\nspending, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:12.757 --> 00:17:17.820\nAnd then they actually might just need\nto know, here's what I need to know.\n\n324\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.452\nIs this gonna happen again?\n\n325\n00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:21.340\nAnd the manager says, well, it can.\n\n326\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.746\nHere's what would actually\nhelp us to prevent this.\n\n327\n00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:26.990\nOnce again,\nit's still the information that gets out.\n\n328\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.230\nBut notice, everybody might actually\nhave a piece of that information.\n\n329\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.920\nSomebody else just working inside the\ncompany might just need to know, yes, and\n\n330\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.330\nthis didn't happen, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.732\nYes, we were able to successfully stop it,\nokay, and that might be enough.\n\n332\n00:17:39.732 --> 00:17:42.210\nBut whatever it might be, right?\n\n333\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.560\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nthat we have lessons learned,\n\n334\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.330\nthat everybody might need to attend.\n\n335\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.650\nWe might find out that it actually\nhappened from the very fact that\n\n336\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.410\nsomeone internal to the organization got\nsocially engineered at some point here.\n\n337\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.825\nAnd that's something else we might\nactually have to talk about about as well,\n\n338\n00:17:58.825 --> 00:18:00.100\nin terms of training.\n\n339\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, those who forget\nthe past are doomed to repeat it.\n\n340\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.750\n&gt;&gt; That is true, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.950\nWhat could be done to prevent similar\nincidences from occurring into the future?\n\n342\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.690\nThis is where that training comes in,\nthe tools, you name it.\n\n343\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.290\nWhatever it might be,\n\n344\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.080\nyou always have to also think about\nthe future events from happening as well.\n\n345\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.780\nAnd then the improvements of\nwhat you can do to detect it.\n\n346\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.350\nSo detection is kind of the key.\n\n347\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.160\nNow just when you think you're done,\nthere's actually\n\n348\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.250\na different general question that\nyou might have to think about.\n\n349\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.210\nIt doesn't mean you go through every\nsingle one of them, but if you need to,\n\n350\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.560\nyou definitely want to here.\n\n351\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.160\nSo how many incident response team members\nwould participate in the handling?\n\n352\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.525\nThat's a big important question\nin terms of resources.\n\n353\n00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:48.813\nAnd the way that you do it is by\nprioritizing every single instance that\n\n354\n00:18:48.813 --> 00:18:50.490\nends up happening, so\n\n355\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.520\nyou assign the proper amount of resources\nto handle the event that goes on, okay?\n\n356\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.750\nBesides the instant response team, what\ngroups within the organization would be\n\n357\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.370\nresponsible, okay, or\nwould be involved in handling it?\n\n358\n00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.790\nTo which external parties?\n\n359\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.660\nNow you might be wondering\nwhat is this about?\n\n360\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.650\nWell, remember that a company really\nhardly stands alone any more, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.550\nSo some companies,\nthey can be internal all by themselves.\n\n362\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.090\nBut if your company also has,\nlet's say part of their infrastructure in\n\n363\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.830\nthe cloud as well as on premises there,\nremember that you're\n\n364\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.610\nteaming up with that organization that\nis providing your cloud services.\n\n365\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.580\nYou might need to know exactly and report\nto them what would have actually happened\n\n366\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.950\nhere, and what information you need\nto share with them as well, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.050\nSo it all does actually\nhave to take place.\n\n368\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.910\nAnd you really do have to think about\n\n369\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.600\nthe idea of what these questions really\ndo give you to handle the incident.\n\n370\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.500\nAnd then from that point,\nthat's where each scenario,\n\n371\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.580\nright, can give you a little bit\nmore detail and even more questions\n\n372\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.880\nto help you to focus in on different\naspects of the attack, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.000\nNow I told you,\n\n374\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.170\nyou don't have to actually follow\nevery single one of these questions.\n\n375\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.630\nBut if you do,\nit's a more comprehensive result\n\n376\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.770\nthat you'll end up getting from instant\nhandling than you would if you try and\n\n377\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.430\npick and\nchoose which ones you want at the time.\n\n378\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.410\nSo doing it at the beginning and\nthen figuring out the way that your\n\n379\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.000\norganization is gonna do\nit is really kind of key.\n\n380\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.640\nThen you'll get a system together and\na particular process together, and\n\n381\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.570\nthat working the way that we want to.\n\n382\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.700\nAnd once that's done,\nit'll be a more efficient, and\n\n383\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.900\nyou'll actually have a more\nexperienced team that has now even\n\n384\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.770\nthought about the process of those\ndifferent scenarios we've talked about.\n\n385\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.477\nAnd now they have a standard\nguide to help them through it,\n\n386\n00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:42.921\nregardless of who's actually on your team,\nokay?\n\n387\n00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:45.080\nAnd that's what really helps.\n\n388\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.594\nWhen you're no longer dependent on\nthat one particular person that knows\n\n389\n00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:52.561\neverything, okay, and there are people\nin organizations that know everything,\n\n390\n00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:53.574\nwhich is great.\n\n391\n00:20:53.574 --> 00:20:54.355\n&gt;&gt; The know it alls.\n\n392\n00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:57.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nit's just the nature of experience, right?\n\n393\n00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.138\n&gt;&gt; Well, certainly.\n\n394\n00:20:58.138 --> 00:21:02.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you hire a younger team or\na new team that is just fitting together,\n\n395\n00:21:02.002 --> 00:21:05.925\nand that experienced person goes on\nvacation, and an incident happens, well,\n\n396\n00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:07.400\ndo you call that person back?\n\n397\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.970\nWell, most of us would, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.811\nYou go, let me just get so and so\non the phone, and there we are.\n\n399\n00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:14.030\nWe're back in business.\n\n400\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.880\nWell, that can be done, but\nwhat we want is we wanna develop a team.\n\n401\n00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.540\n&gt;&gt; A team, yes.\n&gt;&gt; We wanna develop the skills in that\n\n402\n00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.200\nteam, to really consider how\nto handle these incidences.\n\n403\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.340\nAnd then whoever comes in, they know\nexactly where they are in the process of\n\n404\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.642\ndoing this event handling, and\nthat's what we also wanna see.\n\n405\n00:21:31.642 --> 00:21:37.160\nSo by following this document and taking\na look at it, we can now apply those steps\n\n406\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:43.320\nand those questions about every event,\nwhich I can't say right now.\n\n407\n00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.432\nEvery event that happens, and then we'll\nsee that it'll actually give us a more\n\n408\n00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:51.196\ncomprehensive and a fuller approach\nto the way that we handle instances.\n\n409\n00:21:51.196 --> 00:21:57.080\n&gt;&gt; So applying NIST.SP.800-61 r2\nto events, and a great episode.\n\n410\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.496\nAnd but better still,\nmake sure you read that document.\n\n411\n00:21:59.496 --> 00:22:02.260\nYou're gonna have to, and\nit's very important for the exam.\n\n412\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.250\nAlso important, watch everything, all\nthe episodes in the CCNA SECOPS series,\n\n413\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.430\nand go to our course library.\n\n414\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.590\nThere's hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n415\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.933\nAnd thank you for watching

00:00:08.248\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:12.028\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:15.642\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\njoining us on ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:19.035\nI'm your host Zach Memos for CCNA SecOps.\n\n7\n00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.725\nAnd with me is Ronnie Wong, and we're\ngonna be talking about evidence handling.\n\n8\n00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.470\nRonnie I'm so\nexcited to have you hear and I'm so\n\n9\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.840\nexcited to be working with you again.\n\n10\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.368\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n11\n00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:32.037\nas we continue on in\nour SecOps series here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:36.257\nRemember that we've actually talked about\na lot of different things, and as we start\n\n13\n00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:40.199\nto take a look at some of the things that\nwe actually have to know and understand.\n\n14\n00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.260\nAnd that is, of course, the idea of\nmaking sure we do some incident handling.\n\n15\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.713\nAnd specifically today, we're gonna be\naddressing evidence handling as well,\n\n16\n00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:51.010\nin a forensic process.\n\n17\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.150\nNow, whenever we talk about that\nidea of forensics are normally,\n\n18\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.840\nI'm not gonna say for\nevery one of you out there.\n\n19\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.403\nBut our closest encounter to that is\nreally someone that's on a TV drama series\n\n20\n00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:05.114\non some point and\nthey mention the forensics.\n\n21\n00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:09.441\nAnd then of course, we start to actually\nthink about computer forensics as well.\n\n22\n00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.192\nAnd that's really about\nas deep as it gets.\n\n23\n00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:15.223\nWe get to see some fancy you\nknow ways that they solve\n\n24\n00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:17.703\nthe crime within 30 minutes or an hour.\n\n25\n00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.249\nAnd everything is over and good.\n\n26\n00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:24.090\nAnd the good guy wins, bad guy loses,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n27\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.555\nThe problem is the reality\nthough of forensics and\n\n28\n00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:32.100\nthe idea of evidence handling\nespecially in incident handling.\n\n29\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.860\nIt may take a longer process than that,\nand\n\n30\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.843\na lot of times it is because it actually\ndoes have to go through some formalized\n\n31\n00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:42.542\nprocess in the way that we deal with this.\n\n32\n00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:46.801\nSo what we want to do is we want to at\nleast take this episode if not maybe even\n\n33\n00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.642\nanother one.\n\n34\n00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:52.452\nAnd talk about this idea of the evidence\nhandling, according to what procedures\n\n35\n00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:57.720\nhave actually been set up, so that we can\nfollow along in terms of best practices.\n\n36\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.830\nSo that's what we're gonna be\nactually taking a look and\n\n37\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.210\nmore specifically be diving into.\n\n38\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.990\nLike I said, the idea of gathering and\nevidence handling itself.\n\n39\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.280\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, is there an actual\norder that you have to precede?\n\n40\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.885\nI'm pretty sure there might be,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n41\n00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:13.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we actually do need\nto follow a particular order and\n\n42\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.758\nthe reason why is,\nis where that term forensics comes up.\n\n43\n00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:17.366\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n44\n00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.507\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to mention that so\nI'm not gonna define it for\n\n45\n00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.872\nyou in a technical sense.\n\n46\n00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:25.947\nBut what you're doing is you are\ngathering, you are getting information,\n\n47\n00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:29.350\nyou're getting it ready to\npresent into a court of law.\n\n48\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.117\nAnd so in that particular methodology\nyou have to follow the methods and\n\n49\n00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:35.201\nthe procedures that are recommended.\n\n50\n00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:39.800\nTo ensure that whatever comes before\nthat is gonna be legally recognized.\n\n51\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.502\n&gt;&gt; Evidence collection order.\n\n52\n00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.010\n&gt;&gt; Some type of evidence collection\norder is what we're gonna find.\n\n53\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.681\nSo where does this actually come from?\n\n54\n00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:50.345\nWell, on the TV series that you end up\nseeing, you normally just kind of assume\n\n55\n00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.578\nthis magical it's just out there it's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:55.594\n&gt;&gt; Everybody understands it by default and\n\n57\n00:02:55.594 --> 00:02:57.910\nthey know exactly what's going on.\n\n58\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.191\nAnd in reality, especially if we're really\njust entering into the world of cyber\n\n59\n00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:05.106\nsecurity Zach,\nwe may not know where it comes from, and\n\n60\n00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:08.913\nour organizations may not know, or\nif they do, they've forgotten it.\n\n61\n00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:12.285\nSo we're going to actually show you\nwhere a lot of this comes from, and\n\n62\n00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:15.614\nthen we're gonna follow a special\ntype of procedure that we do find.\n\n63\n00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:18.696\nAnd it's something that you can\nactually make sure that you go to,\n\n64\n00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.320\nas well as get ready for the exam.\n\n65\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.231\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n66\n00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:27.174\nSo on my screen, I went ahead and\nI pulled up the actual website that\n\n67\n00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:31.390\nwe can go to and\nreally the organization is NIST, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.560\nnist.gov is really the organization\nthat you're looking for.\n\n69\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.673\nAnd they actually do have what they call\ntheir Computer Security Resource Center.\n\n70\n00:03:42.673 --> 00:03:48.507\nAnd if you take a look at the kind\nof name here, right before nist.gov,\n\n71\n00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:52.950\ncsrc is\nthe Computer Security Resource Center.\n\n72\n00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.403\nAnd we're going to their publications.\n\n73\n00:03:54.403 --> 00:03:57.640\nAnd technically they're\nconsidered special publications.\n\n74\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.320\nAnd normally they're prefixed\nwith SP at the beginning of them.\n\n75\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.390\nSo, in this particular area,\nwhen you start to take a look,\n\n76\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.464\nyou'll end up seeing that\nsomewhere in the documentation,\n\n77\n00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:10.300\nprobably in your security\noperations center.\n\n78\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.008\nYou'll probably see these terms\nreferred to in terms of publication.\n\n79\n00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:17.228\nFIPS is a big one you hear actually\nreferred to a lot of times,\n\n80\n00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:19.884\nthe Federal Information\nProcessing Standards,\n\n81\n00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.492\nwhere they talk about\nthe different standards.\n\n82\n00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:26.654\nBut what we're actually looking for\nis right here under SP or\n\n83\n00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:29.480\nthe NIST Special Publications.\n\n84\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.280\nNotice this one includes one guidelines,\nspecifications,\n\n85\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.226\nrecommendations reference materials,\nyou name it.\n\n86\n00:04:35.226 --> 00:04:38.290\nIt has it all in here as well as\na couple of different series that have\n\n87\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.510\nbeen added in as well, and some of\nthe older series that are also here.\n\n88\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.052\nSo 1800 and then 800.\n\n89\n00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:48.280\nWe're really going into SP 800 is\nwhere we're gonna be taking a look at.\n\n90\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.730\nSpecifically one called 800-86,\n\n91\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.514\nis the series that we're actually\ngonna be looking at instead.\n\n92\n00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:56.756\nAnd so if you actually want\nto take a look at this,\n\n93\n00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.520\nyou just browse here to that website.\n\n94\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.266\nLet me make sure I put that back up so\nthat you can see it just for a moment,\n\n95\n00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:06.137\ngives you a chance to write it down or\nif you wanna do a screen capture of it,\n\n96\n00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:06.645\nyou can.\n\n97\n00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:11.048\nFrom that point, once you have that, I'm\ngonna select the SP 800 here as a link.\n\n98\n00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:16.655\nAnd then, it's right down here that\nyou can start to browse through, and\n\n99\n00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:21.605\nsee some of these very significant numbers\nthat you're actually going to be taking\n\n100\n00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:22.254\na look at.\n\n101\n00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:26.266\nNow, the one that I want is actually\nthe one that's the 800-86, and\n\n102\n00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:30.660\nI can continue to scroll down through here\nas you see these numbers starting to kind\n\n103\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.530\nof decrement here.\n\n104\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.957\nSo if I scroll all the way down,\nI see 89, 86, okay, so there it is.\n\n105\n00:05:38.957 --> 00:05:45.712\nSP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic\nTechniques into Incident Response.\n\n106\n00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:49.463\nYou can download this and\nthat's what I recommend as you download.\n\n107\n00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:53.967\nAnd take the time to actually read\nthrough the whole thing if you need to.\n\n108\n00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.592\nMake sure you actually just take\nthe time to read through it,\n\n109\n00:05:56.592 --> 00:06:00.194\ncuz it's actually worth reading especially\nas you're entering into this field of\n\n110\n00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.001\nworking on security operations center.\n\n111\n00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.314\nAnd if some of your work is gonna be where\nyou have to actually kind of present\n\n112\n00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:08.299\nthe order in the forensic manner,\n\n113\n00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:12.483\nthis is where the most of the guidelines\ndo come in for us that were doing.\n\n114\n00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:15.820\nNow I've already downloaded this for us.\n\n115\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.704\nSo when you download it,\nI'll make sure I come here and\n\n116\n00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:21.130\nthis is what it ends up looking like.\n\n117\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.023\nVerify of course you have\nthe right number up here 800-86.\n\n118\n00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:27.545\nNational Institute of Standards and\nTechnology,\n\n119\n00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:29.720\nGuide to Integrating Forensic Technique.\n\n120\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.202\n&gt;&gt; And running, there's zero cost to this,\nor is this free of charge?\n\n121\n00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:33.789\n&gt;&gt; No, this one's actually free of charge,\n\n122\n00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.559\nbecause it's sponsored\nby the US government.\n\n123\n00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.887\nSo, the great thing is, the only charge to\nyou is if you choose to download it and\n\n124\n00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:44.344\nthen print it out yourself, whatever the\ncost of the paper and the ink, or that but\n\n125\n00:06:44.344 --> 00:06:46.450\nI like reading it as a PDF myself.\n\n126\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.584\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; So it's right here,\n\n127\n00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:50.801\nwhere we're actually gonna take a look\nat some of these sections here, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:54.205\nRecommendations of\nthe NIST is what we have,\n\n129\n00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.527\nand of course the authors\nof this document.\n\n130\n00:06:57.527 --> 00:07:02.164\nAs I continue to scroll on through,\nnotice that it is about computer security.\n\n131\n00:07:02.164 --> 00:07:05.490\nAnd this one's dated just a little bit.\n\n132\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.730\nSometimes you'll see that they'll\nupdate some of these, but\n\n133\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.210\nthis one's actually still from that point.\n\n134\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.090\nYou might be wondering, Ronnie as of\nthe recording of the show it's really 2017\n\n135\n00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.413\nhere, is this still valid?\n\n136\n00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:18.753\nYes, the rules for evidence handling\nare still valid, and the guidelines for\n\n137\n00:07:18.753 --> 00:07:21.791\nactually implementing those\nare still valid as well.\n\n138\n00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:22.600\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n139\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.003\n&gt;&gt; So, they're still all right there.\n\n140\n00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:29.230\nLet's get to the table of contents and\nshow you what's normally involved in this.\n\n141\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.113\nNow this is not the only one that we're\ngonna be taking a look at especially in\n\n142\n00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:32.663\nthis series.\n\n143\n00:07:32.663 --> 00:07:37.015\nYou'll see that we will refer to\nanother one the 800 -61 Revision 2 or\n\n144\n00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:40.561\nR2, is what we'll also end up\ntaking a look at more in depth.\n\n145\n00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:44.893\nThat one you need to know much more than\nwhat we are really focusing on here.\n\n146\n00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:47.107\nEspecially in getting ready for the exam.\n\n147\n00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:50.842\nBut to tell you, if you really don't\nhave a clue of where to start,\n\n148\n00:07:50.842 --> 00:07:55.475\nespecially in this, you can actually read\nthis document and it will help you out.\n\n149\n00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.226\nSo here, it gives you of course\nthe introduction, Establishing and\n\n150\n00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:02.848\nOrganizing Forensic capabilities,\nokay, tells you the needs,\n\n151\n00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:04.670\nstaffing that you're wanting.\n\n152\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.810\nBut what we're really going to focus in\non is right here in this third section,\n\n153\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.556\nand what it comes down to it, it's\nreally about the data collection itself.\n\n154\n00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna to\n\n155\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.160\nbe focusing in really on this 3.1 issue,\n\n156\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.240\nas where we're actually going to be taking\na look at more in particular, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.920\nSo even though the rest of\nthis does come into play for\n\n158\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.930\neverything else that we're doing, this\nepisode is really gonna be focused around.\n\n159\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.070\nNow of course there's other one,\nthere's other things that are here,\n\n160\n00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.640\nsuch as Using Data from Data File,\nFile Basics,\n\n161\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.160\ncollecting them, and\nExamining the Data Files here, and\n\n162\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.150\neven Data from the Operating System,\nData from Network Traffic.\n\n163\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.050\nYou name it, it tells you how to handle\nall of this, and getting it ready for\n\n164\n00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.140\nforensics and incident handling,\nwhich is really neat, okay.\n\n165\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.670\nMost of us don't think about that,\n\n166\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.550\nand a lot of what we do know, I said\nis really from the idea, the TV show.\n\n167\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.240\nSo these are also linked,\n\n168\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.635\nas you see my cursor as I hover\nover the actual words here?\n\n169\n00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Notice my cursor turns into that hand,\n\n170\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.640\nand that normally means\nthat there's a link to it.\n\n171\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.090\nIf I just click on it, that will\nbring me to about the right place,\n\n172\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.850\nright here where it says Data Collection,\nokay?\n\n173\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.200\nIs what we're actually talking about,\nright here.\n\n174\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.740\nSo this is the section you really\nwant to make sure if anything\n\n175\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.730\nthat you read over a couple of times, and\nthen we're gonna point out specific things\n\n176\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.580\nthat are called out by\nthe exam itself through here.\n\n177\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.540\nSo of course, it gives you the reason for\nthe data collection, and then making\n\n178\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.660\nsure you can identify all the possible\nsources that you're actually gonna need.\n\n179\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.830\nSome of these things we don't think about,\nright?\n\n180\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.539\nSo here it even tells you some of\nthe widespread things, most obvious common\n\n181\n00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:50.924\nsources of data, is desktop computers,\nservers, network storage devices, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.903\nAnd I'll even show you some of the ideas\nof where you're actually gonna\n\n183\n00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:59.874\nfind that information, and even external\nexamples here, magnetic disk, you name it,\n\n184\n00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:03.240\nit tells you,\nthese are things you should think about.\n\n185\n00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.750\nDon't just go, I've got the computer,\n\n186\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.810\nbut think about all the places that you\nmight also end up finding more data.\n\n187\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.000\nAnd even going outside of the\norganization, you might even see logs from\n\n188\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.640\nthe ISP, you go on and you actually see\nthat it is really is a good general,\n\n189\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.510\nand fairly comprehensive way to take a\nlook at stuff that we're not really sure.\n\n190\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.770\nOnce we're there, this is where we\nget into that acquiring the data, and\n\n191\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.310\nit tells us actually to be able to\nidentify those potential sources, and\n\n192\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.030\nthen how do we get the data\noff those machines?\n\n193\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.532\nAnd what are we actually\nsupposed to be able to do?\n\n194\n00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:39.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n195\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.610\n&gt;&gt; So this is where we do jump into this\nidea, of making sure that we pay attention\n\n196\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.080\na little bit more to things like\nthe volatility as well as the value of\n\n197\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.090\nthe data itself, making sure you come up\nwith a particular plan and the effort.\n\n198\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.690\nSo this one right here where talks\nabout developing the plan to acquire\n\n199\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.780\nthe data itself, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.860\nThat is kind of the key step that we start\nto work with, and then we have these\n\n201\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.990\nother elements that are involved with\nthat identifying the actual plan itself.\n\n202\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo here it says the first step, and\nbecause there's actually multiple data\n\n203\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.350\nsources, and we actually create a plan to\nhelp us prioritize, how we're gonna attack\n\n204\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.675\nthese different things to make\nsure we get the data necessary.\n\n205\n00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n206\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.950\n&gt;&gt; As I scroll on down you'll\nactually see it kind of goes through\n\n207\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.605\nthe same process again, breaking it down.\n\n208\n00:11:23.605 --> 00:11:29.788\nBut then in 3.1.3, it goes in to\nthe Incident Response Considerations,\n\n209\n00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:35.360\nand I'm getting,\nI think I passed it at some point here.\n\n210\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.790\nIt is in 3.2 and 3.1, yeah, so\n\n211\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:45.250\nthese are the two sections particularly\nthat we want to actually jump back into.\n\n212\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.662\nSo we're not gonna leave that, we're not\ngonna actually go outside of 3.1 here.\n\n213\n00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:51.350\nSo let's just take a look at\nwhat we're given here, and\n\n214\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.020\nI want you to actually\nbe able to examine this.\n\n215\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.760\nEven though we're talking about it,\n\n216\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.862\nmake sure you go back an re-read\nthis stuff and do this.\n\n217\n00:11:58.862 --> 00:12:03.660\nAll right, so at the very beginning when\nwe start talking about this idea, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.890\nZach did mention this idea of\nevidence collection order, and\n\n219\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.430\nthat's actually one of the most\nimportant things that we actually\n\n220\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.740\nhave to be able to understand and\ndo, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.870\nAnd when we start doing that right,\n\n222\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.960\nit actually begins in a special process\nthat we take a look at here, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.640\nThat according to NIST,\n\n224\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.640\nthe recommended steps to be included\nin evidence collection itself, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.590\nInclude making sure that we first of\nall identify all the possible sources\n\n226\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.350\nto the instant that we're talking about,\nokay?\n\n227\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.330\nWe do not want to leave any stone unturned\nat this point, if it is a possibility\n\n228\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:43.220\nthat it could be admitted into evidence,\nwell then that's what we want to do.\n\n229\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.370\nNow this also goes into something\nthat we're not going to do as\n\n230\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.250\na entry level analyst here, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.810\nWhere we have to make the decision\non whether or not it is relevant or\n\n232\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.850\nnot, our decision is simple.\n\n233\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.630\nWe collect everything that has\na relationship to that computer,\n\n234\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.890\nthat we believe that we can find, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.590\nSomebody else wouldn't make\nthat determination for us,\n\n236\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.980\nwhether it's relevant or not, but for\n\n237\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.860\nus, just understanding that, gathering\nall the actual evidence that we can do,\n\n238\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.690\nand identifying those data\nsources are gonna be key.\n\n239\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.230\nThen developing the plan\nto handle the data,\n\n240\n00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.670\nacquiring the data itself,\nas well as verifying integrity data.\n\n241\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.330\nAll that needs to be broken down so\n\n242\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.330\nthat we understand what that means\nat this particular point too, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.270\nSo let's take a look at this one,\nwe actually develop this plan here, and\n\n244\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.020\nactually help us to prioritize what we do.\n\n245\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.330\nFirst ones at, that we normally\nactually think about, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.550\nAs far as evidence handling, and gathering\ngoes, even though listed in this order,\n\n247\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.750\nI notice there's actually a bullet\npoint and not a number bullet point.\n\n248\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what order that we\n\n249\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.880\ncover them, that's what I'm trying to say.\n\n250\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But usually the first one, right?\n\n251\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.240\nIs gonna be what we call the Volatility.\n\n252\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.875\nNow Zach, do you understand this\nidea of data volatility here?\n\n253\n00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.570\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I would imagine it would be very\n\n254\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.810\nsensitive data, it would be data that\nneeds to be handled with utmost care?\n\n255\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, to a point, right,\n\n256\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.367\nthe very fact is Volatility means\nit can be erased very quickly.\n\n257\n00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:07.874\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n258\n00:14:07.874 --> 00:14:10.420\nIn what we actually have to do so,\n\n259\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.760\nthe more likely the chances that we're\nholding onto to data that may be\n\n260\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.800\nfragile, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.580\nWe wanna make sure that we actually\ngive that consideration first.\n\n262\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.180\nSo here it says,\nrefers to data on a live system\n\n263\n00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:27.400\nthat is lost after a computer is powered\ndown, or due to the passage of time.\n\n264\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.480\nSo in any one of these instances here,\n\n265\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.020\nwe have to think about\nwhere does the data reside?\n\n266\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.990\nIf we are now investigating, we're told to\nactually handle that particular computer,\n\n267\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.280\nif the computer is on,\n\n268\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.630\nwe're talking about what is actually\ndisplayed on the screen itself.\n\n269\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.280\nBecause as soon as we turn the power off,\nthat information's gone.\n\n270\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Could be, yeah.\n\n271\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.375\n&gt;&gt; So it's not kept, it's gone.\n\n272\n00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we actually have to be able to try\n\n273\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.550\nand see what we can do to capture\nthe data that is there, and\n\n274\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.210\nwe might do that first,\nbecause of the volatility of that.\n\n275\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.970\nSomebody walks into the room,\nflips off the switch which\n\n276\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.962\nturns off all the light sockets in\nthe room, and the computer is now off.\n\n277\n00:15:06.962 --> 00:15:09.686\nWell [INAUDIBLE] All right,\nlet's make sure we stop, and\n\n278\n00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:13.228\nmake sure we gather that evidence first\n[CROSSTALK] Before it disappears.\n\n279\n00:15:13.228 --> 00:15:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, Ronnie? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It really\ncan be a life changing event for you,\n\n280\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.750\nif you're actually doing\nsomething like this.\n\n281\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.770\nSo just kind of realize that\nthe Volatility does actually\n\n282\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.460\nplay a sense of things that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n283\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.990\nBut what about the stacks of,\nI can't remember what they call it,\n\n284\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.460\nDVD's or CD's,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.670\n&gt;&gt; That are there and Drives.\n\n286\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.545\nThose are normally\nrelatively non volatile.\n\n287\n00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; In other words,\n\n288\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.920\nthe data will stay there,\nthey've kind of stay there at rest, and\n\n289\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.150\nthey're not access all the time,\nthey're just there.\n\n290\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.260\nWell as long as they're there, you can\nkind of probably set them on a shelf to be\n\n291\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.850\nexamined and gathered a little bit later.\n\n292\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.760\nBut whatever is actually the most\nvolatile, these are things that we're\n\n293\n00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.685\ngoing to gather first because we want\nto make sure that we capture them.\n\n294\n00:15:55.685 --> 00:15:57.448\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nNow as an example of this Zach,\n\n295\n00:15:57.448 --> 00:15:59.012\nas we start to think about it,\n\n296\n00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:02.712\nwell what do we do with something\nthat's actually live on the screen?\n\n297\n00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.812\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can go in there and try and\n\n298\n00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:10.320\ndo one of those screen prints, those print\nscreens shots to make sure it's saved.\n\n299\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320\nBut remember that when you do that,\n\n300\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.620\nyou also have to consider that\nyou now just change the evidence.\n\n301\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.473\nWell, yes, you did.\n\n302\n00:16:18.473 --> 00:16:22.064\nBy you doing that screenshot, you now have\nactually saved something on that drive\n\n303\n00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.524\nthat wasn't there when\nsomething actually happened.\n\n304\n00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:25.866\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it alters it slightly then.\n\n305\n00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:27.489\n&gt;&gt; It does, because you've added.\n\n306\n00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.626\nYou as a technician or an analyst,\n\n307\n00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:33.622\nyou've added something into what\nwas not supposed to be there.\n\n308\n00:16:33.622 --> 00:16:34.983\nNow, you've added that in.\n\n309\n00:16:34.983 --> 00:16:35.756\nNow, do people do it?\n\n310\n00:16:35.756 --> 00:16:40.453\nYes and the reality is that's why the\neasiest way to capture everything that's\n\n311\n00:16:40.453 --> 00:16:41.377\non the screen.\n\n312\n00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:44.158\nAnother way is make sure that you\nactually take pictures of it,\n\n313\n00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:45.473\neven using your smartphone.\n\n314\n00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:46.382\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say that.\n\n315\n00:16:46.382 --> 00:16:47.314\n&gt;&gt; Polaroids.\n\n316\n00:16:47.314 --> 00:16:49.960\nPolaroids is probably not be best,\ncuz you don't get great resolution.\n\n317\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.587\nBut video of it, you name it,\nsomething like that.\n\n318\n00:16:52.587 --> 00:16:54.842\nIt's not going to disturb\nwhat's on the screen.\n\n319\n00:16:54.842 --> 00:16:56.394\nIt's exactly what's there.\n\n320\n00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:00.686\nAnd then of course, there's special tools\nto ensure that you're not actually writing\n\n321\n00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:04.340\nsomething in to what you're exactly\nexamining there that can now actually\n\n322\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.849\ncapture the live data for you.\n\n323\n00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:10.209\nSo you do also have to go into that not\nonly understand that order volatility,\n\n324\n00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:14.703\nbut also what can you do to accidentally\nkind of hinder the process here by adding\n\n325\n00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:17.546\nin something that wasn't\nhere at the beginning.\n\n326\n00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:22.166\nSo, you do wanna be careful when\nyou start taking look at this idea\n\n327\n00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.272\nof the order of gathering it.\n\n328\n00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:26.654\nSo, not only do we have this volatility.\n\n329\n00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:31.399\nNotice the other here,\nof course is likely value.\n\n330\n00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:34.373\nBased on analyst's understanding\nof the situation and\n\n331\n00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:38.232\nprevious experience in a similar\nsituation, the analyst should be able\n\n332\n00:17:38.232 --> 00:17:41.982\nto estimate the relative likely\nvalue of each potential data source.\n\n333\n00:17:41.982 --> 00:17:44.920\nThis is all about\nthe prioritization again.\n\n334\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.524\nOnce we now understand that volatility\nis probably our key in primary,\n\n335\n00:17:48.524 --> 00:17:50.395\ncuz we don't want to lose anything.\n\n336\n00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:53.793\nWe also now have to give\neverything a potential value and\n\n337\n00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:56.972\nmake sure that we gather\nthat evidence next as well,\n\n338\n00:17:56.972 --> 00:18:01.767\nbecause we don't want something that\ncould be really important to be held up.\n\n339\n00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:05.415\nBecause I find it interesting that\nsomething else is over here when there's\n\n340\n00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:09.584\nactually a solid piece of evidence and\nI'm just going, nobody will pick that up.\n\n341\n00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:10.980\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n342\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.633\nBe careful.\n\n343\n00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:16.183\nMake sure you actually assign the value\nand the time that a particular piece of\n\n344\n00:18:16.183 --> 00:18:20.251\nevidence takes, and notice this\none the amount of effort required.\n\n345\n00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:21.693\nThis is a big one, as well.\n\n346\n00:18:21.693 --> 00:18:26.866\nThe amount of effort required, it takes\nfor data sources vary widely here.\n\n347\n00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:29.369\nAnd so, this is where you\nstart talking about tools and\n\n348\n00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.795\nthe cost of different things.\n\n349\n00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:33.636\nSo, all of this also comes into play too.\n\n350\n00:18:33.636 --> 00:18:36.902\nHow long does it take for\nsomething to actually get acquired?\n\n351\n00:18:36.902 --> 00:18:38.138\nWas the effort that it takes?\n\n352\n00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:40.095\nDoes it take more technical skill?\n\n353\n00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:44.242\nGet that all that stuff lined up\nas you're ready to proceed and\n\n354\n00:18:44.242 --> 00:18:46.334\ngo out to that point, as well.\n\n355\n00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:50.624\nSo once you actually have all of\nthat ready to go, then of course,\n\n356\n00:18:50.624 --> 00:18:53.521\nyou make your particular and\nthe plan here.\n\n357\n00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:56.953\nYou now go to that acquisition\nof the actual data here and\n\n358\n00:18:56.953 --> 00:19:01.333\nthis is where you start picking up\non different type of security tools,\n\n359\n00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:05.494\nanalysis tools and everything else\nthat you can do that will help you\n\n360\n00:19:05.494 --> 00:19:09.383\nto actually get the data the place\nthat you want it to be as well.\n\n361\n00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:12.886\nSo, this is where it becomes important\nthat as we start to take a look at.\n\n362\n00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:17.831\nBecause when we acquire the data,\nwe could also now be messing around with\n\n363\n00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:22.155\nthe data integrity itself and\nthe preservation of the data too.\n\n364\n00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:25.550\nSo if that's something that\nis happening within our\n\n365\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.868\nfield as we're starting to\nhandle the evidence and\n\n366\n00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:32.971\ncollecting the data here,\nthen we've got to be very careful.\n\n367\n00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:36.524\nSo when we aren't, that's when\nsomething else ends up happening.\n\n368\n00:19:36.524 --> 00:19:41.276\nSo Zach and when we start acquiring the\ndata, one of the ideas that we we wanna do\n\n369\n00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:45.826\nis be able to actually do some data\nintegrity checks on the data that we get.\n\n370\n00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:49.963\nHow do I know that the data that I just\npulled off of that hard drive is the same\n\n371\n00:19:49.963 --> 00:19:53.984\ndata that now exists on the drive that\nI'm gonna use to analyze the data?\n\n372\n00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.026\nSo that it's a one to one match, so\n\n373\n00:19:56.026 --> 00:19:58.990\nthat nobody can say it's\nnot an exact duplicate.\n\n374\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.275\nThat this is actually not,\nthis is some modified copy.\n\n375\n00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:07.188\nWell, this is where we start running\nhashes against the data itself.\n\n376\n00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:10.654\nWe run a mathematical formula\nagainst the original data.\n\n377\n00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:12.039\nWe get an output.\n\n378\n00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:16.098\nWe run the same mathematical problem\nagainst the copy that we just made.\n\n379\n00:20:16.098 --> 00:20:17.839\nWe get the same output.\n\n380\n00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:22.700\nWe get a different output on the copy that\nI just made somewhere in that process what\n\n381\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.461\nhas changed is the variable,\n\n382\n00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:28.208\nwhich is the data that I copied\nover from the original machine.\n\n383\n00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:33.011\nAnd if that’s true, it means I don't have\nintegrity of the data itself somewhere\n\n384\n00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:34.901\nalong the line I've lost bits.\n\n385\n00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.771\nSomething has changed,\nsomething is not quite right and\n\n386\n00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:40.716\nthat's when we actually start\nto worry a little bit more.\n\n387\n00:20:40.716 --> 00:20:43.937\nSo we need to actually think\nabout how we acquire the data,\n\n388\n00:20:43.937 --> 00:20:48.236\nas well as how we can go ahead and make\nsure we run that integrity check as well.\n\n389\n00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:52.339\n&gt;&gt; And if that second hash is even ever so\nslightly different,\n\n390\n00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:54.564\nthe evidence is inadmissible.\n\n391\n00:20:54.564 --> 00:20:56.908\nI mean,\na good lawyer can have it thrown out.\n\n392\n00:20:56.908 --> 00:21:00.516\n&gt;&gt; Yes and the reason why is\nthat it's not a small change.\n\n393\n00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:03.207\nWe can't just justify and\nsay, it's a small change.\n\n394\n00:21:03.207 --> 00:21:07.399\nEvery change that you make, especially\nwith the way this hashing algorithm works,\n\n395\n00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:10.070\nit ends up causing what we\ncall an avalanche of theft.\n\n396\n00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.459\nSo even the most minute change,\n\n397\n00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:17.944\nthe output of that mathematical formula\nthat we're running through is so\n\n398\n00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:23.080\nstoutly different that you cannot\nsay that the data merely changed.\n\n399\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.964\nThe only thing you can say is\nthat data is not the same and\n\n400\n00:21:25.964 --> 00:21:30.573\nthat is tantamount to you saying, I'm not\nreally working with the evidence anymore.\n\n401\n00:21:30.573 --> 00:21:33.763\nSo yes, you're right in that sense\nwhen you start actually having to deal\n\n402\n00:21:33.763 --> 00:21:34.285\nwith that.\n\n403\n00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:38.889\nSo make sure that you think about elements\nlike this as we start too to take look,\n\n404\n00:21:38.889 --> 00:21:41.649\nespecially on this verify\nthe integrity here.\n\n405\n00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:42.504\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n406\n00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:43.074\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n407\n00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:46.899\nSo, this is where you might\nhear the term message digest.\n\n408\n00:21:46.899 --> 00:21:48.220\nAnd normally like I said,\n\n409\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.676\nI've just called hashing the ends up\ngiving you as what we call message digest.\n\n410\n00:21:52.676 --> 00:21:53.969\nAnd then it says,\n\n411\n00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:58.811\nthe comparison between those two\nare also going to happen as well.\n\n412\n00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:03.276\nHere is something that is probably a\nlittle bit more unusual inside of the SPs\n\n413\n00:22:03.276 --> 00:22:07.183\nhere, inside of the special\npublication is every once in awhile,\n\n414\n00:22:07.183 --> 00:22:11.605\nyou'll see where it actually does kind\nof bold print an entire paragraph.\n\n415\n00:22:11.605 --> 00:22:13.019\nAnd this is something that, of course,\n\n416\n00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:15.189\nmeans hey, maybe it's something\nI should pay attention to.\n\n417\n00:22:15.189 --> 00:22:17.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, before an analyst begins to\n\n418\n00:22:17.947 --> 00:22:21.368\ncollect any data, a decision\nshould be made by the analyst or\n\n419\n00:22:21.368 --> 00:22:25.595\nmanagement on the need to collect and\npreserve in a way that supports future\n\n420\n00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:28.306\nlegal or\ninternal disciplinary proceedings.\n\n421\n00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:32.188\nSo in other words, this cannot be\nhaphazard in how we actually gather it.\n\n422\n00:22:32.188 --> 00:22:34.364\nIn such situations, notice it says,\n\n423\n00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:37.492\nyou have to have a clearly\ndefined chain of custody, so\n\n424\n00:22:37.492 --> 00:22:42.470\nthat you can actually avoid allegations of\nmishandling or tampering of the evidence.\n\n425\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.313\nKeeping a log of every person, whose\nhad physical custody of the evidence.\n\n426\n00:22:46.313 --> 00:22:48.078\nDocumenting actions.\n\n427\n00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:48.604\nYou name it.\n\n428\n00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:51.678\nIt goes through and\nactually just about tells you everything.\n\n429\n00:22:51.678 --> 00:22:55.360\nIt is unclear whether or not the evidence\nneeds to be preserved by default,\n\n430\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.595\nit should be preserved.\n\n431\n00:22:56.595 --> 00:22:57.239\n&gt;&gt; It should be, yeah.\n\n432\n00:22:57.239 --> 00:22:58.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n433\n00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.040\nSo make sure you take some time and\nthat you take a few moments to understand\n\n434\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.855\nwhat is happening here, as you start\ntalking about that idea, as well.\n\n435\n00:23:07.855 --> 00:23:10.810\nSo not only did we start talking\nabout checking the integrity, but\n\n436\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.510\nwhat about the preservation of data?\n\n437\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:18.560\nWell, data some of it, depending on\nhow it's kept and how it's stored.\n\n438\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.425\nIt can even corrupt over time.\n\n439\n00:23:21.425 --> 00:23:25.172\nSo one of these things that I saw was\nsomething on a documentary like on\n\n440\n00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:29.566\nthe Discovery Channel at some point where\nthey showed like the original music CDs\n\n441\n00:23:29.566 --> 00:23:33.375\nthat were out in the early 80s or\nmaybe even late 70s for all I know,\n\n442\n00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.761\nI don't even know when.\n\n443\n00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:38.335\nBut the Smithsonian actually gave,\nit showed this and\n\n444\n00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:42.771\nthe woman picked it up with these\ngloves and these little tweezers.\n\n445\n00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:45.847\nI don't know how else to describe it,\ntweezers and she didn't actually touch it.\n\n446\n00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:49.767\nShe actually just picked it up and showed\nyou and it was transparent all the way\n\n447\n00:23:49.767 --> 00:23:53.342\nthrough, but it was a music CD that\nwas released in the earliest days.\n\n448\n00:23:53.342 --> 00:23:57.720\nShowing you that even after\na while that even on that media,\n\n449\n00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.658\nit can kind of denigrate.\n\n450\n00:23:59.658 --> 00:24:02.220\nIt can actually kind of\ndisappear after awhile And\n\n451\n00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.131\nthat's something we also have to think\nabout in terms of our preservation.\n\n452\n00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:10.050\nWe all like to think that\nthe data can exist forever, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.420\nIn whatever storage media we choose.\n\n454\n00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.900\nBut in all reality, right?\n\n455\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.350\nEspecially on things like optical media.\n\n456\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.930\nMost of the time they'll tell you, you\nneed to actually transfer that stuff every\n\n457\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.715\nthree to five years to new media,\nif you want it to last.\n\n458\n00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:22.290\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n459\n00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.170\nYeah, so\nthat's something we have to think about.\n\n460\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, data and rest of the data\nthat's permanently asleep.\n\n461\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.860\nIf you're not careful.\n\n462\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt and\n\n463\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.530\nI've seen that happen just on things like\nbackups before where it didn't take long.\n\n464\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.480\nIt took like a week and\n\n465\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.330\nif I need a restore then all of a sudden\nI go backup got corrupted at some point.\n\n466\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.864\nAnd who knows what actually\nended up happening and\n\n467\n00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:43.810\nwhere the corruption came in.\n\n468\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.910\nSo you do have to be careful\non a lot of these stuff, and\n\n469\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.350\nthe same thing even with\ncomputer hard drives.\n\n470\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.660\nSomething will last forever and\never and ever, and go forever.\n\n471\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.970\nSometimes you'll get one, and they'll only\nlast about for about six months or so.\n\n472\n00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.520\nSo don't even trust things like\nhard drives to really give you\n\n473\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.800\nsomething like that.\n\n474\n00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.490\nThings like even paper and pencil, right?\n\n475\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:08.030\nAfter a while, if you actually wrote\neverything down in this old ink pen, you\n\n476\n00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.210\nmight end up seeing that after a while,\nit fades away, it kind of disappears.\n\n477\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.420\nReceipts also do the same thing.\n\n478\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Zach, one of the things that-\n\n479\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.810\n&gt;&gt; Thermal paper disappears after a while.\n\n480\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thermal paper is, yeah,\n\n481\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.330\nthat was the one that got me the most is,\nI ended up buying a battery for my car.\n\n482\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.820\nAnd it had a little pouch on the side\nthat said, put the receipt here.\n\n483\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.905\nI did, but when I had to take it back for\n\n484\n00:25:26.905 --> 00:25:27.518\nprorating-\n&gt;&gt; Nothing there.\n\n485\n00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:28.240\n&gt;&gt; You can't even read it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.710\n&gt;&gt; So I couldn't even get my prorating for\n\n487\n00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.890\nit anymore, either.\n\n488\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.910\nSo, you have to worry about\nevidence preservation.\n\n489\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.200\nSo, not only the acquisition of the data,\nmaking sure we get it all.\n\n490\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.100\nNot only the integrity, but also, of\ncourse, the preservation of that evidence\n\n491\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.920\nis something that we have to\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n492\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.850\nEven before we start and\nis something that we also wanna make sure.\n\n493\n00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.315\n&gt;&gt; Or backup on back up as I used to say.\n\n494\n00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:54.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n495\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.530\nreally is kind of those important\nthings that we don't consider, okay?\n\n496\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:03.873\nBut missed at least in this special\npublication 800-86 here, yep.\n\n497\n00:26:03.873 --> 00:26:06.530\nI'm trying to make sure I say\nthe right number, 800-86.\n\n498\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.230\nIt will give you the foundations and\nthe beginnings of what you might need.\n\n499\n00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.470\nNo, now your organization\nmay enhance that a bit.\n\n500\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.700\nBut most of them as far\nas the bare framework,\n\n501\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.170\nit comes back to what we see right here\ninside of that particular document.\n\n502\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.150\nAnd when that happens,\n\n503\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.050\nright, it means that you at least have\na starting point that you can go to.\n\n504\n00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.990\nSo my recommendation as\nyou're getting ready for\n\n505\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.080\nthe exam, make sure you look at\nthat section specifically and\n\n506\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.910\nunderstand those elements of the evidence\ncollection order and of the data\n\n507\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.520\nintegrity the data preservation and\nthe ideal of the volatility.\n\n508\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.310\nOkay?\n\n509\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.920\nThe volatile data collection as well,\nmaking sure that we get\n\n510\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.180\nall of that stuff in there, and\nthat's what we want to do right?\n\n511\n00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.040\nSo read about, understand a little\nbit more because it is highly\n\n512\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.368\nlikely that you're gonna see more on the\nexam on stuff like this than you realize.\n\n513\n00:26:56.368 --> 00:27:01.390\nAnd that's because they expect you to\nunderstand that a big part of everything\n\n514\n00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.660\nthat you're gonna do as an analyst one day\nis that if you do catch something you have\n\n515\n00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.850\nto be able to understand that process\nbecause they hope to prosecute it one day.\n\n516\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.940\nDon't just look at it as\nan interesting science experiment.\n\n517\n00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.290\nOr an interesting idea of ooh this is\nneat and something for me to find and\n\n518\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.030\nsomething for me to protect against.\n\n519\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.810\nIt is all leading to something,\nwhich is, of course, to stop this.\n\n520\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.700\nAnd the way you do that\nis by prosecuting them.\n\n521\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.530\nAnd the way to prosecute them is,\nif you can handle the evidence correctly.\n\n522\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:33.773\nSo here's a good place for you to begin,\nby taking a look at the missed SP 800-86.\n\n523\n00:27:33.773 --> 00:27:36.580\nMake sure you familiarize yourself with\nthat particular section that we showed you\n\n524\n00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.590\nhere in the show.\n\n525\n00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.610\nAnd that should help you to\nnot only prepare for the exam,\n\n526\n00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.900\nbut also get ready for your career\nat a security operations center.\n\n527\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nYou can prepare to\n\n528\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.470\nhelp stop those bad actors.\n\n529\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.880\nThis has been evidence handling, and this\nis in the CCNA sec ops series of videos.\n\n530\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.800\nAnd make sure that you watch every one of\nthem because these episodes are great and\n\n531\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.270\nthey're going to help you in the long run.\n\n532\n00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.320\nAnd also, check our our course library.\n\n533\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.080\nThere's hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n534\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.945\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n535\n00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:03.370\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n536\n00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.060\nThanks for watching.\n\n537\n00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.800\nI'm Zach

00:00:12.003\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.316\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.380\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.241\nI'm your host, Zack Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA SECOPS,\n\n7\n00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.869\nVERIS Schema Categories.\n\n8\n00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the episode title.\n\n9\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.510\nAnd Ronnie Wong is here to deliver us the\ninformation we need to keep on going and\n\n10\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.330\nkeep learning.\n\n11\n00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.310\nHey, Ronnie, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.270\nAs we continue on in our\nCCNA SECOPS series here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.880\nWe are now taking a look,\nof course, at VERIS schemas.\n\n15\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.010\nAnd if you're looking at it like,\nwhat, what is a VERIS schema?\n\n16\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.985\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was my first question,\nRonnie, what is a VERIS schema?\n\n17\n00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit actually is a good question for\n\n18\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.260\nwhat we actually need to think about and\nhandle.\n\n19\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.233\nWell, Zach,\nwhen you think about it in this way, okay?\n\n20\n00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.218\nIndustry-wide, in terms of security and\nthe IT field,\n\n21\n00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:03.210\neverybody in different shops\nspeaks in different ways.\n\n22\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.060\nAnd when you talk about\na particular incident or\n\n23\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.120\na security breach that may have\nhappened and I listen to it,\n\n24\n00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.120\nI may not have a good understanding of\nwhat actually happened at your shop.\n\n25\n00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.860\nBecause I might interpret\nit a little bit differently\n\n26\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.000\nbased on the evidence that you gave me,\nokay?\n\n27\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.670\nSo, I might not understand\nwhat exactly happened.\n\n28\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.385\nAnd then you hear something that\neither I or somebody else told you and\n\n29\n00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.270\nyou're not in full\nunderstanding of that either.\n\n30\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.820\nAnd it makes it difficult then to\nbring an issue up to somebody that\n\n31\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.205\nmay have more experience at times or\na different perspective,\n\n32\n00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:45.589\nand to get everybody on board in\nterms of the same information so\n\n33\n00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:50.339\nthat decisions and even help can be\noffered in the way that needs to.\n\n34\n00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:55.668\nVERIS, V, E, R, I, S is a particular\nway of handling instance and\n\n35\n00:01:55.668 --> 00:02:02.124\nreporting on incidences that's supposed\nto be what relatively uniform to be able\n\n36\n00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:08.690\nto provide good quality information to\nwhoever ends up getting this information.\n\n37\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.550\nAnd it has really has\none purpose behind it.\n\n38\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.111\nAnd the entire purpose behind trying to\nuse something like VERIS schema is not so\n\n39\n00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:21.348\nthat you have the most greatest\ndocumentation in the world.\n\n40\n00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:26.133\nBut it's so that you can present\nthe right information that is needed to\n\n41\n00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.826\ngive you the best\ndecision-making possible, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:33.010\nAnd that's what it's all\nbased around when we started\n\n43\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.840\nthe talk about this idea of what\nVERIS scheme has helped us to do.\n\n44\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560\n&gt;&gt; So is VERIS latin or\nis it alphabet soup?\n\n45\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, believe it or not,\nit's alphabet soup, right?\n\n46\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.448\nSo it's actually an acronym for\nvocabulary, for\n\n47\n00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:47.720\nevent recording, and incident sharing.\n\n48\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.569\nYeah, so, guys at Verizon essentially\ncame up with the foundation of\n\n49\n00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.785\nthis when they had a breach\nseveral years ago.\n\n50\n00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.055\nAnd they realized that the breach was\npretty much not understood by different\n\n51\n00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.211\nteams within Verizon, but\n\n52\n00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:03.320\nas well as others when they\nstarted sharing the information.\n\n53\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.130\nAnd so here, they've essentially put out\nthis understanding in the schema to allow\n\n54\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.540\nfor the anonymization of certain things\nthat might reveal company secrets, but\n\n55\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.490\nat the same, time to allow for other\npeople to be able to see the information,\n\n56\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.504\nand get help that they need to.\n\n57\n00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:22.500\nSo the VERIS schema is actually\na kind of community-driven and\n\n58\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.850\na community-maintained way of documenting\ninformation that we have out there,\n\n59\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.570\nthat's supposed to provide that\ncommon language for us, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.550\nSo where in the world do we find\nout more information about and\n\n61\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.640\nhow are we actually gonna use\nit right here on the show?\n\n62\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.870\nNow let me show you the site here, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.790\nSo the easiest place to go, and\nyou want to actually be careful here, and\n\n64\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.340\nthere's no other way for\nme to describe this.\n\n65\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.854\nNotice how it actually says, Not Secure.\n\n66\n00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:49.810\nCan you see that?\n\n67\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.740\n&gt;&gt; It says unsecure.\n\n68\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.670\n&gt;&gt; It says Not Secure, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.944\nSo you might be wondering like,\nRonnie are you sure?\n\n70\n00:03:54.944 --> 00:04:01.750\nYeah, it's got a GitHub certificate on it\nand the site name is veriscommunity.net.\n\n71\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.500\nSo the certificate doesn't match up but\nthis is the official site right here\n\n72\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.990\nthat you would go to, and\nthat's why we're on this site.\n\n73\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.820\nAnd if you take a look,\nthere is VERIS, the vocabulary for\n\n74\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.910\nevent recording and incident sharing.\n\n75\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.000\nAnd the entire project is hosted on GitHub\nitself, is what they've actually done.\n\n76\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.780\nSo when you take a look at what\nthey're talking about here, okay,\n\n77\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.280\nis that right here in this first sentence\nis kind of the key in what we wanna\n\n78\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.350\nunderstand about this manner and this\nformat that we're talking about, right?\n\n79\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.290\nSet of metrics designed to\nprovide a common language for\n\n80\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.890\ndescribing security incidents in\na structured and repeatable manner, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.210\nAnd here they're talking about,\nhere it is.\n\n82\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.760\nIt's a response to one\nof the most critical and\n\n83\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.840\npersistent challenges in the industry.\n\n84\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.910\nAnd that is because without it we might\nnot have the information that we need\n\n85\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.560\nto make the best possible decisions\nthat need to be made for my company, and\n\n86\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.460\nalso to get help from other\npeople as well, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.620\nSo the overall goal is to lay that\nfoundation, it says, constructively, and\n\n88\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.420\nlearn cooperatively, okay,\nfrom our experiences and to measure and\n\n89\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.260\nmanage risk, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.490\nSo this is where it all begins and\neverything that we've talked about here\n\n91\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.980\nIs trying to help us to understand\nsome of those categories.\n\n92\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.790\nNow, the issue though, that were really\ncalled into, especially on the exam,\n\n93\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.550\nis that if we were given,\nokay, an incident, okay,\n\n94\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.090\ncould we categorize that incident\naccording to the VERIS schema, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.980\nCan we do something like\nthat to help us out?\n\n96\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.110\nWell, yes, you can.\n\n97\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.126\nAnd the best place for you to do that and\n\n98\n00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:47.729\nunderstand that is gonna be right\nhere on their own website, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.116\nAnd the reason why I wanted to bring up\nthe website is because it actually has in\n\n100\n00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:54.360\ngreat documentation on how to do this.\n\n101\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.850\nIt doesn't mean that you're not\ngonna get confused by this, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.330\nBut at least you get documentation.\n\n103\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.390\nAnd you get a great navigation on some of\nthe things that we can actually do and\n\n104\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.310\nwill take a look, especially on that\nscheme documentation to help us to\n\n105\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.285\nunderstand the categories that we're\ntalking about especially in VERIS schema.\n\n106\n00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.921\n&gt;&gt; And this is on GitHub and this is\nalso gonna be free of charge, right?\n\n107\n00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:18.234\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so this is all free and\nis community-driven,\n\n108\n00:06:18.234 --> 00:06:20.160\nis designed to be this way.\n\n109\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.155\nAnd what we'll see is that there's\na lot of different categories and\n\n110\n00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:28.710\nsubcategories and some different ways\nof actually describing everything.\n\n111\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.450\nAnd we'll talk about that\njust briefly here, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.980\nBut this overall idea, right,\nis to really allow a company that really\n\n113\n00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.900\ntake advantage of the documentation and\nthe way that it happens and the language.\n\n114\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.348\nSo that it's consistent across the board\nwith whoever else is actually following\n\n115\n00:06:48.348 --> 00:06:50.609\nthe same standard as what is to do, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:54.078\nSo ultimately in the end,\nas you look through this website,\n\n117\n00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:57.683\nyou'll see the idea of actually\nrecording all of our events and\n\n118\n00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.670\ninstances in this way is to help\nanswer really two questions, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:07.225\nAnd the first question that it should help\nto answer, especially for someone that's\n\n120\n00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:12.489\nmaking the decision, okay, is what is it\nthat I want to know about this instant?\n\n121\n00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:17.791\nOkay, not everybody needs\nto know the details exactly\n\n122\n00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:25.408\nwhat the technical term was that ended\nup happening to your company right now.\n\n123\n00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:30.202\nBut they may need to know about the detail\nsuch as the time of the breach and\n\n124\n00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:33.510\nalso the impact of the breach itself,\nokay?\n\n125\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.580\nThat might actually more important than\nyou telling them that it was a malware\n\n126\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.620\nbreach from so and so file that\nhit the server that did all these.\n\n127\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.661\nDon't get me wrong,\nthose are important details for\n\n128\n00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:45.574\nsomeone at the level of\ntrying to respond to that.\n\n129\n00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:50.002\nBut in making a decision on what needs to\nbe told or what needs to be passed on,\n\n130\n00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:53.760\nthey may just say, what do I really\nwant to know from this event?\n\n131\n00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.190\nAnd that's when a CEO or\nsomebody else might come and say,\n\n132\n00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.786\nHere's what I need to\nknow about the event.\n\n133\n00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:02.686\nWell you might know all those\nother technical details, but\n\n134\n00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.980\nyou don't know how to\nactually respond then.\n\n135\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.180\nThis is why the idea of understanding\nthe schema can't be helpful enough.\n\n136\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.860\nSecondly, is how should I prioritize\nthe different various elements\n\n137\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.970\nthat I get to help me support the decision\nmaking that might have to be done.\n\n138\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.050\nSo from that standpoint,\nsomebody that is making the decision,\n\n139\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.890\nhow do they then take what they're\ngiven from the actual VERIS schema\n\n140\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.400\nideas as presented, how do I actually\nmake the best decision from those?\n\n141\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.180\nSo the VERIS schema allows us essentially\nthe idea of prioritization, it allows us\n\n142\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.060\nthe ability then to actually understand\nwhat other people may be going through and\n\n143\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.910\nwhat my response should be and how I can\nanswer questions like this as well, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.139\nThe advantage of VERIS,\nis because it is community driven and\n\n145\n00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:55.330\nit allows for\nother people to communicate, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.750\nIt allows you then to collect and\nshare information anonymously and\n\n147\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.190\nresponsibly to the people\nthat follow this schema.\n\n148\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.930\nSo you don't have to reveal all of your\ncompany's secrets, but you do have to\n\n149\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.130\nreveal certain things in certain elements\nhere if you want to participate in it and\n\n150\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.400\nget help from it and get better\ndecision making from it as well.\n\n151\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.390\nSo that's the whole goal and aspect of\nwhat we really want to make sure that we\n\n152\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.600\ndo and that we understand as\nwe start to take a look, okay.\n\n153\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.960\nSo let's go back to the website for\na moment and\n\n154\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.140\nlet's talk about some of\nthe different aspects of this.\n\n155\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.480\nMake sure you do take some time and\nvisit this website.\n\n156\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.190\nI'm not saying you have to\nread every detail about it.\n\n157\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:46.460\nBut whatever kind of hits you're kind of\ncuriosity button is what you want to do.\n\n158\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.400\nAnd so, in sense, we're specifically\ncalling out the idea of the schema.\n\n159\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.960\nLet's select schema documentation, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.810\nOnce I select schema documentation,\nokay, for\n\n161\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.330\nthe exam especially,\nwhen we start to take a look at this.\n\n162\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.670\nYou want to make sure that\nyou note these kind of big,\n\n163\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.540\ngigantic categories or\nschemas that we're talking about, right.\n\n164\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.580\nThe Incidence Tracking, okay,\nthe Victim Demographics.\n\n165\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.644\nThe incidence descriptions here,\nthe Discovery &amp; Response, and\n\n166\n00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:21.822\nthe Impact Assessment.\n\n167\n00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:25.290\nEvery time an incident happens,\nit doesn't necessarily mean that Josh,\n\n168\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.910\nyou have to go through all of them,\nokay, but it does mean that you pick and\n\n169\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.080\nchoose which one set you\nwant to actually answer and\n\n170\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.760\nrespond to essentially is\nwhat you want to do, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.610\nSo it doesn't have to actually be\na comprehensive beginning to the end, but\n\n172\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.570\nit can be if you choose to.\n\n173\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.310\nYou can instead say hey, I'm just\nusing this for incident tracking, and\n\n174\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.680\nI'm not worried so much about victim\ndemographics, but I want to actually also\n\n175\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.830\nprovide a description, and\nthen an impact assessment.\n\n176\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.260\nYou can do that.\n\n177\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.840\nOr, you can actually say, here's\nthe incident, here's who actually got\n\n178\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.930\nvictimized from it, here's how I\ndiscovered and responded to this as well.\n\n179\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.010\nSo all of these are possible\ncombinations that you can end up seeing\n\n180\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.390\nin terms of the documentation.\n\n181\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.240\nNow, they like to actually say that\nthe format in which the schema\n\n182\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.355\ndocumentation follows, okay, is that\nyou normally end up getting a question,\n\n183\n00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:26.062\nokay, suggested wording for\na question with VERIS-based application,\n\n184\n00:11:26.062 --> 00:11:30.896\nokay, user notes, what is helpful,\nokay, and then another question type,\n\n185\n00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:35.670\nokay, identifies a type of question and it\nsays here's all the information that you\n\n186\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.220\ncan possibly give for\nthe format of what we end up seeing now.\n\n187\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.490\nDon't worry about it right now but\nunderstand that there is a logic\n\n188\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.380\nbehind the information that they want\nyou to actually see and do, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.460\nNow to find out more about each one\nof these in terms of the information\n\n190\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.090\nthat we're actually given,\nI can select Incident Tracking here and\n\n191\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.800\nnow this is what I like about this, okay.\n\n192\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.440\nIt really does give me at least an example\n\n193\n00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.680\nof what they mean by incident tracking,\nokay.\n\n194\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.900\nCaptures general information about the\nincident itself, main purpose is to allow\n\n195\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.060\norganizations to identify, store and\nretrieve incidences over time.\n\n196\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.630\nAnd so then, they have of course,\nhere's what they want you to do,\n\n197\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.850\ngive an incident an ID.\n\n198\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.150\nAnd they say, what is actually\nthe case number here, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.860\nHow are you actually going to list this,\nand\n\n200\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.390\nthey normally also have a particular\nformat, such as the variable name here,\n\n201\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.370\ntell you the purpose, and who developed\nit and then a source ID, okay.\n\n202\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.360\nSo here's the overall incident,\nwho possibly caused this, okay.\n\n203\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:50.030\nAssociate an incident with an entity\nthat is handling or reporting it, okay.\n\n204\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.490\nSo whoever actually told\nyou it was happening.\n\n205\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.900\nIs it confirmed?\n\n206\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.491\nAnd you actually go ahead and\ntake a look at the reason why behind that.\n\n207\n00:12:56.491 --> 00:13:00.720\nCan you summarize the incident\nof what's actually happened?\n\n208\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.700\nRelated Incidents that may\nactually be part of this\n\n209\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.230\none incident that you\nmight think is a relation.\n\n210\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.740\nWell how confident are you\nin the assessment or\n\n211\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.750\nin the reporting that you're doing?\n\n212\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.494\nOther additional notes that you\nactually might want to give.\n\n213\n00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:21.291\nSo, all of that's actually stuff\nthat you might chose to document\n\n214\n00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:25.510\nalong with just the idea of\ninstant handling or tracking.\n\n215\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:31.090\nUnder the Victim Demographics,\nnotice it kind of follows the same thing.\n\n216\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.942\nWho's the actual victim,\nwhat ID have you given it and\n\n217\n00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:38.120\nthen of course the other information\nthat you want to put in there.\n\n218\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.505\nPrimary Industry, now this is probably\nsomething that you may do but you may not.\n\n219\n00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:47.260\nThere's a particular code that can\nbe listed in there if you choose to.\n\n220\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:54.500\nIt says record the appropriate code using\nat east 2 of the full 6-digit code.\n\n221\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.470\nIf you want to have more\nspecificity to that.\n\n222\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.080\nAnd it even, of course, continues to\ngive you all of that information.\n\n223\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.515\nCountry of operation,\nagain, if it's important.\n\n224\n00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:06.040\nYou may actually have false alarms.\n\n225\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.060\nNumber of employees,\nthis is where it might get a little bit\n\n226\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.700\ntoo much where you go I don't\nwant them to know that.\n\n227\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.320\nWell, don't answer, okay?\n\n228\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.460\nAnnual revenue, you may not want anybody\nto know the annual revenue, but in terms\n\n229\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.130\nof them gathering more statistical\ndata and of course, for analysis here.\n\n230\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.314\nComparing companies and what type or\n\n231\n00:14:25.314 --> 00:14:29.020\nwhat level of incidents is\nhappening with that company.\n\n232\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.500\nYou can get that as well.\n\n233\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.420\nLocations affected, notes, you name it.\n\n234\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.850\nYou can continue to see that all of these\nwill have kind of the same information.\n\n235\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.168\nThis is kind of the key one as well, okay.\n\n236\n00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:46.310\nIn the incident description this is how we\nend up not only seeing the incident but\n\n237\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.970\nnotice it kinds of gives us the overall\nnature of how every incident,\n\n238\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.080\nat least these four basic questions here,\nright?\n\n239\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.370\nThe four As is what they talk of.\n\n240\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.440\nWhose actions affected the asset?\n\n241\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.310\nWhat actions affected the asset?\n\n242\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.660\nWhich assets were affected?\n\n243\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.960\nAttributes.\n\n244\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.850\nSo much so, that this was kinda the key\nimportance in terms of a schema,\n\n245\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:13.212\nthat you can take this and ultimately\ntake everything that you're doing and\n\n246\n00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:17.410\ndefine into what they\ncall a VERIS A4 grid.\n\n247\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.010\nThat allows you to list all of the actual\n\n248\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.190\ncomponents over here\non the left hand side.\n\n249\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.662\nAnd then what the attack is.\n\n250\n00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:32.355\nAnd from that point you can of course\neven assign some different numbers and\n\n251\n00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:36.150\nhere they show you 3 actors or\n7 actions, 5 assets.\n\n252\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.750\nYou name it.\nYou can actually compare all these and\n\n253\n00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.390\nit gives you some different ones.\n\n254\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.170\nHow to create the grid.\n\n255\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.940\nAnd of course how you\nactually end up doing that.\n\n256\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.000\nSo it does give you a little\nbit more statistical\n\n257\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.120\nanalysis that you can do\nbased on that as well.\n\n258\n00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.671\nDiscovery and Response of course.\n\n259\n00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:57.236\nMethodology, Root Causes,\nCorrective Actions, you name it.\n\n260\n00:15:57.236 --> 00:16:00.027\nAll this stuff actually\ndoes come into play, okay.\n\n261\n00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:03.678\nSo, each one is,\nas you take a particular instant here.\n\n262\n00:16:03.678 --> 00:16:05.018\nYou want to make sure,\n\n263\n00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:09.467\nthat you can actually understand where\nit is that you might categorize, or\n\n264\n00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:13.370\nplace something like this, so\nthat you can respond to it as well.\n\n265\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.880\nNow, once all of that is actually done,\nthis is where you might go like,\n\n266\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.690\nso how do I do this?\n\n267\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.960\nYou can track it on paper if you want to,\nbut it takes a little more time and\n\n268\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.950\neffort to do so.\n\n269\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:31.710\nA lot of companies will also\nhave different forms, as well.\n\n270\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.250\nAnd so, great thing is we'll see that,\n\n271\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.830\nwhen we get to that\na little bit later here.\n\n272\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:42.470\nNow there's also of course\nindicators of compromise,\n\n273\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.950\nare kinda big ones that you\nmight actually point to.\n\n274\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.990\nAnd then samples,\nsamples are really good for us, and\n\n275\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.080\nthis is where I wanted to\nget to in just a moment.\n\n276\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.430\nSo let me go back that, and we'll kinda\npull that up in a moment, as well.\n\n277\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:02.070\nClassification examples, and maps to other\nschemas, so that way you can compare, and\n\n278\n00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.170\ncontrast it versus other\nschemas that may be out there.\n\n279\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.790\nAnd even a community database.\n\n280\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.000\nLet me zoom out.\n\n281\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.020\nLet me get down there.\n\n282\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.990\nSo, the community database is a big one,\nwhere you can go to the data,\n\n283\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.900\nthat has actually been\nposted up there already.\n\n284\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.470\nAnd then, it even of course tells you what\nthe problem is, how do you actually work\n\n285\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.930\naround that, what are they\nexpecting you to do in the future?\n\n286\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.578\nNow, once all that is done,\n\n287\n00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:32.066\nonce you kind of have a good understanding\nof how something like this is done.\n\n288\n00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:34.279\nWhat does it end up resulting\nin most of the time for\n\n289\n00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.450\na company that chooses Faultless?\n\n290\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.480\nWell, you can actually end\nup getting an application.\n\n291\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.030\nIn other words, somebody might develop\nan application like this where you record,\n\n292\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.950\nor you have a recording tool for\nall of your instances,\n\n293\n00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.650\nthat you host on your own\ninside of your network here.\n\n294\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.060\nSo, here is a web-based survey to be\nable to record, and report security\n\n295\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.000\ninstances using the VERIS framework in\nan efficient, and repeatable manner.\n\n296\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:07.201\nWe chose SurveyGizmo, simply because\nit demonstrates that a VERIS-compliant\n\n297\n00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:11.537\ndata entry form can be created\nusing off-the-shelf survey tools.\n\n298\n00:18:11.537 --> 00:18:19.081\nSo that you can do that, and it says you\ncan use this as you want in terms of fit.\n\n299\n00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:23.293\nSo here's an example of what you might\nbe doing if your company followed\n\n300\n00:18:23.293 --> 00:18:26.240\na VERIS type of instant tracking tool.\n\n301\n00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.710\nYou could give it an incident ID,\nnow I don't have an incident ID here, but\n\n302\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.700\nlet's just call this one 9001,\njust because I want to.\n\n303\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.890\nThen notice it says hey,\nhas this been confirmed?\n\n304\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.190\nAnd if you remember back to the Schema\nthat we were talking about,\n\n305\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.580\nnotice this actually doing\nthe Schema questions, but\n\n306\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.770\nin this kind of interactive\ntype of situation instead.\n\n307\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.085\nSo is it confirmed,\nis it suspected, is it a near miss?\n\n308\n00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:57.533\nWell, you can of course just mark some\nlike this, confirmed or suspected,\n\n309\n00:18:57.533 --> 00:18:58.655\ngive it a summary.\n\n310\n00:19:01.325 --> 00:19:06.366\nYes, we did find malware\n\n311\n00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:10.413\non say Zach's-\n&gt;&gt; It happens all the time.\n\n312\n00:19:10.413 --> 00:19:13.408\n&gt;&gt; Desktop-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:19:13.408 --> 00:19:18.868\n&gt;&gt; Computer after he opened\n\n314\n00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:23.590\na email attachment.\n\n315\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.480\nThat's pretty common.\n\n316\n00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n317\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.887\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's do something like that.\n\n318\n00:19:27.887 --> 00:19:29.900\nThen, when did the incident occur?\n\n319\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.495\nYou, of course, can provide the proper\ncontext in terms of the date and time.\n\n320\n00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:40.132\nSo this is, what is the day, the second?\n\n321\n00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:41.990\n&gt;&gt; October, the second.\n\n322\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.160\n&gt;&gt; There you go, and even more notes, and\n\n323\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.140\ninstructions on how it was\nhandled if you choose to.\n\n324\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.436\nVictim Organization, this is maybe where\nyou choose to kind of skip a few things,\n\n325\n00:19:52.436 --> 00:19:57.609\nbut notice if you do want to actually look\nup your industry, it has a lot of them,\n\n326\n00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:04.850\nSo this is where you can scroll through,\nand pick one and do this.\n\n327\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.270\nNow, if you're doing this on your own.\n\n328\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.570\nAgain, it means you actually have\nto type all this up later, and\n\n329\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.530\nenter it into a database somewhere.\n\n330\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.430\nLet's say that for\nus here, what are we here?\n\n331\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.780\nSpeciality Trade Contractor, why not?\n\n332\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.910\nNumber of employees, let's say 11 to 100.\n\n333\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:29.850\nCountry of operation, let's say\nright here in the US, United States.\n\n334\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.940\nAnd then any other notes they want to.\n\n335\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.820\nAre we using the long form,\nor the short form here?\n\n336\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.550\nFor use more complex incidences or\nshort form.\n\n337\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.535\nWe're gonna select short form, because I\ndon't wanna type anymore than I have to.\n\n338\n00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:45.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n339\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.790\nit shows you that, you might be\nwondering why is this so essential?\n\n340\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:54.170\nWell now, whether its me, or analyst\nnumber two, or analyst number three, Zach,\n\n341\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.130\nwhoever it is, I'm not just recording\nthe information I feel is relevant.\n\n342\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.000\nBut what we're actually asked a question,\nand we're answering what we believe\n\n343\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.610\nshould be answered through\nthis one consistent format.\n\n344\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.090\nThat means that the results that we get,\nregardless of whether I do it, or\n\n345\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.720\nwhether Zach does it.\n\n346\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.990\nIt's gonna be consistent, and\n\n347\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.680\nit actually will provide the information,\nthat we need to actually provide.\n\n348\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n349\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.830\n&gt;&gt; So then we click next, and\nwe'll now get to the short form.\n\n350\n00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:27.590\nAnd now it's gonna say hey,\nwhat is it that we want here?\n\n351\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.070\nAbuse of logical access, and\nprivileges, inappropriate use or\n\n352\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.070\nworkaround, basic malware infection.\n\n353\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.238\nLet's try that one.\n\n354\n00:21:36.238 --> 00:21:37.720\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Notice that once I picked that,\n\n355\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.760\nit actually gave me some other choices.\n\n356\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.085\nIf I chose something else,\nnotice I would get another choice instead.\n\n357\n00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n358\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.860\nwe'll choose the one that we stuck\nwith here, basic malware infection.\n\n359\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.790\nIf you know the details, then you select.\n\n360\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.335\nSo this one, let's say here\nIs some type of malware, and\n\n361\n00:21:55.335 --> 00:22:02.680\nwe'll say it's a command and\ncontrol variety, infection vector.\n\n362\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.430\nDid we know what ended up happening here?\n\n363\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.710\nLet's say it's an email attachment, and\nthe affected asset here is a desktop\n\n364\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:15.250\ncomputer, malware name we will\ncall it Zach, Zach's revenge.\n\n365\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n366\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.990\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n367\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.975\n&gt;&gt; I want vengeance.\n\n368\n00:22:17.975 --> 00:22:21.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll click next.\n\n369\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.450\nOther attributes of course, now this we\ndidn't get to, cuz I didn't describe it.\n\n370\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.530\nBut notice,\nthis is the CIA triangle here, and\n\n371\n00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.000\nthis is all about the security goals here.\n\n372\n00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.750\nFor what attributes were compromised in\nthis particular incident that we have.\n\n373\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.592\nAnd this is real important, because this\nmeans that you did not reach your goals,\n\n374\n00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:43.883\nin terms of your security.\n\n375\n00:22:43.883 --> 00:22:47.526\nSo, you want to make sure you identify\nwhich one actually ended up getting\n\n376\n00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:49.936\ncompromised here with the command and\ncontrol,\n\n377\n00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:53.130\nwell that would actually be right\nhere in the confidentiality.\n\n378\n00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.565\nNow, notice you can actually add\nin all of them if you choose to.\n\n379\n00:22:56.565 --> 00:22:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Hm-hm.\n\n380\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.810\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou might actually do something like that.\n\n381\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.550\nLet's just say that it was this\none at the beginning here,\n\n382\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.690\nwhich is confidentiality and possession.\n\n383\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.389\nAnd now, what data was disclosed?\n\n384\n00:23:07.389 --> 00:23:09.140\nWas the data disclosed?\n\n385\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.060\nYou can say I don't know,\nit was maybe potentially at risk here.\n\n386\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.000\nYou can pick how many records,\n\n387\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.550\nyou name it,\nyou can actually see all this information.\n\n388\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.820\nAnd then provide the actual\ntracking details here,\n\n389\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.420\nas you continue to move forward.\n\n390\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.207\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n391\n00:23:25.883 --> 00:23:27.569\n&gt;&gt; So then of course, Timeline of events,\n\n392\n00:23:27.569 --> 00:23:29.460\nwhich is very important\nin certain aspects.\n\n393\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.089\nI'm not gonna worry about it too much.\n\n394\n00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:33.492\nLet's say Unknown for right now.\n\n395\n00:23:37.191 --> 00:23:41.288\nHow was the incident discovered?\n\n396\n00:23:41.288 --> 00:23:45.090\nLet's say that this one was\nsome type of IT audit or scan.\n\n397\n00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.777\nAny losses were reported, we haven't\nhad anything reported yet, and so\n\n398\n00:23:50.777 --> 00:23:51.927\nonce this is done.\n\n399\n00:23:51.927 --> 00:23:54.275\nWhat they actually choose\ndo in terms of submission?\n\n400\n00:23:54.275 --> 00:23:56.268\nWell, we're not gonna actually submit it,\nbut\n\n401\n00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:59.240\nif we wanted to this would get submitted\nthen to a databases tracking it.\n\n402\n00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.934\nAnd allow us to go ahead and do that.\n\n403\n00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:05.060\nBut now notice it says, and\nyou're just playing, Trash It.\n\n404\n00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.040\nSo, if we wanted to make sure that we\nmarked it for someone to review, or\n\n405\n00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.640\nGood to go!, we can also do that as well.\n\n406\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.250\nSo, it gives a consistent manner.\n\n407\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.379\nI'm just going to select Trash It cuz I'm\nnot sending it to any other database here.\n\n408\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.470\nSays, notice it's done, you can now go and\nrecord another one if you choose to, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:26.430\nSo it gives you that consistency in the\nway that everything is actually reported\n\n410\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.850\nout to give you\nthe information that you need.\n\n411\n00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.475\nSo when you start to take a look at\nsome type of instance, like on malware.\n\n412\n00:24:33.475 --> 00:24:35.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Notice that you can go back\n\n413\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.470\nto that schema documentation,\n&gt;&gt; And start to actually say,\n\n414\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.210\nhow do I categorize those\ndifferent things that we need to.\n\n415\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.171\nYou might realize, it's not really about\nthe victim demographic so much, but\n\n416\n00:24:46.171 --> 00:24:49.314\nit's more about the incidence\ndescription and the tracking.\n\n417\n00:24:49.314 --> 00:24:52.950\nYou want to discovery response\nas well as the impact.\n\n418\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.900\nBut just take a look and\ntake some time at noticing\n\n419\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.360\nwhat is actually happening here as we\ncontinue to actually use tools like this?\n\n420\n00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.330\nNow is VERIS schema the only way to go?\n\n421\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.500\nNo, okay, but\n\n422\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.300\nthis is the one that is specifically\ncalled out on the CISCO SECOPS exam.\n\n423\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.370\nAnd so they do want you to make sure that\nyou pay attention, especially the schema,\n\n424\n00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.270\nokay, and go through and\ntake a look at that example again.\n\n425\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.554\nAnd notice the information\nthat you're actually given so\n\n426\n00:25:21.554 --> 00:25:24.577\nthat you can set something\nlike this up if you need to.\n\n427\n00:25:24.577 --> 00:25:27.995\nNot everything's gonna fit neatly\ninto a category, but do your best.\n\n428\n00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:31.670\nMake sure you take a look once again,\nlike we said here, read through this.\n\n429\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.200\nIt even says, hey if you wanna click\nStart and how this actually works.\n\n430\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.560\nNotice it says right here, and this is\nwhere it gets a little bit trickier,\n\n431\n00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.960\nif you're doing this like\nan Excel spreadsheet.\n\n432\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.720\nIt shows you how you would actually\nkeep track of it here instead.\n\n433\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.600\nAnd that's probably not what you actually\nwant to do, where you're actually making\n\n434\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.980\ntables of tracking everything, and adding\nin more information as you go along.\n\n435\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.560\nBut it is a great place for you to start,\nif especially you believe that you\n\n436\n00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.420\nneed something like this to help you to\ncategorize and report the information.\n\n437\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:07.234\nFor instance, that you're actually having\nto handle in a much more formalized way.\n\n438\n00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:09.802\nAt the same time,\nin the details that you actually need so\n\n439\n00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:12.290\nthat good business decisions can be made.\n\n440\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.390\n&gt;&gt; Well that's awesome.\n\n441\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.960\nVERIS Schema categories.\n\n442\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.900\nWonderful episode.\n\n443\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.440\nValuable information and\n\n444\n00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.930\nsomething you will need if\nyou're getting into forensics.\n\n445\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.550\nRight Ronnie?\n\n446\n00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.720\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n447\n00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.570\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n448\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.452\nAnd make sure you check out every single\nepisode of the CCNA sec
