show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:12.705\nYou'll see that during this show,\n\n4\n00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.959\nwe'll probably end up referring\nto it as CCNA SECOPS very often.\n\n5\n00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.132\nAnd that is because this particular\nshow matches up to the exam for,\n\n6\n00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:25.950\nof course,\nyour CCNA Cyber Ops certification as well.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.260\nNow, let's talk about a few details on\nthe exam as we actually get started this\n\n8\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.992\ntoo, okay?\n\n9\n00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:34.193\nIf you are getting ready for the exam,\nwe want to know a little bit about,\n\n10\n00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:37.230\nof course, preparing and\ngetting access to the exam as well.\n\n11\n00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.790\nLet's take a look at my screen,\nthat will help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.929\nMake sure you go to the Pearson VUE\nwebsite, and when you do so,\n\n13\n00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.077\nyou, of course, can select the program.\n\n14\n00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:49.680\nFor us, it's gonna be Cisco, and\nthat should pop up Cisco Systems.\n\n15\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.780\nAnd once we do this, you, if you have\nnot yet actually created an account,\n\n16\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.920\nmake sure you create an account\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n17\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.490\nOnce you do so, of course,\nyou'll log back in, come to the same site.\n\n18\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.498\nFrom this point, you will go down\nto where it says View exams, so\n\n19\n00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.523\nthat you can find the correct exam number.\n\n20\n00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:12.644\nAnd once we do so, we're gonna actually be\nunderneath these Proctored Exams, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.998\nSo Cisco does offer some\nof the other ones, but\n\n22\n00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:22.021\nwe're underneath the Proctored Exams,\nand we're looking for 210-255,\n\n23\n00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:27.029\n210-255, Implementing Cisco\nCybersecurity Operations.\n\n24\n00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:33.256\nAnd once you do that, notice that there's\nactually a couple of different languages,\n\n25\n00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.403\nEnglish and Japanese.\n\n26\n00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:38.504\nLet's select English at this point and\nclick Next.\n\n27\n00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:42.910\nFrom that point, of course, you'll\nschedule the exam, which will be near you.\n\n28\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.430\nThere's a button over on the lower\nright-hand corner that will allow you to\n\n29\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.520\npick a center near you, and\nthat's what you'll have to do.\n\n30\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.770\nMake sure that you arrive about 15 minutes\nearly, and that way you also bring,\n\n31\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.040\nof course, a photo ID, and\nthat you are ready for the exam as well.\n\n32\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.833\nNow when we start taking a look\nat the details of the exam,\n\n33\n00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.372\nthat is what we're also here for too.\n\n34\n00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:07.652\nThe entire, of course, CCNA\nCybersecurity Operations show is based\n\n35\n00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:10.191\naround the exam objectives themselves,\n\n36\n00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:14.310\nthat you can download directly\nfrom Cisco Learning website.\n\n37\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.800\nSo make sure you do that first, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600\nNotice that the exam is a 90 minute exam,\nand\n\n39\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.290\nthere's between 60 to 70 questions\nin this assessment, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.950\nNow, to achieve the overall certification\nitself, you must take two exams.\n\n41\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.220\nThe first one, of course,\nis the Security Fundamentals exam, and\n\n42\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.300\nthen this one on the Implementing\nCisco Cybersecurity Operations.\n\n43\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.598\nBoth of those will lead you to your\nCCNA Cyber Ops certification, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:46.379\nNow the whole goal, of course, as we\nactually take a look at this particular\n\n45\n00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.654\nshow is, not only for you to be\nable to achieve your certification.\n\n46\n00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:55.652\nBut also to help prepare you as an entry\nlevel analyst in working in a security\n\n47\n00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:56.992\noperation center.\n\n48\n00:02:56.992 --> 00:03:01.656\nAnd so, the goal and the show,\nof course, is designed around that, and\n\n49\n00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:05.120\nit's also designed around\nthese exam topics.\n\n50\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo throughout the show, we will be\ncovering every exam topic as well.\n\n51\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.959\nWe talk about endpoint threat and\ncomputer forensics analysis,\n\n52\n00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.806\nas we break it down through using these\ndifferent terms using the CVSS 3.0.\n\n53\n00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.359\nAnd we'll make sure that we\ncover all the details in that.\n\n54\n00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.239\nWe, of course, will take a look at some\nof the different items that pertain to\n\n55\n00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.240\nthe Windows file system,\nas well as the Linux file system.\n\n56\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.110\nWe'll also talk, of course,\nabout evidence, and\n\n57\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.240\nthe different image types that\nwe may also be using, in terms\n\n58\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.530\nof making sure that we're ready to work\nin that security operations center.\n\n59\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.940\nAnd then, of course, describe the idea\nof an investigation, and the threats,\n\n60\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.122\nand the threat actors that are in place.\n\n61\n00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:50.230\nUnder the Network Intrusion Analysis,\nwe, of course, will go through each and\n\n62\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.098\nevery one of these topics as well,\nincluding the protocol headers,\n\n63\n00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:56.240\nin which we'll take a look at in depth.\n\n64\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.340\nWe'll also see, of course, different\nelements using NetFlow Version 5.\n\n65\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.240\nWe, of course, will work with Wireshark\nand using PCAP files as well.\n\n66\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.300\nAnd we, of course, will talk about the\nfive tuples of data as we go through this.\n\n67\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.370\nWe'll show you how to extract a file from\na TCP stream given a PCAP file as well.\n\n68\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.020\nAnd then, of course, different\nelements that are involved there,\n\n69\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.491\nmaking sure we can identify them too.\n\n70\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.076\nAs we move into the third section,\nwe'll now move into incident responses.\n\n71\n00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:32.025\nAnd we will heavily focus in upon\nthe NIST documentation here on\n\n72\n00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:37.088\nSP800-61, or excuse me, 800-61 r2.\n\n73\n00:04:37.088 --> 00:04:41.221\nAnd this will help us to go ahead and\nprepare, as you see, it's referred to in\n\n74\n00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.375\nmultiple sections throughout, of course,\nthis third domain objectives.\n\n75\n00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.736\nWe, of course,\nwill describe the idea of using CSIRT\n\n76\n00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:53.230\nin our particular centers as well,\nand then, the network profiling.\n\n77\n00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.830\nAnd then we'll look at, of course,\ndata and event analysis.\n\n78\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.420\nAnd we'll take a look at all the elements\nthat are described right here,\n\n79\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.900\ngoing from data normalization,\n\n80\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.290\nof course, to actually comparing different\nanalytic methods that we have in hand.\n\n81\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.220\nAnd lastly, we'll also end up focusing on\na couple of other NIST documents too, or\n\n82\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.270\nat least one other one, okay?\n\n83\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.300\nSo we'll take a look at the kill\nchain right here in 5.1,\n\n84\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.760\nas well as the same NIST document\nwe referred to earlier, and\n\n85\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.700\nthen later on,\nanother NIST document as well.\n\n86\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.100\nAnd lastly, we'll talk about other\nschemas that are also involved\n\n87\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.210\nin what you may find very common,\ninside of your security operations center.\n\n88\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.644\nSo if you are now in this process\nof preparing for this second exam,\n\n89\n00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:44.496\nor for the CCNA Cyber Ops overall,\nI do have to actually make\n\n90\n00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:50.532\na particularly good recommendation\nto you before you proceed on, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:55.000\nYou can choose to take either one of\nthe exams in whatever order you choose to.\n\n92\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.257\nThe recommendation, of course, is that you\ntake the Security Fundamentals first and\n\n93\n00:05:59.257 --> 00:06:02.600\nthen take, of course,\nthe SECOPS exam second, okay?\n\n94\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.980\nDo not be surprised to find that you'll\nsee a lot of the elements that are in\n\n95\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.210\nthe Security Fundamentals exam also\nappear in the SECOPS exam as well.\n\n96\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.710\nSo just be prepared for\nthat as you continue to go ahead and\n\n97\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.200\nstudy, as well as watch the shows that\nwe've created right here to help you too.\n\n98\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.951\nDon't forget to take advantage of\nthe forums that are also at the ITProTV\n\n99\n00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:27.511\nwebsite.\n\n100\n00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:32.361\nBut if you're ready to get started, all\nyou have to do is actually go ahead and\n\n101\n00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.121\nget forwarded into\nthe very first video on,\n\n102\n00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.572\nof course,\nour CCNA Cybersecurity Operations show.\n\n103\n00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:39.435\nThank you for watching.\n\n104\n00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:45.463\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
