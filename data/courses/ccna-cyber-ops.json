          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.934\n[SOUND] Hi,\nwe're here to do an overview for\n\n2\n00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:08.175\nthe Cisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals show.\n\n3\n00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.750\nIf you're studying to obtain your\nCisco CCNA Cyber Ops Certification,\n\n4\n00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.330\nthen you're in the perfect place.\n\n5\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890\nSo let's take a moment to talk about what\nyou should expect before taking your exam.\n\n6\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.210\nIf we can take a look at my screen,\n\n7\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.520\nI'd like to pull up some\ninformation from Cisco's website.\n\n8\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.380\nNow, just so you're aware,\nthis is actually going to\n\n9\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.980\nbe a certification that requires\ntwo exams that you need to pass.\n\n10\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.569\nSo the first exam that we'll\nbe focusing on is going to be\n\n11\n00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:41.910\nthe 210-250 SECFND, which I have\npulled up in this other tab here.\n\n12\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.530\nAnd this is what we're focusing about for\nthis particular show.\n\n13\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.819\nNow, this is going to run about 90\nminutes for the particular exam.\n\n14\n00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.501\nAnd, I know it says here on my\nscreen 55 to 60 questions, but\n\n15\n00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.276\nwe found some conflicting information\non Cisco's site that also\n\n16\n00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.250\nstates it could be up to 70 questions.\n\n17\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.220\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n18\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.365\nNow, if you're thinking about cost,\n\n19\n00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:12.401\nit's probably going to run you about\n$295 for this particular exam.\n\n20\n00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.353\nBut you might wanna just check\nlocally to verify that price.\n\n21\n00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:18.902\nAnd if you're wondering,\nwell where can I go and take that exam?\n\n22\n00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:22.964\nIf you click on this hyperlink, it'll\nnavigate you to the Pearson View website\n\n23\n00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:25.206\nand you'll be able to\nschedule your exam and\n\n24\n00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:29.345\nfind the nearest Pearson View testing\ncenter so that you can complete this exam.\n\n25\n00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.500\nNow, what about the details of the exam?\n\n26\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.530\nWhat is gonna be covered?\n\n27\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.260\nWhat should you know before\nyou get into that booth?\n\n28\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.100\nWell, maybe Ronnie Wong\ncan help us with that.\n\n29\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.340\nRonnie, what do you think?\n\n30\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.086\n&gt;&gt; Well as we get started\nin taking a look at\n\n31\n00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:45.020\nthe Cybersecurity Fundamentals Show We're\npretty much gonna take the exam objective\n\n32\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.040\noutline and cover all the topics that\nare right there on the exam objectives.\n\n33\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.050\nAs well as add in some personal\ndetails that should help you out\n\n34\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.790\nas you get ready for\nthe Cybersecurity Fundamentals.\n\n35\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.563\nRemember that the goal here is about\nfundamentals of cybersecurity.\n\n36\n00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:03.428\nSo we're not really getting super in\ndepth into a lot of the information, but\n\n37\n00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:06.060\nwe need to have at least\na basic coverage of it.\n\n38\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.650\nAnd that's what we'll do right here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.320\nSo, let's take a look at my screen again.\n\n40\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.650\nAnd that way we'll actually be able\nto show you a few different things.\n\n41\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.370\nAs you go to the Cisco learning website,\n\n42\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.290\nremember that you can always\nuse your favorite browser and\n\n43\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.130\njust type in the Cisco Cyber Ops and\nthat should lead you to a link.\n\n44\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.510\nAnd from there you can click\non the 210-250 on the SECFND.\n\n45\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.030\nOnce you have that, you can then\ngo to where it says exam topics.\n\n46\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.040\nAnd I do recommend that you do this as you\n\n47\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.000\ngo through our show as we start to film\nthat as well, because you'll see that what\n\n48\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.310\nwe'll do is we'll cover all\nthe topics listed right here.\n\n49\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.990\nAnd there are different\ndetails behind it and\n\n50\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.540\nyou can see how the exam breaks down and\nthe different percentages.\n\n51\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.127\nTo make it easier, of course, they have\nthe ability for you to download a complete\n\n52\n00:02:56.127 --> 00:03:00.198\nlist of the topics in a PDF format,\nto make it easier for you to print out.\n\n53\n00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.940\nSo that you can also go back and\n\n54\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.970\nensure that you're covering\neverything that you need to.\n\n55\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.335\nOnce you have that where you download it,\nhere's what it ends up looking like.\n\n56\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:14.110\nAnd what will follow in the format\nof our show is also going to\n\n57\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.490\nkind of really directly come from,\nwell, these fundamentals right here and\n\n58\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.000\nthese exams, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.199\nSo according to the official exam list,\n\n60\n00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.311\nremember that this is exactly\nwhat Cherokee was saying.\n\n61\n00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:29.050\nIt's about a 90 minute exam,\n60 to 70 questions.\n\n62\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.385\nYou can say between 55\nto 70 if you want to.\n\n63\n00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:36.440\nIt's gonna be about $295 US.\n\n64\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.910\nSo if you're in a different area in the\nworld, make sure you check your prices,\n\n65\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.070\ndon't go just by what I said because\nprices can change after time.\n\n66\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.180\nSo make sure you understand that,\nbut download a copy of this.\n\n67\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.710\nWe're gonna spend a good\nbit of time right here in\n\n68\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.140\nthe networking concepts themselves.\n\n69\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.240\nEven though\nthe CCNA Cyber Ops Certification\n\n70\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.560\ndoesn't really require you to\nhave any networking background.\n\n71\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.696\nWell they do question you about it,\nwhere they have 12% of the exam.\n\n72\n00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:09.131\nAnd we'll talk about the basic\nnetworking concepts and\n\n73\n00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.651\nwe'll spend a good bit of time in there,\nbecause it is fundamental knowledge for\n\n74\n00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.355\nyou to be able to do any\ntype of network monitoring.\n\n75\n00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:18.901\nYou have to at least understand basic\nprotocols as well as the devices on\n\n76\n00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:19.618\nthe network.\n\n77\n00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:23.889\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll make sure\nthat we cover a lot of these different\n\n78\n00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.094\njust basic networking concepts to ensure\nthat we have a good foundation for\n\n79\n00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:31.760\nwhere we will begin our cyber\nops training with, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.000\nWe'll also take a look, of course,\nat various security concepts here.\n\n81\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.960\nWell, we'll talk about\nthe basics of security.\n\n82\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.380\nWe'll talk about risks, threats,\nas well as vulnerabilities.\n\n83\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.120\nWe'll take a look, of course, at different\nterms that we need to understand and\n\n84\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.530\nencounter, especially in the business\nworld and the networking world as well.\n\n85\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.950\nWe'll also, of course,\n\n86\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.860\ntalk about some of the different ways\nthat we control access into our networks.\n\n87\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.840\nAnd then various terms that\nwe've come across even without\n\n88\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.860\nhaving to go to the level of what we call\ncybersecurity training today as well, and\n\n89\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.150\nwe'll see that.\n\n90\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.944\nThen we'll spend a little bit of time\nhere in the area of cryptography.\n\n91\n00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:10.865\nAnd what you'll have to also remember\nbecause this is one of their newest\n\n92\n00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:15.044\ncertifications that are out there,\nyou'll end up finding that some of these\n\n93\n00:05:15.044 --> 00:05:18.541\nparticular exam topics that you'll see,\nthey are very vague.\n\n94\n00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.907\nAnd this is where hopefully our show\nis going to help you out to be able to\n\n95\n00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:25.370\nreduce that definition down.\n\n96\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.210\nFor example, right here in this particular\nexam objectives, as you see it,\n\n97\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.410\nwhere it says describe how the success or\n\n98\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.790\nfailure of cryptographic exchange\nimpacts a security investigation.\n\n99\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.950\nWell, that is pretty vague, and\nif you're not exactly sure what\n\n100\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.116\nthe question actually means,\nwell, that's why you need help.\n\n101\n00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:48.954\nAnd that's why I show what we're going to\nbe doing is gonna help you to focus in on\n\n102\n00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.495\nwhat they're really pinpointing on and\ngetting ready for\n\n103\n00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.510\nthis type of exam as well.\n\n104\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.240\nAnd also of course,\n\n105\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.660\ngetting ready to be someone that goes into\nthe cybersecurity realm in your career.\n\n106\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.295\nWe're also gonna take a brief bit of time\nhere to talk about host-based security.\n\n107\n00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:08.850\nWe'll take a look at both Windows\nas well as Linux domains and\n\n108\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.470\ncomputers, so that we understand the good\ndifferences in monitoring utilities, and\n\n109\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.020\nof course, different security\nutilities that we have access in.\n\n110\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.682\nAnd lastly, we'll talk about\nnetwork security monitoring.\n\n111\n00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:24.346\nAnd actually next to last, I should say\nthe penultimate addition here is the idea\n\n112\n00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:29.012\nof security monitoring, talk about\ndifferent types of data that we're looking\n\n113\n00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:33.780\nfor as well as some of the different\ntools that we need to be familiar with.\n\n114\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.480\nAnd also of course,\nwhat we're normally monitoring for\n\n115\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.930\non the network in terms of traffic.\n\n116\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.180\nWe'll also briefly take some time and\n\n117\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.130\nintroduce you to the concepts of\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Center,\n\n118\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.450\nas well as the Cisco Fire Site\nManagement Console as well.\n\n119\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.979\nSo that you can take a look at this idea\nof the next generation IPS events types.\n\n120\n00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.077\nSo we'll be able to show you all those\ndifferent aspects that should help you out\n\n121\n00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:03.519\nas well as you start seeing more and\nmore of this in today's world.\n\n122\n00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:07.750\nLastly, we'll round out everything that\nwe'll do by spending a good bit of\n\n123\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.850\ntime and\ntaking a look at attack methodology.\n\n124\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.640\nNow a good fifth of the entire exam\nis based on methodologies here,\n\n125\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.280\nso 21% of the entire exam is right here.\n\n126\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.680\nBut the great thing about this, and\n\n127\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.710\nI know this is gonna sound a little\nbit unusual that I say it's great.\n\n128\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.200\nBut a lot of this is more memorization,\nit's understanding the basic concepts.\n\n129\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.060\nEven though we show you and\nwe explain to you some of the attacks,\n\n130\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.330\nthis one is really about memorization\nof a lot of these concepts.\n\n131\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.800\nSo make sure that you understand that.\n\n132\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.589\nBut we'll go through every single\none of these exam objectives to\n\n133\n00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.641\nensure that we get a good,\nproper coverage of everything\n\n134\n00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:53.394\nthat you actually end up finding\non the SECFND exam, that 210-250.\n\n135\n00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:57.620\nThat way you'll make sure that\nyou go into the exam prepared.\n\n136\n00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.060\nMake sure you also do\nyour own studying here.\n\n137\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.660\nThere is nothing else that will prepare\nyou better than the content that you'll\n\n138\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.550\nget right here at ITProTV, but\nas well as putting your own study and\n\n139\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.710\nyour own time and effort into learning\nabout these different concepts.\n\n140\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.350\nSo if you're ready for your challenge and\nentry into the, really,\n\n141\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.700\nnext generation of all\nsecurity in the IT world,\n\n142\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.060\nwhich is gonna be

00:00:12.023\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:15.743\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:18.554\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:23.189\nIn this episode, we're gonna be talking\nabout, well, our network models.\n\n7\n00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.666\nIf you've been working in IT, or\nhave watched some of our other series,\n\n8\n00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.517\nyou may be already introduced\nto some of this information.\n\n9\n00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:32.569\nBut don't go anywhere because,\nwell, it's Ronnie and I today, and\n\n10\n00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.714\nwe have some really great\ninformation with you.\n\n11\n00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:38.697\nSo let me go ahead and introduce Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios with us today.\n\n12\n00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:39.810\nThank you for joining.\n\n13\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nhere as we begin this new show and\n\n14\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.560\ntake a look at the idea of Cisco\ncybersecurity fundamentals.\n\n15\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.710\nLike everything else in Ciscoland,\nyou do have to pay attention not only,\n\n16\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.480\nof course, to the basic networking\nconcept, but, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.210\nthose things that are very\nspecific to Cisco, as well.\n\n18\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.630\nBut the great thing is in this particular\nseries and show, we're really going to\n\n19\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.970\ntalk about what security fundamentals at\nthe beginning, if I can actually say that.\n\n20\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.400\nAnd, of course, we'll emphasize where\nCisco really does emphasize some of\n\n21\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.010\nthe things that they want you to know\nwhen it comes down to the exam as well,\n\n22\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.800\nif you're actually preparing for\nthat new CCNA cyber ops certification.\n\n23\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.610\nSo we wanna jump into that\nright at the beginning here\n\n24\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.300\nbecause it's something that we have to\nmake sure that we clearly understand and\n\n25\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.000\nknow, which is the networking\nfundamentals, right.\n\n26\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.120\nSo we're gonna begin with just\nthe idea here of talking about the,\n\n27\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.620\nwell, networking models that you\nhave to be incredibly familiar with.\n\n28\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.530\nIn the realm of Cisco, they want you to\nactually know about two basic models.\n\n29\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.297\nOne, of course, is the OSI model, and\nthe other one's gonna be the TCP/IP model.\n\n30\n00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:50.230\nBut there's a little bit of stuff\nthat we really need to focus in on.\n\n31\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.322\nBut you need to have a solid, rock solid,\nunderstanding of the actual OSI model and\n\n32\n00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:58.840\neach of the network layers and\nhow they function.\n\n33\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.860\nSo we're gonna spend\na bit of time on that.\n\n34\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.550\nAnd then we'll take a look at it in\ncontrast, and compare that, of course,\n\n35\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.140\nwith the TCP/IP model, as well.\n\n36\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.060\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, earlier,\n\n37\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.690\nyou and I, we were talking\nabout trying to explain these.\n\n38\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.930\nThey're not theoretical, but\nthey're not something tangible.\n\n39\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.660\nSo sometimes this can be a bit\nof a topic that may be hard for\n\n40\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.430\nsomeone to understand if they haven't\nbeen introduced to it before.\n\n41\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.805\nSo I think we're gonna try\nto just start at the basics.\n\n42\n00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:27.469\nAnd if you're one of those people\nwho haven't seen the OSI model or\n\n43\n00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.152\nthe TCP/IP model before,\njust hang in there and\n\n44\n00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:34.418\nhave a little bit of faith because you\nmight not fully understand it at first.\n\n45\n00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:38.578\nBut it's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle\nbecause once you start learning more\n\n46\n00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:42.470\nprotocols and just the different\ncomponents of this jigsaw puzzle,\n\n47\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.230\neventually you will see how\neverything is pieced together.\n\n48\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Cherokee, you're absolutely right.\n\n49\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.690\nThe very fact is, now that Cisco\nhas this new CCNA cyberops and\n\n50\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.850\nthey are requiring two exams, it's kind of\ninteresting because it doesn't really mean\n\n51\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.200\nthat you have to go through\nthe CCNA routing and switching.\n\n52\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.080\nAnd they assume that you already\nhave some basic networking concepts,\n\n53\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.290\nbut you may not.\n\n54\n00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.180\nSo what we're gonna do here,\nof course, is review.\n\n55\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.189\nBut we wanna make sure that we have\nan in-depth coverage just in case you're\n\n56\n00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.175\ndeciding, hey,\nthis is where I'm gonna start.\n\n57\n00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:13.894\nNow, it's not really gonna help you for\neverything that you'll actually see.\n\n58\n00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.940\nBut at least at the beginning,\nwe have a strong, fundamental review.\n\n59\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.620\nAnd that's what we'll be taking a look at.\n\n60\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.280\nSo we wanna make sure that we describe\neverything in terms of this model.\n\n61\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.520\nAnd what Cherokee said was also\ncorrect in the very fact that it's\n\n62\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.100\nsomething that's theoretical.\n\n63\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.530\nBut if you understand\nwhy it's actually there,\n\n64\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.510\nit will help you out when it comes down to\nsome of the different networking concepts\n\n65\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.100\nthat we'll have to really master if we're\ngonna pursue this type of certification.\n\n66\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.140\nSo when it begins, Cherokee, do you know\nwhy the OSI model came about, by chance?\n\n67\n00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Government initiative\nto improve communication?\n\n68\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.614\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; That was the original Internet, but\n\n69\n00:03:49.614 --> 00:03:51.308\nit still was-\n&gt;&gt; You would think that, yeah,\n\n70\n00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:52.137\nyou would think that.\n\n71\n00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:57.103\nBut the very fact is it was a kind of\na vendor neutral push to standardize\n\n72\n00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:01.130\nall networking, okay,\nall the way across the world.\n\n73\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.860\nThey wanted to make sure that there\nwas one particular networking\n\n74\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.230\nmodel that could be used regardless\nof where you are in the world.\n\n75\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.708\nAnd you might be wondering, why is that?\n\n76\n00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.320\nThat's because,\n\n77\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.990\nwell, before this point, right, there\nwere many different networking models.\n\n78\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.370\nIf you bought one particular\ncompany's equipment,\n\n79\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.540\nyou had to use their networking model.\n\n80\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.190\nIf you went to another company,\nyou had to use their networking model.\n\n81\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.934\nWhen the OSI really started out,\nthey said, look, here's what we wanna do,\n\n82\n00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.541\nwe wanna make it vendor neutral.\n\n83\n00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:31.027\nWe wanna make sure that it can be able\nto encompass networking just about\n\n84\n00:04:31.027 --> 00:04:34.189\nevery computer on the planet together,\nas well.\n\n85\n00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.074\nSo that's where it really began,\n\n86\n00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:40.690\nthis idea of trying to standardize those\ndifferent protocols to really help us out.\n\n87\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's starting to come back to me.\n\n88\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.230\nSo was that a DOD initiative and\nthen later on they handed it off to ISO?\n\n89\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.941\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually it's the reverse, right.\n\n90\n00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.581\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the OSI model really is the one that\n\n91\n00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:55.091\ngot started kind of in\nthe mid 70s to early 80s.\n\n92\n00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.543\nBut then, because of the way that\neverything was starting to roll and\n\n93\n00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:02.306\nthe OSI model seemed to be catching steam,\n\n94\n00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:05.550\nthe TCP/IP model got its\nstart as a DOD contract.\n\n95\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.891\nAnd once they started developing it, they\nwere able to do something much quicker.\n\n96\n00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.871\nAnd they were able to actually kind\nof come up with their model and\n\n97\n00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:15.980\ndo some of the same things that\nthe OSI model talks about.\n\n98\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.420\nSo today even though the OSI model is not\nreally the general model of networking\n\n99\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.990\nthat is put into real\npractical use anymore,\n\n100\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.130\nit's still the way that we tend to\ndescribe the end to end communication\n\n101\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.860\nprocess to ensure that one device can\nactually send data to another device,\n\n102\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.490\nand it receives the exact\nsame data that was sent.\n\n103\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.400\nSo it's very important that we understand\nthe concept overall and this model.\n\n104\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.930\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's a pretty historical\nfootnote as far as even just exam taking.\n\n105\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.836\nA lot of our vendors here really want you\nto know that, the book knowledge, per se.\n\n106\n00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:54.081\nAnd then a lot of people in real\nlife still utilize those terms and\n\n107\n00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.786\nthose layers to help troubleshoot and\nexplain just so\n\n108\n00:05:56.786 --> 00:05:59.690\nyou have a good vernacular\nwith your peers at this point.\n\n109\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.382\nThe idea, of course, for the understanding\nfor cyberops and cybersecurity is that\n\n110\n00:06:06.382 --> 00:06:11.434\nyou're not gonna be able to understand\nthe cybersecurity types of concepts if\n\n111\n00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:16.428\nyou don't already have a solid\nfoundational understanding of networking.\n\n112\n00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:20.286\nAnd that really begins with us\ntaking a look a little bit more\n\n113\n00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:23.772\nin-depth into the idea of\nwhat we call the OSI model.\n\n114\n00:06:23.772 --> 00:06:29.184\nNow, the OSI model, what it does for\nus is it separates out into different\n\n115\n00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:35.231\ncompartments or into different layers\nthe way that networking begins to happen.\n\n116\n00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:38.552\nSo at the very beginning when you start\ntalking about the way that the OSI model\n\n117\n00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:42.230\nreally works is that they don't just say,\nall right, we're just gonna take data and\n\n118\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.160\nput it on the network, and\nhope it gets to the other end.\n\n119\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.190\nThey really thought about it\nprocess by process, step by step,\n\n120\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.500\nto ensure that when it was able to be\nput out onto the network that whatever\n\n121\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.432\ncomputer received it was also able\nto process everything, as well.\n\n122\n00:06:59.432 --> 00:07:03.880\nSo in the OSI model, the open systems\ninterconnect breaks down into a seven\n\n123\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.690\nlayer model like we described.\n\n124\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.690\nLet's take a look at my computer screen.\n\n125\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.480\nThat will help us out just a little bit\nwhen we start talking about this idea\n\n126\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.030\nof the OSI model and the seven layers.\n\n127\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.170\nAll right, so what I have before\nyou is usually a representation\n\n128\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.510\nof those different seven layers.\n\n129\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.810\nAnd we're gonna go\nthrough each one of them.\n\n130\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.650\nBut right at the beginning, it's very\nimportant, especially as you get ready for\n\n131\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.910\nthe exam, you do need to\nmemorize these seven layers.\n\n132\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.380\nAnd that's gonna be really\nan important concept,\n\n133\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.880\nespecially in the order\nthat they appear in.\n\n134\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.590\nSo when you take a look, make sure\nyou start with something like that.\n\n135\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie,\n\n136\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.430\ndo you have a favorite mnemonic to\nhelp you memorize these layers?\n\n137\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about a favorite\nmnemonic, there's just one that I've used\n\n138\n00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.810\nover the years, and\nmultiple ones that I've heard about.\n\n139\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.404\nBut the easiest way that\nI know to memorize this,\n\n140\n00:07:48.404 --> 00:07:52.707\nif you're actually having to memorize it\nfor the order, and you probably will,\n\n141\n00:07:52.707 --> 00:07:56.965\nis of course something like all people\nseem to need, I like, delicious pizza.\n\n142\n00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:58.229\nIs the way that I normally do it.\n\n143\n00:07:58.229 --> 00:07:59.494\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a variation.\n\n144\n00:07:59.494 --> 00:08:02.906\nI've heard all people seem\nto need data processing.\n\n145\n00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:06.470\nAnd then starting from\nPhysical up to Application,\n\n146\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.601\nanother way would be\nPlease Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away.\n\n147\n00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:12.533\n[CROSSTALK] So\nboth of those have pizza, so hey?\n\n148\n00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:13.109\nWe love pizza.\n\n149\n00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah go figure.\n\n150\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.680\nI do like food and\nthat's why I tended to use that mnemonic.\n\n151\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.970\nAnother one of our show host here,\nDaniel Lowrie,\n\n152\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.350\nhe says that somebody actually said to him\nall people seem to need Dan physically.\n\n153\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.167\nSo you.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Wow.\n\n154\n00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.128\n&gt;&gt; Can actually name.\n\n155\n00:08:26.128 --> 00:08:29.910\nSo yes you have different ways that\nyou can memorize the layer and\n\n156\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.740\nthe order that they appear in.\n\n157\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.420\nNow the reason why this is very important\n\n158\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.360\nin the way that data's actually\ntransmitted back and forth.\n\n159\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.950\nIs because, data that exist\non your computer right now,\n\n160\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.630\ndoes not have anything that it needs to be\nable to be sent over to another computer.\n\n161\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.800\nIt really doesn't.\n\n162\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.160\nSo if I were to just take my computer and\n\n163\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.070\nbegin to type something out on just\nan application, on my computer that\n\n164\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.160\ndoesn't mean that that data right then is\nready to be transmitted across a network.\n\n165\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.580\nIt is just sitting there.\n\n166\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.276\nIt has the available data that I need,\nbut it doesn't have any of\n\n167\n00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:11.940\nthe information that tells it how it's\nsupposed to be ready to go on the network.\n\n168\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.500\nNor does it have any information that\ntells it how is it actually gonna get to\n\n169\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.160\nthe destination that it's going to.\n\n170\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.904\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I don't know if you\nwere planning on saying this or\n\n171\n00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:24.170\nnot, but you have a nice analogy.\n\n172\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.106\nI don't know if you remember\ntelling me a long time ago but\n\n173\n00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:28.953\nbasically about writing a letter.\n\n174\n00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:32.508\nIt breaks down a little bit with\nthe analogy but if you think about it\n\n175\n00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:36.777\nit's really the closest kind of concept\nthat you may already be familiar with.\n\n176\n00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.057\nThat can work well with this.\n\n177\n00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:42.971\nSo here at our application layer,\nit's kind of similar to like Ronnie said,\n\n178\n00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:47.600\ngetting an idea out of your head\ninto that application or program.\n\n179\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.938\nKind of like if you were to\nwrite a letter to your pen pal.\n\n180\n00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.427\nYou're getting that message out\nof your head onto that paper.\n\n181\n00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that actually makes sense.\n\n182\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.824\nBecause what we're talking about,\nright, is communicating our thoughts.\n\n183\n00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:01.926\nAnd if we don't have a way to\ncommunicate our thoughts and\n\n184\n00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:07.010\nput it down we can't send it if we're\nusing a postal service type of analogy.\n\n185\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.600\nSo even if I know that I want\nto write let's say Cherokee and\n\n186\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.900\nshe lives somewhere else well,\nI can say that I want to write Cherokee.\n\n187\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.330\nI can even say I know exactly\nwhat I want to write to Cherokee.\n\n188\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.890\nBut to get it transmitted over the postal\nservice to her I can't just go to the post\n\n189\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.440\noffice and say I've got a letter\nI want to transmit to Cherokee.\n\n190\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.790\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n191\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.350\nI need to put it into something\nthat then can be transmitted over.\n\n192\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.770\nAnd the OSI model helps us not only to\ndo that, but then to also think about\n\n193\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.820\nthe other parts of the process that\nhelps us to get this stuff through.\n\n194\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.154\nSo when we start to take a look at this\nthat's what you have to begin with is\n\n195\n00:10:42.154 --> 00:10:47.223\nunderstanding that the OSI model is really\ndesigned to help to ensure that the data.\n\n196\n00:10:47.223 --> 00:10:52.136\nThat is desired to be sent from one\ncomputer can arrive over on the other\n\n197\n00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:55.980\ncomputer exactly as it\nwas meant to be sent.\n\n198\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.856\nSo the way that this works on a single\ncomputer is what we call normally\n\n199\n00:11:00.856 --> 00:11:05.733\nsomething like the source computer\nIs that when you begin to choose to\n\n200\n00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:08.949\nsend data it works its\nway down the OSI model.\n\n201\n00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:13.233\nOkay, going from the top to\nthe bottom is the way that data\n\n202\n00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.790\nis sent out from your computer.\n\n203\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.630\nLet me see if I can make that\nline a little bit bigger.\n\n204\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.230\nOops, take away one of those points.\n\n205\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.300\nIs what we're normally talking about.\n\n206\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.550\nIs to work out way down through\nwhat we call that OSI stack or\n\n207\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.580\nthat model to do this.\n\n208\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.490\nSo at the very beginning,\n\n209\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.350\nthat's what we're gonna take a look at\nto help us to understand how this works.\n\n210\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.734\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, it kinda seems a little\nstrange that we're starting at seven and\n\n211\n00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.554\nworking our way down to one, but\n\n212\n00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:45.944\nin text books it's normally\nhow it's written out simply.\n\n213\n00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:48.750\nBecause, well,\nthat's where the thought originates and\n\n214\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.990\nthe process is kind of kick starting, so\nthat's why they have it in that order.\n\n215\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.670\n&gt;&gt; And it does make sense and\n\n216\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.260\nwhat Cherokee is also talking about\nsomething else that you have to know too.\n\n217\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.190\nThat even if you never heard of this\nparticular idea of each of these layers,\n\n218\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.740\nmake sure you memorize them.\n\n219\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.533\nBut another part of it is also this where,\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Look at you.\n\n220\n00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:10.900\n&gt;&gt; You may actually have done this.\n\n221\n00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.270\nOkay, where you may have heard\nsomebody talk about layer seven or\n\n222\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.280\nlayer six or the idea of layer four,\nlayer three.\n\n223\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.450\nIn networking, they mean the same\nthing we normally just refer to them.\n\n224\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.190\nNow I changed the colors up\na little bit and the reason why\n\n225\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.020\nis because I wanna talk about this just\na little bit more as we go on through.\n\n226\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.120\nBut these red layers essentially\nare where it's all done on your computer.\n\n227\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.420\nThe data hasn't left your computer,\nit hasn't done anything yet,\n\n228\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.770\nit's not even prepared to\nleave your computer yet.\n\n229\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.130\nIt's really at layer four\nthat we begin the transition,\n\n230\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.780\nthat's where I took the yellow.\n\n231\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.140\nAnd then at layers three,\n\n232\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.500\ntwo, and one, this is where we get\nthe data ready to be transmitted too.\n\n233\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.390\nSo make sure you memorize numbers\non the layers as well as the names.\n\n234\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.840\n&gt;&gt; And just to throw one more thing\nout there for you guys, Ronnie,\n\n235\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.120\nyou just mentioned the data,\nas the data leaves the computer.\n\n236\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.250\nAnd I see you kind of have\nthis color coded already.\n\n237\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.959\nAnd this is just something nice to know.\n\n238\n00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:07.800\nIt's kind of a little bit\nof a pet peeve of mine.\n\n239\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.130\nBut it's nice for you to be able\nto know the correct terminology,\n\n240\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.410\nand there's something called PDUs,\nor protocol data units.\n\n241\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:20.200\nThose top three layers there,\nwe usually just reserve the word data for\n\n242\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.870\nthat particular protocol data unit for\nuse at those three layers.\n\n243\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.508\nThere is a little mnemonic for that also.\n\n244\n00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:33.980\nAnd it goes, some people fear birthdays.\n\n245\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.340\nI need something for the D though,\nfor the top three layers though.\n\n246\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.890\nThey kind of leave that one out, but\n\n247\n00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.400\nyou've got your D's at the very top,\nthe top three.\n\n248\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.310\nAnd then for\ntransport that's actually segment.\n\n249\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:51.248\nAll right so the data then we will use\nthe term segment if it's a TCP segment,\n\n250\n00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:55.357\nif you we're using UTP,\nwhich Ronnie will explain it in a few.\n\n251\n00:13:55.357 --> 00:13:57.670\nThen that will also be called a data gram.\n\n252\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.770\nSo moving forward, some people p for\n\n253\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.079\npackets at layer three and\nf for frame at layer two.\n\n254\n00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:08.869\nAnd then when you get to the physical\nlayer, Ronnie will explain it, but\n\n255\n00:14:08.869 --> 00:14:10.870\nit's gonna be b for bits or binaries.\n\n256\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.890\nSo just remember the term\nPDU protocol data unit, so\n\n257\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.770\nthat you are using the proper terms for\nthat particular layer.\n\n258\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.660\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n259\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.770\nSo what Cherokee is saying that as\ndata begins to get ready to move\n\n260\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.790\noff of your computer and go to another\none we do call it a little bit different.\n\n261\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:34.580\nWhen data resides on your computer\nalone it is just called data.\n\n262\n00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.420\nBut once we start to transition and\nget the data ready.\n\n263\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.300\nWe then call it here at layer four.\n\n264\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.010\nSegments.\n\n265\n00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.390\nAnd then if I can copy this,\nlet me see if I can without destroying it,\n\n266\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.290\na little bit harder than\nI thought it would be.\n\n267\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:59.193\nAt layer three here, this is going\nto be instead what we call a packet.\n\n268\n00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:03.760\nOr packets.\n\n269\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.570\nAnd then at layer two and one,\nit's really called a frame.\n\n270\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.830\nA frame is essentially what\nwe end up putting onto\n\n271\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.310\nthe wire at some particular point.\n\n272\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.679\nBut really at layer two it's really\nthe idea of what we call a frame.\n\n273\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.279\nAnd then at layer one it's just called\nbits, is what it's called or signal.\n\n274\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.810\nAnd this is really just\nthe idea of putting 1s and\n\n275\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.070\n0s onto the actual network itself, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.170\nSo when we take a look then, you'll hear\nall about some of the different ways\n\n277\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.740\nthat this is actually gonna be described\nas well as data starts moving through.\n\n278\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.005\nAnd you do need to know at least\nthose particular names for\n\n279\n00:15:51.005 --> 00:15:53.808\nthe way that this thing\nis segmented off as well.\n\n280\n00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:57.286\n&gt;&gt; Actually all this information you\nhave on the screen here Ronnie is pretty\n\n281\n00:15:57.286 --> 00:16:00.538\nessential and its, might as well\nscreen shot it or put in your notes,\n\n282\n00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:01.972\nthis is good stuff here guys.\n\n283\n00:16:01.972 --> 00:16:03.717\n&gt;&gt; All right so let's go ahead and\n\n284\n00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:06.409\ntalk about this idea of\nmaking sure that we can.\n\n285\n00:16:06.409 --> 00:16:09.189\nUnderstand what each of\nthe layers does for us.\n\n286\n00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:13.292\nAnd we're trying to use the analogy\nas well, that Cherokee had,\n\n287\n00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:14.941\nthat will help us out too.\n\n288\n00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:19.512\nSo, when it comes down to the idea\nof understand each of those layers,\n\n289\n00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:21.765\nlet me see if I can move things up.\n\n290\n00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:24.288\nKinda shift it around\nwhen I plugged in here.\n\n291\n00:16:24.288 --> 00:16:27.110\nAnd that way, we'll kinda focus in.\n\n292\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.030\nSo we have our data really\nwhen we type it in or\n\n293\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.150\nwhenever we actually do something and\nwe are ready to send the data.\n\n294\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.700\nRemember that the data that exists right\non your computer at this point isn't\n\n295\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.690\nreally ready to go anywhere.\n\n296\n00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.040\nAnd I've also represented this down\nhere at the bottom where I just have\n\n297\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.660\nthe word data.\n\n298\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:51.480\nAt the application layer, what tends to\nhappen, is well, a couple of things, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.970\nYou have an application that you're using,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n300\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.620\nYou can take a word processing program,\n\n301\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.300\nyou can do whatever you want to,\nthat's fine.\n\n302\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.640\nYou, as a human,\n\n303\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.190\nyou interact with that word processing\nprogram to write some type of letter.\n\n304\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.333\nAt the same time,\n\n305\n00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:11.987\nif you're gonna be using networking\nto deliver this letter somewhere,\n\n306\n00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:17.271\nit is the application layer that also\ninteracts with that program itself, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:23.897\nSo the user and this layer interact with\nwhatever that word processing program has,\n\n308\n00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:30.080\nand then it identifies that as a traffic\nready to be transmitted at some point.\n\n309\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.453\nThe other thing that it also\ndoes is that it also says,\n\n310\n00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:38.145\nlook I need to know who\nam I gonna send this to,\n\n311\n00:17:38.145 --> 00:17:42.980\ndo I have the current resources\navailable to send it.\n\n312\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.490\nAnd is there any other necessary\nsynchronisation to send it\n\n313\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.380\non to the other side as well?\n\n314\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.191\nSo even at the very application layer\nitself, even though we normally think\n\n315\n00:17:52.191 --> 00:17:55.896\nabout just a program, it really is\nabout the interaction to the network.\n\n316\n00:17:55.896 --> 00:18:00.614\nSo, at the application layer, we begin\nthat process of taking whatever data\n\n317\n00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:03.270\nthat exists, and we are now packaging it.\n\n318\n00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.502\nWe are now getting it ready for\ntransmission on the network.\n\n319\n00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:12.830\nWe're not transmitting the data yet, but\nwe're just really preparing it for that.\n\n320\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.760\nThe way that that ends up happening is\nthat we take all that information, and\n\n321\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.080\nwe put it into a header,\ncalled layer 7 header, or\n\n322\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.918\nthe idea of the application layer header,\nand we prepend that to the data itself.\n\n323\n00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:29.231\nSo you wanna take a look at examples\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n324\n00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:35.332\nYou can imagine something like FTP or\nSMTP or even or HTTPS or HTTP.\n\n325\n00:18:35.332 --> 00:18:39.058\nNow let's take the idea of SMTP as\nan example right away cuz that's one that\n\n326\n00:18:39.058 --> 00:18:41.660\nwe're familiar with, which is email.\n\n327\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.400\nIf you write in an email client\nlike Outlook or Thunderbird or\n\n328\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.370\nwhatever it might be\nthat you actually use.\n\n329\n00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.957\nThat itself is an application, and\nwhen you choose to now hit the send button\n\n330\n00:18:53.957 --> 00:18:59.721\nwell what happens is that the application\nlayer says look you're gonna SMTP,\n\n331\n00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:04.207\nit is now interacting with that\napplication to say use SMTP.\n\n332\n00:19:04.207 --> 00:19:08.051\nThe only thing that you did is that\nyou wrote whatever that email was and\n\n333\n00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:10.770\nthen you chose to hit the send button.\n\n334\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.110\nThen at that point,\n\n335\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.930\nthe application started communicating\nwith the application layer.\n\n336\n00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.320\nAnd the application layer says,\nyou need to send?\n\n337\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.556\nYou use SMTP to do so.\n\n338\n00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:23.384\nAnd when it does that, it goes ahead and\n\n339\n00:19:23.384 --> 00:19:29.280\nmarks all of what that data is going to\nuse at this point to begin to send that.\n\n340\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.140\nAnd to make sure that you're\nusing SMTP as the main protocol.\n\n341\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.478\nThe reason why this is important\nis because the end result,\n\n342\n00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:41.816\nwhoever's receiving the data, has to\nknow it came from that SMTP as well, or\n\n343\n00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:44.656\nit's not gonna match up and\nit's not gonna work.\n\n344\n00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:48.792\nSo at layer seven, very important that\nwe get off on the right foot here and\n\n345\n00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.740\nthat we understand this process.\n\n346\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.190\nMake sure you understand\nalso some of the examples\n\n347\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.110\nthat are also listed here to help us\nunderstand the application layer.\n\n348\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Lots of different protocols.\n\n349\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's-\n&gt;&gt; Utilizing application layers so.\n\n350\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.740\n&gt;&gt; There's really a ton of them,\nbut these are kind of three and\n\n351\n00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.970\nthe reason why I mentioned these\nspecifically is because, this is where we\n\n352\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:13.720\ndo find at least these three protocols\nthat are defined by RFCs in the IEEE.\n\n353\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.707\nSo, are there tons of other applications,\nyou better believe it, but\n\n354\n00:20:17.707 --> 00:20:21.162\nnot every single protocol is\nactually defined by the RFC and so\n\n355\n00:20:21.162 --> 00:20:25.549\nhere is actually a good example of some\nthat you'll find regardless of whether\n\n356\n00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:29.492\nyou're talking about the OSI model or\nthe TCPIP model, as well okay?\n\n357\n00:20:29.492 --> 00:20:34.338\nSo, now that we have an application\nthat says yes I'm ready to send,\n\n358\n00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:37.140\nI know who to actually send it to.\n\n359\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.770\nThe next part, of course,\nis gonna be the presentation layer.\n\n360\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:46.090\nAnd at the presentation layer,\na couple of other things also must occur.\n\n361\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.680\nAnd everything did seem to shift down.\n\n362\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.656\nSo even though I thought I had everything\nkind of on the screen at the same time,\n\n363\n00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:53.115\nlet's take a look here too.\n\n364\n00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:58.203\nThe Application layer depends\non the Presentation layer\n\n365\n00:20:58.203 --> 00:21:03.600\nto also prepare The data for\nthe network as well, okay.\n\n366\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.440\nAnd this ensures that data\nthat is sent across a network\n\n367\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.660\ncan arrive in something that is\nreadable on the other machine.\n\n368\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.735\nSo without the idea of this presentation\nand this formatting, what could happen is\n\n369\n00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:22.822\nthat the data that arrives let's say from\nmy machine over to Cherokee's machine.\n\n370\n00:21:22.822 --> 00:21:25.500\nWhat ends up happening is that\non Cherokee's machine she may\n\n371\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.480\nreceive everything of the data.\n\n372\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.870\nIt gets up to presentation layer and now\nher computer doesn't know what application\n\n373\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:39.250\ndo I need to make sure that I send this\nto, that then an application on Cherokee's\n\n374\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.668\ncomputers can open and understand-\n&gt;&gt; Has that compatibility.\n\n375\n00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n376\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.630\nSo without this particular idea,\n\n377\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.440\nwe really do not have any method of\nthe end user understanding data.\n\n378\n00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.890\nEven if all the data actually\narrives on her computer.\n\n379\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.310\nSo we have to ensure that when we send it,\n\n380\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:00.180\nthat we tell the other computer this\nis the format the data appears in.\n\n381\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.603\nSo that on your computer,\n\n382\n00:22:01.603 --> 00:22:05.432\nit can open it up using whatever\nprogram uses that particular format.\n\n383\n00:22:05.432 --> 00:22:10.234\n&gt;&gt; And just to note that each one of these\nlayers are dependent on the previous\n\n384\n00:22:10.234 --> 00:22:10.860\nlayers.\n\n385\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.700\nSo we couldn't just start At\ntheir presentation layer,\n\n386\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.570\nbecause you would be omitting\nthat very important first\n\n387\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.830\nstep of gathering your thoughts\ninto that letter, per se.\n\n388\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:25.434\nSo, you'll see, as we go along, each layer\nis dependent upon its neighbors there so.\n\n389\n00:22:25.434 --> 00:22:29.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other thing that you have,\nof course, is, not only does this include\n\n390\n00:22:29.242 --> 00:22:33.274\nthings, like, data format But when you\nstart talking about compressing your data,\n\n391\n00:22:33.274 --> 00:22:35.794\nwhen you start talking about\nthe idea of encrypting,\n\n392\n00:22:35.794 --> 00:22:38.990\nyou are actually at\nthe presentation there as well.\n\n393\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.920\nDown here at the bottom of course,\nare some of the common types of format\n\n394\n00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.960\nin which we do tend to send to,\nbut there's many more.\n\n395\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.330\nI just listed a few of them But\nthis is what happens.\n\n396\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.350\nIt takes whatever your data is in this\noriginal format, on your computer and\n\n397\n00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.320\nsays, when I send it across a network,\nthat means that that machine over there,\n\n398\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.030\nwhatever's associated to\nopen up that type of format,\n\n399\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.717\nit should be able to do it okay.\n\n400\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.210\nAnd then of course, here's the result.\n\n401\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.771\nNotice that what we're adding in\nnow of course is another header.\n\n402\n00:23:09.771 --> 00:23:13.933\nSo not only do we have our data, but\nwe now have an application layer header as\n\n403\n00:23:13.933 --> 00:23:18.294\nwell as a presentation letter layer header\nas we continue to prepare the data for\n\n404\n00:23:18.294 --> 00:23:19.115\nthe network.\n\n405\n00:23:19.115 --> 00:23:24.064\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I'm really glad you added that\nat the bottom, because it is important to\n\n406\n00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:28.582\nbe able to visualize as we are going\nthrough these layers what happens, and\n\n407\n00:23:28.582 --> 00:23:31.451\nthat's called the process\nof encapsulation,\n\n408\n00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:33.482\nas we're going to the OSI model.\n\n409\n00:23:33.482 --> 00:23:38.916\nAnd then decapsulation on\nthe receiving side, on that receiver.\n\n410\n00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.410\nBut if you guys hear that term,\n\n411\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.041\nyou can kind of associate that with\nthe visual Ronnie's provided for you.\n\n412\n00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:48.666\n&gt;&gt; And really is something that's gonna\nmatter as we also see when the data gets\n\n413\n00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:51.711\nsent over to the other side and\nwhat happens here.\n\n414\n00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:55.588\nSo, at least keep this in your mind\nthat when we start sending data it is\n\n415\n00:23:55.588 --> 00:23:56.589\nencapsulating.\n\n416\n00:23:56.589 --> 00:23:59.894\nAnd then when we receive data we'll\ntalk about a term called decapsulation\n\n417\n00:23:59.894 --> 00:24:00.528\nas well okay.\n\n418\n00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.537\nSo, let's move on to\nthe session layer too.\n\n419\n00:24:04.537 --> 00:24:09.056\nAs we start moving on to the idea of the\nsession layer, this is also known as layer\n\n420\n00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:13.230\nfive and let me move everything\nback up on the screen here.\n\n421\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.910\nAnd when we start to take a look then,\nhere this is kind of a key one and\n\n422\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.940\nalso one that can be very easily\n\n423\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.690\nmisexplained cuz I know I probably\ndone it myself multiple times here.\n\n424\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.060\nBut when we start talking\nabout the session layer,\n\n425\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.640\nthis is where my computer and\nCherokee's computer.\n\n426\n00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.480\nBegin to establish and\nmanage the communications\n\n427\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.760\nbetween presentation layers or\nchunks of data as well.\n\n428\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.290\nNow that's important.\n\n429\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.700\nThe reason why is because\nwhat we're actually saying is\n\n430\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.975\nhere's how we separate out all the\ndifferent data streams from one another.\n\n431\n00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:53.075\nCherokee's computer as\nwell as my computer,\n\n432\n00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:56.973\nI can be sending Cherokee\nmultiple piece of information.\n\n433\n00:24:56.973 --> 00:25:00.610\nI can send Cherokee in a single email,\nright?\n\n434\n00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.750\nJust to email itself,\nI can also include of course,\n\n435\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.270\ninside in that email an attachment.\n\n436\n00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.330\nI can also send Cherokee a link that\ntells her where to go, all that data.\n\n437\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.000\nAt the same time,\nCherokee could open up a web browser and\n\n438\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.220\nthen have multiple tabs opened up.\n\n439\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.690\nWell, how is it that\nCherokee's web browser\n\n440\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.410\nknows exactly what different\nwebsites to go to?\n\n441\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.370\nAnd the way that it does it is well,\n\n442\n00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.300\nright here is the very fact is a session\nthere keeps all that information separate.\n\n443\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.500\nAnd that's why I have it as\nseparating out between sessions of\n\n444\n00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.240\nthe communications session between\npresentation layer data units.\n\n445\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.910\nSo every presentation layer, everything\nthat we actually send as a different\n\n446\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.130\nformat is considered a different session,\nand\n\n447\n00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.980\nthis helps us to separate all of that out.\n\n448\n00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.020\nBut at the same time, it also communicates\nwith whoever the receiver is to say,\n\n449\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.170\nall right, I'm sending this data,\nare you getting that data?\n\n450\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.660\nEverything is actually managed here,\nand then when it's all done it knows.\n\n451\n00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.850\nHey, you're no longer using that.\n\n452\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.080\nLet me go in and\nterminate that connection, so\n\n453\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.480\nthat other data can be\nsent through as well.\n\n454\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.380\nSo this is one of the more\nimportant layers that we also have\n\n455\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.090\nIn the entire thing too.\n\n456\n00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.930\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, did you ever play\na game when you were younger with,\n\n457\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.940\nit's called telephone.\n\n458\n00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.440\nYou have two cans or\ncups with a string attached.\n\n459\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.140\n&gt;&gt; I do remember something like that.\n\n460\n00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.810\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know why,\n\n461\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.180\nbut my brain relates this particular\nlayer with that telephone game.\n\n462\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.366\nWe have our logical imports,\n\n463\n00:26:25.366 --> 00:26:30.320\nin-points or ports like you give\nthe analogy if we were using SMTP.\n\n464\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.070\nSo let's say port 25, so\nI pick up my tin can,\n\n465\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.770\nport 25 with my string attached and\nyou're over there on port 25 as well.\n\n466\n00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.820\nI don't know if that helps\nany of you out there but\n\n467\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.170\nthat's kind of how I Think a bit of fun.\n\n468\n00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the session layer does use what\nwe call different ports to help us to\n\n469\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.090\nmaintain and\nestablish that we are communicating\n\n470\n00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.690\non the same message about\nthe same things on both sides.\n\n471\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:57.110\nWithout those particular types of ports\nand a port is a logical connection.\n\n472\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.020\nIf Cherokee is speaking on port 25,\nwell on my end,\n\n473\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.550\nI have to be listening on port 25\nto hear what Cherokee's saying.\n\n474\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.030\nIf not, well, we don't really communicate.\n\n475\n00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.740\nSo the session layer,\nbecause it does manage and terminate and\n\n476\n00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.000\nestablish that communication\nbetween both sides.\n\n477\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.100\nPresentation or excuse me,\nthe session layer is dependent upon those\n\n478\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.920\nports to make sure that that ends up\nhappening, And working for us together.\n\n479\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.400\nSo very important that we understand that\nand then down here at the bottom of my\n\n480\n00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.630\nscreen, you'll also will end up seeing\nthat they added in another layer header.\n\n481\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.150\nSo now when we start to take a look\nat all of this information and\n\n482\n00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:39.470\nthis data together, you'll now see that\nthere's multiple layers, or excuse me.\n\n483\n00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.951\nMultiple headers that we're\nadding on top of this data.\n\n484\n00:27:42.951 --> 00:27:48.038\nSo this is data that has not yet left\nthe computer as well and now we've already\n\n485\n00:27:48.038 --> 00:27:53.270\ngotten at least this much data and\nwe've got a little bit more to go as well.\n\n486\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n487\n00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.890\nFortunately we were able to be\nintroduced to the OSI model and\n\n488\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.150\nlook at three of the seven layers.\n\n489\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.930\nStay tuned, we have five more left or\nexcuse me, [LAUGH].\n\n490\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:08.828\n&gt;&gt; Start all over.\n\n491\n00:28:08.828 --> 00:28:13.008\n[LAUGH] She's not gonna be happy\nwith that, start all over, okay.\n\n492\n00:28:13.008 --> 00:28:13.891\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n493\n00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.620\nWell, that about does it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n494\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.190\nFortunately, we were able to\nintroduce you to the OSI model and\n\n495\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.420\nwe were able to examine\nthree of the layers.\n\n496\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.490\nStay tuned,\nwe still have four more layers to go.\n\n497\n00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.600\nSo grab your popcorn.\n\n498\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.190\nBut for this episode we're gonna sign off.\n\n499\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.600\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n500\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n501\n00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.660\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n502\n00:28:37.660 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:08.505\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:12.236\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals show.\n\n6\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.160\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.650\nIf you been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.590\nwe already have taken a look at\nthe begetting portion of the OSI model.\n\n9\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640\nIn the last episode, we were able to look\nat three layers, but we're gonna go ahead,\n\n10\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.640\nand continue, and look at a couple\ndifferent models in this episode as well.\n\n11\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900\nWith us today we have Ronnie Wong in\nstudio to explain the different layers.\n\n12\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.380\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on to take a look at, well,\n\n14\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.720\nmore of the networking fundamentals\nthat we really have to have on hand\n\n15\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.900\nbefore we go on and\ntackle the idea of any type of cyber ops\n\n16\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.550\nthat we're going to be facing for\nthe CCNA cyber ops here.\n\n17\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.040\nSo the great thing is, since we've already\ntaken a look at the first three layers of\n\n18\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.050\nthe OSI model, it means we can pick up\nwith layer four, which is a transport\n\n19\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.340\nlayer, to help us understand this\na little bit better as well.\n\n20\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.970\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.880\ntake a look at my machine as we\ncontinue to move forward here, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.670\nSo here it is in our 4th layer\nas we continue to go down\n\n23\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.100\nthrough these different layers.\n\n24\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.740\nRemember that these first\n3 layers right here,\n\n25\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.720\nsometimes you might hear\nthe term application block.\n\n26\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.310\nAnd all that really means is that\nthe computer is preparing the data\n\n27\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.680\nto be networked.\n\n28\n00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.980\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n29\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.840\nBut then beginning in Layer 4, going\nall the way down through the end here,\n\n30\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.300\nthrough the Data Link layer, and\nreally even the Physical layer,\n\n31\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.550\nwe are preparing the data for\nnetwork delivery.\n\n32\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.370\nSo that is a difference, right?\n\n33\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.750\nOne is saying, hey, I need to get\nready for the network, itself.\n\n34\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.930\nAnd then the other one is saying,\n\n35\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.640\nI need to get ready to be\ntransmitted over the network.\n\n36\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.659\nSo it's right here at the Transport layer\nthat we begin that transition at Layer 4.\n\n37\n00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.200\nAnd this is what happens.\n\n38\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.480\nAt the very beginning of the OSI model,\nthey really only chose one big protocol.\n\n39\n00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.060\nAnd that protocol was called TCP, which\nis the transmission control protocol.\n\n40\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.720\nThis particular protocol goes ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.620\nestablishes what we call flow control,\nerror checking, and recovery.\n\n42\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.746\nAnd it implements the idea of\nreliable data transport service.\n\n43\n00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:20.890\nNow what is that about?\n\n44\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.610\nWhat this allows us to do,\nbefore any data is actually transmitted,\n\n45\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.730\nright, is that we will establish\nthe communication first.\n\n46\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.990\nIn other words, we'll actually talk\nto the other machine first and\n\n47\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.110\nask if they are ready for\ntransmission of the data to be sent.\n\n48\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.600\nIf I get an okay and everything's good,\nthen we'll start sending the data.\n\n49\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.100\nBut if I don't get a response, if I don't\nget a message that says everything is\n\n50\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.360\ngood, then we won't\ntransmit any data at all.\n\n51\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.420\nThereby, we won't lose any\ndata in that transmission too.\n\n52\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.440\nSo that was the very beginning of TCP.\n\n53\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.820\nNow the issue with TCP is fairly simple.\n\n54\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.280\nWhen you start to take a look at this,\nthat means that every data that\n\n55\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.440\nmay get lost along the way, we have\nalso what we call error correction.\n\n56\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.640\nSo it could be where it says,\n\n57\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.930\nhey, on the receiving computer,\nI didn't get that piece of data.\n\n58\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.090\nYou gave me the first piece, you gave me a\nthird piece, I'm missing the second piece.\n\n59\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.357\nWell, that means that that machine has\nto send the message back to the sending\n\n60\n00:03:20.357 --> 00:03:20.872\ncomputer.\n\n61\n00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:25.306\nAnd say, I need the second piece of data,\nplease retransmit that for\n\n62\n00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:28.720\nus to be able to have\nall the data together.\n\n63\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.390\nAnd as much as it actually sounds\nlike something great and good,\n\n64\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.630\nit can really slow down a network with\nall the different types of data going on.\n\n65\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.820\nThere are some types of data that don't\nneed that amount of inflexibility,\n\n66\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.700\nthat doesn't need that\nestablished connection to happen.\n\n67\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.240\nSo a little bit later on,\nof course, they started adopting and\n\n68\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.440\nthen standardizing the idea of UDP,\nwhich is user data grand protocol.\n\n69\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.320\nThat says, hey,\nall I need to do is send the data.\n\n70\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.880\nIf the other side gets it\nthe other side gets it.\n\n71\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.576\nAnd so the early terms of what we\ncall unreliable data transmission.\n\n72\n00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.720\nAnd that sounded kind of flaky,\nand they didn't mean flaky.\n\n73\n00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.630\nWhat they said is it means we're\nnot establishing a connection.\n\n74\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.650\nWe're not saying that communications has\nalready happened between the machine.\n\n75\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.127\nOnce I get a request, I'm just gonna\nsend it, that's all I'm gonna do.\n\n76\n00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:21.150\nSo as soon as I hear initial request,\nthat means I'm ready to transmit.\n\n77\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.390\nSo I'll just go ahead and\nstart transmitting.\n\n78\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.050\nAnd as long as nobody stops me,\n\n79\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.540\nI'm gonna continue to transmit\nas fast as I can do so.\n\n80\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.310\nSo that way it doesn't matter\nif the other side says stop.\n\n81\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.710\nI'm just gonna transmit.\n\n82\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.110\nIt just says, look,\nthis is the way it's gonna be.\n\n83\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo later on, that's what's\nactually it included in here.\n\n84\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.290\nSo TCP and UDP are kinda\nthe two primary protocols that\n\n85\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.010\nwe tend to see at this Transport layer.\n\n86\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.260\nAnd it is very important that we\nunderstand that because this is where we\n\n87\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.820\nare starting to move that idea of all of\nthe data here into what we call a segment.\n\n88\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.330\nJust like what we had mentioned\nin the previous episode.\n\n89\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.588\nA segment of data is now measurable and\nsomething that we can now say, hey,\n\n90\n00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:08.978\nthis is now something that we\ncan deliver to the other side.\n\n91\n00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:11.890\nThe other side can see\nthis as an entire unit.\n\n92\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.480\nWhereas before, we can talk\nabout the idea of data, itself.\n\n93\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.140\nBut at this point, it is now ready to\nactually be packaged a little bit further\n\n94\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.820\nnow that we have a chunk of data.\n\n95\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.060\nThat's what I normally call it.\n\n96\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.400\nBut it's technically called a segment\nis what we're talking about.\n\n97\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.840\nSo once we get that established in\nthe way that we want to, that, of course,\n\n98\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.590\nadds in another layer here.\n\n99\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.980\nAnd now notice that our data is now\nhaving a lot of different headers\n\n100\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.120\nadded in before it's actually\ntransmitted across the network.\n\n101\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.060\nSo there is a ton of information\n\n102\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.730\nthat we're starting to stack on top of\neverything that needs to be sent, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.510\nSo now that we have all of\nthe data there and available,\n\n104\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.120\nwhat does the Transport\nlayer really doing?\n\n105\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.450\nIt's chopping up all of the data that\nI need to send to the other side\n\n106\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.980\ninto what will fit on the network,\n\n107\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.130\nitself, according to the way that\nnetwork protocols are set up.\n\n108\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.084\nSo for example,\n\n109\n00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:13.550\nif you've ever sent a package anywhere-\n&gt;&gt; Amazon shopping.\n\n110\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.461\n&gt;&gt; Amazon shopping,\nyeah, that's a good one.\n\n111\n00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:17.070\n&gt;&gt; And they give you an option now.\n\n112\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.506\nIf you want all of your items to be saved\nuntil they're all ready to be shipped out,\n\n113\n00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.850\nor let's say order four items and\ntwo are ready to be shipped,\n\n114\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.572\nthey can break it up into\nseparate packages, so.\n\n115\n00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:30.810\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and the Transport layer\nhelps us do that, that's very good.\n\n116\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.800\nThe other one of course,\n\n117\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.450\nis the limitations that we\nhave due to networking.\n\n118\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.150\nSo for example, if you try and\n\n119\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.850\nship something,\nI think UPS I think is it went last time.\n\n120\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.500\nDon't quote me on this cuz\nit's been like 15 years\n\n121\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.650\nsince I've actually shipped anything UPS.\n\n122\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.710\nBut it used to be where 45 pounds is the\nmax that they would ship in a single box.\n\n123\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.280\nSo you had 90 pounds of stuff, you had to\nseparate that out in two different boxes\n\n124\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.730\ncuz they didn't allow you to actually\nput everything in one box, right?\n\n125\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.010\nSo you had to kinda break it up.\n\n126\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.750\nWell, the Transport layer does that.\n\n127\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.080\nAll the data that, actually,\nwere ready to send,\n\n128\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.090\nit may not fit very neatly into what\nwe think is gonna go on to network.\n\n129\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.780\nNetwork says,\nI'm not taking all that data at one time.\n\n130\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.140\nSo the Transport layer says,\nlet me break it up here.\n\n131\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.593\nAnd when it breaks it up, it can put\nsequencing numbers on each of the packages\n\n132\n00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:22.260\nso it knows that when it arrives on\nthe other side what's gonna happen.\n\n133\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.915\nAnd just like what Cherokee was saying\nwith Amazon, it was actually [CROSSTALK]\n\n134\n00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:28.036\n&gt;&gt; Package one of four or whatever and\n\n135\n00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:29.945\nthen what order to put them in.\n\n136\n00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:34.631\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it gives you that ability\nto have all the packages arrive.\n\n137\n00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:36.746\nIt doesn't matter, at least for packages,\n\n138\n00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:39.230\nit doesn't matter what\norder that they arrived in.\n\n139\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.070\nThey can be put back together in\nthe order that they're supposed to.\n\n140\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.680\nMost of the time, because networks are so\nfast, whatever the first one is,\n\n141\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.580\nit's gonna get there first.\n\n142\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.930\nWhatever the second one is,\nit's gonna get there second.\n\n143\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.945\nUsually you don't have packets that\nwill take all different routes.\n\n144\n00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.767\nOnce they've established a good route,\n\n145\n00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:56.276\nthey'll actually all take\nthe same route that they can.\n\n146\n00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:59.664\nBut that's what the transport\nlayer really helps us to do,\n\n147\n00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:04.224\nis ensure that we have that type of Of\neverything that's ready for the network.\n\n148\n00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:06.027\nSo that's what the transport layer does.\n\n149\n00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:09.596\nIt measures it, says this is actually good\nfor the network or this is not good for\n\n150\n00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:10.630\nthe network.\n\n151\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.670\nAnd says whether or not it needs\na connection over to the other side or\n\n152\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.260\nwhether we can send it because\nwe received a request for it.\n\n153\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.117\nTransport layer helps\nus in that situation.\n\n154\n00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:21.136\n&gt;&gt; Or if we're using like multiplexing,\n\n155\n00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:25.160\nit could also act kind of like as\ntraffic control at this portion as well.\n\n156\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the idea of what\nwith things like flow control, too.\n\n157\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.930\nBecause it doesn't allow us to send more\ndata than what the receiver can handle if\n\n158\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.650\nwe're using TCP.\n\n159\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.510\nUDP though, we can actually flood\nthe entire network using UDP.\n\n160\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.346\nBut overall though, with TCP you really\ncan't actually flood the network, or\n\n161\n00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:48.008\nthat device at least, cuz they can send\ndifferent types of messages and say,\n\n162\n00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:50.321\nslow down I can take only so much data.\n\n163\n00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.906\nAnd it can do that idea of flow\ncontrol and error checking,\n\n164\n00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:57.780\nand even recover from the idea of last or\nof losing packets.\n\n165\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.400\nI couldn't remember what I was gonna say.\n\n166\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.150\nError checking is a big one that\nalso happens here at this layer.\n\n167\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.440\nAnd that is because when you actually\naccept the data, it has a way to be able\n\n168\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.140\nto check whether or not this is the same\ndata that left the original computer too.\n\n169\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.060\nSo it gives us that ability to do that.\n\n170\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.480\n&gt;&gt; So you might hear like message\nacknowledgement happening here?\n\n171\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just says I got\nthe other side, I really did get it.\n\n172\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.890\nAnd then it can also do the idea\nof checking of whether or not,\n\n173\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.369\nis this the package that we\nreally think it is, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.830\nNow, of course that means we need to\nmove on down through to our layer three,\n\n175\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.450\nwhich is also known as networking.\n\n176\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.840\nThere's my poor judgement in\ntaking different colors and\n\n177\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.260\nnot matching them up very well or\ncontrasting them.\n\n178\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.298\nThis is what we call the network layer.\n\n179\n00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:51.155\nNetwork layer, or layer three or\n\n180\n00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:54.920\nthe OSI model gives us a couple\nof different things, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.360\nIt allows us to be able to address the\npackages or each of the segments, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.960\nAnd the idea of addressing\nmeans we put a source address,\n\n183\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.910\nwe put a destination address on it,\njust as if you were sending\n\n184\n00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.210\nan envelope to somebody over\nto the United Postal Service.\n\n185\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.430\nYou put a source address, you put\na destination address on the packaging.\n\n186\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.190\nThe network layer helps us to do that.\n\n187\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.300\nSays hey, here's where the package is\ngoing, here's where the package is coming\n\n188\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.950\nfrom or the data is coming from or\nthe segment is coming from.\n\n189\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.320\nAnd at that point it's changed\ninto what we call, of course,\n\n190\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.860\na packet of information then.\n\n191\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.280\nIt also provides for\nus that ability to do routing,\n\n192\n00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.250\nbecause it implements different\nrouting protocols and addressing.\n\n193\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.068\nSo not only can we put the addressing\non each of the packets, but\n\n194\n00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:45.640\nwe can then use that\naddressing to do routing.\n\n195\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.350\nRouting allows us to be able to\nsend out to a network that I am\n\n196\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.410\nnot directly connected to and had\narrived at its proper destination, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.560\nSo networking is a very big part of it and\n\n198\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.680\nprobably the most important\nprotocol that we use today.\n\n199\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.370\nBecause if this is wrong,\n\n200\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.420\nit's not gonna ever get to where\nits destination is gonna be.\n\n201\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.032\nAnd so this is where you start to see,\n\n202\n00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:09.112\nlet me see if I can move this down where\nwe can see that a little bit more.\n\n203\n00:11:09.112 --> 00:11:16.510\nSo the result is notice once again,\nmore layers and more headers, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.810\nSo now notice this is getting\nreally big at this point.\n\n205\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.008\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And it is.\n\n206\n00:11:21.008 --> 00:11:25.190\nEverything that you said is not\na very small amount of data, right.\n\n207\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.700\nSo it could be that your data\nis tiny like what I have here.\n\n208\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.583\nBut each of these headers really\nactually has a certain amount of data\n\n209\n00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:37.554\nthat is sent along with it\nthat has to be used too, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:37.554 --> 00:11:45.760\nNow, now that we have this idea of\na destination address, this is key.\n\n211\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.980\nBecause if the Segment, or\n\n212\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.900\nif the packets that we send are not on\nthe same network, this is what it's gonna\n\n213\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.240\nuse to help us to forward the data along\nthe path to the network that it's on.\n\n214\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.570\nBut we also have to realize that my\nmachine is not directly connected\n\n215\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.880\nto a network in which the destination\nis connected to as well.\n\n216\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.600\nSo that means the data has to move\nfrom one device, to another device,\n\n217\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.340\nto another device.\n\n218\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.592\n&gt;&gt; There may be multiple in between.\n\n219\n00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:18.920\n&gt;&gt; There may be, and so\nthat's what we have to deal with.\n\n220\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.940\nAnd layer 2, is what helps us to do that,\nwhich is the data link layer.\n\n221\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Let's, could we just go back for\none second?\n\n222\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.130\n&gt;&gt; Mm- hm.\nSure thing.\n\n223\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.700\n&gt;&gt; I want to just recap.\n\n224\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.940\nYou did emphasize this, but I'm going to\nsay it one more time, because it's just so\n\n225\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.000\nimportant.\n\n226\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.611\nAt layer 3, all right, so just to recap\nhere guys, we've got layer 3, Routing.\n\n227\n00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:37.110\nRouting happens at layer three here.\n\n228\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.465\nSo if you see any kind of questions you\nmay then be familiar at this point but\n\n229\n00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:44.358\nobviously routers,\nthey utilize layer three.\n\n230\n00:12:44.358 --> 00:12:48.767\nSo you know layer 3 switches,\nany kind of a device that incorporates\n\n231\n00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.198\na routing function would\nbe operating at this layer.\n\n232\n00:12:52.198 --> 00:12:57.190\nAnd when Ronnie said addressing,\nanother really key important thing here,\n\n233\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.948\nalways marry the idea of IP addressing,\nif you're on an IP network here,\n\n234\n00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.130\nwhen we're talking about Layer 3 as well.\n\n235\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.750\nSo we're using IP\naddresses to go ahead and\n\n236\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.010\nget that information to\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n237\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.630\n&gt;&gt; And it really is something\nthat we wanna make sure that we\n\n238\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.880\nmake sure, excuse me.\n\n239\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.128\nThat we get packed down without having\nto worry about it too much, and\n\n240\n00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:20.416\nthat it becomes natural for\n\n241\n00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:21.982\nus to talk about [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n242\n00:13:21.982 --> 00:13:23.770\nlike know it in your sleep at this point.\n\n243\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.310\n&gt;&gt; It really is essential that we can\ndo that, especially for the exams.\n\n244\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.890\nYou don't get a lot of time on Cisco\nexams, and that's the problem.\n\n245\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.060\nIf you haven't taken one before, one of\nthe hints that I can give you right away.\n\n246\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.780\nIs you've got to be willing, at this\npoint, while you have the chance to study,\n\n247\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:46.620\nis to slow down and learn every concept\nthat you can as slowly as you can.\n\n248\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.140\nThen you have to begin to speed up and\nlearn it faster, and\n\n249\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.270\nfaster, and faster,\nuntil it becomes second nature to you.\n\n250\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.990\nThe reason behind that is that on the exam\nyou just will not have time to try and\n\n251\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.280\ndo some of the things you normally do.\n\n252\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.440\nLet me give you a for instance there.\n\n253\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.079\nYou don't have the time to\nevaluate every single answer and\n\n254\n00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:06.622\nsee if it's a great answer or not.\n\n255\n00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:10.110\nYou've got to be able to look at those\nanswers and verify and go, that's close,\n\n256\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.446\nlet me eliminate the two right off the bat\nthat I'm not going to worry about and\n\n257\n00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:14.390\njust look at the two.\n\n258\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.260\nAnd hopefully that those are actually\ntwo that you can concentrate on.\n\n259\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.959\nYou just don't have time to\ndo anything like that, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:26.481\n&gt;&gt; If there's anything that doesn't really\nstick in your head, I know some people and\n\n261\n00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:27.442\nit happens to me.\n\n262\n00:14:27.442 --> 00:14:31.246\nSometimes there are a couple different\ntopics that might not just be so\n\n263\n00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.629\nnatural to you,\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n264\n00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:37.430\nwrite them down as a note right\nbefore you start the exam.\n\n265\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.967\nFor instance,\nwhen you look at the different layers,\n\n266\n00:14:39.967 --> 00:14:42.575\nthe numerical versus the title,\nsomething like that.\n\n267\n00:14:42.575 --> 00:14:45.841\nSo that you don't waste the extra time or\nsomething like if you're\n\n268\n00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:49.356\nutilizing the delta chart for\nsub netting, you can just write it down.\n\n269\n00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:51.718\nSo if it for some reason it\ndoesn't stick in your brain,\n\n270\n00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:55.680\nyou do have it a reference so\nyou're not wasting this precious moments.\n\n271\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.642\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that,\nthat is kind of a key as well, okay.\n\n272\n00:14:58.642 --> 00:15:02.399\nNow, since we're talking about addressing\nat Layer 3, the network player,\n\n273\n00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.317\nwe talked about the idea of addressing.\n\n274\n00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:08.950\nHow important that is for the end to\nend delivery of our data packets.\n\n275\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.690\nBut then, we also mention that the very\nfact is that there could be multiple\n\n276\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:18.150\ndevices in between where I'm sending\nfrom and my destination, as well.\n\n277\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.058\nSo that means that I have to be able\nto put data on to a network and\n\n278\n00:15:22.058 --> 00:15:26.644\nhave some way that that data can be\ntransmitted from one device to the next\n\n279\n00:15:26.644 --> 00:15:31.255\ndevice, to the next device, and\nultimately to it's destination too.\n\n280\n00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:37.090\nIf I do not have that ability, as much as\nthat data packet has where it's going.\n\n281\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.357\nIt is the same as if I addressed a letter\nto Cherokee and I went ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:45.419\nput everything on there and\njust left it sitting right on my desk.\n\n283\n00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:48.210\nEven if I have a stamp on it,\nit's just like that.\n\n284\n00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.610\nIt's like,\nI do not know how that's gonna get there.\n\n285\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:55.127\nIf it's sitting on my desk, it's never\ngoing to arrive at that destination.\n\n286\n00:15:55.127 --> 00:15:58.738\nSo at some point we need\nto also prepare for what?\n\n287\n00:15:58.738 --> 00:16:03.009\nFor it's delivery on the network\nthat it's going to be put on And\n\n288\n00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:07.374\nin networking, it is sending it\nfrom device to device to device.\n\n289\n00:16:07.374 --> 00:16:10.320\nAnd that's what the data\nlink layer helps us to do.\n\n290\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.630\nIt helps us do what we call reliable\ntransport from device to device.\n\n291\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.340\nNow if you're not getting this image and\n\n292\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.100\nthis picture, go ahead and\nfollow the logic with me right now.\n\n293\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.493\nOn my laptop right now,\n\n294\n00:16:21.493 --> 00:16:26.173\nif I were to send something over to\nanother network just somewhere else, okay.\n\n295\n00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:28.030\nAnd leave my machine, and\n\n296\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.258\neven if the network is not in\nmy same physical network here.\n\n297\n00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.390\nIt would then go out to the default\ngateway, which is a router or\n\n298\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.170\na firewall at that point.\n\n299\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.730\nFrom that router or firewall,\n\n300\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.450\nit would then have to be\ndelivered through an ISP's router.\n\n301\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.460\nAnd then from the ISP's router,\nit would be delivered out onto\n\n302\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.900\nan Internet router somewhere and\nwho knows how many routers in between.\n\n303\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.200\nLet's say four or five.\n\n304\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.840\nBut each way along the path until\nit gets to the destination network.\n\n305\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.060\nSo it is at layer two or\nthe data link layer that allows us to\n\n306\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.030\nmove the data along the path\nto its destination.\n\n307\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.119\nWithout the layer two information,\nwe cannot move the data.\n\n308\n00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.800\nWe can look at it and go, I know that\nthis is going to this IP address.\n\n309\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.870\nBut I cannot move\nthe data if I do not know\n\n310\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.580\nthose devices in terms\nof their addressing.\n\n311\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.574\nWhich is what we call a MAC address or\na BIA or burned in address.\n\n312\n00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:29.440\n&gt;&gt; So, with your analogy there let's say,\nyou did want to send a message to me.\n\n313\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.405\nAnd I was on your same network,\nor same sub net segment there.\n\n314\n00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:38.960\nYou're saying I wouldn't even need\nan IP for that communication at that\n\n315\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.030\nparticular level, but only until I\nwere to leave that particular network.\n\n316\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.120\nThat's when I switch over.\n\n317\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of a little bit hairier\nthan what we think it is right now.\n\n318\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.780\nWe really don't need to use IP addresses,\n\n319\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.100\ntechnically, if we're only sending\ndata from one machine to another one.\n\n320\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.646\nThe problem that we have,\nthough, Cherokee, is this,\n\n321\n00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:02.627\nis that we normally just don't\nsend data from machine to machine.\n\n322\n00:18:02.627 --> 00:18:06.801\nWe normally send data from, well,\nan application on my machine,\n\n323\n00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:09.045\nto an application on your machine.\n\n324\n00:18:09.045 --> 00:18:13.132\nAnd the weird thing is, the applications,\nwhen you program them in,\n\n325\n00:18:13.132 --> 00:18:18.260\nthey don't go, I'm gonna actually just\nlook at the Mac address to do so.\n\n326\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.760\nWhat it normally does is it\nlooks at your IP address.\n\n327\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n328\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.270\n&gt;&gt; So in that sense that even\nthough we technically don't need\n\n329\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:30.400\nan IP address on our machines to do so,\nthat we're on the same physical network.\n\n330\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.552\nIt still does because it's the application\nthat's sending- [CROSSTALK]\n\n331\n00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:34.525\n&gt;&gt; How it was coded yeah.\n\n332\n00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:37.416\n&gt;&gt; And so that's why most people get\nconfused when we start talking about\n\n333\n00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.300\nit because.\n\n334\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.997\nWe can talk about in fundamental\nnetworking contents.\n\n335\n00:18:40.997 --> 00:18:44.331\nAnd yeah, if we do not send in anything\noff of our network, we don't need\n\n336\n00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:48.450\nIP addresses, but because we prolong an\noperating system that has an IP address.\n\n337\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.610\nBecause we have applications that go,\nyeah,\n\n338\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.700\nif I'm sending this over to Cherokee,\n\n339\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.770\nI do need to know where that IP address\nis going and need to be able to do that.\n\n340\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.700\nSo it is weird that technically\nwe don't need it, but we\n\n341\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.740\ndo need it because everything else that we\ndo in networking relies on the IP address.\n\n342\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.160\nSo it has changed over time in\nthe way that we would do things now.\n\n343\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.930\nSo it is kind of neat in that now.\n\n344\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.400\nThere's another another things\nthat I've also put down here,\n\n345\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.090\nlet me zoom in just for a moment.\n\n346\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:19.610\nWhich is on this LLC and\nthis idea of the MAC Layer 2.\n\n347\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.920\nSo the downlink layer is now, for\n\n348\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.540\n20 years plus now, is technically\ndivided into two sub layers.\n\n349\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.250\nAn LLC,\nwhich is a Logical Link Connection.\n\n350\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.700\nAnd then the MAC, which of course\nis the Media Address Connector.\n\n351\n00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.460\nOr, I can't remember actually\nwhat it stands for for right now.\n\n352\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.848\nBut what's the whole idea?\n\n353\n00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:41.839\n&gt;&gt; The access control.\n&gt;&gt; Access control.\n\n354\n00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:45.070\nSee, I should know that, but I didn't.\n\n355\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.310\nManages communication\nwithin a single link.\n\n356\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.686\nNow what is that about?\n\n357\n00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:51.774\nThat is the idea of taking\nthat MAC address and\n\n358\n00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.850\nessentially linking it to the IP address.\n\n359\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.070\nThat's what its doing.\n\n360\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.100\nIt's actually saying I have\nthe MAC address, I had the idea\n\n361\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.820\nof actually managing communication, and\ncommunications are normally done over IP.\n\n362\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.870\nSo it knows exactly what machine to send\nit to, even though we only have maybe\n\n363\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.750\nan IP address on the other end,\nit says hey, that's me, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.668\nWhen you actually send that,\n\n365\n00:20:14.668 --> 00:20:18.971\nthe logical link layer is telling\nthat application, that's me.\n\n366\n00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:21.788\nI know you're talking about\nan IP address Ronnie.\n\n367\n00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:27.850\nBut no, when you do it, that actually\nlinks to my NIC, so send it on here, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:33.080\nThe other one of course is this,\nit defines the MAC address itself.\n\n369\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.614\nSo every single NIC that's out there of\ncourse gets that MAC because it's actually\n\n370\n00:20:37.614 --> 00:20:41.836\nburned in at the factory and we actually\nuse that for identification as well.\n\n371\n00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:44.580\nSo it is at the data link layer and so\n\n372\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.564\nNICs, okay,\nNetwork Interface Cards operate.\n\n373\n00:20:48.564 --> 00:20:52.830\nAnd this is the key, okay, operate or\nas functional on layer two.\n\n374\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.790\nThe reason why that's actually important\nis because there are devices and there\n\n375\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:04.130\nare physical components to the MAC itself,\nor to the NIC Itself such as the port.\n\n376\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.820\nAnd there are pens on the port\nthat are on layer one.\n\n377\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.080\n&gt;&gt; Like the transceiver chip.\n\n378\n00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.184\n&gt;&gt; Like the transceiver chip, right.\n\n379\n00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:09.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n380\n00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:14.260\nthere's a lot of that where you start\nto take a look and it gets confusing,\n\n381\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.848\nlike which of these actually is\na NIC on layer one or layer two?\n\n382\n00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:22.140\nI's on both, but\nfunctionally it works on layer two.\n\n383\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.483\nPhysically it connects in that layer one,\nso\n\n384\n00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:27.083\nthat makes it kind of\na weird device under itself.\n\n385\n00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.225\nSomebody that you mash your point out.\n\n386\n00:21:28.225 --> 00:21:31.450\nSo, again some things\nwe have to worry about.\n\n387\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.800\nRemember that Cherokee,\n\n388\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.760\nemphasize the idea on the network layer\nof routers being on that work layer.\n\n389\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.140\nHere at layer two, it would be\nthe NIC would actually be here,\n\n390\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.040\nswitches would also be here at layer\ntwo because it uses that MAC address\n\n391\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.164\nto help identify where data\nis actually going, as well.\n\n392\n00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:49.270\nAnd then you have now the physical layer.\n\n393\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.131\nNow, the physical layer itself,\nlet me make sure we can see this,\n\n394\n00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:57.901\ncuz I didn't change it, and\nI should've changed it, but I didn't.\n\n395\n00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:00.270\nAt the physical layer,\nyou'll notice something here.\n\n396\n00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.685\nAnd I didn't point out the idea of the\nresult which is adding in another header.\n\n397\n00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:09.210\nBut at layer two,\nwe also add that layer two header.\n\n398\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.050\nBu the physical layer doesn't actually\nhave a header that it needs to.\n\n399\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.300\nNow the other thing that I needed to do\nat layer two which I didn't emphasize,\n\n400\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.590\nis also at layer two,\nthere is one more thing.\n\n401\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.230\nLet me see if I can put it down here,\nthere is also a footer.\n\n402\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.020\nOops, I copied the whole thing,\nlet me delete that out there.\n\n403\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.170\nI was just trying to copy one thing.\n\n404\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.560\nThere is also a layer two footer.\n\n405\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.800\nSo this is the only one that really\ndoes do that encapsulation here.\n\n406\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.010\n&gt;&gt; RCRC?\n\n407\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.199\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and this is for the idea what\nwe call a cyclic redundancy check\n\n408\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.050\n&gt;&gt; And sometime's you'll also see, yeah,\n\n409\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:55.140\nthey use a different acronym, sometimes\nCRC or FCS for Frame Check Sequence.\n\n410\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.130\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's probably the actual correct one,\n\n411\n00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.250\nframe check sequence,\nis the one that we see.\n\n412\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.709\nAnd let me see if I can move that.\n\n413\n00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.560\nAll right, there we go, okay.\n\n414\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.760\nSo, this is what you have at layer two,\n\n415\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.380\nit's the only one that really has\na trailer that encapsulates everything.\n\n416\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.540\nAnd this is key because\nthe encapsulation now means that,\n\n417\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.480\nthat data is ready to be\nput out onto the network.\n\n418\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.600\nAnd so, at the physical layer,\nthis is what is said of it.\n\n419\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.660\nI established the data path going to and\nfrom this machine.\n\n420\n00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.810\nAnd it includes everything.\n\n421\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.430\nVoltage, transmission distances,\nconnectors, and\n\n422\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.960\nall of the actual technology involved\nis normally categorized into WAN or\n\n423\n00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960\nLAN technologies, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.202\nSo this is where we do not have any\nadditional data, let me kind of\n\n425\n00:23:40.202 --> 00:23:44.077\nget rid of that one and- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And we're not seeing any kind\n\n426\n00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:48.210\nof intelligent decisions being made\nat this layer, either, right Ronnie?\n\n427\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.510\nIt's just electrical impulses, basically.\n\n428\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.514\n&gt;&gt; That's all it is,\nis bits is what we call them.\n\n429\n00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:56.779\nBeing able to send ones and zeros is\npretty much what are we doing here.\n\n430\n00:23:56.779 --> 00:24:01.710\nSo this is what is transmitted\non the actual network itself in\n\n431\n00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.138\nwhat needs to happen, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:04.138 --> 00:24:08.657\nNow once you have this, this is where data\ncan be put onto the wire, and it can then\n\n433\n00:24:08.657 --> 00:24:13.400\ngo across the entire wire, and here's\nthe result that we would normally get.\n\n434\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.660\nSo we take a look at this full\nscreen just for a moment,\n\n435\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.170\nit will help us out, to make sure\nthat we understand what's happening.\n\n436\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.877\nWhen we first send data, remember we\nare gonna be encapsulating the data, and\n\n437\n00:24:22.877 --> 00:24:24.740\nthis is where we're adding layers on.\n\n438\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.492\nAnd once we start adding the layers on,\nthat means that the physical layer,\n\n439\n00:24:29.492 --> 00:24:30.690\nwe transmit that.\n\n440\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.910\nIt can go over any of\nthe media that we have,\n\n441\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.650\nwhether it's actually on the same network,\n\n442\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.320\nwhether we're going across a router,\nwhether we're going across the internet,\n\n443\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.700\nit will then be sent using the information\nthat it finds inside of that frame.\n\n444\n00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.530\nWhen it arrives at the receiving computer,\n\n445\n00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.560\nthis is where we'll begin\nthe process of decapsulation.\n\n446\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.530\nDecapsulation means each of those headers\nis essentially going to be removed\n\n447\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.420\nas it starts moving up that computer.\n\n448\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.320\nSo, if we go back to this right here,\nas the actual\n\n449\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.210\ncomputer is receiving it, it will\nfirst look at the Layer 2 information.\n\n450\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.300\nIf the Layer 2 information, in other words\nif this is the destination MAC address,\n\n451\n00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.820\nit will essentially remove that, and\n\n452\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.340\nit would check that frame\nto help us out to do this.\n\n453\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.690\nSame thing as it continues to move up and\nthrough the actual layers again, it will\n\n454\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.480\nverify and see if that address is actually\nthe address that it's supposed to be.\n\n455\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.780\nThe other thing that we'll also end\nup seeing then, is it will verify and\n\n456\n00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.398\ncheck at Layer 4, and if everything is\ngood, then it will continue to process\n\n457\n00:25:39.398 --> 00:25:44.020\nLayer 4 information, and\nthen of course Layer 5.\n\n458\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:49.320\nOnce it gets to Layer 4 and Layer 5,\nit knows it's on the right machine.\n\n459\n00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.160\nFrom this point on,\nit is just checking for errors.\n\n460\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.600\nIt is just checking to see if\nthe rest of the data can be read,\n\n461\n00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.540\nand that's where we have Layer 6.\n\n462\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.610\nAnd then finally, it gets to that\npoint where we are now sending it on\n\n463\n00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:06.750\nto the application, that the format says\nthe application is supposed to open.\n\n464\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.760\nAnd once you open it, you should now\nbe able to read the data on your end,\n\n465\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.420\nwhen you get through\nthe entire process here,\n\n466\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.970\non the end-to-end side of\neverything that goes on.\n\n467\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.083\nSo, every time that you're sending data,\nit has to go through this process.\n\n468\n00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:24.398\nIt sounds long-\n&gt;&gt; You know what it kind of looks like?\n\n469\n00:26:24.398 --> 00:26:26.908\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know the exact terminology, but\n\n470\n00:26:26.908 --> 00:26:31.620\nlet's say a spacecraft was entering in our\natmosphere and they kind of break away?\n\n471\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.690\nThat's kind of what's happening here,\nright, with decapsulation.\n\n472\n00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.090\nLet's say we had multiple layers\nof atmosphere, seven layers, and\n\n473\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:41.880\nwe're just going through it and breaking\naway the additional information until\n\n474\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.060\nyou're left with your beautiful little,\nyour data, there at the end.\n\n475\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.260\n&gt;&gt; And that really is kind\nof a key understanding.\n\n476\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.730\nAs you move into the realm of\ncybersecurity and cyber-ops, if you don't\n\n477\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:00.060\nunderstand this process, troubleshooting\nbecomes a lot more difficult.\n\n478\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.360\nThe idea of understanding where\nsecurity breaches becomes a lot\n\n479\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.060\nmore difficult as well.\n\n480\n00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.510\nSo having a solid understanding of the OSI\nmodel, as well as the TCP/IP model,\n\n481\n00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.579\nwhich we're gonna end up talking about\nprobably in another segment here.\n\n482\n00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.140\nWe're actually gonna see that but\nat the same time this is where it begins.\n\n483\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.350\nIt's fundamentals,\nfundamentals, fundamentals.\n\n484\n00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.020\nIf you don't have this concept down,\n\n485\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.100\nmake sure you get this concept down\nbecause it is very important for\n\n486\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.180\neverything else that we build upon from\nthis point on in everything that we do.\n\n487\n00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not really going anywhere.\n\n488\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.370\n&gt;&gt; Nope, it really isn't.\n\n489\n00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.140\nBut just remember that this is\nkind of at least the beginning.\n\n490\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.647\nWe still got a bit more to\ngo on network models though.\n\n491\n00:27:39.647 --> 00:27:41.090\n&gt;&gt; So there you have it.\n\n492\n00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.062\nThose are going to be your fundamentals,\nas Ronnie said, your basics.\n\n493\n00:27:45.062 --> 00:27:50.080\nNow, just some advice I've recommended\nto students before in the past.\n\n494\n00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.970\nI think it's a pretty beneficial or\nhelpful tool, if you go ahead and\n\n495\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.590\nwrite out the stuff in layers.\n\n496\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.050\nAnd as you continue throughout this\nseries and through your studies,\n\n497\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.480\njust kind of write down which devices\nare being utilized at which layer,\n\n498\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.230\nwhich protocol, what they do.\n\n499\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.660\nPut it in your own words,\nbecause it's gonna make it easier for\n\n500\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.800\nyou to understand.\n\n501\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.150\nThe magic of this is that you can\ngo back and rewatch this episode or\n\n502\n00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.450\nthe previous episode if we\nwere a little fast for you.\n\n503\n00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.180\nBut This is something you\nfully need to understand.\n\n504\n00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.970\nI think about that wraps it up for\n\n505\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.060\nthis episode, so\nI'm gonna sign off as your show host.\n\n506\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.440\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n507\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n508\n00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.740\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n509\n00:28:32.649 -->

00:00:07.462\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:10.892\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:16.570\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.410\nIf you've been following along,\nyou know that this is well, a part three,\n\n8\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.440\nwe've made it to a part three\nof describing networking models.\n\n9\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.430\nSo we're going to go ahead and pick back\nup where we left off in the last episode.\n\n10\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.100\nAnd with us today,\nwe have Ronnie Wong in studio.\n\n11\n00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.400\nThank you, Ronnie for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here as\nwe continue on with taking a look at some\n\n13\n00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.340\nof the different networking models.\n\n14\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.850\nWe've already went over the OSI\nmodel in pretty good depth.\n\n15\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.470\nDon't get me wrong,\nthere is a lot more to it, but\n\n16\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.500\nthat should at least get you started.\n\n17\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.540\nAnd if you do have more and\nmore information or\n\n18\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.480\nmore questions, make sure you also\ncheck out some of the other shows that\n\n19\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.050\nwe've done in CCNA routing and\nswitching, and even in CCNA security.\n\n20\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.790\nYou'll probably learn\na little bit more there too.\n\n21\n00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.620\nWe tend to go over it multiple\ntimes during the course of your CC.\n\n22\n00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.960\nActually, anything that's Cisco.\n\n23\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240\nYou'll go over it multiple times.\n\n24\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.730\nSo make sure you check that out.\n\n25\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.470\nThat will actually help.\n\n26\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.070\nNow even though the OSI model is pretty\nmuch the generic model that we use to help\n\n27\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.087\ndescribe the networking concepts,\nthe way that we believe that end-to-end\n\n28\n00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:26.760\ncommunication happens between the sending\ncomputer and receiving computer.\n\n29\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.020\nThat particular model in itself was\nnever any type of commercial success.\n\n30\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.210\nAnd what I mean by that is that\nregardless of what they tried to do\n\n31\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.850\nthey really never had the ability\nto make it implement well.\n\n32\n00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.700\nSo, we use it today because it's\ndescription of the way that\n\n33\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.000\nnetworking works.\n\n34\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.510\nIs probably incredibly descriptive and\nworked very well but it's\n\n35\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.370\nimplementation of it never took off and\ntheres a couple of reasons behind that.\n\n36\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.960\nFirst and foremost the biggest\nreason behind this idea\n\n37\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.070\nis that there were competing models\nthat were already out there.\n\n38\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.970\nThere were of course proprietary\nmodels that existed,\n\n39\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.280\nthere were also of course competing\nmodels that also existed too.\n\n40\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.750\nAnd one of them that came on very fast and\nstrong right after the OSI model got\n\n41\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620\nkicked off is what we\ncall the TCP/IP model.\n\n42\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.940\nAlso, at the very beginning,\nknown as the DoD model of networking.\n\n43\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.140\nThis was a vendor neutral\ntype of model as well.\n\n44\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.340\nDesigned for public networking.\n\n45\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.750\nThe DoD did this under contract.\n\n46\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.560\nSo they actually had contractors do this,\nbut their biggest benefit\n\n47\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.270\nwas the very fact that not only\nthey want it to succeed and work.\n\n48\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.990\nBut they also had well universities and\ndifferent people that came together.\n\n49\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.210\nThat wanted to see this thing succeed and\nwork the way that it needed to.\n\n50\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.180\nAnd if you're talking about\nnetworking model implementation,\n\n51\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.870\nin other words what's really\nhappening on the networks today,\n\n52\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.870\nwe tend to use what is called\nthat TCP/IP model instead.\n\n53\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.320\nSo this is kind of the foundation, and\nthis is where the rubber hits the road\n\n54\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.770\nhere in terms of real networking\nconcepts actually being put to use.\n\n55\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.080\nBut there's a way that we describe\nnetworking is still with the OSI model,\n\n56\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.530\neven though we don't do that anymore.\n\n57\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.120\nAnd the other reason behind the OSI model\n\n58\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.120\nnot really getting a foothold into the\nmarketplace, where as TCP/IP did, is that\n\n59\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.560\nit wasn't very flexible, it wasn't very\nagile in some of the things that it did.\n\n60\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, from my understanding it seems\nlike OSI is more of a way to describe\n\n61\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.810\nlayer and layers where as TCP/IP has\nthat flexibility to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.740\nbe used across public networks\nsuch as the internet.\n\n63\n00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, both of them have that\nopportunity but they really did try\n\n64\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.630\ndescribe that better in terms of\njust LAN in the very beginning.\n\n65\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.580\nBut it's particular failure was\nthe standardization they tended to follow,\n\n66\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.650\nthey didn't they didn't have a problem\nreusing protocols that existed out there\n\n67\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.680\nfor things like TCP, right.\n\n68\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.010\nSo, if you were using FTP if you were\ndoing all they followed it perfectly fine\n\n69\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.140\nbut when it came down to\nthings like IP addressing or\n\n70\n00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.380\nthe addressing they never\nreally specified IP.\n\n71\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.410\nSo, they didn't adopt it right away.\n\n72\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.160\nThey didn't do anything.\n\n73\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.340\nThey kind of, said, well, we don't\nknow what to really, standardize on.\n\n74\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.020\nSo, they had to kind of, made a choice.\n\n75\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.120\nAnd, standardization, especially among\nvendor neutral type standardization\n\n76\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.020\ntakes a ton, a long, long, long time.\n\n77\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.620\nSo, they kind of waited until committees\ncould kind of, come together and\n\n78\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.430\ndecide what was gonna be done.\n\n79\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.920\nBut by that point, you had a fast and\n\n80\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.830\nnimble team behind TCP/IP that said,\nyeah this is what we're gonna do.\n\n81\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.770\nThe IP, we're just gonna stick with that.\n\n82\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.850\nWe're just gonna take that and go.\n\n83\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.940\nThey didn't even ask.\n\n84\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.280\nThey didn't have to kind of wait and\ndo things by committee.\n\n85\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.330\nIt was essentially done and they said,\nhere's what we're gonna use.\n\n86\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.390\nHere's what's gonna happen, we need new\nprotocol for this, let's use this instead.\n\n87\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.870\nAnd they just continued to develop faster,\nso much so\n\n88\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.800\nthat it really left the OSI model\nbehind in terms of implementation.\n\n89\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.130\nSo speed, agility and\n\n90\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.380\nquickness is what led the TCP/IP to be\nreally the model that's implemented.\n\n91\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.621\nWhen you compare and contrast this,\n\n92\n00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:18.650\nthe TCP/IP model is originally four\nlayers compared to the OSI model.\n\n93\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.630\nLet's take a look at my machine, and that\nwill help us to kind of separate us out\n\n94\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.800\nand make sure that we understand the paths\nthat we're taking a look at, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.830\nToday there's actually an updated model,\nand\n\n96\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.570\nthere is an original model that\nyou have to contend with, and\n\n97\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.780\nI say the idea of contending with\nthis model because of this, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.170\nEven though it is updated not everybody\nfollow the updated model, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.250\nSo you tend to see this in most\nof the Cisco types of textbooks\n\n100\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.880\nwhere they just kind of say look.\n\n101\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.990\nHere's these two models,\n\n102\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.870\none's an alternate model, and\none is the original model.\n\n103\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.740\nBut they don't really say,\nyou better stick to this one, or\n\n104\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.390\nthis is the one you should learn.\n\n105\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.310\nSo what does that mean for you?\n\n106\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.740\nYou've gotta know them both.\n\n107\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what it really means,\n\n108\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.230\nyeah, great instead of\nhaving to learn one,\n\n109\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.810\nyou are actually having\nto know both of them.\n\n110\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.340\nThe great thing is they're-\n&gt;&gt; Not too difficult.\n\n111\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Identical, yeah, it's not like\nyou're learning all new seven layers.\n\n112\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.980\nAnd this actually lines up\nvery well with the OSI model.\n\n113\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.990\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n114\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.130\nThat if we take the OSI model and\nwe line it up in that seven layers.\n\n115\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.870\nI'm trying to make sure,\nit's fairly even here.\n\n116\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Close enough, yeah.\n\n117\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n118\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.960\nThat what you'll end up seeing\nis almost the same thing.\n\n119\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.030\nAnd the reason why I wanted to point\nthis out is functionality-wise,\n\n120\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.310\nit works kinda functionally the same way.\n\n121\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.140\nThe very fact is, instead of spending\na lot of time dividing up the application,\n\n122\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.460\npresentation, and session layer,\nthey just said, when you deal with\n\n123\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.440\nthe idea of applications, this is\nthe end user, and this is, of course,\n\n124\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.310\napplications that are getting ready for\nnetworking and that was pretty much key.\n\n125\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.790\nIn other words,\nwe're preparing the data for networking.\n\n126\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure, you've already primed\nus by saying these three upper layers\n\n127\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.870\nare sometimes called the application\nblock and that's essentially what it is.\n\n128\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.180\nThey're so closely intertwined, so hey,\nlet's make things a little easier, right?\n\n129\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's where the theoretical\nnature of this model comes in, right?\n\n130\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.840\nSo even though, the USI says,\nno, we need to separate this out.\n\n131\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.740\nAnd the idea of the layers here\nby the USI model was really key.\n\n132\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.560\nWhat this also meant in the USI model\nis that we could easily replace\n\n133\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.190\npresentation formats.\n\n134\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.860\nAnd it wouldn't affect anything\nup here in the application.\n\n135\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.320\nOr we could actually replace some\ntype of transport protocol and\n\n136\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.890\nit wouldn't affect everything else.\n\n137\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.800\nSame thing with the networking model,\nas well, as far as the addressing.\n\n138\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.000\nYou can replace IP with anything\nelse that you wanted to and\n\n139\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.530\nit wouldn't effect the rest\nof the networking model.\n\n140\n00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.570\nUp here in TCP/IP they just said,\napplication are whatever applications do.\n\n141\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.850\nWe're not really that concerned.\n\n142\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.580\nWe know that it knows how\nto do what it needs to do.\n\n143\n00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.605\nBut notice that the transport layer kind\nof lines up with the transport layer here.\n\n144\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:59.131\nAnd then networking layer,\nthey changed that internetworking layer,\n\n145\n00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:00.919\nor Internet layer instead.\n\n146\n00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:05.768\nAnd then the original idea is that they\ndidn't separate out the data link and\n\n147\n00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:06.770\nthe physical.\n\n148\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.130\nThey just called it network access,\nand Cisco calls it network access.\n\n149\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.640\nSometimes you'll hear\nthe term network interface.\n\n150\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.520\nYou'll hear some other\nterms out there as well.\n\n151\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.411\nYou may even see just the term physical,\nyou name it.\n\n152\n00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:21.210\nThey're all different, but Cisco uses\nthe term network access in this one.\n\n153\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.431\n&gt;&gt; It's just a little more definitive.\n\n154\n00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.794\nIf I were trying to explain a problem\nthat I was experiencing to you,\n\n155\n00:08:25.794 --> 00:08:29.650\nRonnie, I might choose to use something\na little more definitive there.\n\n156\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.829\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's what you end up seeing, so\n\n157\n00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:36.434\nCisco really does tend to\nat least talk about this.\n\n158\n00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:40.161\nBut the way that we describe all\nnetworking, even within Cisco,\n\n159\n00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:44.901\nas much as we implement it along here, is\nthis one that's kinda the one that we use,\n\n160\n00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:49.640\nwhich is, of course, the seven-layer\nOSI model, instead of the four-layer.\n\n161\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.430\nRemember that today, though,\nthis is what, generally,\n\n162\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.890\nthey say is used more often today.\n\n163\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.210\nAnd in Cisco textbooks,\n\n164\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:01.010\nand every place that you read on the Net,\nyou'll see the same thing.\n\n165\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.740\nThe only difference here is that they've\nseparated out the network access layer\n\n166\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.320\ninto the data link and physical.\n\n167\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.510\nI wonder who they got that from.\n\n168\n00:09:08.808 --> 00:09:11.666\nLook at that, the OSI model as well,\nbecause they realized\n\n169\n00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:14.480\nthat the descriptors,\nat this point, were much better.\n\n170\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.208\nAnd the reason why is that\nthis actually accounts for\n\n171\n00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:20.990\nthe change of technology that goes on\nin the world, where the OSI model,\n\n172\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.090\neven though it was really\ndeveloped around the late 70s,\n\n173\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.470\nit can still be used today, in the 21st\ncentury, to describe networking.\n\n174\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.185\nWhereas the network access here, when they\nfirst started doing it, they just thought,\n\n175\n00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:35.565\nwell, we're just connecting things\ntogether, it doesn't matter what it is.\n\n176\n00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:39.449\nBut yet, they did end up dividing it out\nbecause they realized that these two\n\n177\n00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:43.908\nshould be interchangeable, regardless of\nwhatever the physical layer actually is.\n\n178\n00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:48.210\nThe only thing that they do to help\ndefine this a little bit more is gonna\n\n179\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.700\nbe what I have here in the yellow.\n\n180\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.050\nThe data link layer addresses\nthe idea of encapsulation,\n\n181\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:58.270\nwhich we've already seen, and also the\naddressing, such as the MAC addressing.\n\n182\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.141\nAnd then, of course, the physical layer\nis the idea of transmitting bits as well,\n\n183\n00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:05.449\nor signal, if you want to call it that.\n\n184\n00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:09.118\nSo that's kind of the key in\nunderstanding, but overall, though,\n\n185\n00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:11.270\nthe functionality is the same.\n\n186\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.420\nAs data is put out onto network,\n\n187\n00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.080\nit still goes down through the application\nlayer to prepare itself for networking.\n\n188\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.187\nAnd then the delivery preparation\nbegins at the transport layer with\n\n189\n00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:25.461\nthe addressing,\nas well as the routing information.\n\n190\n00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:29.381\nAnd then, of course, how we move\nthe data from device to device, and\n\n191\n00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:31.540\nthen put it onto the network.\n\n192\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.300\nSame thing happens everywhere when\nyou start to contrast that, so\n\n193\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.410\nthere's really not a ton of\ndifferences in functionality.\n\n194\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.750\nBut this description is key in what\nneeds to happen and understand there.\n\n195\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.050\nThe only other thing that I'll\nalso put down here to try and\n\n196\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.715\nhelp you to distinguish them is when\nwe start talking about protocols,\n\n197\n00:10:51.715 --> 00:10:56.710\nright, the OSI model, they did not\nactually use anything that was already\n\n198\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.680\npredefined to say this is\nthe way it's going to be.\n\n199\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.220\nThey started off with\na standardization process.\n\n200\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.803\nAnd then whatever the agreement was for\nstandardization,\n\n201\n00:11:06.803 --> 00:11:11.542\nthat is what they actually put as the\nprotocol itself, but it took a long time.\n\n202\n00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:15.636\nIn the TCP/IP model, they just said,\nwhatever the RFC is for this,\n\n203\n00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:18.570\nwhat we need here, we'll just use that.\n\n204\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.194\nAnd that made it so much easier for\npeople to adopt to it and\n\n205\n00:11:21.194 --> 00:11:24.641\nunderstand the technology than to sit\nthere and have to wait and go, well,\n\n206\n00:11:24.641 --> 00:11:28.033\nwe just haven't standardized that yet,\nand once it gets standardized,\n\n207\n00:11:28.033 --> 00:11:30.580\nwe'll be able to tell\nyou what we really mean.\n\n208\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.010\nBut at this point, this is when\nTCP took over because they were-\n\n209\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.195\n&gt;&gt; It points you back to those RFCs.\n\n210\n00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:39.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because they were able to allow\nyou to use the RFCs that existed to say,\n\n211\n00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:40.883\nthis is how this protocol works.\n\n212\n00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:44.278\nAnd it's easy for\npeople to develop applications and\n\n213\n00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:48.049\nnetworking based off of those\na lot quicker than waiting for\n\n214\n00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:51.684\nsome group to come together and\nstandardize some model.\n\n215\n00:11:51.684 --> 00:11:52.968\nAnd so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n216\n00:11:52.968 --> 00:11:54.819\nall of our software can\nwork on our hardware.\n\n217\n00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:57.451\nAnd the different developers and\n\n218\n00:11:57.451 --> 00:12:01.770\nthe hardware manufacturers,\nthey all have that.\n\n219\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.400\nIt's ensured that they're all\ngonna be working together and\n\n220\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.730\nyou have that compatibility there.\n\n221\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now that means we're kinda\nat the end of describing networking.\n\n222\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.260\nBut I do want to make sure that we kind of\ngo over a couple of different things here,\n\n223\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.050\nokay, so that you can see that this\nactually works the way that we say that it\n\n224\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.690\nworks as well, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.611\nSo one, of course, is so that we can\nunderstand the end-to-end packet\n\n226\n00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:30.257\ndelivery process of what is\ngoing on in our networks.\n\n227\n00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:33.970\nSo let me describe to you what\nyou see here on the screen.\n\n228\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.602\nAnd then we'll walk through it\ntogether in what we see, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:37.602 --> 00:12:41.710\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nyou have a sending machine.\n\n230\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.100\nOver here on the right-hand side,\nyou have a server.\n\n231\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.185\nAll of these addresses are on the top,\nthe IP addresses.\n\n232\n00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:50.791\nThey're all made up, so please don't use\nthese two in the middle if you're actually\n\n233\n00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:53.610\nout there on the Internet,\ncuz they probably belong to somebody.\n\n234\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.760\nSo don't use them, okay, if you're\nconnected directly to the Internet.\n\n235\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.922\n&gt;&gt; I love your disclaimers, Ronnie.\n\n236\n00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to cuz I don't want somebody\n\n237\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.120\nactually putting these IP addresses\nwhen they don't really belong to them,\n\n238\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.520\ncuz they don't belong to me.\n\n239\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.272\nThat's what they count down to, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:10.180\nSo this is what we're going to see.\n\n241\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.150\nI want you to make sure that you\nunderstand what is happening\n\n242\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.180\nalong the packet process here, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.468\nWhat are we starting off with then\nas we start sending the data?\n\n244\n00:13:20.468 --> 00:13:23.627\nOkay, when we start describing\nthe networking model,\n\n245\n00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:28.397\nthere's a couple of things that happen\nbetween my sending machine and, of course,\n\n246\n00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:30.240\nwhere it's gonna be received.\n\n247\n00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.880\nRemember that the destination itself is\nreally over here on the right-hand side.\n\n248\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.950\nUnderneath each of the IP addresses,\nI have fake MAC addresses, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.950\nThese are not usable, don't try and\nuse them, [LAUGH] once again,\n\n250\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.900\nas you start seeing them,\nbut you do have this.\n\n251\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.312\nHere in step one, going from my\nsending computer over to the router,\n\n252\n00:13:52.312 --> 00:13:56.875\nnotice that what I have, as far as\nthe way that the packet headers work,\n\n253\n00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:59.330\nis I show you the layer 3 header here.\n\n254\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.810\nAnd I show you the layer 2 header, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.303\nSo notice that my machine\nalready knows one thing,\n\n256\n00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:11.112\nit knows its own layer 3 address and\nit knows its own layer 2 address.\n\n257\n00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:16.390\nThat makes sense, right, the source\nmachine knows exactly its own information.\n\n258\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.513\nBut it could be that it's sending\nit to a machine that knows,\n\n259\n00:14:19.513 --> 00:14:22.940\nwhat, only the layer 3 information.\n\n260\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.200\nAnd if it does, it means I don't know how\nto actually get it over to that network,\n\n261\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.950\nbecause device-device communication is\nonly established at the data link layer,\n\n262\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.200\nas far as reliable transportation.\n\n263\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.790\nSo how do I do this?\n\n264\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:42.170\nWell, this is where this machine starts to\nput out some information onto the network,\n\n265\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:47.015\nessentially asking for\nthe MAC address of this IP address.\n\n266\n00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:48.839\n&gt;&gt; ARP.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we call ARP, right, and\n\n267\n00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:51.370\nwe'll actually talk about that\nmuch more in depth later on.\n\n268\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.620\nBut at this point, that's what it will do.\n\n269\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.050\nNobody else on this side of the network,\nokay, cuz we only have this one machine,\n\n270\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:05.800\nwill have, what, this matching, yeah, MAC\nor IP address, so it will hit this router.\n\n271\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.080\nThis router, instead, will do\nsomething that we call a proxy ARP,\n\n272\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.910\nis what it will do.\n\n273\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.420\nI say, look, that's not my IP address,\nbut why don't you go ahead and put\n\n274\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.730\nmy MAC address on that packet,\nokay, on that frame.\n\n275\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.760\nThen that gets delivered over to\nrouter 2's interface right here.\n\n276\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.130\nWhen it takes a look at the information\nthat it actually gets right here on router\n\n277\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.640\n1, not router 2,\nwhen it takes a look at that,\n\n278\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.800\nthe first thing that it does is it takes\na look at the layer 2 information.\n\n279\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.771\nAnd it says, hey, that is my MAC address.\n\n280\n00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:46.850\nSo it processes the layer 2 header,\nit processes it right on.\n\n281\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.806\nThen when it goes to layer 3, it goes,\nwait a minute, that's not my IP address.\n\n282\n00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:51.577\n&gt;&gt; That's not my IP address.\n\n283\n00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:53.059\n&gt;&gt; That's not my layer 3 address.\n\n284\n00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:56.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So a router, instead, says, look,\n\n285\n00:15:56.166 --> 00:16:01.445\nI'm not chained in layer 3, but\nI do need to send this packet somewhere.\n\n286\n00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:04.739\nWhere it can actually\nget to its destination.\n\n287\n00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:07.530\nIt takes a look in its routing table.\n\n288\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:12.279\nAnd router 2 has already reported\nthat I may have a possible route to\n\n289\n00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.625\n172.16.12.101.\n\n290\n00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:20.163\nSo now router 2 tells router 1\ninstead to take that frame and\n\n291\n00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:23.940\nput, well, its MAC address on it.\n\n292\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.260\nSo router one instead now I'm\nsending it out this interface\n\n293\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.930\nand it has a MAC address of all Cs and\nnow the destination\n\n294\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:42.510\nbecause router two's interface is\nfacing it, is also changing there.\n\n295\n00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.020\nSo now as it enters into router two,\nit will follow the same process.\n\n296\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.320\nIt will process the layer two header.\n\n297\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.590\nSay hey, layer two matches.\n\n298\n00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.080\nBut then when it goes to process layer\nthree, it says that doesn't match.\n\n299\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.591\nBut when I take a look\ninside of my routing table,\n\n300\n00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:02.827\nI noticed something that 172.16.12\nis on the other side over here.\n\n301\n00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:07.790\nSo let me send it out here\ngoing over to this network.\n\n302\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.050\nAnd when it does that this is where\nwe'll have the full screen here so\n\n303\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.550\nthat we can see the remaining information.\n\n304\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.340\nSo when it does this we'll\nactually take a look and\n\n305\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.940\nwhat will happen as it leaves this\ninterface we will then see the same thing.\n\n306\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.640\nIt will change the layer two address here\n\n307\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.980\nto the exiting interface,\nmove that out of the way,\n\n308\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.530\nand then it will also change\nthe destination here.\n\n309\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.510\nWhen it arrives on this computer,\nit will now process and\n\n310\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.350\ngo, that is my layer two address.\n\n311\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.690\nOnce it processes layer two header,\nit will then go to layer three and\n\n312\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.260\nit will say what?\n\n313\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.747\nHey.\n&gt;&gt; There's my IP address.\n\n314\n00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:55.020\n&gt;&gt; That is my IP address.\n\n315\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.090\nThat means I have reached my destination.\n\n316\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.970\nSo along this path, we can see where\nlayer 2, and layer 3 are actually\n\n317\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.970\nworking hand and hand to move data long\nto get it to where it needs to go.\n\n318\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.963\nNow a lot of us have probably\nnot taken the time and\n\n319\n00:18:10.963 --> 00:18:15.855\nopportunity to look at well where in the\nworld do we actually see like layer 2 and\n\n320\n00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:19.227\nlayer 3, and\nlayer 4 information a lot of the times.\n\n321\n00:18:19.227 --> 00:18:24.380\nSo I'm gonna actually bring up\na packet sniffer, just for a moment.\n\n322\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.810\nAnd I'll select one aspect of that.\n\n323\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.192\nAnd then I'm going to\nrun a capture hopefully.\n\n324\n00:18:32.192 --> 00:18:35.272\nAt least I'll try.\n\n325\n00:18:35.272 --> 00:18:38.689\n&gt;&gt; For the capture filter, do you have\nto put it in like TCP or whatever?\n\n326\n00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:39.522\n&gt;&gt; Nah, not for right now.\n\n327\n00:18:39.522 --> 00:18:40.156\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n328\n00:18:40.156 --> 00:18:41.431\n&gt;&gt; I just need to make sure I can run it.\n\n329\n00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.056\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n330\n00:18:42.056 --> 00:18:42.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n331\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.288\nSo I'll go ahead and run that.\n\n332\n00:18:44.288 --> 00:18:49.021\nAnd I'll bring up a,\n&gt;&gt; You're creating some traffic right now?\n\n333\n00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:51.867\n&gt;&gt; Website, yep,\njust gonna create some traffic so\n\n334\n00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:53.840\nthat we can see some information.\n\n335\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.060\nAnd so we'll do that and\nthat should be enough.\n\n336\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.210\nSo now, I'm actually capturing\ntraffic along that interface.\n\n337\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.420\nAnd I'm going to stop it,\nat least I think I did.\n\n338\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.270\nI may not have actually\ncaptured any of it at all.\n\n339\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.170\nSo it depends on what network\nI'm actually connected to.\n\n340\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.570\nBut as we see information.\n\n341\n00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.380\nSo this one here, I'm going to, I'm trying\nto see if I can find an HTTP message here.\n\n342\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.610\nThere's a UDP one, that'll work.\n\n343\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.086\nLet me see if I can find\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n344\n00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:25.440\nIt's because I'm connected\nto two different networks.\n\n345\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.740\nBut let me just pick this\npacket right up here.\n\n346\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.590\nSo that we can see something,\nand I'll zoom in all right.\n\n347\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.090\nSo I'll just pick a packet along here.\n\n348\n00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.730\nIt doesn't matter which one.\n\n349\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.000\nBut it's down here if I can\nactually get this thing to show up.\n\n350\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.300\nNotice that what we see right here\nin this information pane, right?\n\n351\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.830\nThis is just giving me all the blue area's\ngiving me all the information that's\n\n352\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.650\nnormally is coming across the interface.\n\n353\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.749\nBut now if I select one of them\nit doesn't matter which one.\n\n354\n00:19:48.749 --> 00:19:51.953\n&gt;&gt; Now we're looking that that individual\npacket information in that bottom field.\n\n355\n00:19:51.953 --> 00:19:56.750\n&gt;&gt; And so down here when you\ntake a look here notice this.\n\n356\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.410\nI have Ethernet II.\n\n357\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.610\nAnd its source is actually well,\nlook at that.\n\n358\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.760\nThose are MAC addresses here.\n\n359\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.603\nSo this is my layer two\nheader information.\n\n360\n00:20:07.603 --> 00:20:12.522\nOkay, directly underneath that\nis IP Protocol Version 4.\n\n361\n00:20:12.522 --> 00:20:15.790\nThat's my layer 3 information.\n\n362\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.440\nDirectly underneath that is,\nwell, look at that.\n\n363\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.910\nThere is my layer 4 again,\nwhich is datagrams.\n\n364\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.060\nSo this is actually using UDP.\n\n365\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.580\nAnd this precision time protocol,\nthis is probably an application as well.\n\n366\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.240\nSo this is where we actually\ncan run through that and see.\n\n367\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.610\nSo if you're actually saying how do I\nknow that these headers really exist?\n\n368\n00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.239\nYou can open up a packet sniffer and\nyou can actually see layer two,\n\n369\n00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:46.135\nlayer three, layer four,\nand the application, yep.\n\n370\n00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:49.756\n&gt;&gt; And depending on what type of\nprotocol you're utilizing here,\n\n371\n00:20:49.756 --> 00:20:51.439\nyou might see a shorter list.\n\n372\n00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:53.211\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because it depends on what\n\n373\n00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.520\nlayers you're dealing with.\n\n374\n00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there's no doubt.\n\n375\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.620\nSo I just wanted to make sure that\nwe saw that type of information so\n\n376\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.520\nthat we can understand that it is working,\nit's not just theoretical\n\n377\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.380\nIt literally is on every single\nframe that we send across a network.\n\n378\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.220\n&gt;&gt; Well I appreciate what you did there,\nRonnie, providing that visual.\n\n379\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.027\nBecause really, that's what I hear most\nabout the TCP, or these models here,\n\n380\n00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:21.859\nthe OSI and the TC/PIP models, is that\nit's hard to really grasp it visually.\n\n381\n00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:25.345\nSo like I said,\nif it didn't resonate with you initially,\n\n382\n00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:27.410\nplease just give it some time.\n\n383\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.650\nI promise you will have\nthat lightbulb moment.\n\n384\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.110\nSo, just go back and rewatch or\ncontinue your studies.\n\n385\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.940\nSometimes it happens\na little bit later on.\n\n386\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.550\nIt's not an immediate kind of thing,\nbut you'll get there.\n\n387\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.025\nWe do have some more information for you.\n\n388\n00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:42.160\nRonnie, did you have any\nfinal thoughts for this show?\n\n389\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just trying to make\nsure because I think I confused\n\n390\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.910\nmyself for a moment.\n\n391\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.670\nI was describing what we saw there in\nthat packet capture using the OSI model.\n\n392\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.885\nBut obviously just using TCP-IP.\n\n393\n00:21:52.885 --> 00:21:57.000\nSo even though I said layer two,\nthree, four and five.\n\n394\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.166\nIt's not going up to layer five.\n\n395\n00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:01.711\n[LAUGH] It's just really hitting that\napplication layer in the four-layer or\n\n396\n00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:03.500\nfive-layer model anyways.\n\n397\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.750\nSo I just wanna make sure as people like,\nwhy he's trying to describe the OSI model?\n\n398\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.790\nIt's just because I got confused there.\n\n399\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.569\nSo make sure when you take a look at that\nthat you realize it's running TCP/IP\n\n400\n00:22:12.569 --> 00:22:14.060\ncuz that's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's just by habit.\n\n401\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.372\nCuz that's how people talk.\n\n402\n00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:16.436\n&gt;&gt; That is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:18.940\n&gt;&gt; So I just wanna make sure\nthat we clarified that.\n\n404\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n405\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.935\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n406\n00:22:22.935 --> 00:22:25.540\nBut remember I'm your\nshow host Cherokee Boose.\n\n407\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n408\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.518\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n409\n00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:37.410\n[MUSIC]\n\n410\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:42.179\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.898\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series,\n\n5\n00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.298\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:20.003\nIn this particular episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.215\nwe will be taking a look at\nbasic networking protocols.\n\n8\n00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:25.728\nAnd if you're familiar with them,\nthen great, this will be a review.\n\n9\n00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.484\nIf not, we're gonna go ahead and\nintroduce you to these terms.\n\n10\n00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.871\nAnd here, we have Ronnie Wong\nto go ahead and begin and\n\n11\n00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.802\nwalk us through what we need to know for\nthis particular exam.\n\n12\n00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.146\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you, Cherokee for\nhaving me back in the studio,\n\n13\n00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:42.370\nas we take a look at some of\nthe basic networking protocols.\n\n14\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.172\nAnd these are things that should not be\na challenge to us, but just, again, review\n\n15\n00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:51.987\nand understanding fundamentals is key to\nbecoming someone that can analyze data.\n\n16\n00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:55.367\nEspecially security data,\nin a way that makes sense to them, and\n\n17\n00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:56.930\nit actually helps out.\n\n18\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.550\nSo we wanna make sure we review these\nconcepts about different protocols.\n\n19\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.570\nThe great thing is when we\ntake a look at the protocols,\n\n20\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.880\nit's really not anything\ngigantically difficult, but\n\n21\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.630\nit is something we have to at least\nbe able to see and understand.\n\n22\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320\nAnd then we're also gonna take a look at\nusing Wireshark to help us to identify\n\n23\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960\nthese protocols as well.\n\n24\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.810\nAnd it's all up to you on\nhow far you get into it, but\n\n25\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.180\nwe're really just doing a cursory\nunderstanding of it, but\n\n26\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.790\na great little review to\nhelp us out when we begin.\n\n27\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.758\nSo today, we're gonna be talking about\na little bit of the IP protocol.\n\n28\n00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:33.520\nWe're also gonna dive into TCP and UDP,\nas well as we're gonna take a look\n\n29\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.850\nat rounding that out with understanding\na little bit more about the basic\n\n30\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.140\nfunctioning of ICMP, the Internet\nControl Messaging Protocol, as well.\n\n31\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.930\nSo all of that is actually what\nwe're gonna take a look at,\n\n32\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.450\nat least in this show.\n\n33\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.300\nSo that we can have a good\nfoundational understanding.\n\n34\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.360\nSo let's start off with probably the most\nimportant protocol when it comes down to\n\n35\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.410\nany type of networking at all,\nwhich is gonna be the IP protocol,\n\n36\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.320\nthe Internet protocol itself.\n\n37\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.199\nSo Cherokee, when we start talking\nabout the idea of an IP address,\n\n38\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.500\nthat's really what we wanna focus on and\n\n39\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.030\nhow we come about it and how we\nunderstand what that address shows us.\n\n40\n00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.760\nSo that's what we're\nactually gonna focus on.\n\n41\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n42\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.940\nAnd this will help us out in understanding\nwhat we're gonna be seeing on a daily\n\n43\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.270\nbasis as we start analyzing security data.\n\n44\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970\nSo here it is on my computer screen.\n\n45\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.550\nI've kind of broken this down because this\nis what you're gonna see in the current\n\n46\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.360\ninstance, which is what we call IP Version\n4, as far as the time period that you're\n\n47\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.270\nentering into the world of cybersecurity\nand then cyber operations.\n\n48\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.100\nAnd of course, what you're gonna\nbe seeing in the very near future,\n\n49\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.930\nwhich is IP Version 6.\n\n50\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.250\nWhen we start talking about\nboth of those protocols,\n\n51\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.530\nremember that the IP protocol\noperates at layer 3, is that right?\n\n52\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at layer 3 of the OSI model,\n\n53\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.190\nthe networking model, or the Internet\nlayer on the TCP/IP model as well.\n\n54\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.000\nThese are actually the addressing\nprotocols that's used, and\n\n55\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.700\nthe reason why it's so important is\nbecause just about everything that we tend\n\n56\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.900\nto do in networking seems to revolve\naround the issue of IP addressing.\n\n57\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.020\nAnd the protocol of the past and\nof the current what we have right now,\n\n58\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.240\nthe current times,\nis gonna be of course IP Version 4.\n\n59\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.805\nAnd that is because what we have in\nthe near future is we're gonna be\n\n60\n00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:20.854\nswitching over to this IP Version 6.\n\n61\n00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:24.965\n&gt;&gt; And I love how you say near future,\nbut it is becoming a reality, but\n\n62\n00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:28.950\nI can recall ten years ago,\nwhen I was being introduced to IPv6.\n\n63\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.576\nThey said this is imminent,\nit's on the forefront, and\n\n64\n00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:34.315\nit's been awhile that we've\nbeen talking about this, right?\n\n65\n00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:39.171\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it's really been a long\ntime because this protocol was actually\n\n66\n00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.099\nintroduced quite awhile ago.\n\n67\n00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.982\nIt really happens probably around 1990s,\nthey started saying,\n\n68\n00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:46.774\nhere's what we're moving to.\n\n69\n00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:51.380\nAnd that is because, well really, the IP\nVersion 4 address space on the Internet\n\n70\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.510\nwas really being consumed very quickly.\n\n71\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.540\nBut the reason why the delay in IP Version\n6, even though there were talks\n\n72\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.780\nabout what would happen, is IP Version\n6 never really got a footing,\n\n73\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.980\nas far as stabilizing everything\nthat it needed to do.\n\n74\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.780\nSo its developmental time that it's\nspent really has actually kind of\n\n75\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.330\nnow solidified.\n\n76\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.370\nAnd now it's a fairly solid protocol and\nnot a lot of change is going on.\n\n77\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.150\nStill some minor changes, but not a ton.\n\n78\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.980\nBut now, it's actually kind of a mature\nprotocol that we can switch to\n\n79\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.810\nwithout a lot of hassle and\na lot of fuss to it.\n\n80\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.436\nThere are still gonna be programs\nthat we can do, but overall though,\n\n81\n00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:30.953\nwe're gonna see that change probably\nhappen in the next few years.\n\n82\n00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:32.144\nI wish I could be a prognosticator.\n\n83\n00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:33.937\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nwe'll whip out our crystal ball here and\n\n84\n00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:36.431\nsee when we're gonna go [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I know, you wanna know something?\n\n85\n00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.651\nIf I could actually predict that, that the\nentirety of the Internet would actually\n\n86\n00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:44.022\nswitch over to IP Version 6 by this\none date, I could go to Vegas and\n\n87\n00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:45.065\nmake a lot of money.\n\n88\n00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:46.360\nBecause everybody has, of course,\n\n89\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.870\npredicted just like what Cherokee\nwas saying ten years ago.\n\n90\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.540\nWe thought in ten years' time,\nwe'd definitely\n\n91\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.140\nbe switched completely over by that point,\nbut it just hasn't happened.\n\n92\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.090\nAnd that is because there's a lot of\nother applications out there that\n\n93\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.750\nare still dependent upon\nthe original IP Version 4.\n\n94\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.870\nSo let's make sure we\nunderstand IP Version 4.\n\n95\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.380\nRemember that it is truly at its heart and\nnature a 32 bit binary address.\n\n96\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.518\nSo when we take a look at it, the reality\nof everything that we do in programming\n\n97\n00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:17.661\nand networking, it turns out looking\nsomething similar to what I'm actually\n\n98\n00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:20.322\nunderlining here or\npointing out with my cursor.\n\n99\n00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:24.120\nNow it doesn't normally have\na decimal point in between.\n\n100\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.540\nBut I put these there, and everybody puts\nthem there, to make it easier for you and\n\n101\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.400\nI to actually understand.\n\n102\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.830\nIn between each one of those decimal\npoints represents 8 bits of binary,\n\n103\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.950\nunless I typed it in wrong,\nwhich is very possible.\n\n104\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.930\n&gt;&gt; And normally,\nwe refer to that as an octet, right?\n\n105\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.670\n&gt;&gt; As an octet, and once we actually\nbreak that down, four octets,\n\n106\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.710\nfour 8 bit sections equals, what,\n32 bits of the binary address.\n\n107\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.770\nNow that address is very important in\nnetworking because it actually represents\n\n108\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.820\ntwo portions of something that we need for\nan IP address to function.\n\n109\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.733\nJust like a regular house address,\nit really has two parts to it.\n\n110\n00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:05.320\nWe also need both parts\nin networking as well.\n\n111\n00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.040\nSo you think about, let's just say,\nlet's make a very generic address here.\n\n112\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.270\nLet's say 1234 Main Street.\n\n113\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.580\nThat's about as generic that I can get.\n\n114\n00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.275\nWell, on Main Street, right,\n\n115\n00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:24.400\nits particular street in which\nthat 124 address resides,\n\n116\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.280\nthere could be many different houses,\nor buildings, or whatever it is.\n\n117\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.120\nAnd each particular building or address,\n\n118\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.556\nright, represents something, represents\na location right there on that street.\n\n119\n00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:42.050\nThe street itself, though, is common to\nevery single building on that street or\n\n120\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.780\nthat house, so what we call a house\nnumber and we also give it a street.\n\n121\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.850\nAnd that gives it what we\ncall a location value.\n\n122\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo, not only in that address\nare we identifying that particular\n\n123\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.070\ndevice as far as networking goes,\ncomputer, server,\n\n124\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.180\nInternet of Thing, whatever it might\nbe that you plug in, your smartphone.\n\n125\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.330\nYou name it,\nit can actually represent any of those.\n\n126\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.070\nBut at the same time, we also have that\nstreet address, which we also called\n\n127\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.530\na network portion of it,\nthat identifies its location somewhere.\n\n128\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.970\nAnd that is kind of key and critical\nto the way that this address functions.\n\n129\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.450\nThat's why you see here I'm trying\nnot to make us get too dizzy here.\n\n130\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.630\nIt's actually representing\ntwo different portions.\n\n131\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.240\nOne is called the network ID, which would\nbe equivalent to the street address.\n\n132\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.890\nAnd the other one of course is a host ID,\n\n133\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.180\nand it's equivalent to\na house number as well.\n\n134\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.680\nNormally when we take a look\nat this in binary though and\n\n135\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.260\nin networking, the left hand side, unlike\nthe way that we do regular addresses,\n\n136\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.430\nnormally represents that network\nportion or the street address.\n\n137\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.427\nAnd then of course,\n\n138\n00:07:46.427 --> 00:07:49.956\nthe individual house number is over\nhere on the right hand side as well.\n\n139\n00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:54.760\nBut the identification of both of those\nparts is something that is actually\n\n140\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.447\nvery easily controlled.\n\n141\n00:07:56.447 --> 00:08:02.031\nAnd that is because they use a Another\ntype of what is called a subnet mask,\n\n142\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.715\nto help us to differentiate network\nID from the host ID through\n\n143\n00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:10.650\na process that's called binary anding.\n\n144\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.040\nAnd binary anding essentially\nallows us to line up\n\n145\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.598\nthis 32 bit IP address that I have.\n\n146\n00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:24.040\nAnd also this Subnet Mask,\nwhich is also 32 bits long,\n\n147\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.710\nand through that mathematical\nbinary process it will reveal to us\n\n148\n00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.470\nwhich portions match at the end when we\nactually run through the process here.\n\n149\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.020\nSo when you do that, it will tell\nyou which portion is network ID and\n\n150\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.180\nthen the portions that don't match,\n\n151\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.940\nwhat comes through the end process is\nconsidered your host idea at that point.\n\n152\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.150\nNow depending on who you're studying,\n\n153\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.760\nyou may hear terms be differentiated\na little bit differently.\n\n154\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.500\nSo instead you may hear about\nthe network portion and\n\n155\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.230\nyou may also hear the term\nnode potion sometimes.\n\n156\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Network bits.\n\n157\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.810\n&gt;&gt; Network bits.\n&gt;&gt; Host bits.\n\n158\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Host bits.\n\n159\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So all of those really match up in\n\n160\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.700\nCisco land.\n\n161\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.060\nWe talk about the idea of network ID and\n\n162\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.440\nhost ID quite often is what\nyou tend to hear instead.\n\n163\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.780\nSo make sure you do understand that.\n\n164\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.760\nNow because you and I and pretty much\nthe majority of us on this planet\n\n165\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.050\ndid not learn how to actually,\nwell learn binary, didn't learn it.\n\n166\n00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.890\n&gt;&gt; It's not native to us.\n\n167\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.140\n&gt;&gt; It's not native to us.\n\n168\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.720\nWe have actually learned how\nto do addition, subtraction,\n\n169\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.250\nmultiplication by using\ndecimal numbers instead.\n\n170\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.082\nWe take that number to help us,whatever\nit is, such as this one up here,\n\n171\n00:09:33.082 --> 00:09:37.144\nwe take this number and\nwe convert it into decimal notation.\n\n172\n00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:42.470\nAnd we keep the dots here, and\nthat is called a dotted decimal notation.\n\n173\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.700\nSo, this number, up here at the top, would\nend up representing a number that would\n\n174\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.740\nlook fairly similar to well,\nthis right here.\n\n175\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.640\nAnd the way that you do that\nis you do the conversion.\n\n176\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.150\nNow we're not gonna go over\nthe idea of converting bits.\n\n177\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.980\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n&gt;&gt; Because at this point,\n\n178\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.010\nwell, because-\n&gt;&gt; It's so fun.\n\n179\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.750\n&gt;&gt; At this point, you should\nactually be doing this on your own.\n\n180\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.645\nSo if you haven't,\n\n181\n00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:04.490\nif you're going, Ronnie,\nI really don't know how to do that.\n\n182\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.330\n&gt;&gt; We have shows for that.\n\n183\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make sure you actually do check\nout some of our other shows inside of our\n\n184\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.960\ncourse library.\n\n185\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.850\nMake sure you check out\nthe Network Plus show.\n\n186\n00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.530\nMake sure you check out the CCE and\nT show, the CCNA routing and switching.\n\n187\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.190\nWe go over those concepts right there.\n\n188\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.700\nThis is supposed to be\njust a brief review.\n\n189\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.550\nDon't get me wrong, I talk longer.\n\n190\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.850\nLong enough to make it not as brief.\n\n191\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.430\n&gt;&gt; No, you're doing great.\n\n192\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.370\nThat's actually my favorite analogy is,\nthe streets number and the house, yeah,\n\n193\n00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.430\nthe house address there.\n\n194\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it does help out when you\nremember that, but if you're saying,\n\n195\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.760\nI really need to review that,\nwell that kind of lets you know something.\n\n196\n00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.270\nIf you don't have that down pat yet,\nyou may have to go back and\n\n197\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.690\nlearn some of that stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.130\nIP addressing is very important in\nanything that you do in terms of analysis.\n\n199\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.190\nFor the idea of cyber ops,\nyou've got to have this concept down.\n\n200\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.070\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and understanding the difference\nbetween a subnet masks and\n\n201\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.600\nthen also being able to things like\nidentify an invalid subnet mask,\n\n202\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.530\nhaving all the ones to the left,\nzeros to the right, things like that.\n\n203\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes a good point.\n\n204\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.870\nYeah, I forgot all about that portion.\n\n205\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.415\nWhich is a Subnet Mask,\nif you take a look at it in binary,\n\n206\n00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:12.420\nyou'll always see a contiguous strings\nof 1s on the left hand side, and\n\n207\n00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.130\nnotice that there are no 1s over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n208\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.400\nAnytime you have something like that,\n\n209\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.530\nthat normally is a good visual\nindicator that that is a Subnet Mask.\n\n210\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.330\nAnd there's ones interspersed in between,\nthen that's not considered the Subnet Mask\n\n211\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.230\nportion, all the way up until the last\ndigit that you do find a one.\n\n212\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.840\nSo, make sure you go back and\ncheck those shows out.\n\n213\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.580\nIt's going to be very important for\nus to do this.\n\n214\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.360\nWhen we start to see this, remember\nthat this is all layer three addressing.\n\n215\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.100\nAnd, every single IP address not\nonly has its IP address, but\n\n216\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.280\nalso, a seven net masked number, as well.\n\n217\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.660\nThe reason why we need to understand that,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n218\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.670\nis that this is not equivalent, okay.\n\n219\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.670\nSo I don't think I can actually do this.\n\n220\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.500\nSo let me put this on one,\non two lines here.\n\n221\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.088\nSo here it's not actually equivalent even\nif I were to do something like this.\n\n222\n00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:07.940\nLet's do 46.1 And a different subnet mask.\n\n223\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.030\nSo it looks like it's identical.\n\n224\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.750\nYou might even consider that they're\nboth on the very same network.\n\n225\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.600\nBut it would be incorrect.\n\n226\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.950\nSo you've got to make sure you pay\nattention to things like that as well,\n\n227\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.960\nbecause it can really hinder you.\n\n228\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.140\nIf you're not exactly sure\nwhat network you're on,\n\n229\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.190\nand the only way to identify that\nis know what the network ID is.\n\n230\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.000\n&gt;&gt; Well for sure.\n\n231\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.290\nAnd I mean on the actual exam,\nthey may present the IP address to\n\n232\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.280\nyou in a dotted decimal notation,\nor in a binary format.\n\n233\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.720\nAnd there's also that\nthird format as well,\n\n234\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.290\nwhich is basically a shorthand to\nsignify or represent that subnet mask.\n\n235\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.450\nAnd that's going to be\nyour slash notation.\n\n236\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.530\nSo if you're not up with memorizing\nyour slashes, your slash notation,\n\n237\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.280\nthat might be something you wanna look\nat as well, like a slide or charts.\n\n238\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo what Cherokee is talking about,\n\n239\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.550\nother than good reminders of\nstuff that I've forgotten so\n\n240\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.320\nI'm glad that she's here to remind me.\n\n241\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.770\nSo you might also see this\nwritten as something like this,\n\n242\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:10.640\nor like that instead.\n\n243\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.990\nBoth of those really represent the same\nthing,and if you aren't familiar for\n\n244\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.320\nthat, in Cisco lane you never know\nwhich one you're going to get,\n\n245\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.455\nusually at the CCNA level,\nwhich is what this exam is based around.\n\n246\n00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:27.390\nIt's probably gonna be the former a lot of\ntimes, but there is no guarantee of that.\n\n247\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.202\nSo you may see where instead they condense\nthis space by just displaying one of these\n\n248\n00:13:32.202 --> 00:13:33.794\nslash notations instead.\n\n249\n00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:38.370\nSo that is kind of a key for\nus making sure that we understand that all\n\n250\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.720\nof the IP addresses then that\nbelong in the same network.\n\n251\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.410\nWe need be able to identify\nsomething like that, and whether or\n\n252\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.160\nnot an IP address is not\nin the same network.\n\n253\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.180\nAll that's actually key for\nsomething that we are going to do.\n\n254\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.090\nBecause we need to make sure that we\nunderstand the elements that are inside of\n\n255\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.050\nour network, and of course the other\naddressing elements that are not inside of\n\n256\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.560\nour network that will also help us out.\n\n257\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.558\nNow let's briefly talk about this\nidea of IPV6 for a moment as well.\n\n258\n00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:09.168\nIPV6 of course is\nthe newer address space and\n\n259\n00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:14.210\nyou'll see that by size the IPV4\nis a 32 bit binary address.\n\n260\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:20.430\nWhere IPV6 though,\nis a 128-bit binary address.\n\n261\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.270\nNow, if you try to compare that number\nhere, this is what it looks like,\n\n262\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.070\nif you look at the example that\nI gave up here at the top.\n\n263\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.670\nSo that's what a 32 bit\nbinary one looks like.\n\n264\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.610\nHere's what 128 bits looks like instead.\n\n265\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.291\nNow, if you try and equalize that somehow,\nthe way that they did this in terms\n\n266\n00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:42.121\nof binary, instead of four octets,\nlike what we had in IPv4.\n\n267\n00:14:42.121 --> 00:14:48.770\nIt's actually going to be eight sections\nof 16 bits each is what it's going to be.\n\n268\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.430\nSo it's actually eight 16 bit sections.\n\n269\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.560\nAnd that is just beyond a mouthful for\nyou and I to actually accomplish.\n\n270\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.760\nMight be wondering why is\nthe address base so much larger?\n\n271\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.670\nAnd that is because of one big reason.\n\n272\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.890\nIt's really because in the IP\nversion 4 address space that we had,\n\n273\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.910\na little bit under 4.3 billion\npossibilities, it wasn't enough.\n\n274\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.097\nThey never thought about it when they\nfirst started coming around the,\n\n275\n00:15:16.097 --> 00:15:18.696\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I know, who would've thought one person\n\n276\n00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:22.245\nwould have five different IP addresses\non a daily basis dealing with that.\n\n277\n00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:23.735\n&gt;&gt; And so they really didn't.\n\n278\n00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:26.095\nAnd at that point,\nwhen you start to think about that,\n\n279\n00:15:26.095 --> 00:15:28.975\nthey didn't ever think that\nit would come to this point.\n\n280\n00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:34.140\nAnd that's shortsightedness, but it's\nalso testament to the idea that we would\n\n281\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.780\nactually be using this type of networking\nit's about for everything in our lives.\n\n282\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.690\nSo instead of trying to go up and\ngo okay, we'll make it 48 bits.\n\n283\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Slightly larger.\n\n284\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.153\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, slightly larger.\n\n285\n00:15:44.153 --> 00:15:44.993\n&gt;&gt; Go big or go home.\n\n286\n00:15:44.993 --> 00:15:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Let's make it so big here,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.840\n&gt;&gt; 120 bit binary address.\n\n288\n00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.275\nThat we should not theoretically be able\nto run out of numbers to a site that these\n\n289\n00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:54.005\naddresses are.\n\n290\n00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:57.582\n&gt;&gt; I know, who knows what our grandkids'\ngrandkids are gonna be saying.\n\n291\n00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.441\nThey may be having the same\ndiscussion about a new,\n\n292\n00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.313\na different addressing scheme.\n\n293\n00:16:02.313 --> 00:16:05.735\nWell, if they do,\nthey are really overusing everything.\n\n294\n00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:09.074\nNow let me kind of give you an example\nof how much they're gonna overuse it,\n\n295\n00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:10.730\nif it's true, right?\n\n296\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.357\nSo, with IPv6, how does this\nIP address really help us with\n\n297\n00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:20.188\nthe idea of losing address space\nthat we didn't have in IPv4?\n\n298\n00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.649\nWell, right now,\nif I were to start a company and\n\n299\n00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:26.270\nI said I need an IP address from an ISP,\nthey might assign me one, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.170\nUnless I ask for\nmore than one, but usually,\n\n301\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:33.460\nthey're gonna assign me one,\njust one single public IP address.\n\n302\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:40.460\nWell in theory, in IPv6, okay,\nonce they start to do this, an individual,\n\n303\n00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.020\nokay, single individual could actually\nend up with one IPv6 address.\n\n304\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.860\nAnd that will give them more addresses\nthat they can use internally on\n\n305\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.330\nthe network without having to do any\nfancy use of private IP addresses or\n\n306\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.690\nanything like that.\n\n307\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.760\nWhich is going to actually be more\nthan the current address space\n\n308\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.430\nof the entire Internet.\n\n309\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.387\nSo you can have one network that can have\nmore computers on it than the entire IP\n\n310\n00:17:05.387 --> 00:17:07.303\naddress in the public space.\n\n311\n00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:11.460\nAnd that's kind of the key in what we want\nto make sure that we understand and do.\n\n312\n00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.130\nSo, it really is helpful when we start\nthinking about the size of this.\n\n313\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.120\nNow, the great thing is,\n\n314\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.290\nit's still identical in terms\nof the way that it's portioned.\n\n315\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.480\nThere's still a network ID,\nthere's still a host ID.\n\n316\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.910\nBut they've standardized this to where\n\n317\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.860\nthe subnet masking is no longer\nreally needed its variable.\n\n318\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.590\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool, it's almost like\nthey made it a little more intuitive, so\n\n319\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.657\nyou can really drill down and\nsee if it's a personal IP address.\n\n320\n00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.395\nIf it's going to be used for\nbusiness use and things like that,\n\n321\n00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:41.340\njust to make it a little more organized.\n\n322\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.360\nThat's where the pre-planning\ncomes into play there.\n\n323\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.050\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n324\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.330\nSo most of the time, individuals instead,\neven inside of their network,\n\n325\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.020\nif they're only assigned a single network.\n\n326\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:55.350\nThey're gonna use a /64 notation, which\nis right in half of that address space.\n\n327\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.930\nSo the first 64 bits of the address\nis gonna be the network portion,\n\n328\n00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.160\nthe last 64 bits of the network address\nis gonna be the node portion or\n\n329\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.120\nthe node ID itself, or\nthe ID of the host ID.\n\n330\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.520\nI keep using different terms, but\nthat's what it's gonna end up doing.\n\n331\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.680\nSo that's normally standardized.\n\n332\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.093\nIn theory, in true academic theory,\nright, what should happen is,\n\n333\n00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:21.403\nyour IP address, or your ISP,\nin IPv6, assigns you,\n\n334\n00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:27.502\nwhether you're a consumer or\nwhether you're a business, a /32 network.\n\n335\n00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:32.406\nNow the reason why I wanted to point that\nout is because that means the next 32 bits\n\n336\n00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:34.040\nall the way to that /64,\n\n337\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.545\nthose are networks that you can\ncreate on your own at home.\n\n338\n00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:42.368\nAnd you go, well, that's 32 to 64, that's\n32, yep, there's a lot of networks that\n\n339\n00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:45.869\nyou can create or a lot of the subnets\nthat you can create on your own.\n\n340\n00:18:45.869 --> 00:18:51.530\nBut I think ISPs are probably gonna end up\nmanaging that space a little bit more and\n\n341\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.862\na little bit more conservative,\n\n342\n00:18:53.862 --> 00:18:59.630\nrather than just handing you a complete\naddress space that big, but they can.\n\n343\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.690\nAnd they won't run out, that's the key\nis what we'll end up seeing here.\n\n344\n00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.610\nSo, normally when you start to see this,\n\n345\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.080\na single address looks similar\nto something like this.\n\n346\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.620\nLet me zoom in, oops,\nlet me zoom back out.\n\n347\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.907\n&gt;&gt; And what Ronnie is showing us\nhere is instead of writing it,\n\n348\n00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.668\nwe talked about before, in the binary or\ndotted decimal notation.\n\n349\n00:19:21.668 --> 00:19:24.333\nAnd decimal being a ten\nbased numbering system,\n\n350\n00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:28.233\nwe are now looking at hexadecimal\nnotation, because well, frankly,\n\n351\n00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.935\nit's a lot of typing, for all those\ndifferent characters and binaries, so.\n\n352\n00:19:32.935 --> 00:19:33.755\n&gt;&gt; It really would be.\n\n353\n00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:37.830\nIf we were to do this in just regular\ndotted decimal notation, it would turn out\n\n354\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.510\nto be like what we said here,\nwhich is eight sections of 16 bits each,\n\n355\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.015\nwhich would be long,\ngigantic numbers in between.\n\n356\n00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:50.362\nSo we wouldn't be able to use\nnumbers like 192.168..0.1.\n\n357\n00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:55.163\nIt would be something like 192168.200210.,\n\n358\n00:19:55.163 --> 00:20:01.090\nI mean, it would just be gigantic\nnumbers that we would end up using.\n\n359\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.530\nSo instead by using hexadecimal,\nthey shorten the format up.\n\n360\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.800\nSo that instead of actually dealing with\nthis, we're actually dealing with, well,\n\n361\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:15.950\neight sections of, well, four hexadecimal\ndigits each, is what we're doing, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.440\nSo you actually see right here,\nthe first 64 bits then,\n\n363\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.210\nhere's 16 bits, here's 32,\nhere's 48, here's 64.\n\n364\n00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.210\nThat is gonna be my\nstandard network portion.\n\n365\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.940\nThe last 64 bits, that's 16, 32, 48.\n\n366\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:41.610\nAnd then here is 64, well,\nthat would be my host ID instead.\n\n367\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.580\nSo that's what we'll also\nend up seeing there too.\n\n368\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.272\nThe other thing about IPv6 addresses is\nthat your computer's gonna take up more\n\n369\n00:20:49.272 --> 00:20:50.722\nthan one IPv6 address.\n\n370\n00:20:50.722 --> 00:20:55.236\nYou're gonna actually see for different\ninterfaces, you'll actually have multiple\n\n371\n00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:58.940\nIPv6 addresses, depending on\nthe type of traffic that it is.\n\n372\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.070\nSo for example, like this one here, it\ntells you that this single address here,\n\n373\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:09.710\nwhich is our fe80, which is equivalent\nto like an APIPA address here,\n\n374\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:15.440\nit is linked to my en0 interface\non my network adapter.\n\n375\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.096\nIt's not linked to every single\nnetwork adapter, I have a wireless,\n\n376\n00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:19.909\nI have one that's\nphysically plugged in here.\n\n377\n00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:24.570\nThis one is absolutely linked to the one\nthat's physically plugged in right now.\n\n378\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.160\nSo you actually see that if I go and\nfind the wireless one,\n\n379\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.810\nit'll be a different address.\n\n380\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:29.410\nAnd then of course,\n\n381\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.000\nyou can manually assign them, or\nyou can be given an address space.\n\n382\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we kind of just get those.\n\n383\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.400\nIt's not like with our IPv4 APIPAs,\nit's not just\n\n384\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.530\nassigned on an emergency kind of basis,\nand so it's a little different there.\n\n385\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's because we actually\nuse these addresses in real networking\n\n386\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.370\ninstead, whereas in APIPA, even though\nwe can theoretically use them, we don't.\n\n387\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.690\nBut normally, you also see this.\n\n388\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.790\nNow the other thing that\nyou may end up seeing, and\n\n389\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.420\nthis is something I kind of\nchanged here for a moment.\n\n390\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.010\nBut notice that in this particular\naddress, I went ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.240\nalso removed this.\n\n392\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.080\nNow I need to change this up if\nI'm gonna do it properly here.\n\n393\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.500\nWhenever you have a string of 0s\nall together, something like this,\n\n394\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.780\nyou instead can replace that with\nwhat we call a double colon instead.\n\n395\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.770\nYou can only do it one time per address,\nbut this is how it is represented.\n\n396\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.520\nThat way,\nyou can shorten up the address a lot more,\n\n397\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.450\nless typing to be able to\ndo something like this.\n\n398\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.000\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; And also, if you\n\n399\n00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.660\nhad any 0s at the beginning, for your\nleading 0s, you could also remove them.\n\n400\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:39.176\nSo, you could use the double colon\nonce throughout your address and\n\n401\n00:22:39.176 --> 00:22:41.788\nthen also remove, let's say,\n\n402\n00:22:41.788 --> 00:22:45.882\ninstead of9bff in that line, you had like-\n&gt;&gt; 0.\n\n403\n00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can remove that 0,\nand it would still be applicable.\n\n404\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.020\nYou're just, less typing for you there.\n\n405\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nwhat Cherokee is talking about,\n\n406\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.140\nlet's change this 9 here,\nand we'll make this one a 0.\n\n407\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.440\nOops, if I can actually type a 0,\nwell even if I saw this 0 here, and\n\n408\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.930\nnotice that I have those\nfour extra decimal digits.\n\n409\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.831\n&gt;&gt; BFF, your best friend for life.\n\n410\n00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:09.706\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so here,\n[LAUGH] that's exactly what I thought of,\n\n411\n00:23:09.706 --> 00:23:12.010\nthe first time I ever saw that.\n\n412\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.535\nSo instead of actually having\nto write this out on a leading\n\n413\n00:23:15.535 --> 00:23:20.500\n0 just like anything that we do in\nregular math, we can also remove that.\n\n414\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n\n415\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.710\n&gt;&gt; And\nit actually represents the same thing.\n\n416\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.580\nBut it has to be a 0,\nit has to be in the lead spot,\n\n417\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.120\nwe can't remove-\n&gt;&gt; Just random.\n\n418\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Following 0s.\n\n419\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n420\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.120\n&gt;&gt; But it has to be right\nthere in the beginning, and\n\n421\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.260\nthat shortens things up even more.\n\n422\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.970\nSo both of these,\n\n423\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.160\nyou'll end up seeing something that\nwill help you to shorten up the address.\n\n424\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.150\nNow remember that this one is normally\ngonna be assigned on every interface that\n\n425\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.930\nyou have, but other ones that\nare used publicly on the Internet\n\n426\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.940\nwill have different at the beginning.\n\n427\n00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.680\nSo instead of fe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Prefixes are pretty important.\n\n428\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.134\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you'll probably see something\nlike 200 or 234, whatever it might be.\n\n429\n00:23:57.134 --> 00:23:58.783\nYou actually see some\ndifferent numbers there.\n\n430\n00:23:58.783 --> 00:24:02.979\n&gt;&gt; Right, if it's signifying multicast,\nbecause something that well,\n\n431\n00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:06.484\nwith advent of IPv6,\nit really does change up the game, and\n\n432\n00:24:06.484 --> 00:24:10.150\nwe don't see things like\nbroadcast communications anymore.\n\n433\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.710\nAnd so as we continue with these shows,\nI think Ronnie will be\n\n434\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.030\npointing out some differences with\nprotocols, and how they may differ,\n\n435\n00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:24.710\nbecause of the use well, omitting the use\nof broadcast for type of communication.\n\n436\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, you actually see\n\n437\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.080\nthis is actually gonna be something\nthat you'll kind of learn, right.\n\n438\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.833\nWhat a broadcast is versus\nthe idea of IPv4 and IPv6, but\n\n439\n00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:35.661\nbeing on a clearly distinguished\nease is kind of at least key\n\n440\n00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:38.920\nat the beginning of\neverything that we'll do.\n\n441\n00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.770\nSo make sure you have a solid\nunderstanding, at least of the basis here.\n\n442\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.460\nSo when we take a look at\nthe idea of IPv4 vs IPv6.\n\n443\n00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.350\nIPv6 is coming, you should take\nthe time to learn more about it.\n\n444\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:58.590\nAnd if you haven't, go ahead, especially\nwith your membership here at ITProTV,\n\n445\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.710\ntake advantage of the Cisco Labs that\nare provided through there and try and\n\n446\n00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.960\ntype in some of these addresses,\nand make them work together.\n\n447\n00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.600\nBecause it's gonna be very essential,\nat least in the near future,\n\n448\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.020\nwhen you start doing the type\nof cyber ops security,\n\n449\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.420\nand, I wanna kinda say analysis\nthat we'll need to do.\n\n450\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.180\nDistinguishing the difference\nbetween these is gonna be key\n\n451\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.360\nunderstanding the differences\nis also gonna be key.\n\n452\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.310\nAnd making sure you understand what is\nin a subnet, what is not in a subnet,\n\n453\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.420\nand how you identify that,\nall that's also gonna be key, as well.\n\n454\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.600\nIt's not something that\nwe should easily just go,\n\n455\n00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.600\nI'm not gonna worry about it until later.\n\n456\n00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.450\nAt this point,\nin terms of cyber analysis and\n\n457\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.650\nsecurity, you've got to go ahead and\nmake sure you have a solid firm foundation\n\n458\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.980\nof at least the IP addressing\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n459\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:52.380\nSo, let's see where we also find this\ninside of the packets themselves,\n\n460\n00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.060\na lot a times and on machines and\nwe will take a brief look here.\n\n461\n00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.640\nSo here it is, I'm on my machine\nwhich is just a regular MacBook.\n\n462\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.440\nAnd if I scroll down here to the bottom,\n\n463\n00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.840\nlet's make sure that I\ncan see a few things.\n\n464\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.650\nI've already been doing just a little bit\nof pinging and some different things here.\n\n465\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:13.470\nBut if I just simply type in an ifconfig,\nand of course if\n\n466\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:18.440\nyou're on a Windows machine you would do\nipconfig, and let me just do an ifconfig.\n\n467\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.690\nAnd here it shows everything.\n\n468\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.418\nIf I scroll all the way up to\nwhere I typed in that, and\n\n469\n00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:27.560\nthere's the ifconfig that I typed in.\n\n470\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.652\nI'm going to scroll down here and\nlook for the EN0.\n\n471\n00:26:31.652 --> 00:26:34.410\nAnd you'll see a couple\nof different things.\n\n472\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.750\nBut right away, one of the things\nthat I actually saw here, of course,\n\n473\n00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.950\nis the MAC address.\n\n474\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.690\nAnd this shows me some\nof that information.\n\n475\n00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.310\nAnd if I scroll down\na little bit more here,\n\n476\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.380\nthis is the one that I'm actually tied to,\nas well.\n\n477\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.220\nHere's the one that's actually\nconnected to the network.\n\n478\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.460\nAnd you'll see a little\nbit more information.\n\n479\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.510\nNotice that on this one,\nyou have two different addresses.\n\n480\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.280\nHere is the one that I showed\nyou a little bit earlier here.\n\n481\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.820\nOr very close if not very similar.\n\n482\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.560\nSo that is an IP version 6 address.\n\n483\n00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.820\nAnd that's already configured that way.\n\n484\n00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.220\nThe protocol stack's been added in.\n\n485\n00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.940\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes you'll\nhear that term dual stack.\n\n486\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.620\nLike if a piece of equipment\nsupports both IPv4,\n\n487\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.940\nIPv6, just about everything does today,\nit really does.\n\n488\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.700\nPrefix length, of course there's\nthat /64 we were talking about.\n\n489\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.520\nAnd then the one that says inet itself\nhere is my current IPv4 address.\n\n490\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.520\nThe network mask for one reason or another\nis actually reported as a hexadecimal.\n\n491\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.710\nThat's kinda neat, and then here's\nthe broadcast address that we have.\n\n492\n00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.910\nSo you can see information just like\nthat when you start to put it in.\n\n493\n00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.650\nThe other thing of course and\nI'm gonna bring up some Wireshark here.\n\n494\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.660\nSo I'm just gonna start a new\ncapture on Wireshark then.\n\n495\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.510\nAnd when I do so, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick I continue without saving and\n\n496\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.000\nnow traffic is beginning to go through.\n\n497\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.380\nI'm gonna open this up and\ngo to ITPRO.TV and send a little bit of\n\n498\n00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.730\ntraffic along there and that way we\nactually have some different traffic\n\n499\n00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:08.210\ngoing on that we can actually see and I'm\ngonna stop the information for right now.\n\n500\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.590\nSo that we can take a look at just\na little bit of information and\n\n501\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.760\none of the things that\nI want to point out,\n\n502\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.060\nI wanna make sure I capture an IP\nversion 6 packet which is right here.\n\n503\n00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.650\nI don't even know what this ones about but\nI wanted to take a look at it so\n\n504\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.800\nthat we can see it briefly.\n\n505\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.430\nRight here I can see that at the top\n\n506\n00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.580\nthis is gonna be my source address\ngoing to a destination and\n\n507\n00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.390\nthis is going to some type of multicast\naddress is what we're seeing.\n\n508\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.500\nI belive is whats going too.\n\n509\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.880\nSo if I take a look at\nthe layer three information,\n\n510\n00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.500\nwhich is the internet\nprotocol version six here.\n\n511\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.560\nLet me make sure I'm zoomed, yeah.\n\n512\n00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.590\nMake sure I can zoom.\n\n513\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.660\nThere we go.\nI was going to say, why didn't it zoom.\n\n514\n00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.230\nLet me zoom right back in, so\nthat we can see a little bit better.\n\n515\n00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.610\nSo, right here, you can see the source\naddress, which is this one and\n\n516\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.370\nthey didn't abbreviate it at all.\n\n517\n00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.280\nThey didn't drop any of\nthose leading zeroes here.\n\n518\n00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.180\nOr actually that's not leading,\nthat's why they didn't drop it.\n\n519\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.750\nBut notice this one right up here,\nthis 2c.\n\n520\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.390\nAnd yep, so they drop one here, and\nthey also dropped a string of zeroes here.\n\n521\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.030\nAnd then the destination,\neverything in between the very prefix,\n\n522\n00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:14.690\nthe very beginning, all the way to the\nvery last little section of those 16 bits\n\n523\n00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.050\nwere all zeroes,\nessentially is what we see here too.\n\n524\n00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.060\nSo you can see for example,\ninside of WireShark, that is of course,\n\n525\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.700\nan IP version 6 address.\n\n526\n00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.360\nNow the other thing tha we can also see,\nlet me see if I can do an HTTP, and see\n\n527\n00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.420\nif I can scroll down and find,\nthere's some more information.\n\n528\n00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.800\nAnd the reason why I wanna point\nthis one out particularly,\n\n529\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.720\nis because I know that this is going\nto be the IP address of ITProTV, and\n\n530\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.750\nthis is coming back to my own computer.\n\n531\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:50.810\nSo I can of course, also see the IP\nversion 4 addressing here on the source\n\n532\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.780\nand destination and understanding that\nall of this information is coming across.\n\n533\n00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.320\nDon't get me wrong,\nthere is a lot more to examine here, but\n\n534\n00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.870\nat least at the beginning,\nyou can verify and\n\n535\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:06.170\nyou can tell where you can see IP version\n6 addresses and IP version 4 addresses.\n\n536\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.170\nWhen you do a simple packet\ncapture to help you.\n\n537\n00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.730\nAt the very beginning, learning how\nto use an analysis tool like this,\n\n538\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.820\nor at least a gathering tool like this,\nit's really gonna be\n\n539\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.770\nkey especially when you move to the more\ntechnical cyber ops side of it.\n\n540\n00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.600\nSo, we wanna make sure that you at least\nunderstand how you see that information\n\n541\n00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.440\non the protocol right now.\n\n542\n00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.539\nBut we do have a lot of other\nprotocols that we need to talk about.\n\n543\n00:30:27.539 --> 00:30:29.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I probably ran out of time.\n\n544\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we did a little bit,\nbut that's okay.\n\n545\n00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.940\nReally understanding these protocols\nis going to be extremely beneficial,\n\n546\n00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.490\nwell not only for the exam, but\nunderstanding how the protocols work\n\n547\n00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.740\nwill help you in real life troubleshooting\nproblems that you will encounter.\n\n548\n00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.210\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nwrap up for this particular episode.\n\n549\n00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.450\nRemember, this was a review and\nI think there are other sources.\n\n550\n00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.450\nYou can go back to other videos if\nyou need to dig a little bit deeper.\n\n551\n00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.270\nIf you need to practice your subnetting or\nbinary conversion,\n\n552\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:02.180\nCisco even has free games on their\nwebsite that you might want to check out.\n\n553\n00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.490\nSo go ahead and do that, but we still have\na lot of information headed your way, so\n\n554\n00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.730\ndon't go anywhere.\n\n555\n00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.370\nFor this particular episode, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and sign off as your host.\n\n556\n00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.800\nRemember my name is Cherokee Boose.\n\n557\n00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n558\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.074\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at IT PRO TV.\n\n559\n00:31:16.074 -->

00:00:11.806\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:16.110\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.510\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800\nIn the last episode, we were able to\ntake a look at IP version four and\n\n7\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.620\nIP version six and understand\nthe differences between those two.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.610\nIn this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.050\nwe're going to go ahead and\ncontinue with some networking protocols.\n\n10\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.880\nWith us, in studios today,\nwe have Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.320\nThanks for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back,\nas we continue on in this kind of\n\n13\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.350\nlittle short series on\ndifferent networking protocols.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.200\nWe really explained the very\nimportance of IP protocol.\n\n15\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.180\nAnd we've talked about\nthe differences there and\n\n16\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.470\nsome of the things you need to make sure\nyou can focus in on and concentrate on.\n\n17\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.760\nBut of course there's several\nmore protocols we need to get to-\n\n18\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.180\n&gt;&gt; There are, where are we gonna start?\n\n19\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680\n&gt;&gt; And what we're gonna do is we\nare gonna start with of course\n\n20\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.140\nthe biggest protocol that we\nhave to deal with, which is TCP.\n\n21\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.070\nThe transmission control protocol itself,\nso that we understand what has to happen\n\n22\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.040\nwhen two computers end up\ntrying to communicate.\n\n23\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.010\nThe problem with computers\ncommunicating is, fairly simple.\n\n24\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.080\nOne computer could be ready to send, but\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320\nthe receiving computer might\nnot be ready to receive.\n\n26\n00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.360\nSo if that sending computer says,\nhey, I'm gonna send the traffic, and\n\n27\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.390\nthe receiving computer's not expecting the\ntraffic, well the only thing that's gonna\n\n28\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.500\nhappen are packets are gonna get lost,\nthey're gonna get dropped off sometime.\n\n29\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like when I'm talking to\nmy children when they're watching TV?\n\n30\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.385\n&gt;&gt; I would say yes.\n\n31\n00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very much so,\n\n32\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.990\nthey are going to ignore\nthe actual traffic.\n\n33\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.670\nSo yeah, that is a very good analogy,\nand what can happen?\n\n34\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.700\nSo, the way that TCP works, though,\n\n35\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700\nis that they begin at that idea of\nwhat they mean by protocol, right?\n\n36\n00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.434\nThese are the rules that are gonna\nhappen before we transmit data and\n\n37\n00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:54.951\nthat is the key behind TCP.\n\n38\n00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:57.200\nIs that certain things have to occur and\n\n39\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.820\nthe key here is really about\nsynchronization more than anything else.\n\n40\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.090\nThe idea of synchronization is\nthat the sending computer says,\n\n41\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.900\nhey I am ready to transmit data to on you.\n\n42\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.700\nAnd then your computer\nessentially comes back and\n\n43\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.770\nsays, well I am now ready to\nreceive traffic from you.\n\n44\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.680\nAnd when they agree that everything is\nactually good and the condition that needs\n\n45\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.140\nto be then transmission of that\ntraffic can start to happen.\n\n46\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.740\nAnd the way that works is\nover a three way handshake.\n\n47\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.550\nLet me go ahead and take.\n\n48\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.560\nLet's go ahead, excuse me,\nand let me go ahead.\n\n49\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.090\nBut let's go ahead and take a look at my\nmachine and I've made a little diagram\n\n50\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.279\nto make sure that we understand the\noperation of TCP at the very beginning.\n\n51\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.550\nSo here on my machine, and we take\na look at the upper right-hand corner.\n\n52\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.040\nI've made this very little simple diagram.\n\n53\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.686\nThe way that that synchronization really\nbegins is that when the sending computer\n\n54\n00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:53.649\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n55\n00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.748\nLet me see if I can zoom in\non that just a little bit.\n\n56\n00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:57.027\n&gt;&gt; They always name them like Bob and\nSally for\n\n57\n00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.180\nsome reason when they explain TCP.\n\n58\n00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just an easier way to talk when\nyou represent them with people instead.\n\n59\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.120\nSo here on the left hand side the sending\ncomputer says I am ready to send data.\n\n60\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.900\nAnd what they do is that they send what\nthey call a SYN packet which stands for\n\n61\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.390\nsynchronization in very short format.\n\n62\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.000\nAnd the receiving computer receives\nthat particular synchronization.\n\n63\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540\nNow I want to talk about what\nhappens when we do that.\n\n64\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo on the lower left hand side\nof certain things as we go on,\n\n65\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.050\nthis is the header for TCP.\n\n66\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.480\nNow the header will change over time,\n\n67\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.410\ndepending on what type of\ninformation is packed in there, but\n\n68\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.550\nreally at the beginning here is kind\nof the variable things we have in hand.\n\n69\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.540\nBut when we start talking about\nthe original synchronization,\n\n70\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.370\nthe three-way handshake to\nget everything established.\n\n71\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.240\nIt really comes down to this\ninformation right here and\n\n72\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.510\nthis is what we call different\nflags that are actually set.\n\n73\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.560\nThere's an urgent flag,\nthere's an acknowledgment,\n\n74\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.060\nthere's a push, there's a reset,\nthere's a syn and there's a fin.\n\n75\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.360\nNow when it first begins,\nthis is the only flag that is actually set\n\n76\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.020\nright at the beginning here,\nwhich is the sync packet, okay.\n\n77\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.490\nSo this particular flag will be turned on,\nso that when the receiving\n\n78\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.010\ncomputer gets that, it knows that\nit is time for synchronization.\n\n79\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.720\nSo when that receiving computer gets\nthat packet, it has to do two things.\n\n80\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.430\nThe first thing it has to do\nis acknowledge that it has\n\n81\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.310\nthe synchronization packet, so it sends\nback what we call an acknowledgement.\n\n82\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.680\nBut then, because it knows there's\ngoing to be an exchange, says, hey,\n\n83\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.270\nsince you're syncing up with me,\nwhy don't I also sync up to you as well?\n\n84\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.990\nSo in that return package back to\nthe sending computer it marks two flags.\n\n85\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.040\nIt marks the synchronization.\n\n86\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.540\nAnd it also marks the acknowledgement here\nso that now when the receiving computer\n\n87\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.340\nnow or the original sending computer\ngets that particular header back.\n\n88\n00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.340\nIt now understands that it sees the sync\nand the acknowledgement flags marked, and\n\n89\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.310\nthat's what starts to happen here.\n\n90\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.830\n&gt;&gt; So just to kind of dummy it\ndown a little bit for us here,\n\n91\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.180\nRonnie, that's a very great\ntechnical explanation.\n\n92\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.050\nAnd so basically what you're saying is,\nthat blue SYN packet,\n\n93\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.900\nthat could be Bob trying to\nget the attention of Sally.\n\n94\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.370\nAnd Bob says,\nhey Sally I want to talk to you.\n\n95\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.520\nAnd then Sally might be busy and she says,\nI see that you want to talk to me.\n\n96\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.700\nSo now this is the beginning\nof that communication there.\n\n97\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.840\nSo that's I guess the two parts.\n\n98\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.070\nSo then what would be third part\nof that three-way handshake?\n\n99\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that idea is really kind\nof the analogy that we have.\n\n100\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.770\nIf the other person doesn't respond at\nall, we won't get an acknowledgement,\n\n101\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.940\nwe definitely won't get a synchronization\nmessage, unless the idea that the person\n\n102\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.710\nsays hey look, I'm not trying to sync up\nbecause you're trying to sync up here,\n\n103\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.080\nI'm not acknowledging yours.\n\n104\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.280\nI'm just going to start a new\nconversation with the SYN,\n\n105\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.900\nwell that starts it over\nfrom the other side.\n\n106\n00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.170\nBut if they get both, they realize that\nit's actually acknowledging the original\n\n107\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.440\nsync here, and there's a sequence\nnumber that goes along with that.\n\n108\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.980\nAnd then matching that up, and now that\nactually has the attention of both.\n\n109\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.670\nSo the final acknowledgement then,\nand this three-way handshake.\n\n110\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.010\nSo here's the first handshake,\nhere's the second one.\n\n111\n00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.600\nThe third one is simply sending\nback an acknowledgement which,\n\n112\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.890\nif let me see if I scroll out here.\n\n113\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.370\nAnd zoom back in,\nit just marks this acknowledgement here or\n\n114\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.430\nthis ACK packet is what it does or flag.\n\n115\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.050\nOnce that's done, both sides agree\nthat now they've actually got,\n\n116\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.470\nwell, the information that says,\nI am ready to receive packets.\n\n117\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.890\nThe sending computer says,\nI am ready to send information.\n\n118\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.445\nAnd this is when data packets can\nthen be exchanged between the two.\n\n119\n00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Now my kids can listen to me.\n\n120\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.950\n&gt;&gt; In theory, you're correct.\n\n121\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.830\nIf you actually take this into\nthe realm of behaviors, right?\n\n122\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.675\nWell, it is kinda the same idea,\nthat you have to make sure that you get\n\n123\n00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.292\nthe attention first before you\ncan transmit that information.\n\n124\n00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Transmit.\n\n125\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.178\n&gt;&gt; If not, it is like yelling at them and\n\n126\n00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:03.490\nthen not realizing they didn't hear\na single word that you said [CROSSTALK].\n\n127\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.300\n&gt;&gt; They have their earbuds in.\n\n128\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.110\n&gt;&gt; Earbuds or\nthey are listening to the TV,\n\n129\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.700\nor they're listening to what\nis considered music today.\n\n130\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.480\nI know I'm joking.\n\n131\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.540\nIf you love music today, my apologies.\n\n132\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.270\nI'm, start from the 70s and the early 80s.\n\n133\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.310\nSo forgive me if everything\nelse sounds like noise to me.\n\n134\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.770\nBut just realize that you have that,\nshe have that happen.\n\n135\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.310\nAnd at the very beginning of,\nof course, TCP/IP networking model,\n\n136\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.240\nthis was really the only\ntraffic that it wanted to do.\n\n137\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.780\nSo the hard thing about this is\nit's relatively slow in comparison.\n\n138\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, look at all that information\nthat has to be sorted through.\n\n139\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.580\nIf you look right there, that is a lot\nthat these devices have to read and\n\n140\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.880\nunderstand.\n\n141\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.660\nSo, we do have that guarantee,\nit's a connection based,\n\n142\n00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.930\nits a guaranteed connection.\n\n143\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.900\n&gt;&gt; Yep, connection oriented.\n\n144\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.178\n&gt;&gt; Connection oriented, but\nit does have a lot of extra work, so\n\n145\n00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:54.888\nit is a little bit slower there.\n\n146\n00:07:54.888 --> 00:07:58.848\n&gt;&gt; Yep it turned out that the header\nhere is much larger than what we would\n\n147\n00:07:58.848 --> 00:08:02.058\nnormally see for The ID,\nwhat we'll call UBD traffic,\n\n148\n00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:04.614\nwhich we'll take a look\nat in just a moment.\n\n149\n00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:07.440\nBut overall though,\nhere's kind of the very beginning,\n\n150\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.151\nis that we're saying both\nsides are synchronized up and\n\n151\n00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.870\nthey are ready to receive, and\nthey're ready to send traffic.\n\n152\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.320\nSo this allows us to say that\nthe communication is connection oriented.\n\n153\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.966\nIf we don't have a connection,\nwe don't send the data.\n\n154\n00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:23.673\nAnd this makes up about probably 80,\n\n155\n00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:28.513\nI'm gonna say maybe even 85% of all\nthe protocols that we tend to use\n\n156\n00:08:28.513 --> 00:08:33.100\nacross networks is the idea\nof some type of TCP traffic.\n\n157\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.640\nAnytime that you connect, let's say for\nan example, to a web server,\n\n158\n00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.260\nyou're having to establish this\nthing first to make that happen.\n\n159\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.520\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n160\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.923\nAs well we use kind of example that I\nhave already used before I'm going to go\n\n161\n00:08:47.923 --> 00:08:53.440\nahead and do a packet capture.\n\n162\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.205\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n\n163\n00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:58.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say it one day correctly\na packet capture on my computer and\n\n164\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.780\nI'm simply gonna go to the ITProTV\nwebsite is what I'm gonna do.\n\n165\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.930\nSo I'm gonna select that interface and\npackets.\n\n166\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.534\nAnd then bring this up and go to ITProTV.\n\n167\n00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:12.351\nAnd let's make sure that we\nestablish our connection.\n\n168\n00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:16.604\nAnd that's the website that has now\ncome in and we're good and ready to go.\n\n169\n00:09:16.604 --> 00:09:20.729\nI'm simply going to stop the capture and\n\n170\n00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:26.927\nfrom this point on let's see if\nI can do this, and go to HTTP.\n\n171\n00:09:26.927 --> 00:09:32.616\nAnd as I scroll down here, something\nactually has been permanently moved.\n\n172\n00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:36.110\nI'm trying to make sure that we actually\nstart seeing some of the information\n\n173\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.763\nthat we need.\n\n174\n00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:44.724\nMaybe, Let's see right here there we go.\n\n175\n00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:48.099\nSo right at the beginning, let's take\na look, I'm starting to look at this\n\n176\n00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:50.740\ninformation right over here\nwhich is the acknowledgment so\n\n177\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.878\nthat we can see\nthe information coming across.\n\n178\n00:09:52.878 --> 00:09:58.499\nSo I'm gonna scroll back all the way\nup here, see where I can find the TCP.\n\n179\n00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:01.650\nI'm actually getting all\nthe acknowledgments.\n\n180\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.831\n&gt;&gt; So, what you're showing us here is,\nactually,\n\n181\n00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:08.403\nvisually looking at three-way\nhandshake occurring.\n\n182\n00:10:08.403 --> 00:10:12.470\nBy looking at these IP addresses\nsource and the destination addresses.\n\n183\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was trying to make\nsure that I saw the whole thing.\n\n184\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.680\nAnd that begins with this packet 676,\nright here.\n\n185\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.270\nAnd then, notice it jumps a few and\nactually picks up again.\n\n186\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.191\nNotice that here's my computer\ngoing to the ITProTV website.\n\n187\n00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.550\nAnd before I actually establish with HTTP,\n\n188\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.920\nthis starts off with\nTCP as the connection.\n\n189\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.635\nTell me what port I'm going to,\n64713 to port 80.\n\n190\n00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.180\nAnd here is the beginning\nof that synchronization.\n\n191\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.580\nSo we see the SYN packet.\n\n192\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Our first handshake.\n\n193\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.819\n&gt;&gt; The first handshake And then the second\npart is when that web server responds.\n\n194\n00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:50.147\nSo here's ITProTV's web server,\ncoming all the way back to me.\n\n195\n00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:55.500\nAnd then notice, here is the SYN,\nACK, that it's actually getting.\n\n196\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.800\nAnd then of course,\nthe final and the third one,\n\n197\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.370\nif I can make sure that I see that\ncorrectly there it is on this one.\n\n198\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.150\nI should have highlighted it.\n\n199\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.730\nThat would actually have made it simpler.\n\n200\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.184\nSo there's SYN, SYN, ACK,\nand acknowledgement.\n\n201\n00:11:07.184 --> 00:11:12.571\nRemember that once we get a three way\nhandshake then we can start sending and\n\n202\n00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.864\nreceiving data.\n\n203\n00:11:13.864 --> 00:11:19.527\nAnd this is where my computer sent\na get request from the website itself.\n\n204\n00:11:19.527 --> 00:11:21.407\nAnd now once we start doing that,\n\n205\n00:11:21.407 --> 00:11:24.912\nthis is where it starts actually\nsending data back and forth.\n\n206\n00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:27.199\nAnd there's the application data.\n\n207\n00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:30.962\nLet me see,\nthere's some other things here, 192.\n\n208\n00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:33.159\nBut that way you can at least see that,\n\n209\n00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:37.010\nthat is the very beginning of\nwhat you're taking a look at.\n\n210\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.660\nThe SYN, the SYN ACK and\nthe acknowledgment and\n\n211\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.792\nthen that's where traffic can now\nflow back and forth in between.\n\n212\n00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n213\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.130\nSo that TCP is a really important process.\n\n214\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.995\nWhen you start seeing this information and\n\n215\n00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:50.923\nyou know that the connection\nis good first.\n\n216\n00:11:50.923 --> 00:11:53.365\nBut remember that attacks\ncan also come this way.\n\n217\n00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:58.515\nIf they happen not to actually\nrespond to the idea of the SYN ACK or\n\n218\n00:11:58.515 --> 00:12:02.445\nthis ACK package, and\nwe essentially leave that connection open.\n\n219\n00:12:02.445 --> 00:12:06.725\nAnd that way it actually never makes\nits final connection that it needs to.\n\n220\n00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:10.810\nSo just knowing where you can view\nthis information is also key here.\n\n221\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.109\nBut remember that that is\na part of what you do see,\n\n222\n00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.870\nwhen you start to take\na look as well okay.\n\n223\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.272\nAll right, so we're probably going to use\nthis information a little bit more in just\n\n224\n00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:22.016\na moment, but\n\n225\n00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:26.053\nthat's really kind of the very beginnings\nwhen you start talking about TCP.\n\n226\n00:12:26.053 --> 00:12:30.122\nThe other thing of course that TCP does\nis the idea of error correction, when it\n\n227\n00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:34.390\nneeds to, and that really has to do with\nwhen data packets arrive out of sequence.\n\n228\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.479\nThat it then can actually arrive\nat the receiving machine and\n\n229\n00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:42.730\nuse sequence numbers,\nI'm gonna say that, sequence numbers\n\n230\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.990\nto help put everything back into\nthe order that it needs to be, as well.\n\n231\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.870\nSo we can do error\ncorrection by using TCP and\n\n232\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.750\nthere's a lot of other\ninformation that TCP offers us.\n\n233\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.640\nAnd you can see that there's\nthis amount of information.\n\n234\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.540\nSequence numbers,\nacknowledgment ports that we tend to use.\n\n235\n00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.700\nThe checksum for the error correction\npointers, and other options.\n\n236\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.050\nAnd of course, the data that we attach\nto it all that is key in fundamental,\n\n237\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.193\nwhen we start taking a look at the use\nof TCP, very important protocol,\n\n238\n00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:19.645\nmake sure you at least understand\nthose basics as well, and\n\n239\n00:13:19.645 --> 00:13:23.512\nyou'll se that all these information\nwill actually come to play,\n\n240\n00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:26.654\nespecially in doing the analysis\nthat you have to do.\n\n241\n00:13:26.654 --> 00:13:33.128\nSo that then leads us to UDP,\nUser Datagram Protocol.\n\n242\n00:13:33.128 --> 00:13:37.517\nNow what is it about user data\ngram protocol that we needed and\n\n243\n00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.076\nwe have TCP, right.\n\n244\n00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:42.197\nThe most amazing thing is,\nif I establish that connection,\n\n245\n00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:46.421\nif I synchronise with every partner that\nI need to to send guaranteed traffic, and\n\n246\n00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.889\nthat's what it does\nconnection orientation.\n\n247\n00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:51.954\nMeans I got the attention of\nthe other side, I know that\n\n248\n00:13:51.954 --> 00:13:56.365\nwe could fully communicate and I can\nsend data and data shouldn't be missing.\n\n249\n00:13:56.365 --> 00:14:01.595\nWell, we have that but the very fact\nis they also added in later inside\n\n250\n00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:06.295\nof the TCP/IP protocol stack UDP,\nUser Datagram Protocol.\n\n251\n00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:11.610\nAnd that is because they realized that\nnot every bit of information requires\n\n252\n00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.937\nthe complete connection or even error\ncorrection happened, as well okay.\n\n253\n00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:20.523\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kind of had this thought here,\njust kind of popped into my head.\n\n254\n00:14:20.523 --> 00:14:23.020\nHave you ever watched Willy Wonka,\nthe original?\n\n255\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.710\n&gt;&gt; I believe I have.\n\n256\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.520\n&gt;&gt; Was the girl's name Varuka or\nsomething?\n\n257\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Sounds familiar, yeah.\n\n258\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.280\n&gt;&gt; The bratty one?\nShe's like I want it and I want it now!\n\n259\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.646\nAnd I think she was talking about the\ngolden ticket or some kinda squirrel or\n\n260\n00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:34.243\nsomething.\n\n261\n00:14:34.243 --> 00:14:37.762\nBut anyways, that's kind of\nthe world we're living in, right?\n\n262\n00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:41.681\nSo, you look at this tether info and\nthere's, it's a lot smaller,\n\n263\n00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:46.073\nthere's a lot less information that\nwe see here, and that's because well,\n\n264\n00:14:46.073 --> 00:14:49.519\nwe want the speed and we want it now,\nand we want our Netflix to\n\n265\n00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:53.267\nstream without buffering and\nthat's where UDP comes in to play.\n\n266\n00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:57.935\nAny of those real time Protocols,\nas we're seeing UDP being utilized.\n\n267\n00:14:57.935 --> 00:15:02.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, UDP really works well\nin situations where we do need\n\n268\n00:15:02.564 --> 00:15:07.750\nreal live time to actually be\na consistent in what we want.\n\n269\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.180\nWith TCP types of traffic, right?\n\n270\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.930\nIf I drop a packet, it means that the\nreceiving computer is going to send back\n\n271\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.550\na request to essentially retrieve\nwhatever pack has been lost.\n\n272\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.630\nWell that can cause unusual\nloops in data being sent and\n\n273\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.600\nthen data being late and\ncertain things that will happen there.\n\n274\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.970\nSo what ends up happening with UDP is that\n\n275\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.900\nwhen we see this idea of a request\nbeing sent to get any data.\n\n276\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.820\nThe other side doesn't wait and go,\n\n277\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.590\nlet me synchronize first, it just says you\nrequested data, I'm just gonna send it.\n\n278\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.036\nAnd then if there's any other\nacknowledgement that comes along\n\n279\n00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.410\nthat says,\nhey are you getting this or not?\n\n280\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.919\nThe only thing that this\nparticular side is gonna do,\n\n281\n00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:54.544\nthe receiving side that made the initial\nrequest is, just keep sending it and\n\n282\n00:15:54.544 --> 00:15:57.592\nsend it as fast as you can go,\nthat's all it really cares about.\n\n283\n00:15:57.592 --> 00:16:00.678\nIt doesn't want to acknowledge\nthat it needs a handshake or\n\n284\n00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:02.788\nanything, it just wants the data back.\n\n285\n00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:07.252\nBut that includes, it doesn't actually\nsend back any request as well for\n\n286\n00:16:07.252 --> 00:16:09.708\nany packets that are dropped or missed.\n\n287\n00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.627\n&gt;&gt; Sure, best effort.\n\n288\n00:16:11.627 --> 00:16:12.436\nThat's why you hear that term.\n\n289\n00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:13.880\nBut, hey, you know what?\n\n290\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.160\nAnd I love that analogy where people\nsay it's like sending a letter.\n\n291\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.430\nWhereas TCP is sending that\nletter via registered mail,\n\n292\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.650\nyou have to sign for it and\nget that acknowledgement.\n\n293\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.830\nWhereas with UDP I'm gonna put the stamp\non it and just hope it gets to you Ronnie.\n\n294\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.463\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much about it for\nthe way that this works.\n\n295\n00:16:31.463 --> 00:16:36.013\nAnd you might be wondering like, why would\nanybody ever choose that one over TCP when\n\n296\n00:16:36.013 --> 00:16:40.760\nI have the good solid connection I know\nevery data packets going to get there?\n\n297\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.245\nThe reason why is that sometimes the idea\nof receiving the packets in the order that\n\n298\n00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:49.478\nthey need to be received Is more important\nthan getting every single packet.\n\n299\n00:16:49.478 --> 00:16:50.867\nAnd that sounds strange, right?\n\n300\n00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:52.613\nCuz it sounded strange to me\nthe first time I heard it.\n\n301\n00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:56.430\nI was like, why would that be as\nimportant as actually getting everything.\n\n302\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.363\nWell think about the idea of a telephone\nconversation in something like this right?\n\n303\n00:17:01.363 --> 00:17:02.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or our show.\n\n304\n00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:03.632\n&gt;&gt; Or our show, yeah.\n\n305\n00:17:03.632 --> 00:17:05.651\nIt actually may be more\nimportant than that.\n\n306\n00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:09.956\nSo the idea of actually being able to\nreceive that data is actually going to be\n\n307\n00:17:09.956 --> 00:17:11.240\nkey for us.\n\n308\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.180\nBecause if we stop to actually have\nevery single packet that we drop\n\n309\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.009\nover our streaming, having to be\nretrieved again by your computer.\n\n310\n00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:22.842\n&gt;&gt; And\nreinserted it at a later moment in time.\n\n311\n00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:24.058\n&gt;&gt; Reinsert it, yeah,\nit's not gonna make sense.\n\n312\n00:17:24.058 --> 00:17:27.279\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll have words being\ninterjected into Ronnie's next sentence\n\n313\n00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:30.207\nand you're gonna be trying to decipher,\nwhat is he talking about.\n\n314\n00:17:30.207 --> 00:17:33.645\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and so\nthose are really kind of important things.\n\n315\n00:17:33.645 --> 00:17:36.395\nThe streaming of the data\nallows us to send the data\n\n316\n00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:39.290\nas fast as we possibly\ncan at the same time.\n\n317\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.156\nWith whatever your computer can receive,\nbut\n\n318\n00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:45.691\nalso not worry about it as long\nas it still isn't too bad.\n\n319\n00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:46.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n320\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.720\n&gt;&gt; If you miss a couple of\n\n321\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.570\nwords in Ronnie's sentence,\nhumans just have that ability to kind\n\n322\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.974\nof read in-between the lines,\nyou'll fill in the gap.\n\n323\n00:17:52.974 --> 00:17:57.610\nSo sometimes, in that situation, it would\nbe more preferable or to utilize UDP.\n\n324\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.160\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's definitely gonna be\nsomething you're gonna see more often, and\n\n325\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.680\nthere's even things we don't think about\nthat really does require UDP traffic.\n\n326\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.938\nSo whenever we create tunneling, it\ndoesn't need us to establish everything.\n\n327\n00:18:09.938 --> 00:18:15.400\nSo a lot of the new tunneling methods\nalso use UDP, DMS uses UDP, you name it,\n\n328\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.590\nthere's a lot of what we tend to see\nthere, is always based on the idea of UDP.\n\n329\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.430\nSo let's take a look at this\nusing Wireshark as well.\n\n330\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.547\nSo since I mentioned a protocol that\nwe can actually see UDP work on,\n\n331\n00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:32.014\nlet's see if we can make that work here.\n\n332\n00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:34.910\nI've not had success in restarting this.\n\n333\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.120\nLet's see if I can\ncontinue without saving.\n\n334\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.080\nLet me take that out, there we go.\n\n335\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.040\nSo I've got a traffic flowing,\nwhich is perfectly fine, and\n\n336\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.550\nI do see UDP messages coming up.\n\n337\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.500\nLet me go ahead and try this again, okay.\n\n338\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.592\nWhenever we do some type of lookup,\nso let me see here.\n\n339\n00:18:51.592 --> 00:18:55.740\nI'm actually gonna type in the,\nlet's just just bring up I'm trying to\n\n340\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.530\nthink of something that I really\nhaven't looked up before.\n\n341\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:07.615\nSo I'll say, we're talking\nAustralian news cast interruption.\n\n342\n00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:10.780\nAll right, so\nwe'll see there's something like that.\n\n343\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.360\nWell that's fine,\nit doesn't matter what it is, okay.\n\n344\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.440\nNow, what I did there, right,\nis try to find a particular\n\n345\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.910\nbit of information using something\nlike DNS error and we'll see if I can.\n\n346\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.690\nActually, let me do it differently here\nand this will actually make it work.\n\n347\n00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.745\nLet me do nslookup and\n\n348\n00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:33.019\nwe'll do something let's say www.\n\n349\n00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:35.202\nHow do you spell miley?\n\n350\n00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:36.206\n&gt;&gt; C-Y-R-U-S.\n\n351\n00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:36.904\n&gt;&gt; Mileycyrus.com.\n\n352\n00:19:36.904 --> 00:19:37.960\nLet's do that, all right.\n\n353\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.630\nSo, look at that,\nall these wonderful places which\n\n354\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.590\nI did not know it actually existed,\nshows me the service that I use here.\n\n355\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.680\nI'm just trying to get DNS to work,\nthat's what I was trying to do here.\n\n356\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.480\nSo let me stop this capture, and\n\n357\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.720\nthen we'll kind of point out\na couple of things here.\n\n358\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.930\nLet's just do DNS, and let's see if we\ncan spot some different information.\n\n359\n00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.020\nHere, it did do a few things.\n\n360\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.424\nBut there it is, there's standard here.\n\n361\n00:20:08.852 --> 00:20:11.436\nThere it is, I was trying to make sure\nit actually showed what I wanted.\n\n362\n00:20:11.436 --> 00:20:17.271\nSo over on the last one here,\nthis is 5230.\n\n363\n00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:20.076\nLet me see if I can screen this in.\n\n364\n00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:22.765\n5230 and this is my machine.\n\n365\n00:20:22.765 --> 00:20:26.357\nThat 14.71 going out to the DNS server.\n\n366\n00:20:26.357 --> 00:20:29.430\nSo there's the standard query\nas we come across there.\n\n367\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.640\nNotice that on the frame underneath and\nhere is where the key is.\n\n368\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.330\nNotice that it's the user\ndatagram protocol.\n\n369\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.320\nSo this is not waiting for\nthe connection for the TCP to happen.\n\n370\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.470\nThis is absolutely showing that.\n\n371\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.230\nSo that's why we don't see the send,\nthe send ACK, and the ACK.\n\n372\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.450\nIt's simply returning or initializing or\nsending out that data immediately.\n\n373\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.561\nAnd, of course the response, if I can\nscroll down and see that response.\n\n374\n00:20:55.561 --> 00:20:59.971\n&gt;&gt; And here, by knowing your port numbers\nyou can easily identify port number 53 for\n\n375\n00:20:59.971 --> 00:21:02.932\nDNS, So that's where it comes\ninto with security, and\n\n376\n00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:06.969\nthat's why it is so essential to know\nyour port number at this point as well.\n\n377\n00:21:06.969 --> 00:21:09.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here you do end up seeing,\nthere it is,\n\n378\n00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:13.350\nuser data RAM protocol as well,\nbeing able to do that.\n\n379\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.050\nNow, remember to take a look at\n\n380\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.300\nthe information itself per\npacket is what you wanna see.\n\n381\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.950\nUDP doesn't shop as easily\nas it does except for\n\n382\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.470\nwhat's right here on the protocol.\n\n383\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.910\nIf I were to change the protocol to UDP.\n\n384\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.176\nThis is where we might all be\nable to see just a, I don't see.\n\n385\n00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:36.117\nI thought I saw some UDP, there's one,\nI don't even know what this one is for.\n\n386\n00:21:36.117 --> 00:21:41.014\nSo here is another one that shows you\nregular standard UDP packet instead\n\n387\n00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:43.370\nof using the protocol DNS.\n\n388\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.080\nAnd you can see right here, here's\nanother one that shows up the same way.\n\n389\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.480\nSo if it doesn't show up as\njust UDP in the protocol,\n\n390\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.540\nremember that some of those\nprotocols really only use UDP.\n\n391\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.150\nAnd that's something that we also want to\nconsider and take a look at as well, okay.\n\n392\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.630\nSo it's very key that we understand\nhow we can look up this traffic and\n\n393\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.950\nhow we can identify it at the same time\nis what we're also gonna end up seeing.\n\n394\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.080\nSo that brings us to kind of the last big\n\n395\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.380\nprotocol that we're going to talk about\nhere, let me stop that for right now.\n\n396\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.460\nAnd we'll leave this\nkind of up as we need to.\n\n397\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.960\nBut the last one is the ICMP,\nokay, the Internet, IC,\n\n398\n00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.060\nInternet control messaging protocol.\n\n399\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.160\nThere's another one that sounds\nvery similar which is IGMP,\n\n400\n00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.340\nthe Internet group messaging protocol.\n\n401\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.320\nBut we're focusing in on ICMP.\n\n402\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.390\nMost of us when we start to use ICMP\nreally learned about it through\n\n403\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.660\nour basic troubleshooting at the beginning\nwhen we start learning about networking.\n\n404\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.810\nWhich, of course, is using ping.\n\n405\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.940\nIf I can scroll out here to help us out.\n\n406\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.810\nSo if I wanted to verify\nthat something was up and\n\n407\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.638\noperational, I'm simply gonna\nping the ITProTV website.\n\n408\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.890\nPing is a protocol that we use\nthat's actually an ICMP protocol\n\n409\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.720\nthat's called a type 8\nICMP message instead.\n\n410\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.602\nAnd that actually has a class or\na code type of 0.\n\n411\n00:23:13.602 --> 00:23:18.294\nNotice that what I'm getting back here is\nof course, all of these information and\n\n412\n00:23:18.294 --> 00:23:22.918\nwhat you are also seeing is right here,\nwhere it shows you the sequence number and\n\n413\n00:23:22.918 --> 00:23:25.230\nit says it's actually working on ICMP.\n\n414\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.340\nThat's actually kind of a key\naspect of what we generally use,\n\n415\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.810\nsomething like ICMP4.\n\n416\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.520\nICMP is a protocol that's\nalso encapsulated within IP,\n\n417\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.970\nthe IP protocol itself.\n\n418\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.203\nThat allows now for us to do ping\nbecause routes the traffic as well and\n\n419\n00:23:45.203 --> 00:23:47.662\nbrings us back into what we need.\n\n420\n00:23:47.662 --> 00:23:52.838\nSo not only do we use something\nlike this to help us with ICMP,\n\n421\n00:23:52.838 --> 00:23:58.024\nbut we can also do things like\ntrace route, and, let me see.\n\n422\n00:23:58.024 --> 00:24:00.625\nI'll just do a portion of it here.\n\n423\n00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:03.536\nFor one reason or another, I know I was\ndoing this a little bit earlier and\n\n424\n00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:04.888\nit kept timing out after a while.\n\n425\n00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:06.440\nBut this is actually good,\n\n426\n00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.630\nbecause even the idea of trace route\nis not really a protocol unto itself.\n\n427\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.118\nIt's an ICMP message that's, I think,\na type 11, if I remember right, yep,\n\n428\n00:24:15.118 --> 00:24:15.780\ntype 11.\n\n429\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.840\nAnd it uses what we call the TTL\nexceeded limit, is the way that it uses.\n\n430\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.112\nSo now notice that right here on,\n\n431\n00:24:23.112 --> 00:24:28.560\nafter number four on long the routers on\nthe internet before it gets to ITProTV.\n\n432\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.520\nIt's essentially saying,\nhey, this timed out.\n\n433\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.560\nThe next route is actually\nsaying it timed out as well.\n\n434\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.630\nIt's continuing to show\nthese time out messages.\n\n435\n00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.980\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't always mean that\nthat device is down or inoperable.\n\n436\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.799\nSometimes devices will also\nblock ICMP traffic, so\n\n437\n00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:50.540\nit just may mean that there is no route\navailable to that device for you to view.\n\n438\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.800\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much key here.\n\n439\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.727\nSo we're gonna take a look in WireShark\nat both of those different protocols so\n\n440\n00:24:56.727 --> 00:24:59.530\nthat we can see just a little\nbit of information as well.\n\n441\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.180\nSo hopeful I've actually captured\nenough packets at this point.\n\n442\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.560\nWhen we take a look at the display filter,\n\n443\n00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.920\nyou may think that right here on this\ndisplay filter, I simply type in ping.\n\n444\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.400\nWell, it has a ping-pong protocol, but it\ndoesn't seem to have anything like ping.\n\n445\n00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.340\nLet me try trace route, let's do that.\n\n446\n00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.845\nRemember that in like Mac and\nof course Linux, and even,\n\n447\n00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:25.070\nprobably in a trace route\nyou actually spell it out.\n\n448\n00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.265\nIn Windows it would be Trace RT and\nsomething like that.\n\n449\n00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:30.510\nTracert as a lot of people call it.\n\n450\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.310\nBut notice it's not its\nown defined protocol.\n\n451\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.740\nBut if I were to change this to ICMP.\n\n452\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.297\n&gt;&gt; And they kinda try to help us\nout there a little bit by putting\n\n453\n00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:43.998\nred if you're typing the incorrect\nprotocol in that field and\n\n454\n00:25:43.998 --> 00:25:48.860\nwhereas you can see Ronnie has green, so\nit's an acceptable form in that field.\n\n455\n00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n456\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.730\nDon't get me wrong, this is not something\nthat you can learn overnight or\n\n457\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.170\nwithin ten minutes here.\n\n458\n00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.181\nIt's something you do have\nto know the protocols and\n\n459\n00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:58.200\nyou do have to understand\nwhat they're doing here.\n\n460\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.611\nSo at the very beginning when you\nstart to actually do a request,\n\n461\n00:26:02.611 --> 00:26:08.100\na ping request, which is an echo request\nhere, is a type eight with a code zero.\n\n462\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.146\nThe key behind this is that even\nthough most of the time when\n\n463\n00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:16.689\nyou take a look in terms of firewalls,\nand especially on the ASA,\n\n464\n00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:20.840\nthey'll list this code type\nhere as being the port number.\n\n465\n00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.520\nTechnically it's not a port number,\nit's a type number.\n\n466\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.480\nBut most people use it as a port number as\nwell, so make sure you understand that.\n\n467\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.890\nThat there is a distinction,\nthat there is a difference,\n\n468\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.610\nthey're probably not gonna be that\npicky on this CISCO exam for it.\n\n469\n00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.155\nBut I know something like in real world\nthe very fact on the analysis and stuff,\n\n470\n00:26:38.155 --> 00:26:40.960\nespecially if you're doing\nsomething like a job interview.\n\n471\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.910\nThey may ask you something fairly\nunusually insane, or inane I should say.\n\n472\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.030\nWhat port does ping operate on?\n\n473\n00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.810\nMost of us would automatically\njump to port eight.\n\n474\n00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.736\nTechnically, it's not actually\na port that it operates on,\n\n475\n00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:57.320\nit's a type that it operates on.\n\n476\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.640\nSo it's something just\nkind of off to the side.\n\n477\n00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:06.040\nThe reply itself is going to be\na type zero as far as reply goes.\n\n478\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.299\nIf I scroll down a little bit,\nwell actually a lot more,\n\n479\n00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:09.610\nthere's where I want to get to.\n\n480\n00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:18.620\nThis is where traceroute begins, and the\nprotocol that really uses an ICMP type 11.\n\n481\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.460\nSo if I scroll down, notice my type 11,\nwhich is right here.\n\n482\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:29.697\nAnd you'll see the actual subtype,\nwhich is Time-to-live exceeded,\n\n483\n00:27:29.697 --> 00:27:35.660\nand that is another key for us when we\nstart to take a look at ICMP as well.\n\n484\n00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.692\nSo trace route as well as Ping, they\nare not going to be their own protocols,\n\n485\n00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.220\nthey're gonna be listed under ICMP.\n\n486\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.550\nThere are a lot of other\nprotocols that we use.\n\n487\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.870\nICMP can also be used in building routing\ntables, such as on a Cisco router as well.\n\n488\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.740\nThey can maintain routing tables,\nit can do a lot for us.\n\n489\n00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.970\nBut when we start taking one\nwe got in troubleshooting,\n\n490\n00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.350\nthis is the information that\nwe're normally looking for.\n\n491\n00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.409\nAnd in terms of analysis,\n\n492\n00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:03.710\nit's something that can really\nshow us a bit more information.\n\n493\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.565\nSo being able to see these\nthings in live capture, and\n\n494\n00:28:06.565 --> 00:28:09.240\nunderstanding how to capture them,\nis also key.\n\n495\n00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.676\nMaking sure we understand what\nthe process and their functions are,\n\n496\n00:28:11.676 --> 00:28:13.140\nare also going to be key for us.\n\n497\n00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.430\nAnd that's what we've\ntaken a look at here.\n\n498\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n499\n00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.644\nSo, in this show, we were able to look\nat TCP transmission control protocol and\n\n500\n00:28:24.644 --> 00:28:27.940\nhow it differs from UDP,\nuser datagram protocol.\n\n501\n00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.380\nAnd in what situations,\nwe might choose one versus the other.\n\n502\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.563\nAnd then we were also introduced to\na couple different variations here for\n\n503\n00:28:35.563 --> 00:28:36.510\nICMP messages.\n\n504\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.461\nWe looked at ping with WireShark and\nwe also are able to look at Traceroute,\n\n505\n00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:43.650\nwhich are both great\ntrouble-shooting utilities.\n\n506\n00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.830\nSo stay tuned.\n\n507\n00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.330\nWe have a lot more protocols headed\nyour way, but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n508\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.470\nsign off for this show.\n\n509\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.870\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Buse.\n\n510\n00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n511\n00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.969\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n512\n00:28:55.969 --> 00:29:01.787\n[MUSIC]\n\n513\n00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:05.277\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:16.268\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:19.120\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.430\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at basic networking services.\n\n8\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.980\nWith us today in studios\nwe have Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.530\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me here,\n\n11\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.720\nas we continue on to learn\nmore about the idea of some of\n\n12\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.840\nthe fundamental things that we have to\nunderstand of course about networking.\n\n13\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.910\nIf we are gonna become\ncyber ops technicians, and\n\n14\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.530\nof course support people, we have to have\na solid foundation in terms of networking.\n\n15\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.130\nAnd one of the basic things that we\ndefinitely need to cover of course\n\n16\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.090\nis gonna be the realm of different\nservices that we tend to have\n\n17\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.160\nin that networking world.\n\n18\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.470\nWhen it comes down to regular LAN,\nlocal area networks, we tend to have some\n\n19\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830\ndifferent basic services that\nare always constantly running.\n\n20\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.210\nRight off the bat, I can normally think\nabout things like DNS running, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.030\nwe'll talk about that a little bit more.\n\n22\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.180\nWe also have DHCP a lot of times\nthat we need to understand and run.\n\n23\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.180\nAnd then at the very beginning when\nall the devices get plugged in,\n\n24\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.750\nwe normally also use ARP, or\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n25\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.550\nThose are kind of the three protocols or\nservices that we need to have a good solid\n\n26\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.410\nfoundational understanding of as we start\nto move into the realm of data analysis.\n\n27\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.810\nUnderstanding the process of\nhow each of those works so\n\n28\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.290\nthat we can troubleshoot\nthem when we need to, but\n\n29\n00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.520\nalso be able to spot the differences\nwhen it comes down to analysis.\n\n30\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.910\nOne of the hardest things to do when\nyou start moving into the world of data\n\n31\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.840\nanalysis, not data analysis, but the idea\nof security analysis, is you have to\n\n32\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.500\nremember kind of a basic fundamental\nCisco motto more than anything else.\n\n33\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000\nWhich is begin with what\nyou know should work.\n\n34\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.332\nAnd the only way for you to do that is to\nbegin by knowing how something like this\n\n35\n00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:00.610\nworks-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n36\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.330\n&gt;&gt; So that you can begin troubleshooting.\n\n37\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.790\nIf anything is out of the line,\n\n38\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.190\nsuch as a process not working, that is\nkind of a key for you to go, all right I\n\n39\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.030\nneed to focus in on this service and why\nit's not working in the way it needs to.\n\n40\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.910\nSo that's why we're going to spend\na little bit of time in different services\n\n41\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.100\nto make sure that we know what happens.\n\n42\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.330\nAnd the first one that we're going\nto talk about is the idea of ARP or\n\n43\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.310\nAddress Resolution Protocol.\n\n44\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.180\nNow Cherokee, you were saying just\nright before the show that you really\n\n45\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.930\ndo love ARP.\n\n46\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.560\nWhat's so amazing about the idea of ARP?\n\n47\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.950\n&gt;&gt; I like it because of the simplicity.\n\n48\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.480\nIt's very, very basic, and that's kind of,\n\n49\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.430\nit's also a drawback to\nARP because it is so\n\n50\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.380\nbasic there's not any kind of integrated\nsecurity, it utilizes antiquated.\n\n51\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.120\nWell, moving forward like we just\ntalked about previously with IP basics,\n\n52\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.680\ndoes not utilize\nbroadcasting transmissions,\n\n53\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.440\nwhich ARP are heavily relied into upon,\nso we are gonna be seeing,\n\n54\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.870\nmoving forward, this particular service\nbeing phased out, this protocol.\n\n55\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.680\nBut it's kind of like a welcomer,\na greeter,\n\n56\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.060\nlike you walk into Walmart and\nthey have greeters at the door.\n\n57\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.620\nAnd I guess that's kind of what is ARP is.\n\n58\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.800\nARP is address resolution protocol.\n\n59\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.260\nIt takes those IP addresses and, well,\nresolves them to Mac addresses and,\n\n60\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.590\njust to throw this out there,\nthere is the reverse.\n\n61\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.330\nFrom Mac to IP addresses,\nwhich is called RARP.\n\n62\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.744\nReverse Address Resolution Protocol, and\nI've actually seen it before on exams,\n\n63\n00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.074\nso something I like to keep in\nmind to keep it simple is IP is\n\n64\n00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:39.800\ncomposed of two letters and\nMAC is composed of three letters.\n\n65\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.050\nSo we know that two comes before three\njust so you can kind of keep those\n\n66\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.610\nseparated mentally, I don't know if\nthat helps or not but for me it does.\n\n67\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Address Resolution Protocol is\nkind of very neat because that's\n\n68\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.420\nreally the foundation of how\nthe devices on your own land\n\n69\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.040\nbegin to start the communication process.\n\n70\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.260\nAnd usually that's actually where we're\ngoing to see this information and\n\n71\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.700\nit normally is very pervasive\nthroughout your entire IP version for\n\n72\n00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.390\na network when you do something like this.\n\n73\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.090\nSo when you first get the components for\nyour network started.\n\n74\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.220\nSo lets say for an example you now have\nyour building, all of the cabling is put\n\n75\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.550\nin, in terms of your wall jacks going all\nthe way back to your patch panel and now\n\n76\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.720\nyou start to integrate in your own Cisco\nswitch into the building at that point.\n\n77\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.310\nYou plug in all of your different patch\ncablings into of course your switch.\n\n78\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.660\nNow people start bringing\ndevices onto the network.\n\n79\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.310\nWell right away, as you bring\ndevices onto your network, they can,\n\n80\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.130\nthey normally do if you have a couple of\nthings implemented in terms of services.\n\n81\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.490\nThey can begin communicating right away\nwithout anything else actually in place\n\n82\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.000\nand ARP is one of the first things that it\nhas to run through to be able to do so.\n\n83\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.770\nSo let's take a look at\na couple of different ones,\n\n84\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.580\nlet me make sure I'm actually on\nthe right one to help us out there, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.990\nSo let's talk about the idea\nof how ARP works just briefly.\n\n86\n00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Now here on my screen, right,\non this diagram it's a bit messy, but\n\n87\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.920\nit's meant to be so\nthat you can see how things work.\n\n88\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.970\nAs you start plugging in different\ndevices into this switch,\n\n89\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.800\nevery device normally has, of course,\nwhat, an IP address and a MAC address.\n\n90\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.230\nSo every single one of those have that.\n\n91\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.520\nWell, disconnected by themselves,\nit really doesn't matter so much.\n\n92\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.980\nBut when you connect them together,\nyou're saying you really want them to\n\n93\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.220\nhave the ability to\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n94\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.500\nThat means that the switch\nin the middle here\n\n95\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.990\nhas to be able to have some information.\n\n96\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.460\nSo it knows where to forward traffic to.\n\n97\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.120\nFor example, if I wanna forward\ntraffic from port number 1 here over\n\n98\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.840\nto port number 5, that means that\nthe switch has to know how to do so.\n\n99\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.790\nAnd the way that the switch is designed,\n\n100\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.140\nis it keeps a MAC address table,\nis what it does right here.\n\n101\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.830\n&gt;&gt; CAM table?\n\n102\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Content addressable memory?\n\n103\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.750\n&gt;&gt; Content addressable memory.\n\n104\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.300\nBut for\nus it's just simply the idea of saying,\n\n105\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.910\non that particular port number this\nis where a MAC address resides.\n\n106\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.580\nRemember that not every single device\nmay know what that MAC address.\n\n107\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.900\nSo in the very beginning,\nthis table may be absolutely, 100% blank.\n\n108\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.700\nSo what happens at that point is\nwhat Cherokee was talking about,\n\n109\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.550\na broadcast message goes\nout on the network from\n\n110\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.390\nthis guy right here which is device number\none, whatever it is, and it puts out, and\n\n111\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.940\nit says, who is and then might actually\njust send it out to the broadcast address.\n\n112\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.240\nAnd it's simply saying,\nI want to talk to somebody,\n\n113\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.470\nI need to know what the MAC addresses are.\n\n114\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.240\nAnd so, this table can,\nalso be located on here.\n\n115\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.740\nSo, it can start filling that information\nup on your individual machines.\n\n116\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.370\nWhen it does that, let me see if\nI can find the one, here, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.890\nSo, here's a fairly simple example,\nas well.\n\n118\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.010\nSo, what happens on a regular ARP\nbroadcast, cause that's what we're talking\n\n119\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.880\nabout, is that you can see here's\nthe layer two information, and\n\n120\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.420\nhere of course on the right hand\nside is our layer three information.\n\n121\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.590\nAnd I might find out something that even\nthough I have the ability to enter in\n\n122\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.330\nping, to 172.16.0.10,\ncuz I know that information.\n\n123\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.690\nI don't have a clue where\nthe MAC address is,\n\n124\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.720\n&gt;&gt; The layer two info.\n\n125\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.590\n&gt;&gt; And if I don't have a clue\nwhere the MAC address is,\n\n126\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.300\nthat means I can't send the data.\n\n127\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.180\nI may know exactly what\nmachine to send it to, but\n\n128\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.970\nI've no decision on where to force that\ndata to, to get it to that machine.\n\n129\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.817\nSo in this instance away that\nthe screen arrow and the working here,\n\n130\n00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:49.339\nis it really canned until it\nfounds where that MAC address is.\n\n131\n00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:54.547\nThe only way to find that\nout is by broadcasting out\n\n132\n00:07:54.547 --> 00:08:00.876\nthat ARP request that\nsays who is 172.16.0.10.\n\n133\n00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.229\nAnd when it sends that\ninformation out onto the switch,\n\n134\n00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:08.113\nthe switch will broadcast that out.\n\n135\n00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:14.000\nThe interface, E or Ethernet 0/1,\nit'll take a look at that and\n\n136\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.880\nwell, that's not my IP address,\nso I'm not gonna answer.\n\n137\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.881\nBut this file server over here on the left\nhand side, we'll be able to answer, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:28.711\nAs it takes, wait a minute,\nsomebody's asking who is 172.16.0.10?\n\n139\n00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:29.291\n&gt;&gt; That's me.\n\n140\n00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:30.544\n&gt;&gt; Well that's me-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:34.659\n&gt;&gt; And that's when that machine says,\nhey, ARP says,\n\n142\n00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.410\nI can now tie that to my own address.\n\n143\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.999\nSo that way what they are looking for\n\n144\n00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:45.990\nis the information that I have linked or\nmapped to my own MAC address.\n\n145\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.382\nThen it replies back, the switch will\ncache a copy of that information.\n\n146\n00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:55.166\nSay, hey that's located\non port number two and\n\n147\n00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:59.621\nthen forward that on to\nthe original request back here.\n\n148\n00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:03.030\nAnd once it does that,\nthis machine will cache it.\n\n149\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.640\nAnd then once it takes\na look at that information,\n\n150\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.900\nit will be able to fill\nthis end right here.\n\n151\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.666\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n152\n00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:14.732\nyou have a lot more experience\nwith Cisco exam taking than I do.\n\n153\n00:09:14.732 --> 00:09:19.560\nBut I will tell you that this kind\nof brings back a thought where Cisco\n\n154\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.541\nlikes to use the terminology\nwhen they're asking you,\n\n155\n00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:26.690\nwhich ports will not,\nhow did they word it?\n\n156\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.796\nThey say, basically, it's gonna be\nflooding out of all ports except,\n\n157\n00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:36.790\nand then you have to identify\nthe sending device by the MAC address.\n\n158\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.840\nAnd that's the port that it will not be\nflooding out of whenever you're looking at\n\n159\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.969\na hub, which does that every single time.\n\n160\n00:09:42.969 --> 00:09:48.362\nBut here with switch with the inteligen, a\nswitch will only send out that flood when\n\n161\n00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:53.774\nthe cam table is that information of MAC\naddress is missing from that information.\n\n162\n00:09:53.774 --> 00:09:56.711\nRemember, that info is\nstored in volatile memory.\n\n163\n00:09:56.711 --> 00:10:01.577\nSo if that switch loses power or\nswitches also will purge that information\n\n164\n00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:04.885\nperiodically to keep it pertinent and\nrelevant.\n\n165\n00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:07.798\nSo yes, it does happen periodically,\n\n166\n00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:11.670\nbecause it's not like a one and\ndone kind of deal.\n\n167\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.580\nIt happens throughout, so.\n\n168\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.464\n&gt;&gt; You'll actually see that renew on\nthat refreshing take place pretty much\n\n169\n00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:18.811\non a regular basis.\n\n170\n00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:22.410\nI think on Cisco switches,\nit's about every five minutes or so.\n\n171\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.560\nIt just depends on the size of the table.\n\n172\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.671\nBut it doesn't only have to do it then, if\nyou have what's called a unknown unicast.\n\n173\n00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:31.140\nIn other words,\nthey don't know exactly where to send it.\n\n174\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.810\nIt will also flood it out of\ncourse every other port, but\n\n175\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.600\nthe one that it came in on as well.\n\n176\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.309\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that wording too-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:39.386\n&gt;&gt; So BS.\n\n178\n00:10:39.386 --> 00:10:42.796\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's pretty much a key here\nwhen we start taking a look, but\n\n179\n00:10:42.796 --> 00:10:44.972\nthis is essentially what art does for us.\n\n180\n00:10:44.972 --> 00:10:48.164\nIt links up of course then or\nit gives us this ability.\n\n181\n00:10:48.164 --> 00:10:51.961\nIf I have the layer three information,\nI wannna make sure I say that right.\n\n182\n00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.145\nBecause directionality just like what\nCherokee was talking about is very\n\n183\n00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:55.664\ncritical.\n\n184\n00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:57.597\nIf I have an IP address and\n\n185\n00:10:57.597 --> 00:11:03.503\nI need to be able to forward that along\ninside of a layer two network, right?\n\n186\n00:11:03.503 --> 00:11:04.343\nSuch as a LAN,\n\n187\n00:11:04.343 --> 00:11:09.320\nnotice that pretty much everything on this\nside of the router is a layer two network.\n\n188\n00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.407\nWell that means I need to\ndiscover the MAC address and\n\n189\n00:11:12.407 --> 00:11:16.825\nthe protocol that we normally use or\nthe service that we use, I should say,\n\n190\n00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:20.600\nis really going to be right\nhere which is going to be ARP.\n\n191\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.261\nARP is what helps us to discover that\nwhen given the layer three information.\n\n192\n00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:29.460\nAnd I need to discover what the MAC\naddress information is gonna be as well.\n\n193\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.304\nNow if you're unfamiliar in Cisco world\nwith the way that MAC address formats\n\n194\n00:11:34.304 --> 00:11:38.490\nwork, this is typically how the MAC\naddress format tends to look.\n\n195\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.520\nI'm not gonna say that for every\nsingle device, but the majority of it.\n\n196\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.600\nEspecially when you're working with\nrouters and switches in Cisco land.\n\n197\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.228\nOops, I mistyped one, no.\n\n198\n00:11:49.228 --> 00:11:54.662\nActually, I was gonna say, I really did\nkind of mess that up completely, didn't I?\n\n199\n00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:59.377\nSo let me type that one again, I put in\ntoo many dashes or too many dots there,\n\n200\n00:11:59.377 --> 00:12:00.125\n0001.\n\n201\n00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:04.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just depending on that vendor,\nyou can see your MAC address is written in\n\n202\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.779\nhexidecimal notations with-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n203\n00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:10.345\n&gt;&gt; Hyphens or colons, just depending on.\n\n204\n00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:11.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The vendor.\n\n205\n00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.247\n&gt;&gt; And notice that this one\nreally doesn't have either one.\n\n206\n00:12:13.247 --> 00:12:14.769\nThat's what I'm really trying to get at-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n207\n00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:18.590\n&gt;&gt; The very fact that in the realm of\nCisco you're not going to have that.\n\n208\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.440\nInstead you're gonna have these four\nsections really represented by this.\n\n209\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.474\nSo you may see that, you may not, but\n\n210\n00:12:24.474 --> 00:12:26.167\njust kind of be aware-\n&gt;&gt; Be aware.\n\n211\n00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.991\n&gt;&gt; If this doesn't look familiar to you.\n\n212\n00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:31.580\nThis is the same representation\nas a MAC address.\n\n213\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.270\nIt does help,\n\n214\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.770\nso I always try to make sure that we can\nat least see something like that as well.\n\n215\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.210\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So ARP is really a very important way\n\n216\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.710\nthat we can discover a lot of\ninformation on our networks.\n\n217\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.340\nSwitches really begin to populate\ntheir particular address table.\n\n218\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.220\nDoing this, and it really helps to be able\nto forward the data along that right port.\n\n219\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.555\nSo now when it actually sends\ninformation outbound, right?\n\n220\n00:12:55.555 --> 00:13:00.409\nFrom PC01, it sends it to the destination\nnot only with the layer 3 address,\n\n221\n00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:02.960\nbut with the layer 2 address.\n\n222\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.520\nIt enters into this switch, this switch\nlooks for it in its own MAC address table,\n\n223\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.610\nand says hey,\nthat's located on port number 2.\n\n224\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.363\nAnd instead of flooding\nit out every other port,\n\n225\n00:13:14.363 --> 00:13:16.990\nit just simply directs\nit onto port number 2.\n\n226\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I already know that information.\n\n227\n00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Already know it, and\nthat allows me to be able to do that.\n\n228\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.550\nNow there is a condition though,\n\n229\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.900\nthat we may not actually be able\nto do exactly that directly.\n\n230\n00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.114\nSo let's say that I wanted to get to here\ninstead by doing something like this.\n\n231\n00:13:33.114 --> 00:13:36.204\nLet me see if I can make this route\nthrough a little bit easier, better.\n\n232\n00:13:36.204 --> 00:13:39.123\nThat line looks a little bit squirrely or\nthin now.\n\n233\n00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:41.167\nYeah, that looks a little bit better.\n\n234\n00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:44.170\nOkay, so let's say I wanted to do this.\n\n235\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:51.162\nHow in the world does this work when\nI know the layer 3 information,\n\n236\n00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:55.832\n192.168, oops, 680.200.\n\n237\n00:13:55.832 --> 00:14:00.941\nBut I have no chance of learning\nthe actual MAC address of\n\n238\n00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:08.630\nthat device that's actually on a separate\nnetwork or even across the Internet.\n\n239\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.329\nOkay, this is literally\non a separate network.\n\n240\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:18.920\nPC01 will have no chance of ever really\nlearning this MAC address over here.\n\n241\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.350\nSo what ends up happening at\nthat point is that ARP, also has\n\n242\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:28.360\nanother services along with it, has\ntechnically caught a proxy ARP as well.\n\n243\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.884\nAs we send this information out on\nnetwork and we do an ARP, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:31.884 --> 00:14:36.215\nAnd it says hey, here's the address we're\nlooking at, this guy will take a look and\n\n245\n00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:40.290\ngo hey, that's not my layer 3 address,\nI'm gonna drop it.\n\n246\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.620\nThe switch will take a look and\ngo, I don't know what that is,\n\n247\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.070\nlet me flood it out every other port.\n\n248\n00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.400\nEverybody will drop it,\nexcept for this router interface.\n\n249\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.749\nThe router interface will say, yeah,\nthat's not my IP address either.\n\n250\n00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:58.307\nBut I can handle and for\nthat data to where it needs to go,\n\n251\n00:14:58.307 --> 00:15:02.066\nso instead what you-\n&gt;&gt; Because that router recognizes\n\n252\n00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:03.989\nthe network portion of that address.\n\n253\n00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:04.673\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n254\n00:15:04.673 --> 00:15:08.068\n&gt;&gt; Like you were talking about in\nthe previous two episodes ago.\n\n255\n00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:08.834\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe, yep.\n\n256\n00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:10.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a few episodes ago, for\n\n257\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.284\nall I know.\n\n258\n00:15:11.284 --> 00:15:15.108\nBut yeah, at this point here,\nthe router interface says,\n\n259\n00:15:15.108 --> 00:15:20.020\nthat's not my IP address, but\ngo ahead and just put my MAC address on.\n\n260\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.109\nSo whatever that MAC address\nis on that interface,\n\n261\n00:15:22.109 --> 00:15:23.816\nI'm just gonna make one up for right now.\n\n262\n00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:30.280\nIt instead will allow it to go ahead and\nput its MAC address on.\n\n263\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.130\nTechnically that is called\na proxy ARP instead.\n\n264\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.090\nAnd that way once you\nforward it to this router, so\n\n265\n00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.770\nnow the traffic has a definition\nthat's not on this network.\n\n266\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.380\nBut it knows where to send it to next,\nthe next device it needs to send it.\n\n267\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.240\nWell then it will allow it to come\nthrough and notice on the router,\n\n268\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.014\nthe routing table can then take\na look inside the routing table.\n\n269\n00:15:50.014 --> 00:15:53.360\nHey, that's out of what\nthis interface over here,\n\n270\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.796\nlet me now be able to pour\nthat along to the other side.\n\n271\n00:15:56.796 --> 00:16:00.837\nSo, normally you have traffic\nthat does something like this.\n\n272\n00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:02.178\nSo on both occasions,\n\n273\n00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:07.240\nthat's what you'll actually end up seeing\nquite often is that ability to do so.\n\n274\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.820\nWhenever a computer comes up on the\nnetwork, usually that particular computer\n\n275\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.950\nwhen it first gets up there, it tries to\ncommunicate out and anybody that's talking\n\n276\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.250\nand gets the information from is asking\nfor who is this particular machine.\n\n277\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.040\nAnd you'll see those ARP\nrequests come along very much so.\n\n278\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.880\n&gt;&gt; So by utilizing the proxy\n\n279\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.980\nARP PC1 is then satisfied with\nthat alternate MAC address\n\n280\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.820\nbecause as long as it's communicating\nit really could care less, right?\n\n281\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.654\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n282\n00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:36.740\n&gt;&gt; And so\nyou'll actually end up seeing that.\n\n283\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.400\nAnd if you take a look at a couple\nof episodes ago where we did\n\n284\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.690\ntake a look at the idea of well,\nthe way that data is forwarded and\n\n285\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.750\nwe used this during the OSI model.\n\n286\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.680\nAnd we talked about this process where\nit uses layer two and layer three.\n\n287\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.020\nBe sure you check that episode out cuz\nthat's really part of the process as well\n\n288\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.249\nin terms of actually understanding\na little bit about of what happens here.\n\n289\n00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:03.160\nThe ARP is by far a very important\nservice that went abusing on our node.\n\n290\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.450\nRemember that at this point\nan IPv4 is all done in broadcast.\n\n291\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.736\nSo, I don't know if I can\nactually spot some on or not but\n\n292\n00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:13.080\nlet's see if we can check\nsome on our network.\n\n293\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.330\nAnd see if some ARP requests\nare coming along too.\n\n294\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.750\nSo let me bring up old Wireshark if I can.\n\n295\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Yep, cuz we're using IPP four and\nif we were on an IPP six network,\n\n296\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:29.070\nwe would be more reliant on the ND\nnetwork discovery protocol, and\n\n297\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.040\nARP kind of goes by the wayside there.\n\n298\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it looks like I did\nsee a couple of ARPs and\n\n299\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.430\nI see them every once in\na while pop up there.\n\n300\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:40.650\nSo it's not as prevalent as this PTP\nversion 2, whatever that one is.\n\n301\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.560\nBut I do see art messages going across.\n\n302\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.760\nSo I think I've got a few.\n\n303\n00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.302\nLet me go ahead and\nstop the capture here and\n\n304\n00:17:46.302 --> 00:17:49.276\nlet's see if I can actually\napply ARP [CROSSTALK].\n\n305\n00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:50.520\n&gt;&gt; I think it's all lower case.\n\n306\n00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.154\n&gt;&gt; Is it all lower case?\n\n307\n00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:51.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.740\n&gt;&gt; There we go, there we go.\n\n309\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.990\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n310\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.920\nSo now that asashi, all lowercase.\n\n311\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Wireshark is a little finicky about the\nway the uppercase and lowercase there so.\n\n312\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so even though the protocol\nlisted here is all uppercase.\n\n313\n00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:04.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n314\n00:18:04.054 --> 00:18:04.864\n&gt;&gt; It's funny.\n\n315\n00:18:04.864 --> 00:18:06.560\n&gt;&gt; Go figure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n316\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.350\nYou can see.\n\n317\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.440\nLet's just start off\nwith this information and\n\n318\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.000\nlet's take a look at\nthe info that comes across.\n\n319\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.020\nSo just like I was telling you\nthat when ARP begins to work,\n\n320\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.400\nhere is the actual message that it says.\n\n321\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.190\nWho has, or I said who is, it should\nbe who has 10.0.0.1, if you know that,\n\n322\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:29.840\ngo ahead and tell this particular address.\n\n323\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.750\nSo anybody that has that information\ncan broadcast that out and\n\n324\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.090\nsend it on to whoever actually needs it.\n\n325\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:41.390\nSo, all of these different devices, a lot\nof Samsung here and, of course, Apple.\n\n326\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.810\nAnd there's a Roku,\na Ubiquiti access point, you name it.\n\n327\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.610\nBut here's all of\nthe different ARP requests.\n\n328\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.297\nAnd if I just choose one, and I come\ndown here to the bottom where I can see\n\n329\n00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:58.397\nthe details of that, you can see on the\naddress there is now the lemme zoom in.\n\n330\n00:18:58.397 --> 00:19:00.815\nI always think I can.\n\n331\n00:19:00.815 --> 00:19:02.841\nHere's the sending and\nyou might look at that and\n\n332\n00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.480\nthat's a little bit strange, right?\n\n333\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.950\nNotice the all zeros here, okay.\n\n334\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.850\nWhat this usually indicates for\n\n335\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.510\nus is trying to broadcast it out there\nacross the entire broadcast network.\n\n336\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.640\n&gt;&gt; And that's what, it's just written in\nhexadecimal notation up there in the top\n\n337\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.150\nright there Ronnie.\n\n338\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.160\nIf we look with the indication of\nall F's in hexadecimal notation.\n\n339\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is it, yep.\n\n340\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So that actually tells you the layer\n\n341\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.146\ntwo broadcast on the all F's as well.\n\n342\n00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:33.430\nBut you can see down here, even at layer\nthree, which is where ARP works as well,\n\n343\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.019\nthat this is also where it\nindicates it right here too.\n\n344\n00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:40.585\nThe target MAC address and here it\nis at the actual default gateway for\n\n345\n00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:42.350\nour network, too.\n\n346\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.580\nSo ARP is actually out there and it can,\nit doesn't consume the network, but you\n\n347\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.470\ncan see that every device, the software\nis pretty much a broadcast right here.\n\n348\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.770\nLets see if I can actually\nhit a destination.\n\n349\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.910\nSo here's a Samsung something\nto an Apple machine.\n\n350\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.460\nSo this time if we focus in and go here.\n\n351\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.330\nYou can now see that this one is\nspecifically directed where it can say,\n\n352\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.810\nhey here is the Apple Mac address.\n\n353\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.180\nAnd here is the source from the Samsung.\n\n354\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.331\nAnd ARP is actually replying here.\n\n355\n00:20:16.571 --> 00:20:19.238\nSo there's a lot of\ninformation that you can see,\n\n356\n00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:22.090\nespecially with ARP at the very beginning.\n\n357\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.400\nThat traffic is constantly going\non inside of your networks.\n\n358\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.150\nSo don't, you know, don't think\nthat's actually something foreign.\n\n359\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.570\nIt is normally a part of our regular\nnetworking that we will generally see as\n\n360\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.910\nwell, okay.\n\n361\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.170\nSo there is the idea of just\ntalking about the nature of ARP and\n\n362\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.250\nwhat it actually does for\nus at the very beginning of networking.\n\n363\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.930\nThe other thing that we\ncan also talk about here\n\n364\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.000\nis gonna be the way that a DNS and\nDHCP function.\n\n365\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.740\nWhen it comes down to networking, not only\ndo you have to understand how the very\n\n366\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.820\nbeginnings of it in how devices really get\nestablished and can begin to communicate.\n\n367\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.340\nWe also need to understand the addressing\nfunction, as well as how we network today.\n\n368\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.326\nSo I'm gonna kinda take this\na little bit out of order.\n\n369\n00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:08.907\nI wanna talk about DHCP first, is what\nwe are going to talk about instead.\n\n370\n00:21:08.907 --> 00:21:09.930\n&gt;&gt; More of my favorites.\n\n371\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:16.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration\nProtocol pretty much happens in this way.\n\n372\n00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.980\nRemember that not every single machine\nthat's plugged in at the beginning\n\n373\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.310\nhas an IP address, nor a subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, DNS Servers.\n\n374\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.490\nIt doesn't have any of that information.\n\n375\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.910\nSo you have two options, right?\n\n376\n00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.390\nYou can statically assign\nall that information,\n\n377\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.520\nor you can actually have it\ndynamically done for you.\n\n378\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.240\nAnd this is kind of very key and\ncritical on your network.\n\n379\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.680\nIt really depends on size and\n\n380\n00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.710\nhow much resources you're willing\nto devote on just a task like that.\n\n381\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.430\nAnd that's a very repetitive task to do,\nwhether you're talking about ten computers\n\n382\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.210\nor whether you're talking about\na hundred or a thousand computers here.\n\n383\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.450\nAnd we start getting into higher and\nhigher numbers,\n\n384\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.150\nprobably the easier fashion is to\ncentralize that type of management.\n\n385\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.960\nAnd instead, consider this\nidea of a DHCP Server instead.\n\n386\n00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.080\nThe reason why is now,\nI can configure the DHCP Server one time,\n\n387\n00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.810\nturn on that server on to my own network,\nonce I get everything configured.\n\n388\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.840\nFrom that point on, I don't have to\nworry about handing out IP addresses,\n\n389\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.240\nsubnet mask, default gateway,\nDNS servers, WINS, if I choose to.\n\n390\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.480\nAnything that you can configure in IP,\npretty much DHCP can go ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.660\nconfigure that for you.\n\n392\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure.\nI mean even some of our most basic devices\n\n393\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.640\nlike the all in one routers that you guys\nmight even have rented from your ISP.\n\n394\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.140\nEven offer a benign, or I guess,\na rudimentary form of DHCP.\n\n395\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.720\nBut like Ronnie was saying, in a very\nlarge environment you probably wanna beef\n\n396\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:49.300\nyour system, like a dedicated DHCP\nserver to go ahead and handle that.\n\n397\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.280\n&gt;&gt; It depends on what\nyou really need to do.\n\n398\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.180\nThe idea of DHCP, though, is very\nimportant when you bring new devices on\n\n399\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.180\nyour network or you have guest\ndevices that come on to your network.\n\n400\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.911\nInstead of them having to bring\nit to you all the time, and\n\n401\n00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:01.403\nthen you having to type\nin all that information.\n\n402\n00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:02.520\n&gt;&gt; A lot of manual entry.\n\n403\n00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of manual entry.\n\n404\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.600\nOnce you get to that point you really\nwant to hand it off to something that\n\n405\n00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.445\ncan do it consistently and rightly,\naccurately is pretty much to key.\n\n406\n00:23:12.445 --> 00:23:17.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, IT techs and system admins, they\ndon't like to do unnecessary work, right?\n\n407\n00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:23.255\nSo let's go ahead and set it up, and\nthen just let the DHCP server handle it.\n\n408\n00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:24.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you don't right?\n\n409\n00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:26.545\nCan you do it without DHCP?\n\n410\n00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:28.505\nSure, you definitely can.\n\n411\n00:23:28.505 --> 00:23:31.400\nWill it take you a heck\nof a long time to do so?\n\n412\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.300\nYes, especially when you\nstart hitting hundreds or\n\n413\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.080\nthousands of computers, it can take\nyou quite a bit of a long time.\n\n414\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.978\nAnd let's talk about the basic process\nhere in terms of DHCP as we take\n\n415\n00:23:41.978 --> 00:23:45.112\na look at how to get started on this,\nright?\n\n416\n00:23:45.112 --> 00:23:50.081\nSo when we talk about a DHCP server,\nokay, and of course, a DNS client,\n\n417\n00:23:50.081 --> 00:23:54.888\nthere is a four step way or four step\nprocess whatever you want to call it\n\n418\n00:23:54.888 --> 00:23:58.902\nhere to ensuring that your\nmachine receives everything.\n\n419\n00:23:58.902 --> 00:24:03.964\nAnd you have to be able to ensure\nthat everything goes on here.\n\n420\n00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:06.910\nNow, this is something that's very\ndifficult to capture in Wireshark.\n\n421\n00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.868\nI was trying it right\nbefore the show [CROSSTALK]\n\n422\n00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:09.220\n&gt;&gt; I know, I've tried too.\n\n423\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.090\nSometimes you're just not fast\nenough to get to that first step\n\n424\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:12.970\n&gt;&gt; And it requires\n\n425\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.320\na couple things that you just don't really\n\n426\n00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.990\nhave at the beginning of DHCP\nif you're trying to capture it.\n\n427\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.710\nWhich is a working that work could on.\n\n428\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.625\nI know that that sound strange, but\nI'll show you what I'm talking about,\n\n429\n00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:24.101\nwe'll try and capture some information and\nsee how that works.\n\n430\n00:24:24.101 --> 00:24:27.198\nUsually if you capture anything,\nit's these last two steps,\n\n431\n00:24:27.198 --> 00:24:31.030\nwhich kind of actually means that\nyou already hit these first two.\n\n432\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.840\nBut at the very beginning,\nit happens with your own computer.\n\n433\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.340\nOnce you plug a network cable into it,\n\n434\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.210\nyour computer is set to obtain an IP\naddress automatically in Windows.\n\n435\n00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:46.640\nThat's what we call it and you actually\nend up being able to use the DHCP server.\n\n436\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.378\nSo it will send out a message\ncalled a DHCPDiscover\n\n437\n00:24:50.378 --> 00:24:53.640\nmessage across the entire network.\n\n438\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.000\nNow it doesn't know exactly\nwho the DHCP server is.\n\n439\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.940\nSo when it does it,\n\n440\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.710\nit just puts it out there as a flooded\nmessage such as a broadcast to do so.\n\n441\n00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking for a DHCP server.\n\n442\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nthat's what it's actually looking for.\n\n443\n00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.886\nAnd the only one that responds to that\nDHCPDiscover message is going to be a DHCP\n\n444\n00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:10.660\nserver.\n\n445\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.630\n&gt;&gt; Unless there's a rogue DHCP server,\n\n446\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.490\nwhere we look at it from\na security standpoint.\n\n447\n00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.080\n&gt;&gt; Yup and that's something that\nyou'll have to kind of deal with.\n\n448\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.969\nBut the very fact is that it will look for\n\n449\n00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:22.126\nthe very first DHCP server that\nwill respond to discover, okay?\n\n450\n00:25:22.126 --> 00:25:26.860\nSo, it's not picky, it doesn't sit there\nand say, I'm only gonna use this one.\n\n451\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.910\nIt says, look, you're responding to that\nDHCPDiscover packet, so let me use you.\n\n452\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.352\nThat's what it would generally end up\ndoing when you start to use DHCPDiscover.\n\n453\n00:25:36.352 --> 00:25:39.786\nOnce the DHCP server has\nthat discover message,\n\n454\n00:25:39.786 --> 00:25:45.210\nit then takes a look at the configuration\nit's suppose to hand out.\n\n455\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.860\nAnd when it does that,\nit can now make an offer.\n\n456\n00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.870\nAnd when it sends and offer back out\nto the actual responding client,\n\n457\n00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.470\nwhat that offer really does include\nall the information that it\n\n458\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.750\nneeds to configure itself to be\nuseful on that network, okay?\n\n459\n00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.690\n&gt;&gt; And, something just logically in my\nbrain I don't know how yours works,\n\n460\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.800\nbut you see at the request and\nRonnie will get to that step next,\n\n461\n00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.280\nis actually after the offer and\n\n462\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.990\nnormally you request something\nbefore someone, I don't know, maybe.\n\n463\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.165\nBut an easy way to remember this\nis with a simple pneumonic,\n\n464\n00:26:16.165 --> 00:26:19.483\nand you guys might have even heard it,\nit's the DORA method.\n\n465\n00:26:19.483 --> 00:26:24.543\nAnd if you look at the D for discover, the\nO for offer, and that might help you just\n\n466\n00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:29.570\nremember the sequence of these steps in\ncase you come across that on an exam.\n\n467\n00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably the easiest way\nto remember all of the information here.\n\n468\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.712\nBut is to see that offer,\nthe offer, remember,\n\n469\n00:26:35.712 --> 00:26:38.890\nincludes everything that we\nnormally have to hand out.\n\n470\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.000\nThe nice thing about DHCP is we\nlease the address to the client.\n\n471\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.650\nAnd that means we can yank\nthat lease if we need to,\n\n472\n00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.790\nand reuse that address at\nsome time in the future.\n\n473\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.530\nIf we statically assign that IP address,\nwell that means that that address\n\n474\n00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.810\nprobably just kinda disappears\non your network forever.\n\n475\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.310\nAnd if it's not in use that's fine, but-\n&gt;&gt; It's just kind of wasted.\n\n476\n00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's kind of\nwasted at some point here.\n\n477\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.980\nBut if you statically assign it, and\n\n478\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.640\nnobody ever uses that address, you can\nprobably assign it to somebody else.\n\n479\n00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.650\nBut now if that computer ever turns\nback on, you'll now have conflicting\n\n480\n00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.390\ninformation, two different devices on\nthe same network with the same IP address.\n\n481\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:15.968\nNot ever a good thing.\n\n482\n00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.731\n&gt;&gt; No bueno.\n\n483\n00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nonce you have that on your computer and\n\n484\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.730\nit's configured,\nthat is when your computer responds back.\n\n485\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.890\nAnd this is kinda weird, it's really kinda\nmaking the official request to say hey,\n\n486\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.890\nI'm gonna take that lease,\nis what it's doing, okay?\n\n487\n00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.170\nSo that's where we see that idea\nof the request package coming in.\n\n488\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.744\nAnd then the DHCP server will essentially\nmark that address as being list\n\n489\n00:27:38.744 --> 00:27:39.339\nout to you.\n\n490\n00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:43.127\nAnd once that's happen, they will send\nyou back an acknowledgment saying,\n\n491\n00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:44.800\nI've got you as a lease.\n\n492\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.070\nAnd so you'll be able to use that\naddress until lease time is expired.\n\n493\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:55.150\nLease can be set for anytime that you want\nto, how fast, how long that you wanted to.\n\n494\n00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.666\nLike in Windows, I think the DHCP\nserver by default is eight days long.\n\n495\n00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:02.912\nBut on other types of appliances\nthat you might see it on,\n\n496\n00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:06.848\nit may be as short as 24 hours or\neight hours or whatever it might be.\n\n497\n00:28:06.848 --> 00:28:12.520\nAnd it just depends on how much your\nnetwork changes, is what you might have.\n\n498\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.570\nSo for example,\nif you're in a regular LAN network and\n\n499\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.100\nyou don't have a lot of\ndevices that change.\n\n500\n00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.624\nPeople aren't bringing computers in,\naren't taking computers off network,\n\n501\n00:28:20.624 --> 00:28:21.882\nyou may leave it and go look.\n\n502\n00:28:21.882 --> 00:28:26.090\nWe'll set it for two weeks,\nif we want to and that's perfectly fine.\n\n503\n00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.110\nBut if you have an environment in\nwhich you know people are constantly\n\n504\n00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.150\nmoving in and out of that network and\nyou want to make sure that\n\n505\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.250\nthose particular addresses can\nbe reused over and over again.\n\n506\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.370\nYou set a shorter lease\ntime is what you might do.\n\n507\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.520\nFor example, if you have a guest\nwireless network, you may not set it for\n\n508\n00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.515\nwhere you go I'm gonna extend out,\nat least for eight days.\n\n509\n00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:47.725\nYou might set it where you\nonly extend the lease for\n\n510\n00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:50.295\nthat address for, let's say,\ntwo hours, maybe.\n\n511\n00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:53.925\nOr maybe, four hours, if you know that\nthat's the max that a vendor might\n\n512\n00:28:53.925 --> 00:28:56.272\nbe on your network, or\na guest might be on your network.\n\n513\n00:28:56.272 --> 00:28:58.762\nAnd that way, at the end of the four\nhours they have to renew that again.\n\n514\n00:28:58.762 --> 00:28:59.602\nIt's perfectly fine, they can.\n\n515\n00:28:59.602 --> 00:29:02.586\n&gt;&gt; Better allocation if you have smaller\nIP address pool then it's just using them\n\n516\n00:29:02.586 --> 00:29:03.349\nmore efficiently.\n\n517\n00:29:03.349 --> 00:29:07.793\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's managing better because\nit could be that if you lease it for\n\n518\n00:29:07.793 --> 00:29:11.750\neight days, you might find out if\nyou say I have 63 addresses, and\n\n519\n00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.430\nnow you're at 63 addresses and\nsomebody new comes online and\n\n520\n00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.290\nthey're like why can't I get connected?\n\n521\n00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.020\nWell you have to wait for\nthose leases to expire.\n\n522\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.290\nYou have to go in and\nmanually yank those leases from the pool.\n\n523\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.450\nSo it really does take a little bit\nof time in getting to manage that.\n\n524\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.180\nBut that's kinda the beginning process.\n\n525\n00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:28.920\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda neat, too.\n\n526\n00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.330\nIf you look at the RFC for DHCP, there's\na lot of other additional information that\n\n527\n00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.240\ncan be pushed out to those\nmachines on the network as well.\n\n528\n00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.580\nBut typically IP address, any kind of\nreservations and leases, things like that,\n\n529\n00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.810\nare your basics.\n\n530\n00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll see a lot\ndepending on what you need.\n\n531\n00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.890\nFor example, you have thin clients,\nyou can actually push to\n\n532\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.220\nconfiguration out from something\nlike an FTP server if you want to.\n\n533\n00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.910\nSo every time you plug in like a phone or\n\n534\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.820\na thin client, it automatically\ndownloads the configuration.\n\n535\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.797\nAnd once it gets its DHCPLease, if you\nhave that type of lease going on too.\n\n536\n00:30:00.797 --> 00:30:02.338\nSo there is a ton of information,\n\n537\n00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:06.050\nyou can push out just about anything\nthat you want to that deals with IP.\n\n538\n00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:11.003\nSince it's called DHCP is about IP\nconfiguration is anything that resides\n\n539\n00:30:11.003 --> 00:30:13.608\njust about in the IP stack that we have.\n\n540\n00:30:13.608 --> 00:30:19.580\nNow normally this is what we see\ninside of a regular LAN network, okay?\n\n541\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.410\nDHCP can extend out beyond your LAN.\n\n542\n00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:28.234\nAnd the way that it does it is by creating\nwhat is called a DHCP Relay agent instead.\n\n543\n00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:31.140\nSo notice that I have\ntwo separate networks.\n\n544\n00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.541\nOne over here on the right hand side and\n\n545\n00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:36.407\nthe other one over here\non the left hand side.\n\n546\n00:30:36.407 --> 00:30:40.490\nWhat if I only have one\nDHCP Server though?\n\n547\n00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.380\nWell if I have only one DHCP Server,\n\n548\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.010\nthat begins to become a little\nbit more problematic.\n\n549\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:50.420\n&gt;&gt; And this is where knowing how those\nprotocols work really comes into play.\n\n550\n00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.210\nBecause what was our first step there,\nRonnie?\n\n551\n00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.820\nThe D, the discover.\n\n552\n00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.510\n&gt;&gt; Which is discover, so\nif you start sending out a discover here,\n\n553\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.150\nwell that's gonna be\na broadcast on this network.\n\n554\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:03.850\nBur remember, routers do not by\ndefault let broadcasts go across, so\n\n555\n00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.450\nit can't hit this DHCP server.\n\n556\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:10.130\nSo for us to be able to use\nDHCP across multiple networks,\n\n557\n00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.220\nyou need to set up what we\ncall a DHCP relay agent.\n\n558\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.800\nAnd you can configure that on\nan interface on this router,\n\n559\n00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.140\nit's called an IP helper address.\n\n560\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.800\nOnce you configure that now,\nit will be able to take that broadcast and\n\n561\n00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.440\nit will accept it here and\n\n562\n00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.710\nchange it into a unicast across to\nthe DHCP server for the discover message.\n\n563\n00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.050\nAnd everything from that point now\nwill become a unicast back here.\n\n564\n00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.440\nAnd then, on this side, it will broadcast\nit back out and then it will go ahead and\n\n565\n00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.740\ncontinue on through the process\nof acknowledgement or\n\n566\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.600\nthe offer, the request, and\nthe acknowledgement as well.\n\n567\n00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.860\nTons of information, so\n\n568\n00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.960\nyou're not limited by a single\nWAN just because you used DHDP.\n\n569\n00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.030\nBut its effectiveness can\nactually be extended out by using\n\n570\n00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.950\nrelay agents along with it.\n\n571\n00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.290\nSo you can actually do that.\n\n572\n00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.560\nYou can even set up a DHCP\nserver on your router as well\n\n573\n00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.310\nto actually work as a DHCP\nserver if you choose to.\n\n574\n00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.630\nAnd you can set up multiple\npools if you want to.\n\n575\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.640\nOne for each particular interface and\neven subinterfaces as well.\n\n576\n00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.883\nSo, it really is a very powerful\npart of understanding services\n\n577\n00:32:17.883 --> 00:32:19.811\nthat we normally find on the network.\n\n578\n00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:23.540\nBut we really had a lot of time here,\nthat we've taken look and\n\n579\n00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.860\ntalked about ARP and DHCP.\n\n580\n00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.060\nBut we still have at least one more\nto go but I think I'm out of time.\n\n581\n00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are.\n\n582\n00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.670\nUnfortunately, Ronnie,\nthat's about it for this episode.\n\n583\n00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.630\nWe were able to really take a look\nat address resolution protocol and\n\n584\n00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.995\ndynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n585\n00:32:38.995 --> 00:32:43.030\nI think we're gonna be\nstarting off with DNS next.\n\n586\n00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.540\nSo don't go anywhere, stay tuned,\n\n587\n00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.510\nwe've got a lot of good\ninformation headed your way.\n\n588\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.490\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n589\n00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.840\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n590\n00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n591\n00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.595\n&gt;&gt; See you here next time at ITProTV.\n\n592\n00:32:59.595 --> 00:33:03.425\n[MUSIC]\n\n593\n00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:06.079\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:15.186\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:18.470\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.010\nThis is actually a part two, where we\nare looking at basic networking services.\n\n6\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.970\nIn this episode, we're gonna dive\ninto the wonderful world of DNS.\n\n7\n00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.820\nWith us today in studio is,\nwe have Ronnie Wong to go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.810\nhelp us with this topic.\n\n9\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.610\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back,\n\n11\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.290\nas we continue on taking a look\nat the basic network services.\n\n12\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.705\n&gt;&gt; We've already covered things like\nARP as well, and of course, DHTP.\n\n13\n00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:43.880\nWe talked about those, and\n\n14\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.630\nwe're not really going in\ndepth into multiple services.\n\n15\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.000\nBut really has to be there at\nthe beginning as networking is\n\n16\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.880\nstarting to come online, and ARP, of\ncourse, is one of the most important ones.\n\n17\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.910\nAnd then assigning IP addresses,\nof course, is another one.\n\n18\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.411\nAnd that's why we\nmentioned the idea of DHTP.\n\n19\n00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.820\nWhich I couldn't remember the acronym for\nright off the top of my head.\n\n20\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.680\nNow we're heading into another acronym.\n\n21\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.200\nAnd of course,\n\n22\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.810\nif you've been in networking any time,\nthese things sound natural to you, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680\nBut, for most people, they probably don't\nunderstand how we can talk in a realm of\n\n24\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.290\nacronyms in the way that we do.\n\n25\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.840\nSo we are actually heading\ninto what we call DNS,\n\n26\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.830\ndomain name system is\nwhere we're focusing on.\n\n27\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.207\nAnd it's because it is about as\nimportant as the IP addressing today.\n\n28\n00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:32.910\nAnd the reason why is that well, computers\nreally don't have to actually network.\n\n29\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.120\nIt's people that really need\nto use computers to network.\n\n30\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.300\nAnd we find out something very easily,\nwhich are that as good as we are at math,\n\n31\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.090\nmost of us are not someone like Rain Man.\n\n32\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.920\nThat can remember every single IP\naddress that we need to connect to.\n\n33\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.749\nSo instead we actually have to use names.\n\n34\n00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.447\nAnd that's why this is\na very important service for\n\n35\n00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:55.810\nus to at least have the basic grasp and\nunderstanding of it too.\n\n36\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.873\nRight, I mean, I don't know the IP\naddress of Amazon.com and CNN.com.\n\n37\n00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:03.310\nIt's because humans, it's easy for\n\n38\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.670\nus to remember those very basic words and\nacronyms.\n\n39\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.790\nBut, like you said, computers,\nthey don't speak the English language,\n\n40\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.840\nthey speak in binary, so.\n\n41\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.721\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthey really don't need names at all.\n\n42\n00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.594\nComputers can remember\nevery single IP address.\n\n43\n00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.531\nBecause as soon as they\nstart to communicate,\n\n44\n00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.580\nthey cache that information\nin binary terms.\n\n45\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.417\nAnd the names aren't really that\nimportant as much as those IP address.\n\n46\n00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:29.710\nBecause that's why we can locate\ndevices wherever they are in the world.\n\n47\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.630\nBut as you start having humans trying\nto also implement networking, names,\n\n48\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.020\nof course, have become very important.\n\n49\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.345\nSo much so that even though you\nmight think that DNS then is just\n\n50\n00:02:41.345 --> 00:02:45.019\nan optional component to\nwhat you do in networking.\n\n51\n00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.352\nToday you can actually count it as an\nessential service that has to be there for\n\n52\n00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:50.630\njust about anything.\n\n53\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.089\nLet me kind of give you an example\nif you're not sure about that.\n\n54\n00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.322\nIf you were to implement,\n\n55\n00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:57.560\nlet's say something like\na Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n56\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.890\nYou have to have DNS, it's one of the main\ncomponents that must be there for\n\n57\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.330\nDNS to operate, for us to do that.\n\n58\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.620\nEven you, if you're just\nsitting at home right now and\n\n59\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.900\nyou're watching us across the internet.\n\n60\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.660\nYou didn't connect to our IP address just\nlike what Cherokee was talking about.\n\n61\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.300\nYou actually connected probably by taking\nyour computer and browsing to ITPro.TV.\n\n62\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.160\nAnd that is something that of course\nmeans that somewhere along the line,\n\n63\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.110\nyour browser knew how to\nactually get to ITPro.TV.\n\n64\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.590\nAnd if this is your first time\nconnecting to us as a guest,\n\n65\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.960\nif you're actually just\nwatching as a guest here.\n\n66\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.077\nIt's kind of one of the most amazing\nthings when you start to realize how much\n\n67\n00:03:38.077 --> 00:03:39.257\nhas to go into that process.\n\n68\n00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:44.080\nOf getting to that point where your\ncomputer knows exactly how to say.\n\n69\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.675\nHey, I know how to get to\na website I've never been before.\n\n70\n00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:50.335\nAnd it's actually the technology and\nthe background.\n\n71\n00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:54.699\nAnd the main protocol that helps us\ndo that is DNS, domain name system,\n\n72\n00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.640\nwhich allows us to do what\nwe call name resolution.\n\n73\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.310\nName resolution is a process that\nessentially links names to IP addresses.\n\n74\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.520\nAnd this is so essential that there\nare what we call different route\n\n75\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.320\nname servers out on the Internet that\nreally help to provide this functionality.\n\n76\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.180\nWithout this type of functionality\nit would be almost impossible for\n\n77\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.060\nus to be able to use the internet\nas effectively as we have in\n\n78\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.600\nanything that we've been doing, especially\nin things like commerce as well.\n\n79\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty interesting\nthose root servers that you speak of.\n\n80\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.650\nThere's actually 13 and they're labeled,\nwhat is it, A through M?\n\n81\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.749\nAnd they're dispersed throughout\nthe world, but they're basically like\n\n82\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.630\nthe Internet's phone book or yellow pages,\nif you think of it that way.\n\n83\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.240\n&gt;&gt; It really does help, and\nthat's actually a good analogy.\n\n84\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.850\nIt is a directory for\neverything that you connect to\n\n85\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.882\nusing your web browser by\njust simply typing any name.\n\n86\n00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:50.890\nIt has to get that information\nfrom somewhere and\n\n87\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.590\nbe able to route that to\nwhere it needs to go.\n\n88\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.790\nSo we also need to understand\njust a couple of process in that,\n\n89\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.880\nwe're going to take a look at that\nroot concept and idea in a moment.\n\n90\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.680\nWe're gonna talk about how in\nthe world names are actually resolved.\n\n91\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.860\nBut let's start up with kind of the basic\nof what we've been talking about here.\n\n92\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.520\nWhich is how does my computer know\nhow to get somewhere by name?\n\n93\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.960\nAnd that's kind of a key concept for us.\n\n94\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.968\nAnd when your computer does that,\n\n95\n00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:16.472\nwhen instead of actually\ntyping in the IP address.\n\n96\n00:05:16.472 --> 00:05:21.045\nIt has to say all right, I'm looking for\nthis address, whatever it is by name.\n\n97\n00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:24.750\nSo let's take ITPro.TV,\nwell when it does that,\n\n98\n00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.490\nit has to go all right, where in\nthe world do I find that information.\n\n99\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.722\nAnd that's kind of the key in what we do.\n\n100\n00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:34.810\nSo let me go ahead and show an example\nhere of what we're gonna do.\n\n101\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.620\nSo I've taken advantage of the practice\nlabs that we have available right here\n\n102\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.470\nat ITPro.TV.\n\n103\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.690\nTo kind of demonstrate a couple\nof different things for\n\n104\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.540\nus in terms of the name\nresolution process.\n\n105\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.100\nNow we're not going out on\nthe Internet even though we can.\n\n106\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.143\nRight now I'm simply gonna pick a client\nwhich is gonna be the Windows 8.1 client.\n\n107\n00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:57.130\nI wanted to make sure I was\nactually right as I see that.\n\n108\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.080\nAnd let's see if I can actually get\nconnected here, I'm gonna hit Connect, for\n\n109\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.060\njust a moment.\n\n110\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.890\nAnd we wanna see what has to happen\nwhen this machine actually does connect,\n\n111\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.780\nif I can connect there.\n\n112\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.930\nLook, it's giving me an error,\nthat actually means something great.\n\n113\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.520\nSo once I establish the connection and\nnow, hopefully get the desktop connection\n\n114\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.850\ngoing here, there we go, and I get access.\n\n115\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.460\nWhen I decide that I am going to\ntype in a name here on my computer,\n\n116\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.534\nand we'll do ITPro.TV.\n\n117\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.930\nLet's see if everything actually connects,\n\n118\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.590\nit might actually lead me to\na fake internet, for all I know.\n\n119\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.500\nNo, it looks like it's\nactually resolving here.\n\n120\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.090\nIt's just going to take a little\nbit of time for us to get there.\n\n121\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.520\nBut you are actually seeing where\nit's gonna try and make a connection.\n\n122\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.970\nI didn't have to memorize any IP address,\nI didn't have to do anything.\n\n123\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.400\nAnd there we go,\nnow our website is starting to come in.\n\n124\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.440\nWell, what has happened\nhere on this computer\n\n125\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.810\nis that it began the process\nof name resolution.\n\n126\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.710\nIt first started to ask the question,\n\n127\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.430\nbut where did it ask the question\nof at the very beginning?\n\n128\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.370\nWell, on your computer, I'm just\ngonna bring up the command line so\n\n129\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.170\nthat we can see this here.\n\n130\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.610\nOn the computer itself there is what\nwe call of course the DNS cache.\n\n131\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.540\nAnd I'm just gonna change the font\nsize and of course the color so\n\n132\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.150\nthat we can see this a little bit better.\n\n133\n00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:29.159\nChange the console to, we'll make it a 24\npoint, that will help us out a little bit.\n\n134\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.048\n&gt;&gt; So what Ronnie's going to be showing\nus here is kind of interesting.\n\n135\n00:07:34.048 --> 00:07:37.168\nSome people think if I'm running in\nincognito mode, or delete my browsing\n\n136\n00:07:37.168 --> 00:07:40.380\nhistory, there's no record of me\never going to a particular website.\n\n137\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.050\nWell, technically there is,\n\n138\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.230\nif DNS was utilized in facilitating\nthat connection there, so.\n\n139\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the easiest way to\nsee if names have actually\n\n140\n00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:51.777\nbeen resolved on your computer before.\n\n141\n00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:55.919\nIs gonna be right here which\nis the ipconfig display or\n\n142\n00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.703\n/displaydns if you're\non a Windows computer.\n\n143\n00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:04.249\nAnd right inside of here you can\nsee where it has kept a record.\n\n144\n00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.784\nAnd I don't know if I can actually do\nthis without it kind of going nuts\n\n145\n00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:07.900\na little bit.\n\n146\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.010\nYou can see where it resolved\na particular address here and\n\n147\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.660\nit also has a link to a record.\n\n148\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.042\nSo my computer is now cache\nat inside of the rim.\n\n149\n00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:20.650\nAnd it looks like I\nscrolled down way too fast.\n\n150\n00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.289\nI don't know if I have that much control,\nlet me see if\n\n151\n00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:26.764\nI can get a little bit better control\nby doing it this way, there we go.\n\n152\n00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:29.284\nSo there's an internet record W Pad, but\n\n153\n00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:33.110\nthe address that I connected to\nis really out there somewhere.\n\n154\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.460\nIt looks like they've got me connected\nthrough a proxy of some sort.\n\n155\n00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.230\nBut you can actually see some of\nthese different names going on.\n\n156\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Practice labs.\n\n157\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Practice labs.\n\n158\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.720\nAnd so that is a name, and\nwe also find a record listed to it.\n\n159\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.810\nSo every computer has something like this.\n\n160\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.400\nThe weird thing is, if you reboot your\ncomputer, or you get rid of that.\n\n161\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.331\nIf you reboot the computer you\nactually get rid of this cache,\n\n162\n00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:02.992\nthen I can do an IPconfig/flushDNS.\n\n163\n00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:05.750\nAnd notice it tells me\neverything successfully flushed.\n\n164\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.870\nIf I hit my up arrow couple of times and I\ntake look, it still got a few records that\n\n165\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.350\nlook like they're statically\nAshley entered in there.\n\n166\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.129\nYeah, just a few because\nof that proxy server.\n\n167\n00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:19.474\n&gt;&gt; That particular the flash command can\nbe really helpful when troubleshooting\n\n168\n00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:23.028\nwith DNS problems because sometimes\nthat information for say,\n\n169\n00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:25.952\nyou change an IP address\nin that particular server.\n\n170\n00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:27.710\nAnd you need to update those records.\n\n171\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.980\nThat's when you use that command.\n\n172\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo\n\n173\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.470\nwhat if you don't find the record\ninside of your resolver cache?\n\n174\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:42.480\nWell what happens next is that your\ncomputer then goes to its network adapter.\n\n175\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.768\nI'm trying to see if I can get\naccess to my desktop again.\n\n176\n00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:49.090\nI'm gonna right-click on\nthe Windows button, and\n\n177\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.860\nhere I'm going to go into control panel.\n\n178\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.410\nOnce I'm in control panel,\nI'm going to select Network and Internet.\n\n179\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.150\nInside of that, Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n180\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.330\nAnd then right here, the one, let's see,\nlooks like I'm connected to two,\n\n181\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.790\nbut I'm gonna select this\none on that Ethernet status.\n\n182\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.420\nAnd I click on Details,\nlet's see if I can zoom in.\n\n183\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.750\nYou can see where it's pointing\nto what we call a DNS Server.\n\n184\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.970\nAnd that DNS Server is a server\nthat's designed to essentially\n\n185\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.320\ngather that type of information where\nit links up names to IP addresses and\n\n186\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.859\nstore that information right here.\n\n187\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.650\nSo if my computer cannot find it in it's\nresolver cache, it simply goes ahead, and\n\n188\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:35.070\nit looks on the DNS servers that have\nbeen configured on the network adapter.\n\n189\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.980\nAnd you can see right here where\nit actually has configured that.\n\n190\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.900\nAnd instead is actually\nusing static addresses too.\n\n191\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.920\nSo we can actually take a look and\nsee right there.\n\n192\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.374\nSo this is where it does end\nup connecting them to another\n\n193\n00:10:47.374 --> 00:10:49.292\nserver if it doesn't have it.\n\n194\n00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:51.936\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying,\nRonnie, is that first of all,\n\n195\n00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:55.314\nmy system's going to be checking if\nI've been to that website before or\n\n196\n00:10:55.314 --> 00:10:57.730\nif that record is stored\nin its local cache.\n\n197\n00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.600\nIf not, then it's gonna be calling back\nto one of those designated DNS servers.\n\n198\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.520\nWhich basically houses a database\nthat DNS zone which tells us all\n\n199\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.850\nthose resource records and that's where\nI get my information from, right?\n\n200\n00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah so if your computer\ndoesn't have it, it then goes and\n\n201\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.230\nask a DNS server which is specifically\ndesigned to have that information.\n\n202\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.720\nSo on this network, it's actually\nconnected to right here which is this,\n\n203\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.140\ntop one, which is a domain controller.\n\n204\n00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.150\nAnd notice I have the link right here for\nDNS.\n\n205\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Shows you that service is running.\n\n206\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Shows it's running.\n\n207\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.971\nAnd then if I right-click on the name of\nthe server and I go down to DNS manager,\n\n208\n00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:41.044\nI can now look into the management\nconsole of the DNS server itself.\n\n209\n00:11:41.044 --> 00:11:42.780\nAnd this is hosting, of course,\n\n210\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.650\nbeing able to manage name resolution\ninside of my network as well.\n\n211\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.186\nAnd it can also, of course,\n\n212\n00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:52.284\npoint me to other machines that are even\noutside of my network, if I need to.\n\n213\n00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:55.027\nSo I'm expanding out\nthe actual local name zone or\n\n214\n00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:58.620\ndomain name that I'm\nactually authoritated for.\n\n215\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.040\nAnd then expanding out four look up zone,\n\n216\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.140\nselecting the one that's\nlabelled as practice labs here.\n\n217\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.540\nNot the top one here, that's for\n\n218\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.750\nactive directory to do\neverything that it needs to.\n\n219\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.450\nBut this one down here is for\npracticelabs.com.\n\n220\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.815\nAnd here's kind of a visual representation\nof each one of those records.\n\n221\n00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:17.459\nSo if I examine something like this here,\n\n222\n00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:21.580\nnotice that it says this is\nwhat's called a host record.\n\n223\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.700\nAnd a host record is\nsometimes known as A record.\n\n224\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.090\nThat is the most important DNS record\nbecause that is the one that actually\n\n225\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.280\nsays, here's the name.\n\n226\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.375\n&gt;&gt; The most popular.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, here's the name and\n\n227\n00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:34.914\nhere's how it actually matches\nup to an IP address right here.\n\n228\n00:12:34.914 --> 00:12:37.885\nIf I right click on that and\ngo to Properties,\n\n229\n00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:41.540\nI can see it actually\nhas two different names.\n\n230\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.470\nSo DNS allows us to be able to say, if I\nwanna do networking, I can do networking,\n\n231\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.298\neither by using what's\ncalled the host name,\n\n232\n00:12:49.298 --> 00:12:53.379\nwhich is really just like a first\nname of a machine on your network.\n\n233\n00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:59.160\nOr, I can also do what's called an FQDM,\nwhich is a Fully Qualified Domain Name.\n\n234\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.140\nSo it has that ability to link both\nthose to a single IP address for us.\n\n235\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.410\nSo you will have it where it is\nvery possible that you can actually\n\n236\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.760\nuse both to do that.\n\n237\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.260\nSo on this one,\nlet me see I'm gonna copy this name here.\n\n238\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.663\nI think I'm gonna copy the name,\nlet me try that again.\n\n239\n00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:21.730\nIf I can now go to the command prompt,\n\n240\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.662\nI should be able to ping\non that name itself.\n\n241\n00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:28.160\nOops, I keep using the wrong keys.\n\n242\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.660\nMaybe?\n\n243\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.895\nI know what I forgot inside of here\nI have to kind of do this dont I?\n\n244\n00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:38.417\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't me allow me to context.\n\n245\n00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:40.658\n&gt;&gt; CLEBDMO1 I think it is Ronnie.\n\n246\n00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:42.930\nit might just be easier.\n\n247\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; PLABDM01.\n\n248\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.100\n&gt;&gt; DM01\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n249\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.970\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, inside of this lab\nenvironment not everything is easy,\n\n250\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.030\nas just kind of right clicking\nlike the way I want it to do.\n\n251\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.990\nSo he was able to take that name, and\nresolve it, and give me the IP address for\n\n252\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.010\nright here.\n\n253\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.534\nSo you're able to see that information,\nand it can resolve that name very well and\n\n254\n00:14:03.534 --> 00:14:04.331\nvery easily.\n\n255\n00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.570\nNow along with that,\nthere are other records that you may see.\n\n256\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.110\nLike here's one that says a name server\nwhich point you to the specific name\n\n257\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.600\nserver if you need to.\n\n258\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.420\nStart of authority which means\nthis is authoritative for\n\n259\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.776\nthis particular name zone or\nzone that we have.\n\n260\n00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:21.883\nAnd there's even reverse look up records\nthat allow you to be able to find if you\n\n261\n00:14:21.883 --> 00:14:24.970\nhave the IP address you\ncan find the name as well.\n\n262\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.140\nSo there's a different set of records\ndepending on what you need and\n\n263\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.690\nwhat you have access to.\n\n264\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.220\nBut just try and understand that\nyou'll generally see those two\n\n265\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.900\npretty much inside of\nmost business networks.\n\n266\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.810\nAnd that's probably what you'll end\nup encountering most of the time.\n\n267\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.110\nWe'll probably not play around\ntoo much with these records,\n\n268\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.690\nunless we're actually told to.\n\n269\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.010\nBut most of the time, we leave this alone.\n\n270\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.280\nBut on your individual computer's where\nyou are having to manage those sometimes,\n\n271\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.730\nyou will flush out the resolver cache\na lot of times just to make sure you get\n\n272\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.630\na good clean resolution\nthat happens is brand new.\n\n273\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.820\nIt's not something that's been cached for\na long time.\n\n274\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.610\nSo if you ever have that situation where\nit seems like it's not ever giving you\n\n275\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.560\nthe right location,\nyou may also wanna check there too.\n\n276\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.700\nThere's also another older file that's\ncalled a hosts file that you have to\n\n277\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.200\nworry about too.\n\n278\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a couple things.\n\n279\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.530\nAnd like you had shown us all in\nthe command prompt when you used that\n\n280\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.670\nhostname to actually ping, all right.\n\n281\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.140\nSo if you tried to ping with the IP\naddress and were successful but\n\n282\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.290\nwere unsuccessful by\npinging with that hostname.\n\n283\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:27.470\nThat may be an indication that Like Ronnie\nwas mentioning, there's a older\n\n284\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.240\nfile that can actually manually\noverride the DNS process.\n\n285\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.190\nSo that, it could be a clue for\nyou just to investigate further there.\n\n286\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is an unusual\nprocess to appoint right?\n\n287\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.467\nBecause it takes more steps than we think,\nfor me.\n\n288\n00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:45.040\nI think about the idea of\nlearning somebody's name.\n\n289\n00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.657\nI just ask them what's your name,\nthey tell me back and your ready to go.\n\n290\n00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:52.220\nBut, because of the way that we do\nstart the communication process,\n\n291\n00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.340\nwe have to identify and then we have to\nactually be able to locate that particular\n\n292\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.100\nIP address Then communication can\nhappen between those two computers.\n\n293\n00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.140\nSo let's kinda logically\nunderstand the flow.\n\n294\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.030\nSo I was trying to show you, I don't\nknow how successful I was there but\n\n295\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.900\nlet's take a look at my diagram here\nto help us out a little bit more.\n\n296\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.330\nSo at the very beginning, my machine says,\n\n297\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.990\nhey I need to get to\nthe IT Pro TV website.\n\n298\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.700\nWhen it does it,\nit first checks that local cache and\n\n299\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.060\nthere's also a file that I mentioned on\nmost computers called a host file, and\n\n300\n00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.520\nthat's the way we\nstatically used to do this.\n\n301\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.074\nYou'd actually have a list\nthat you would download and\n\n302\n00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:27.864\nit would actually list all the names and\nall the IP addresses that you would go to.\n\n303\n00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:29.570\n&gt;&gt; They don't really use\nthat too much any more.\n\n304\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.110\nIt could actually cause more problems\nbecause even from like a security\n\n305\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.160\nstandpoint there's just better ways\nto go ahead and block that traffic.\n\n306\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.320\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that one will\nactually kinda get you in trouble.\n\n307\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.490\nSo even if you don't use it and even if\nyou think you can delete it out of there\n\n308\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.410\nyou'll see it's still part of the process,\nbut right now it checks that cache first.\n\n309\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.120\nIf it doesn't find it there\nthat's when it goes and\n\n310\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.740\nit checks against that other DNS\nserver that's on the network.\n\n311\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.470\nSo here I'll show you.\n\n312\n00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.540\nIt's actually checking here and\nit ask the same question.\n\n313\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.060\nITProTV and it has the record here.\n\n314\n00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.080\nIt's already actually assigned there.\n\n315\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.440\nWell then, it just returns it back and\nnow he has the IP address\n\n316\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.090\nto go across the network and\nbe able to get out unto ITProTV's network.\n\n317\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:16.340\nSo it's fairly simple in that particular\nvein of different things that may happen.\n\n318\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.990\nBut look,\nit requires at least a setup, right?\n\n319\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.000\nYou not only have to have then\nan IP address on your computer.\n\n320\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.050\nYou also then have to make\nsure that that DNS record, or\n\n321\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.500\nthat link for using DNS is also filled\nin on your network adapter as well.\n\n322\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.902\nIf you don't have that you might find\nout something, that your computer can't\n\n323\n00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:38.227\nconnect to anything beyond your network\nunless you know the IP address to it.\n\n324\n00:17:38.227 --> 00:17:40.596\nAnd there's even a lot of applications\nthat may not work the way\n\n325\n00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:41.730\nthat you want to.\n\n326\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.433\nActive Directory is not gonna\nfunction like you need to as well.\n\n327\n00:17:42.433 --> 00:17:45.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, exactly, and\nyou mentioned that before.\n\n328\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.720\nAnd the Active Directory integrated zone,\n\n329\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.580\nwhen you're setting up Active Directory\nit's gonna ask you right off the bat\n\n330\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.550\nbecause otherwise well,\nit's not gonna function properly.\n\n331\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.000\nAnd if you think about it and\n\n332\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.910\nwhen you said of Active Directory you need\na domain controller which is basically\n\n333\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.550\na database of information about\nyour clients on your network.\n\n334\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.520\nSo, if you have one database that's\nhousing records and then you have another\n\n335\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.190\ndatabase well why don't you just combined\nthe two and it make sense that way.\n\n336\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.920\nAnd there's also situation that\nyou'll probably also end up having\n\n337\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.140\nto troubleshoot through.\n\n338\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.720\nAnd this is key again when you start\nheading toward cybersecurity and\n\n339\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.180\nthe analysis and\nunderstanding of process here.\n\n340\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.160\nWhat if my own DNS server\ndoesn't have a name, okay.\n\n341\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.380\nSo at that particular point what\nhappens when you don't have a name,\n\n342\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.160\nwhether it's on your own computer or\n\n343\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.380\non the DNS server that you\nare pointing to and it doesn't happen.\n\n344\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.330\nWell, that is when we have to actually\nkind of go forward or move to forwarding.\n\n345\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.970\nSay, let me go and point you to another\nDNS server out there on the internet.\n\n346\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.320\nMaybe or somewhere else, that can\npossibly resolve this name for you.\n\n347\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.860\nAnd that's when we start talking\nabout what Cherokee have mentioned in\n\n348\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.950\nthe beginning of this episode the idea\nof using what we call root hints or\n\n349\n00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.040\nthe root servers that are out\nthere on the Internet.\n\n350\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.880\nI didn't draw out all 13,\n\n351\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.140\nbut I kinda gave an example of some\nof them that you might end up seeing.\n\n352\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.680\nSo when it can't resolve it,\nthe only thing that happens at that point\n\n353\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.840\nis now it says hey,\nlet me go and ask someone else.\n\n354\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.090\nAnd usually it asks what\nis called the root servers.\n\n355\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.640\nUp here at the top, there's those 13\nbranches of DNS, and they're actually\n\n356\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.830\nnamed that root up here, which is really\njust a single dot at the very top.\n\n357\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.220\n&gt;&gt; It's actually at the very end of\nyour URL when you're typing that in.\n\n358\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.600\nIt's just that it happens so fast,\nwe don't really type that in or\n\n359\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.630\nnotice it, but it is at the top of\nthat hierarchical structure there.\n\n360\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a trailing\ndot that you normally see.\n\n361\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.217\nLike when you see .com at the end,\nlike ITPROTV demoed .com,\n\n362\n00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:48.100\nthere's actually\na trailing dot at the end.\n\n363\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.963\nAnd so, it actually looks up the smallest\nelement it can, which is that\n\n364\n00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:57.663\nlittle dot that's at the end and\nit goes up to these servers up here and\n\n365\n00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:01.632\nthat looks up the next part of\nthat name which is the com or,\n\n366\n00:20:01.632 --> 00:20:06.060\nwe just do www.itpro.tv,\nit says hey do you know who has .tv?\n\n367\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.660\nWell, the route server knows hey,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n368\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.350\npoint you to the IP address for\nthat .tv name resolution.\n\n369\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.110\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, those are our TLDs?\n\n370\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are the top-level domains.\n\n371\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.310\nSo, at this point here,\nit can point you here, and\n\n372\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.910\nthen once it does that, it can then\nlook at the next part languages, Itpro.\n\n373\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.430\nFrom there, it points us to maybe\nDNS servers that are actually\n\n374\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:34.350\nauthoritative for Itpro, and\nthen if we're looking for lab, or www.\n\n375\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.800\nIt can even point records\ndown there as well.\n\n376\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.090\nSo it is a hierarchical structure and\nat the lowest level,\n\n377\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.004\nit returns that information back\nto the user that's requesting it.\n\n378\n00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:48.330\nAnd here's what you'll\nactually get instead.\n\n379\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.930\nSo, if we follow this diagram,\n\n380\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.670\nlet me kinda move that out of the way and\nchange that up just a little bit so\n\n381\n00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.340\nwe can see it on the screen without\nhaving to readjust too much.\n\n382\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.560\n&gt;&gt; And in your enviroment and especially\nif you're using active directory,\n\n383\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.630\nyou should have a minimum of one but\n\n384\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.840\nin a lot of environment you\nreally wanna have a minimum of\n\n385\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.750\ntwo it's not gonna hurt anything to\nhave extra redundancies in place here.\n\n386\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you really need it especially\nif you're gonna be networking all\n\n387\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.520\nacross the world.\n\n388\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.100\nYou wanna make sure that everything is\nactually operating the way that you need\n\n389\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.580\nto, redundancy is always\ngood in that sense.\n\n390\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.930\nSo, the same process happens\nit checks against local cache,\n\n391\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.890\nit doesn't find it, it then sends\na message up to your DNS server, and\n\n392\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.850\nif it checks it here\nwith the DNS server and\n\n393\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:33.670\nit can't find it that is when it\nmight go out to the actual route.\n\n394\n00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.050\nNow, it doesn't always do that,\nwe might actually forward it to.\n\n395\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.170\nA particular forwarder,\nsuch as inside of our own ISP.\n\n396\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.020\nWhen you get a public IP address from\nyour ISP, they may tell you, hey,\n\n397\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.380\nyou wanna use these DNS\nservers if you choose to.\n\n398\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.820\nYou can use any of them out on\nthe Internet that you want to.\n\n399\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.040\nBut they may say for a good resolution you\nmay wanna use this for fast resolution.\n\n400\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.270\nThe closer it is to you the better,\nor the quicker,\n\n401\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.100\nyou're actually gonna get\nthe The resolution happening.\n\n402\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.280\nSo, you may actually use whatever their IP\naddresses are, but if you choose not to\n\n403\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.460\nyou can tell it to actually go and do root\nhints which is go all the way up to root\n\n404\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:14.150\nserver every time, and then when it checks\nit out here the same question is asked.\n\n405\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.320\nITProTV, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.690\nThat's that, what if the root\nserver doesn't know where it is?\n\n407\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.550\nWell he might say, I know where TV,\nor .TV is, or .com.\n\n408\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.070\nGo and ask that,\nlet me just change this up and\n\n409\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.200\ndo .TV instead to make it consistent.\n\n410\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.090\nSo, go and ask the TV server.\n\n411\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.040\nNow, once it does that,\nthen it can go directly to or\n\n412\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.110\nthe DNS server,\nit returns the record back to DNS,\n\n413\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:48.330\nDNS then gets forwarded on to that\nTV server's top-level domain.\n\n414\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.850\nFrom there it says, all right,\nI know where that is.\n\n415\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.890\nIt sends the information,\nit caches it right here locally, and\n\n416\n00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.750\nthen it sends the proper information\nback down to the client.\n\n417\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.080\nAnd now, the client can resolve it and\nbe able to connect all the way out,\n\n418\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.190\noops I left the trailing tag there,\noff to ITProTv.\n\n419\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.090\nSo, it can do that as well, so that's the\ngreat thing is that even though this seems\n\n420\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:17.080\nlike a very insanely redundant system and\nseems like a long drawn out process.\n\n421\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.105\nIt pretty much is the basis of everything\nthat we do on the actual public Internet\n\n422\n00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:26.990\nat this particular time for us to be able\nto get around and to navigate around.\n\n423\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.918\nNDS is gonna become even more and more\nimportant in the near future because as\n\n424\n00:23:31.918 --> 00:23:36.461\neasy as we understand it with IPv4\naddresses Remember that IP version\n\n425\n00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:41.389\nsix addresses are coming along and\nyou though IP version four addresses were\n\n426\n00:23:41.389 --> 00:23:46.317\nhard to memorize, IP version six addresses\nare gonna be a little bit tougher\n\n427\n00:23:46.317 --> 00:23:50.706\nto try to memorize too so DNS is\nprobably gonna actually be the key for\n\n428\n00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:55.282\nus networking period in the future\ncuz we're not gonna wanna try and.\n\n429\n00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:58.281\nAnd go no, I know exactly what\nIP address I need to go to and\n\n430\n00:23:58.281 --> 00:23:59.662\nwhat range that they are.\n\n431\n00:23:59.662 --> 00:24:03.380\nYou may know but you may not be able to\nidentify them very easily until you get\n\n432\n00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.453\nused to understanding hexadecimal as well\nas you do the idea of decimal numbers and\n\n433\n00:24:07.453 --> 00:24:09.230\nbinary numbers as well.\n\n434\n00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:14.310\nSo, there is kind of the big\nprocess of using DNS altogether.\n\n435\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.060\nRemember, that they do work by the use\nof different records which is key.\n\n436\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.900\nThe host record is by far\nprobably the most important.\n\n437\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.340\nIf you do a reverse look up instead\nthere's one they also call at PTR record,\n\n438\n00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.700\nit's kind of the same thing.\n\n439\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.620\nIt allows you to actually be\nable to do it both ways there.\n\n440\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.120\nWe have DNS servers that\nare available inside of our network.\n\n441\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.870\nAnd out on the Internet, and your own\ncomputer has the ability to resolve,\n\n442\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.920\nand host those records too,\non the machine, but only does it in RAM.\n\n443\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.580\nOr if you want to permanently there,\n\n444\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.410\nyou can add it into a host\nfile onto your computer.\n\n445\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.800\nSo, there are many different\nways that we can use DNS, but\n\n446\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.040\nis something we should not overlook.\n\n447\n00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.520\nLater on, when we get into the idea of\nmore of the understanding of security,\n\n448\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.720\nyou're gonna see something about\neverything that we've talked about here as\n\n449\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.180\nfar as services go.\n\n450\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.520\nThe basic services for\n\n451\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.990\nnetworking were really designed\naround overall functionality, okay?\n\n452\n00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.580\nSo, overall functionality\nmeans they really did\n\n453\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.810\nthink about how well this thing works.\n\n454\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.010\nWhat they really didn't think about\nthough is the idea of security.\n\n455\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.610\nIn anything that we talked about,\nlike ARP, in the previous episode,\n\n456\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.650\nright, that's all done by broadcast.\n\n457\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.100\nNot very secure.\n\n458\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.980\nDHCP, my client,\nit sends out a DHCP discover package.\n\n459\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.730\nIt doesn't care if it's a rogue DHCP\nserver, or a legitimate DHCP server.\n\n460\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.350\nSays I just need an IP address.\n\n461\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.560\nWhoever responds is\nactually going to respond.\n\n462\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.110\nSo there's not a lot of\nsecurity there either.\n\n463\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:42.380\nDNS is designed to help you\nto connect to machines.\n\n464\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's not designed to go,\n\n465\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.630\nshould I really give you\nthis information or not.\n\n466\n00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.080\nAre you authorized for this information.\n\n467\n00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.540\nSo, services designed around\nthe idea of functionality but\n\n468\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.870\nnot really around the idea security.\n\n469\n00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.720\n&gt;&gt; Core network services is so important\nto protect them for those reasons alone.\n\n470\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.470\nSo, we just definitely have to pay\nattention to those machines that\n\n471\n00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.080\nare hosting these particular services.\n\n472\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.540\n&gt;&gt; It is not doubt that not\nonly those machines but\n\n473\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.560\nunderstanding that process that goes on.\n\n474\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.818\nOn everything that we talked about\nin terms of services so far,\n\n475\n00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:16.850\nthese are essential services.\n\n476\n00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.430\nIt's not like you can say, well,\nI could turn off these things.\n\n477\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.560\nYou can, okay.\n\n478\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.590\nYou can turn off DACP if you want to.\n\n479\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.170\nThat means static assignments which is\nperfectly fine as long as you're willing\n\n480\n00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.860\nto do that repetitive work over and over\nagain and your network is rarely changing.\n\n481\n00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.330\nIf your network is changing constantly,\nwell, this is not a good solution for you.\n\n482\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.490\nYou can't turn off DNS.\n\n483\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:42.080\nAs much as you think it's an insecure\nservice, there's DNS set now,\n\n484\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.440\nDNS security that you can implement now.\n\n485\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.530\nBut, you can't just turn it off.\n\n486\n00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:51.300\nSo, it's not as easy as saying,\nI simply won't use those things anymore.\n\n487\n00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.800\nIt's not possible.\n\n488\n00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.270\nSo, that means you have to discover\nthe way that their process works.\n\n489\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.610\nYou have to understand\nthose foundational aspects,\n\n490\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.320\nbefore you can think about\nthe additional security you need to add.\n\n491\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.380\nSo, now the services can be secured.\n\n492\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.830\nAnd also, in terms of analysis, right.\n\n493\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.540\nYou need to understand those\nbasic weaknesses that are here.\n\n494\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.810\nThey are designed to function and to make\nyou be able to network as a human so\n\n495\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.360\nmuch easier than if everything\nhad to be done manually.\n\n496\n00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.860\nSo these services are there but they\nare really at the same time a strange,\n\n497\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:31.310\nunusual security, vulnerability\nthat we have to worry about, too.\n\n498\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.880\nAnd we're gonna get more into the idea\nof securing services later on.\n\n499\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.370\nBut at this point, though, at least\nunderstand their basic functionalities.\n\n500\n00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.420\nThat will actually help you to manage\nthe networks a little bit better.\n\n501\n00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure, and Ronnie,\nwe looked at DNS here in this episode.\n\n502\n00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.280\nIf you don't feel comfortable and\nstrong in this particular topic or\n\n503\n00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.200\nany of the topics we spoke\nabout in the previous episodes,\n\n504\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.930\nthen do a search on the ITPROTV site.\n\n505\n00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.260\nI'm sure there are other episodes.\n\n506\n00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.310\nSome of them even go more in depth,\nyou have that use it to your advantage.\n\n507\n00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.190\nThere might have been a different aspect\nor some detail that we didn't mention here\n\n508\n00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.380\nthat might really resonate with you,\nso take advantage of that.\n\n509\n00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.640\nBut Ronnie, I think you did a good job\nexplaining that so I really appreciate you\n\n510\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.660\ncoming in today and\nI do appreciate you guys for tuning in.\n\n511\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.420\nBut don't go anywhere we still have\nmore information headed your way.\n\n512\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.700\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n513\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n514\n00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.740\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n515\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:31.745\n[MUSIC]\n\n516\n00:28:31.745 -->

00:00:07.772\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:08.523\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Cisco Cybersecurity\n\n5\n00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:13.568\nFundamentals Series.\nI'm your show host\n\n6\n00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:17.872\nCherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:23.110\nSo far in this series we've really\nbeen looking at theoretical concepts.\n\n8\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.910\nHowever this series, we're really gonna\nbe focusing in on some tangible hardware.\n\n9\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.480\nSo we'll be describing\nnetwork device operations.\n\n10\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.980\nWith us today,\nwe have Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.580\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.292\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.009\nhaving me back here on the Cisco\nCyber Security Fundamentals show.\n\n14\n00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.997\nAs we take a look now,\njust like what Cherokee was talking about,\n\n15\n00:00:41.997 --> 00:00:45.895\nthe idea here of some different\nhardware that supports.\n\n16\n00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:50.560\nWell, the issues that we've been taking\nlook at already such as basic networking.\n\n17\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.690\nIf we talk about the idea of networking\nright, it's easy to understand that there\n\n18\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520\nare fundamental theories and\nconcepts that we have to understand.\n\n19\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.230\nBut what is it that makes it work?\n\n20\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.230\nWell, it's the underlying hardware\nthat really begins to make it work.\n\n21\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.040\nSo we are going to focus in on\nsome of the hardware devices and\n\n22\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.240\ntalk about their functionality.\n\n23\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.520\nNow the order that we do these in\nis a no row one particular order.\n\n24\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490\nSo what we did instead\nis we just said hey,\n\n25\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.370\nhere's what the exam objectives say and\nthey list them in this way.\n\n26\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.585\nAnd we've just would have described him or\nI have.\n\n27\n00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:25.190\nWe'll go a head describe\nthem in terms of that order.\n\n28\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.170\nSo don't think that the order\nin which will carrying them\n\n29\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.460\nreally means any significance yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.257\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't build up that way cuz you'll\n\n31\n00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:33.703\nsee like hubs is almost like next to last.\n\n32\n00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:35.870\nAnd why are we talking about?\n\n33\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.450\nBecause we still have to mention them,\nyou'll find them in components inside of\n\n34\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.010\nnetworks today even though\nyou don't think you will.\n\n35\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.590\nAnd that's essential for us to understand\nas we go toward this idea of cyber ops.\n\n36\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.821\nThe reason why is most people might\nunderstand basic security concepts.\n\n37\n00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:57.330\nThey might even have a good grasp and\nunderstanding of networking as far as\n\n38\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.020\nthe theories and the services and\neven protocols that are used.\n\n39\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.556\nBut it doesn't mean that\neverybody knows every piece of\n\n40\n00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:09.404\nequipment on the network that\nthey are actually working in.\n\n41\n00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:13.550\nAnd I know that people will\nkind of argue with me on this.\n\n42\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.880\nBut that is an essential component\nif you're going to be doing\n\n43\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.480\nsome type of analysis and\n\n44\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.970\nwhat could be influencing your network\nespecially in terms of security.\n\n45\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.511\nYou've got to know about every technology.\n\n46\n00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.551\nI don't want to say you have to be\ninsanely exhaustive about every\n\n47\n00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:29.830\ntechnology.\n\n48\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.980\nBut you need to know at least\nevery technology that's on there.\n\n49\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.600\nYou also of course at this\npoint in terms of networking,\n\n50\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.360\nneed to know the basic networking\noperations on how these devices work.\n\n51\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.908\nSo that's why we're going to spend\nsome time in them as well, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:44.908 --> 00:02:46.952\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat multiple ones here.\n\n53\n00:02:46.952 --> 00:02:50.200\nWe're gonna talk about routers,\nwe're gonna talk about switches, hubs,\n\n54\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.600\nbridges, and wireless access points,\nwireless controllers.\n\n55\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.700\nA ton of different things here.\n\n56\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.516\nSo we're not gonna go\nsuper deep dive into it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:59.651\nIf you wanna learn more,\nespecially on routers and switches,\n\n58\n00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.130\nmake sure you check out the CCNA\nrouting and switching shows.\n\n59\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.630\nAnd of course, the CCND will go much\nmore in depth into those concepts, too.\n\n60\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and something I would like to\nmention is as we begin talking about these\n\n61\n00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:14.700\ndevices, just keep an open mind.\n\n62\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.957\nBecause everything is not so\nblack and white and\n\n63\n00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:19.616\nyou'll see as Ronnie explains\nthroughout the series.\n\n64\n00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.250\nBut we even have this idea of\nvirtualization that's very popular today.\n\n65\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.000\nSo, you can even hear\nrouters being virtualized.\n\n66\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.710\nSo as we continue through this show,\njust kind of keep your mind open and\n\n67\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.490\ndon't just think of it the traditional\nrouter piece of router appliance hardware.\n\n68\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead and\ndescribe the functions since you mentioned\n\n69\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.690\nthe idea of routers and\nthat's kind of the first one on our list.\n\n70\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.980\nLet's talk about what\na router really does for us,\n\n71\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.650\nas far as network wise, in what we need.\n\n72\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.420\nRemember that, when we start talking\nabout networking, and we go back to that\n\n73\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.600\nOSI model, we're not really dealing\nwith the idea of data delivery, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.310\nBeing able to make sure that data can go\nget from one location to another location,\n\n75\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.600\nrouters are along that path\nin the OSI model, as well.\n\n76\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.128\nOnce data needs to be communicated\nfrom one machine, if at some point,\n\n77\n00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:14.230\nright, is going to be prepared for\nthe network.\n\n78\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.740\nAnd once it's prepared for the network, it\nthen is going to be put into one size or\n\n79\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.700\nchunks of data that we call segments,\nwhich now can be sent across the network.\n\n80\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.220\nNow at that point, we have to have\naddressing which is at Layer 3.\n\n81\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.310\nAnd this is where it's important\nbecause routers operate on Layer 3.\n\n82\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.000\nAnd that means it can take a frame that\nit sees and it can actually say, hey look\n\n83\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.490\nnot only is this at the right location but\nI can even use that layer 3 information\n\n84\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.430\ninside of that frame to start forwarding\nthe data to its ultimate destination.\n\n85\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.900\nSo it really does provide for us the\nability to take layer 3 information and\n\n86\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.900\nto move the data along that path as well.\n\n87\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.628\nAs Ashley says I need to\ngo from here to there.\n\n88\n00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:03.928\nThe other thing that it does for us and\nkind of one of the most important\n\n89\n00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:09.250\nthings outside of a LAN, is it separates\nout different subnets for us as well.\n\n90\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.520\nLet's take a look at my machine that\nwill help us cuz I've got a diagram that\n\n91\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.930\nI've actually kind of made here\nto help us out a little bit.\n\n92\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.720\nA little bit more stretched out there but\nwe can kind of see it a little bit more.\n\n93\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.567\nNow, a router most of the time inside\nof a LAN functions as what we call\n\n94\n00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.390\na default router or a default gateway.\n\n95\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.510\nI'm gonna start using some of the more\nCisco terminology rather than Microsoft\n\n96\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.210\ncentric terminology.\n\n97\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.010\nAnd in Cisco, they don't tend\nto use default gateway a lot,\n\n98\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.990\neven though you're starting to see\nthat more and more as a terminology.\n\n99\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.360\nBut you may see the term\ndefault router instead.\n\n100\n00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.950\nVery important that you understand\nthat those two things are equal\n\n101\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.420\nin terms of concept, but\n\n102\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.790\nnot in terminology, especially when\nyou face the exam, you might see that.\n\n103\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.810\nSo the way that this works is that,\nwhat if we do have a headquarters network,\n\n104\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.060\na branch network,\nas well as the Internet that's out there?\n\n105\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.620\nAll of those different networks\nthen could theoretically be\n\n106\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220\ntunneled through the Internet\nusing VPN technology.\n\n107\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.750\nOr we might actually have each one having\na direct connection to the other LANS that\n\n108\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.880\nare out there across, you know whatever\nLAN type of connection that we have.\n\n109\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.148\nOn one side, we of course then inside of\neach one of those networks we can have our\n\n110\n00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.307\nlocal area network.\n\n111\n00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:27.205\nSo it is a very big possibility that\nyou may actually have printer one here\n\n112\n00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:32.240\nthat says look, I'm actually going\nto be printing something from PC1.\n\n113\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.670\nAnd also from all of those\nPC's over in Branch two,\n\n114\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.850\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n115\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.490\nYou could also have a PC1 that says,\nI need to go out and\n\n116\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.740\nactually get access to this website.\n\n117\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.930\nServer one might say that I need\nto back up information, but\n\n118\n00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.470\nthat actually exists on\na different network.\n\n119\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.820\nWithout a router, that's right there\nusually on the edge of our network,\n\n120\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.280\nnone of this is possible, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.016\nAnd that is because routers do\nend up doing this one thing here.\n\n122\n00:07:01.016 --> 00:07:05.382\nAt least at the very basics which is\nseparating out multiple networks at\n\n123\n00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:08.440\nthe same time connecting them together.\n\n124\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.500\nSo it forms a centralized connectivity\ndevice, between different networks,\n\n125\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.330\nis what it allows it to do.\n\n126\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.810\nEvery network for us becomes what we\ncall a simple broadcast domain so\n\n127\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.440\nthat broadcast can go out inside\nof that one network as well.\n\n128\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.970\nSo, it is a lot of different things,\nbut at the simplest point here,\n\n129\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.700\nit can at least do this for us, which\nis to separate out different networks.\n\n130\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.650\nSo, if I know I need to connect\nmultiple networks together,\n\n131\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.750\na router is pretty much the device\nthat helps us to be able to do that.\n\n132\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.450\nIf I say, I need two different networks\nand I go, I know what I'm gonna do,\n\n133\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.190\nI'm gonna create two different VLANs,\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n134\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.990\nBut, I need those VLANs to\nconnect to one another because\n\n135\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.310\nthey're on different networks.\n\n136\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.954\nWell you can't do so\nwithout a router in between, or\n\n137\n00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:56.366\na layer three device in\nbetween to help you out.\n\n138\n00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:59.959\nSo essentially, regardless of\nwhether it's a virtual router or\n\n139\n00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.854\nwhether it's a physical router,\n\n140\n00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:06.490\nLayer three devices are important when we\nhave different subnets, or when we do need\n\n141\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.330\nto connect to networks that we don't\neven know about as well, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.260\nSo there's one of the first\nfunctionalities that we have in terms of\n\n143\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.990\na router and what we do.\n\n144\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.320\nNow another thing that a router does is\nthat a router can help us to do something\n\n145\n00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.270\nthat we really don't tend to understand\nat the very beginning of networking.\n\n146\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.423\nWhich is we can now take data,\n\n147\n00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:32.258\nforward it to another network that\nI am not directly connected to.\n\n148\n00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:35.940\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna have to learn\nDijkstra's algorithm today, Ronnie?\n\n149\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.580\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna learn\nDijkstra's algorithm today.\n\n150\n00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.890\nYou will on the CCNA routing and\nswitching, but\n\n151\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.970\nnot on today is what we'll see.\n\n152\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.290\nSo here, we know that it's very easy.\n\n153\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.340\nThese could actually be on the next four,\n\n154\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.758\nlike hedge quarters could\nbe on that 4 one, too.\n\n155\n00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:52.380\nThe branch too could be in the same\ncity if we wanted to across that and\n\n156\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.540\nlink there and\nthen a connection out to the Internet.\n\n157\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.740\nAll of that can actually be\nphysically connected in that way.\n\n158\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.872\nBut what if the information I need is not\nactually directly connected in any way,\n\n159\n00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:04.130\nexcept for across the Internet?\n\n160\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.660\nSo routers can help us to be able to\nforward data to networks that they're\n\n161\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.250\nnot directly connected on.\n\n162\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.700\nSo right here in my diagram, I show\nyou that there's actually a connection\n\n163\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.700\nin between the headquarters and Branch 1.\n\n164\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.660\nThis connection could be\nacross the Internet, or\n\n165\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.590\nit could be across a privately leased\ntype of connection that you might have.\n\n166\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.330\nEither way, right, these two\nnetworks are not directly connected.\n\n167\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.050\nAnd it does that based on information\nthat the routing tables can hold inside\n\n168\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.290\nbased on the router and the routing\ntables inside of those routers as well.\n\n169\n00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.850\nThose routing tables essentially\nare built in one of two ways.\n\n170\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.920\nEither we statically configure\nthose routes inside of the routers.\n\n171\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.350\nSo, we can manually go in and\nset your program them in.\n\n172\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.770\nOr we can turn on different routing\nprotocols that will allow for\n\n173\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:57.350\nthe routers to learn about\ndifferent networks from each other.\n\n174\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.610\nSo, depending on the complexity of your\nnetwork, you actually probably used one or\n\n175\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.110\nthe other, a very simple network,\na static route will work just fine.\n\n176\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.570\nMedium to complex network,\n\n177\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.330\nyou'll probably wanna actually use\na routing protocol in between.\n\n178\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.990\nSo all of that is important for\neverything that we do.\n\n179\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.440\nSo when it comes down to\nsome of the things that\n\n180\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.370\nyou actually have to understand in\nthe way that a router functions\n\n181\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.500\nare a couple of things that we\nwanna make sure that we take away.\n\n182\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.730\nOne is, of course, the configuration\non the interfaces of the router.\n\n183\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.090\nThose have to be correct for\n\n184\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.570\nnetworking to happen, okay,\nthat's pretty much kind of the key.\n\n185\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.240\nAt least the IP address on the routers,\nas well as sum of that mass and\n\n186\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.520\nthe interfaces, are turned on.\n\n187\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.863\nJust as a good guide and\n\n188\n00:10:40.863 --> 00:10:45.481\nwhen we start talking about is the router\nfunctioning the way that we need to.\n\n189\n00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:46.128\nOf course,\n\n190\n00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:50.156\nit has to have an interface with an IP\naddress on that particular network.\n\n191\n00:10:50.156 --> 00:10:53.936\nSo the same thing here on this network,\nsame thing between this network and\n\n192\n00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:55.985\nthe same thing even out to the Internet.\n\n193\n00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:57.987\nWhatever your ISP assigns here,\n\n194\n00:10:57.987 --> 00:11:03.450\nthey'll also give you an address that you\ncan assign on this interface here, too.\n\n195\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.450\nSo that way, you're actually\nconnected to their network.\n\n196\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.030\nSame thing with the branch office,\nyou actually assign the IP\n\n197\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.350\naddress on the other side,\nsame thing here for the headquarters.\n\n198\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.160\nSo we know that those configurations\nhave to be correct too.\n\n199\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:15.730\nThe other thing,\n\n200\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.600\nof course, it actually depends on the\nrouting protocol that you're gonna use,\n\n201\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.390\nrouting protocols have to be configured\non those devices on each side as well.\n\n202\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.712\nSo, you've gotta realize that, too.\n\n203\n00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:29.370\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, not all routing\nprotocols are created equally.\n\n204\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.300\nSo the way that that information\nis stored can be different, right,\n\n205\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.160\ndepending on even if that hardware can\nsupport different routing protocols.\n\n206\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.840\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n207\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.280\nSo, based on that idea, right,\n\n208\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.560\nyou will have some routers that may not be\nable to support newer routing protocols.\n\n209\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.830\nYou may have some that\nwon't support the old ones.\n\n210\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.570\nIt just depends on what you're doing.\n\n211\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.640\nBut if you can't find that,\n\n212\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.780\nthen static routing is probably\ngonna be the way to go.\n\n213\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.280\nMost of them can support the majority of\nthe routing protocols, especially on Cisco\n\n214\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.750\nrouters, you can probably just about\nrun anything that you want to.\n\n215\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.630\n&gt;&gt; And would you agree that static routing\nis going to be, you mentioned before, it\n\n216\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:08.220\nis designed for smaller networks because\nwe do see more administrative effort.\n\n217\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.220\nBut as far as from a security standpoint,\n\n218\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.990\nwould that be more beneficial to prevent\nany kind of rogue routers and utilizing\n\n219\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.060\nadditional paths if you have a static one\ninstead, or what do you think about that?\n\n220\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, it can be if you make sure that\nnobody can get access to that router.\n\n221\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.360\nSo that they can't over program.\n\n222\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.200\n&gt;&gt; Modify that information?\n\n223\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep, modify the actual configuration.\n\n224\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.350\nBut in terms of security,\nit's not really so\n\n225\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.430\nmuch about security as much as it is about\nhow many directions are available for\n\n226\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.860\npeople to get out of your\nnetwork in static routing.\n\n227\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.601\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If there's only one, well,\n\n228\n00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:42.803\nyou only need one route, well,\nso you don't need to turn on\n\n229\n00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:46.992\nentire routing protocol for that router\nto learn about where to send data to.\n\n230\n00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:50.750\nYou just need to manually\nprogram in a default route.\n\n231\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.200\nSay hey, any network that you wanna\ngo to besides the one that's here,\n\n232\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.210\ngo out this interface.\n\n233\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.480\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n234\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.910\nSo the idea of turning on\na routing protocol for\n\n235\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.320\nsomething like that, I'm not saying you\ncan't do it, people do it all the time.\n\n236\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.900\nBut the very fact is, you're only gonna\nhave one route, and that one route is\n\n237\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.540\nnever gonna change, cuz there's only one\npath in and one path out of that network.\n\n238\n00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.352\nSo it really helps in overhead more than\nanything else, but if you can figure that\n\n239\n00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:16.278\nto ensure that you're that only one that\ncan actually change that configuration,\n\n240\n00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:17.417\nthen it is more secure.\n\n241\n00:13:17.417 --> 00:13:21.850\nBecause nobody can upload anything in\nby manipulating the routing protocol on\n\n242\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.755\nthe other end.\n\n243\n00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:26.849\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, on the other end of\na router and sending that update along.\n\n244\n00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:30.760\nSo it can be, but\nnot necessarily all the time.\n\n245\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n246\n00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.892\n&gt;&gt; So routers are very essential, so\nremember that they're layer three and\n\n247\n00:13:34.892 --> 00:13:37.040\nthat they have to be configured correctly.\n\n248\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.400\nIf you're gonna use a routing protocol,\n\n249\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.330\nmake sure you do choose the same one on\nboth sides to be able to use that as well.\n\n250\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.920\nSo it's really key there when\nwe start implementing it.\n\n251\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.370\nEven though today, routers tend to be kind\nof disappearing off of most networks.\n\n252\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.800\nAnd the reason why is firewalls tend to\nhave routing components built into them.\n\n253\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.214\nAnd on small to medium companies,\n\n254\n00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:04.551\ntheir only real multiple connection\nmore is using VPM connection instead.\n\n255\n00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:08.697\nSo they only need an outside interface and\nan inside interface,\n\n256\n00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:13.534\nand they don't need a router with two or\nthree physical network adapters to\n\n257\n00:14:13.534 --> 00:14:18.472\nconnect out to the Internet across a T1\nline, across whatever it might be.\n\n258\n00:14:18.472 --> 00:14:19.060\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n259\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.624\nthey just don't need them anymore,\nbut so you can see now where routers,\n\n260\n00:14:24.624 --> 00:14:28.510\nyou may not see them as often\nas you used to anymore.\n\n261\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.875\nBut you will still find them in existence,\nbecause well,\n\n262\n00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:33.400\npeople don't tend to remove\ndevices that are there already.\n\n263\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.170\n&gt;&gt; If it's not broke, don't fix it.\n\n264\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.128\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it's not broke, don't fix it.\n\n265\n00:14:37.128 --> 00:14:40.350\nBut it does allow you to control\nthe routes better, okay, if you want to.\n\n266\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.460\nYou may see a firewall and then a router\nand then connect it out to the Internet,\n\n267\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.520\ndepending on what you actually need,\nespecially if there is multiple other\n\n268\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.380\nnetworks inside of your own location as\nwell, with routers being able to do that.\n\n269\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.280\nSo router is a very important part\nof the concepts that we have, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.130\nAll right, so\nlet's talk on our next device,\n\n271\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.190\nwhich is the idea of a switch instead.\n\n272\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.090\nNow switches and\nbridges tend to go hand in hand, but\n\n273\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.520\nlet's talk about the idea\nof what a switch does.\n\n274\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.887\nOkay, at the very beginning we, of course,\nhad hubs that allowed us to connect\n\n275\n00:15:12.887 --> 00:15:15.605\nmultiple devices together, and\nthen they could communicate,\n\n276\n00:15:15.605 --> 00:15:18.094\nwhich was perfectly fine,\nbut very inefficient, okay.\n\n277\n00:15:18.094 --> 00:15:22.129\nIf you had a hub that ran\nat 10 megabit connection,\n\n278\n00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:29.200\nwell everybody that plugged in that hub\nwould essentially share that 10 megabits.\n\n279\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.779\nSo anything that actually went into one\nport got broadcast out every other port.\n\n280\n00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:36.158\n&gt;&gt; A lot of congestion.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of congestion,\n\n281\n00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:40.510\na lot of traffic would actually have\nto be retransmitted all the time.\n\n282\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.200\nBut then they came up with switches and\nbridges.\n\n283\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.313\nSwitches and bridges, they tend to take\na look at the layer two information.\n\n284\n00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:53.185\nSo, a switch is a layer two device, and\ninstead, what they do is they allow you to\n\n285\n00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:58.079\nforward data out based on that layer two\ninformation, which is the MAC address.\n\n286\n00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:00.898\nNot every MAC address appeared\non every single port.\n\n287\n00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:05.254\nSo that means that whatever MAC address\nappears on that one port as you send data\n\n288\n00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:07.498\ninto it, the switch then can go ahead and\n\n289\n00:16:07.498 --> 00:16:11.750\nswitch that over to that one port\ndirectly connecting two ports together.\n\n290\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.580\nLet me show you on my diagram\nhere that will help us out.\n\n291\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.390\nSo data entering in a single port,\nis normally directed out\n\n292\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:24.110\nonly one specific port, all the other\nports do not end up sharing that data.\n\n293\n00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.710\nThey won't even see that data,\n\n294\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.620\ncoming across all the other\nports that are out there.\n\n295\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.990\nSo it makes much better efficiency, and\n\n296\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.880\nmuch better use of the bandwidth\nthat we have available.\n\n297\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.250\nIf this is a 10 megabit port, or\na 100 megabit, or a gigabyte port,\n\n298\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.810\nthat means that that device connects in,\ngets that gigabyte connection.\n\n299\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.210\nSame thing over here.\n\n300\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.780\nIt's not got a shared connection.\n\n301\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.020\nAnother thing that switches also have,\nis what's called an ASIC.\n\n302\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.950\nApplication specific integrated circuitry.\n\n303\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:57.600\nWhich means it doesn't really depend\non software, to make this decision.\n\n304\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.220\nSo it's not having to go, and query, and\napply this, and say what port is this on?\n\n305\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.310\nIt's baked inside of the hardware itself.\n\n306\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.410\nThat says hey, I know exactly what\nto use to get this information and\n\n307\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.050\nto do this much quicker,\n\n308\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.980\nthan if we slowed it down by having\nto ask a software component to do so.\n\n309\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.680\nWell, essentially the software is baked\nright into the actual chips themselves, so\n\n310\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.620\nwe don't have to worry about that either.\n\n311\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.087\nSo the idea of the switching component\nalong with that makes networking much\n\n312\n00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.759\nfaster and\nmuch more efficient in what we do.\n\n313\n00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:34.880\nNow the other thing that a switch does,\nbecause all based on well, decisions.\n\n314\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.800\nIs it makes it a smarter device,\nis what it makes it happen here.\n\n315\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.273\nAnd that idea of the smarter devices\nmeans that this switch also has that MAC\n\n316\n00:17:44.273 --> 00:17:49.450\naddress table, you might hear the term\nCAM table, you might everything else.\n\n317\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.877\nBut essentially it's\njust a MAC address table,\n\n318\n00:17:51.877 --> 00:17:54.450\nthat allows the ports to be numbered.\n\n319\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.051\nAnd then, all the devices that are plugged\nin, they can learn about the different\n\n320\n00:17:59.051 --> 00:18:01.864\nMAC addresses that\nare plugged into those ports.\n\n321\n00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:07.306\nSo as soon as you plug a device in, and\nas long as traffic is being sent that way,\n\n322\n00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:12.266\nit can learn that that one device\nactually resides off of this one port.\n\n323\n00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:15.347\nOnce that particular MAC address table,\n\n324\n00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:21.660\nactually does have all the actual MAC\naddresses on it along with the ports.\n\n325\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.220\nAs information is sent,\nit can go ahead and\n\n326\n00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.290\nuse this same information, to know\nexactly what port to forward data out of.\n\n327\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:34.160\nSo the switch has three decisions, and\nthat's pretty much it that it does.\n\n328\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.170\nEither, it forwards data\nfrom one port to the other.\n\n329\n00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.950\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n330\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.120\nIt can go ahead and\nalso filter data out as well.\n\n331\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.870\nTake for instance down here at the bottom.\n\n332\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.450\nAnd I have a hub plugged in down here.\n\n333\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.840\nNotice that both of these\ncomputers over here,\n\n334\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.760\nactually plugged directly\ninto port number three.\n\n335\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.675\nAnd you see port number three here.\n\n336\n00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:57.940\nYou'll also see port number three here,\nand you actually notice there actually is\n\n337\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.760\ntwo different MAC addresses\non port number three.\n\n338\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.730\nWell, the basic functioning of the way\nthat the switch works is that as you\n\n339\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.870\nsend down into one port,\n\n340\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.930\nit will fold to that out any other\nport except for the one it came in on.\n\n341\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.670\nIt just not gonna do that.\n\n342\n00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.790\nSo, if I wanted to send data\nfrom this one that ends in dd,\n\n343\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:21.000\ndd-8b to dd-4b here,\n\n344\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.960\nwell I can send that along, and the data\nwill go across over here to the hub.\n\n345\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.040\nSo it will reach its destination.\n\n346\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.000\nBut when it gets up here to port\nnumber three It says, all right.\n\n347\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.030\nI need to send this data out this port,\nand I can send it to any port but\n\n348\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.930\nthe one it came in on.\n\n349\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.470\nIt says, wait a minute.\n\n350\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.900\nAccording to that MAC address table,\nit's on the same port it came in on.\n\n351\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.130\nSo it filters it,\nit drops that connection.\n\n352\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.710\nOr it can flood it.\n\n353\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.570\nIf we send something from let's\nsay port number two ,to an IP\n\n354\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.470\naddress that's not on my diagram here.\n\n355\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.600\nIt's not actually anywhere on here.\n\n356\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.350\nBut there's only two possibilities here.\n\n357\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.190\nIt can broadcast it, cuz they are.\n\n358\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.160\nLet's go and send out an art, to find\nout if that guy is actually on here.\n\n359\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.310\nSo it can go ahead and try and do that,\nto find everything that it needs to.\n\n360\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.730\nWell, it's not gonna be able to find it.\n\n361\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.870\nOr it now declares as what's\ncalled an unknown unicast.\n\n362\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.590\nAn unknown unicast's essentially\nthe same as a broadcast.\n\n363\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.610\nSays look, I'm gonna send out every\nother port cuz I think that maybe\n\n364\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.130\nit's just plugged in and\nit's just not responding.\n\n365\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.560\nSo it can do the same thing.\n\n366\n00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.480\nSo when it does that, it can flood it,\nit can filter it, or it can forward data.\n\n367\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.650\nAnd that's pretty much what decisions\nthat a switch allows us to do,\n\n368\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.750\non everything that's plugged into it.\n\n369\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.850\nIt is one of the most essential elements\nthat we have inside of a LAN network,\n\n370\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.600\nbecause switches don't need\nany additional configuration.\n\n371\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.100\nStraight from the factory you pull it out\nof the box from Cisco, you plug it in and\n\n372\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.650\nwait for all the lights to settle down.\n\n373\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.560\nYou plug devices in, those devices will\nbegin to communicate if they're actually\n\n374\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.480\nalready on the same layer of 3D network.\n\n375\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.700\nSo is actually ready to\ngo right out of the box.\n\n376\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.880\nRouters though you have to\nconfigure IP addresses on them,\n\n377\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.390\nhave to turn the ports on.\n\n378\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.370\nOn a switch devices are,\n\n379\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.600\nyou don't have to turn the ports\non they're already on by default.\n\n380\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.190\nAnd on the switch itself,\n\n381\n00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.930\nit starts learning these MAC addresses\nonce you start plugging in devices.\n\n382\n00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.650\nSo it knows exactly what to do.\n\n383\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.620\nAnd this also makes it\na security challenge, as well.\n\n384\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.560\nJust like a router can be configured but\n\n385\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.750\nalso misconfigured here,\na switch by its default nature is on.\n\n386\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.540\nYou plug a device in,\nit starts to learn MAC address.\n\n387\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.440\nI'm an attacker,\n\n388\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.120\nI plug in my laptop directly into that\nswitch, I'm gonna be plugged in and\n\n389\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.490\nready to go because it's ready to learn\nmy MAC address on one of those ports.\n\n390\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.990\nAnd if I know what the IP address is,\n\n391\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:47.280\nI can begin communication process across\nthat connection very easily and very well.\n\n392\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.075\nSo, it is a device that you do have to\nworry about when you start taking look.\n\n393\n00:21:51.075 --> 00:21:56.052\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you mentioned previously\nwhen we were looking at routers that\n\n394\n00:21:56.052 --> 00:22:00.792\nthey created separate broadcast domains,\nbecause they prohibit that\n\n395\n00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:06.086\nbroadcast communication unless otherwise\nnoted as an IP helper or DHCP relay.\n\n396\n00:22:06.086 --> 00:22:10.135\nBut when we're talking about switches,\nthere is a term you guys should be\n\n397\n00:22:10.135 --> 00:22:14.775\nfamiliar with and its separate collision\ndomains, because each individual port on\n\n398\n00:22:14.775 --> 00:22:19.282\na switch is it's own separate collision\ndomain, and just a real brief overview or\n\n399\n00:22:19.282 --> 00:22:23.350\nanalogy here, is if you think of\na switch kind of like a traffic cop.\n\n400\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.400\nLike Ronnie was saying,\n\n401\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.770\nyou have the option to send\nthose unicast transmissions.\n\n402\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.400\nAnd that traffic cop is saying,\nokay, you can go this way.\n\n403\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:37.900\nIt prevents or reduces the, well,\nprevents accidents from occurring.\n\n404\n00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.030\nWell these sets the goal\nof that traffic cop.\n\n405\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.210\nAnd that's kind of the same idea\nwhen we look at our switches.\n\n406\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.670\nIt prevents those collisions\nfrom occurring, and so\n\n407\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.290\nyou can think of it that way.\n\n408\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.610\nSwitches create separate\ncollision domains, whereas,\n\n409\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.270\nrouters create separate broadcast domains.\n\n410\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the idea of\ncourse of the collisions,\n\n411\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.170\nit used to be on hubs which is\nthe next device we're talking about.\n\n412\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.890\nSo it's actually good\nthat you brought that up.\n\n413\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.200\nLet me go ahead and bring that up so\nwe can see this very quickly here.\n\n414\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.680\nA hub is just a connectivity device.\n\n415\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.180\nIt doesn't make any decisions.\n\n416\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.840\nHubs operate on layer one.\n\n417\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.200\nSwitches operate on layer two.\n\n418\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.670\nRouters on layer three.\n\n419\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.060\nGood pieces of information just for\nexam readiness.\n\n420\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.760\nThings that you have to worry about.\n\n421\n00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.710\nBut a hub doesn't do anything.\n\n422\n00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.870\nIt is hardwired to do exactly\nwhat you're seeing here.\n\n423\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.500\nIf data is sent into port number one,\n\n424\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.730\nit automatically sends it out to every\nother port but the one it's connected on.\n\n425\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.060\nIt doesn't matter if\nthis is a five port hub,\n\n426\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.430\nlike what I'm showing here,\nor a 48 port hub.\n\n427\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.620\nIt will do so,\nthe other problem that we have is simple.\n\n428\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.164\nIs that there could be another device\nplugged into what number 5 here.\n\n429\n00:23:43.164 --> 00:23:45.056\nAnd when it sends it in there,\n\n430\n00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:49.754\nwell now you actually have two\npossibilities of two pieces of traffic, or\n\n431\n00:23:49.754 --> 00:23:55.091\ntwo frames coming in exactly at the same\ntime, and it's also gonna be flooded too.\n\n432\n00:23:55.091 --> 00:23:59.211\nWell if those two are exactly at\nthe same millisecond when they are sent.\n\n433\n00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.130\nYou will end up with what\nwe call collisions, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.550\nAnd that's what Cherokee\nis pointing out here.\n\n435\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.930\nSo let's take a look at this\nidea of a collision domain.\n\n436\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.740\nSo a single hub, right?\n\n437\n00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.645\nSo when we talk about a router,\n\n438\n00:24:12.645 --> 00:24:16.910\nan interface essentially is\na broadcast domain on a router, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.570\nInside of a single switch,\neverybody connected to a single switch or\n\n440\n00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.460\nconnected to a VLAN on multiple switches,\na single VLAN like VLAN 10,\n\n441\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.500\nthose are all considered\nbroadcast domains as well.\n\n442\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.100\nInside of the broadcast domain though,\n\n443\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.440\nif you are plugged into a hub you're also\nplugged into a single collision domain.\n\n444\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.660\nSo in this sense this is\nexactly what I was showing you.\n\n445\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.653\nIs from device number 5 and\ndevice number 2,\n\n446\n00:24:44.653 --> 00:24:48.951\nif they send exactly at the same time,\ntransmit simultaneously,\n\n447\n00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:54.113\nthe transmission will collide, and\nthat will set off a timer of sorts, right?\n\n448\n00:24:54.113 --> 00:25:00.487\nIt is a particular process that we\ncall a CDMA CD, collision detection.\n\n449\n00:25:00.487 --> 00:25:03.980\nA carrier sends multiple\naccess collision detection.\n\n450\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.920\nWhen it sets that off,\nit actually has these two guys kind of go,\n\n451\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.140\nwhoa, wait a minute.\n\n452\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:13.110\nLet's just stop here and let's see if we\ncan retransmit this without the collision\n\n453\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.200\nhappening by making them wait a certain or\na random amount of time before they send.\n\n454\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.260\nIn theory, those two data packets\nshould not collide again, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.480\nSo, it really does help\nto understand that.\n\n456\n00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.630\nThat hubs really did cause\na lot of collisions and\n\n457\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.270\nremember that on a hub, they all\nshare the same bandwidth, as well.\n\n458\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.040\nSo, all five of those ports here,\nare really sharing the 10 megabits,\n\n459\n00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.680\nif this is a 10 megabit hub.\n\n460\n00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.895\nHard to find 100 megabit hubs, but\nI guess you can if you wanted to.\n\n461\n00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:44.410\n100 megabit hubs may exist down there,\n\n462\n00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.200\nbut if you have 48 ports, you're dividing\nthat 100 megabits between all 48.\n\n463\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.000\nYou got five.\n\n464\n00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.660\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you just spend your\nmoney on a switch at that point?\n\n465\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n466\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.230\nthe idea well, it's cuz switches used\nto be insanely expensive by comparison.\n\n467\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.240\nHubs were relatively cheap by comparison.\n\n468\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.900\nBut this is what you're\npreventing by using a switch and\n\n469\n00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.990\nthat is because each port-\n&gt;&gt; I've seen hubs daisy chained together\n\n470\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.260\ninstead of usually buying\nswitches in certain situations.\n\n471\n00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you had to actually\nfollow a rule if you did,\n\n472\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.900\nit was called the five-four-three rule.\n\n473\n00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.730\nYou had to actually remember that too.\n\n474\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.120\nSo yeah, you had a maximum of five hubs,\nfour sections, and\n\n475\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.570\nthen three different types\nof links that you could do.\n\n476\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.770\nSo it really easy here, right?\n\n477\n00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.345\nSo collisions are what we\nprevented by going to switches,\n\n478\n00:26:25.345 --> 00:26:27.560\nbecause every port is now\nsome collision domain.\n\n479\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.480\nAnd on switches, we normally only tend to\nplug one device into each switch port,\n\n480\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.320\nwhich means if it has a collision with\nanybody, it's going to be with itself,\n\n481\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.050\nwhich it should never have.\n\n482\n00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.570\nSo that's really kind of the three basic\nones that we do tend to see here when\n\n483\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.490\nwe start talking about this idea\nof different devices, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.150\nSo that's a good kind of fundamental\nreview at least of kind of\n\n485\n00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.585\nthe first three things that we\nhave to worry about, right?\n\n486\n00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:54.150\nWe've talked about routers,\n\n487\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.384\nwe've talked about switches, and\neven a little bit about hubs.\n\n488\n00:26:56.384 --> 00:26:59.770\nWe still got a few more to go, but I think\nI'm not sure running out of time here.\n\n489\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.590\n&gt;&gt; You are correct there Ronnie, and yes,\n\n490\n00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.320\njust to recap like you said we were\nable to take a look at our routers.\n\n491\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.972\nRemember that's a layer three device.\n\n492\n00:27:06.972 --> 00:27:10.854\nWe've moved down to layer\ntwo to examine switches and\n\n493\n00:27:10.854 --> 00:27:15.905\nthen we also went down to the physical\nlayer to examine our hubs.\n\n494\n00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:16.535\nStay tuned,\n\n495\n00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:20.955\nwe do have information headed your way for\nadditional networking devices.\n\n496\n00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:23.655\nBut for this episode,\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n497\n00:27:23.655 --> 00:27:25.675\nAs your show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n498\n00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:26.535\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n499\n00:27:26.535 --> 00:27:29.697\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.317\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:20.500\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose,\nthis is actually a part two,\n\n6\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.490\nwhere we will be examining\nnetwork device operations.\n\n7\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.410\nIn the previous episode, Ronnie was able\nto explain the functions of switches,\n\n8\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.900\nrouters, and hubs.\n\n9\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.970\nSo let's go ahead and welcome him\nback in studio today, thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.480\njoining us today Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.480\nAnd what will we be starting with today?\n\n12\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.951\nWhat device will we be examining,\nif I can speak correctly?\n\n13\n00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.778\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, we're gonna be taking\na look at three different devices here.\n\n14\n00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:46.370\nI'm gonna talk about bridges just briefly,\nand then we'll spend little time\n\n15\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.680\ntalking about wireless access point and\nalso wireless LAN controllers.\n\n16\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.100\nJust to make sure that we understand\nwhat are the typical types of devices we\n\n17\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.040\ngenerally see.\n\n18\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.220\nNow bridges is the only\none that's really kind of\n\n19\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.810\nnot going to be seen on today's network.\n\n20\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.490\nI don't wanna say that you won't see them,\n\n21\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.380\nbut I'm pretty sure you're not gonna\nsee them, cuz just as soon as I say\n\n22\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.210\nthat somebody will write and\nbe like, no, we still use one.\n\n23\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.900\n&gt;&gt; I have one on my network.\n\n24\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I still have one on my network.\n\n25\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.010\n&gt;&gt; So I'm definitely not gonna tell\nyou that you're not gonna see one.\n\n26\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.445\nBut let's talk about what\na bridge is versus a switch,\n\n27\n00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:19.140\ncuz usually that's the question\nI get most of the time, right.\n\n28\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.080\nWhat do bridges do?\n\n29\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.710\nWell, bridges, they forward data,\nthey filter data, they flood data.\n\n30\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.950\nWhat do switches do?\n\n31\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.960\nForward, filter, and flood data.\n\n32\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.550\nThat sounds like they're\npretty much the same.\n\n33\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.910\nBridges they make decisions\nbased off the MAC address table.\n\n34\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.540\nWell switches make decisions based\noff the MAC address table as well, so\n\n35\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.460\nwhen it comes down to what the real\ndifferences are between them,\n\n36\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.870\nit really comes down to two things.\n\n37\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.710\nOne is port density,\nswitches tend to have more than,\n\n38\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.990\nwell what bridges will have in terms of\nthe sheer number of ports on the devices.\n\n39\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.270\nEven if you don't have a four port switch,\nfour port bridge though,\n\n40\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.598\nwould be pretty expensive.\n\n41\n00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.710\nUsually they had two, three ports at max,\na lot of times, right.\n\n42\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.605\nBut when you go to 48 port switches,\n\n43\n00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:08.630\nwell you don't tend to have 48 port\nbridges anymore, even though technically\n\n44\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.740\nyou could say that it is actually a bridge\nif you want to talk about that technology.\n\n45\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.400\nEven technology we use in switching\non bridges it actually comes from\n\n46\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.308\nbridge terminology.\n\n47\n00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:24.150\nFor example, if you talk about the idea of\nspanning-tree protocol, the actual terms\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.940\nthat we use in spanning-tree protocol\nto initiate all the different things,\n\n49\n00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.355\nis really from bridges\nmore than anything else.\n\n50\n00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:32.630\nCuz you hear about root-bridge,\n\n51\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.760\nyou hear about the other things that\nare out there, but that's pretty much it.\n\n52\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.370\nAnd so they all come from the bridge, and\nthat's because bridges proceeded switches\n\n53\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.410\nin terms of their arrival on\ntechnology into the world, right.\n\n54\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.230\nSo what is the real big difference?\n\n55\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.790\nAt the beginning when bridges\nstarted making their decisions\n\n56\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.560\non using MAC addresses,\nthat was a very slow process.\n\n57\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.520\nReason why it was slow is cuz asics\nweren't really invented for bridges yet.\n\n58\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.650\nCould they still forward data\nbased in the same process?\n\n59\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.390\nYes, bu the advent of asics\ninto the switching world,\n\n60\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.110\nis really what made the difference,\nand made, of course, switches then,\n\n61\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.090\nmuch faster and much more expensive, and\nbe able to have more port density on them.\n\n62\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.500\nIt really did help\nthe nature of networking.\n\n63\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.670\nSo bridges, even though they operate,\nthey operate relatively slow,\n\n64\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.690\nthey don't have as much port density,\nbut their functionality is\n\n65\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.320\nessentially identical to what you'll\nsee in terms of a switch today.\n\n66\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.980\nCan you still use them if you want to?\n\n67\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.230\nYes, are they gonna be insanely slow?\n\n68\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.500\nYes, and that is because they're\nexpecting you to take that bridge,\n\n69\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.060\nplug it into a hub, and that's really\nwhat they're expecting you to do.\n\n70\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.370\nIf you have 48 different devices,\nthey expect to see all your devices\n\n71\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.250\nplugged into a hub, and then plugged\ninto that switch for that one port.\n\n72\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.000\nAnd then they make a decision\non which of those two\n\n73\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.240\nports they're actually\nsending data out of.\n\n74\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.880\nSo, that's where you'll see that\nidea of what a bridge will be.\n\n75\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.290\nYou'll probably not see them on\nthe network, but, like I said, just\n\n76\n00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.070\nin time that I say that, somebody will\npost in our forums, we still use bridges.\n\n77\n00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.930\nWell, that proved me wrong right there,\n\n78\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.790\nso, I'm gonna say you'll probably not,\nbut you might see it.\n\n79\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.620\n&gt;&gt; So just understanding the\nfunctionality, what they do, what layer\n\n80\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.030\nthey operate on, which would be layer two,\nand just the general idea of that device.\n\n81\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.530\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it really comes\ndown to it's the same thing,\n\n82\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.640\nit's a layer two device.\n\n83\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.250\nIt does work, but very slow by comparison\nto the modern switches that we see today.\n\n84\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.170\nAnd if you have a choice between them,\nalways pick a switch, always.\n\n85\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, by far,\n\n86\n00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.740\nmake sure you pick up that\nidea of the switch, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.310\nSo that's all we're really\ngonna say about the idea of\n\n88\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.980\nbridges when it comes down to\nanything else that we're doing here.\n\n89\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.210\nThe other one that we\nwanna talk about is really\n\n90\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.760\nprobably one of the more popular devices.\n\n91\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.220\nSo we go from the most obscure device that\nyou can possibly find on today's networks,\n\n92\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.390\nHubs and bridges.\n\n93\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.990\nI'm going to say Hubs are pretty\nmuch right about there the same as\n\n94\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.200\nbridges today.\n\n95\n00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.870\nBut the device you're probably just about\nguaranteed to find in corporate networks\n\n96\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.670\ntoday, of course, is gonna be some\ntype of wireless connection, right.\n\n97\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.940\nWireless networks have become insanely\npopular today, and that is because of\n\n98\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.620\nthe advent of not only things like mobile\ndevices, portability devices like laptops.\n\n99\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.680\nBut because of mobile devices\nlike smartphones and tablets\n\n100\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.630\nthat you tend to see, and they don't\ntend to have a physical network adapter.\n\n101\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.250\nSo even on the machine\nI'm using right here,\n\n102\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.190\nit doesn't actually have\na physical network adapter.\n\n103\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.660\nI had to actually buy an actual adapter\nthat plugs into the port itself.\n\n104\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.515\nSo you will still see those two.\n\n105\n00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:37.254\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, and it's just so convenient,\nespecially in environments like hospitals,\n\n106\n00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:40.554\nwhere the doctors and\npersonnel are moving from room to room.\n\n107\n00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:43.533\nAnd we've got our medical\nequipment that needs to,\n\n108\n00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:47.462\ninstead of connecting over the wired\nconnection every single time,\n\n109\n00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:50.620\nit's just an easier way\nof doing things now.\n\n110\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.930\n&gt;&gt; It really is because it no longer\ntethers you to a single location, right.\n\n111\n00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.160\nIf you're connected to a physical switch,\nwell the longest and ultimate\n\n112\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.310\ndistance that you have is the length of\nthat cable, and that's pretty much it.\n\n113\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.500\nBut with wireless though,\n\n114\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.650\nyou can travel within the range\nof that wireless connection.\n\n115\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.760\nSo if it's inside of an office area,\n\n116\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.960\nyou don't have to be tethered\nto your desk anymore.\n\n117\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.830\nYou can move around and\n\n118\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.780\nyou can have that connection, and\nstill be connected and do that.\n\n119\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.160\nLet's take a look at my diagram\nto help us out just briefly here.\n\n120\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.900\nWhen it comes down to\nwireless access points,\n\n121\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.760\nthere's really two types of wireless\naccess point, I only drew one here.\n\n122\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.360\nOr made a diagram for one, which is this\nidea of a wired and wireless access point.\n\n123\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.776\nSo this is kinda the combo device that we\ntend to see that we buy out of brick and\n\n124\n00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:37.635\nmortar stores, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:40.395\nIf you've ever gone in and asked for\na wireless router and you didn't know\n\n126\n00:06:40.395 --> 00:06:44.695\nexactly what you were doing, that's\nactually a multi-layer device, okay.\n\n127\n00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:48.535\nThere's a router on it, so if you actually\nturn your wireless router, so even,\n\n128\n00:06:48.535 --> 00:06:51.625\ndon't do it right now during the middle\nof the show, cuz you'll get disconnected.\n\n129\n00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:53.465\nBut if you turned that\nwireless router around and\n\n130\n00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:55.455\nyou see one of those ports that's\nusually marked a different color,\n\n131\n00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:59.170\na lot of times it says WAN on it or\nInternet on it.\n\n132\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.250\nWell that's actually a router\nport directly on your device.\n\n133\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.290\nSo that's a layer three device,\nthe other four ports that you have where\n\n134\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.775\nyou can physically plug in\nthose ethernet cables to.\n\n135\n00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:13.170\nWell that's actually a switch, a little\nfour port switch or five port switch,\n\n136\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.640\nwhatever it might be.\n\n137\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.679\nSo that's actually a switch, but\n\n138\n00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:21.053\nthe other one though is actually\nthe antenna that you have on that device.\n\n139\n00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:27.910\nWhich is actually going to be a wireless\nhub, so a hub is a layer one device, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.378\nSo we have three different connections\nwhen you start talking about something\n\n141\n00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:32.300\nlike this.\n\n142\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.290\nIf you go out to the store and\nbuy something.\n\n143\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.600\nIt allows people to directly connect\nin wired if they need to, or\n\n144\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.230\nwirelessly by using this access point.\n\n145\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.990\nWhich is also, like I said,\ngenerally a wireless Hub.\n\n146\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.700\nAnd then we can also connect\nout to the internet, and\n\n147\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.700\nthat would actually be a WAN port,\nwhich means it does routing.\n\n148\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.350\nSo this device is a multi-function device,\n\n149\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.380\nis really what it is even though they\ncall it a wireless router, it does that.\n\n150\n00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.520\nNow we're really focusing in on the idea\nof the wireless access point itself.\n\n151\n00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.550\nRemember that when we talked about\nthe idea of hubs in a previous episode,\n\n152\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.870\nwe really had to kind of remind\nourselves that it shares the bandwidth.\n\n153\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.260\nAnd that's important, because when we\nhave two devices that try to communicate\n\n154\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.120\nwith it at the exact same time,\n\n155\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.320\nwe normally end up getting what we\ncall a collision domain, right.\n\n156\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.690\nWe end up having where the data will\nessentially just kind of collide and\n\n157\n00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.470\nthen would drop the packets.\n\n158\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.640\nWell, then that means on a wireless\nnetwork, right, we would still\n\n159\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.020\nhave the same thing that would happen on a\nhub, because that's what it functions as.\n\n160\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.680\nBut it doesn't, because instead of using\nthat CSMACD for collision detection,\n\n161\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.870\nuse something that we call CSMACA for\ncollision avoidance.\n\n162\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.200\nAnd this also plays something a little bit\ntricky on the way that people access this.\n\n163\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.391\nSo, inside of our wireless network right\nnow, if I remember just a couple of hours\n\n164\n00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:57.037\nago I was counting up and there were\nprobably about 30 people that were\n\n165\n00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.854\nusing our wireless access\npoint at that point in time.\n\n166\n00:08:59.854 --> 00:09:02.735\nNow, when you think about that,\nthat sounds like it's a simultaneous\n\n167\n00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:06.065\nconnection, all 30 people are connected\nwirelessly exactly at the same time.\n\n168\n00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:11.074\nBut in reality it's not, everybody is\nreally lining up, taking their own turn\n\n169\n00:09:11.074 --> 00:09:16.255\naccessing that antenna, if there's only\na single antenna on that access point.\n\n170\n00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.230\nIf there's multiple antennas, of course,\nmultiple people can access it.\n\n171\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.860\nBut if there's only one antenna,\nthey would individually,\n\n172\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.530\none at a time, be sending or\nreceiving data on that.\n\n173\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.600\nAnd it happens so fast because we\ndon't realize it in milliseconds, but\n\n174\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.360\nit is actually just one of us at a time.\n\n175\n00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.180\nSo with 30 people,\nthey're essentially lining up and saying,\n\n176\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.710\ncan I use the access point, can I use the\naccess point, can I use the access point.\n\n177\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.880\nBut for us it happens so quickly we\njust think it's simultaneous but\n\n178\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.110\nit's really not, so that's what you\nactually end up seeing there too.\n\n179\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.860\nOkay, so\nin that aspect of the access point itself,\n\n180\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.140\nyou'll end up having to worry\nabout things like that.\n\n181\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.390\nBecause that will kind\nof tell you whether or\n\n182\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.940\nnot you have too many people on the access\npoint at the same time as well.\n\n183\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.740\nAnd these things have to be\nconfigured to make sure that you\n\n184\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.440\nhave DHCP running over them.\n\n185\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.970\nThat they have the right default gateway,\n\n186\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.490\neverything is actually connected\nthe way that we want to.\n\n187\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.300\nThere's also what is called\na lightweight access point.\n\n188\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.628\nSo instead of you doing direct\nconfigurations right here,\n\n189\n00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:18.098\nit is just an access\npoint that acts as a hub.\n\n190\n00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:22.769\nAnd the configuration is received from\nsomewhere else, and that is when we move\n\n191\n00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:26.545\ninto the realm of what we call\na wireless LAN controller, okay.\n\n192\n00:10:26.545 --> 00:10:30.539\nIn a wireless LAN controller,\nit's exactly like it sounds.\n\n193\n00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:32.838\nWe can set up access points\nwherever we want to,\n\n194\n00:10:32.838 --> 00:10:35.850\nmake sure they're connected\nback to this device.\n\n195\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:41.220\nAnd now we can actually have a single\nconfiguration on that LAN controller, and\n\n196\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.020\nthen we can push out the configurations\nin the way that we want to,\n\n197\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.080\none to the cafeteria,\nto auditorium, to the library.\n\n198\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.800\nWe could create different VLANs if\nwe actually want them to have that.\n\n199\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.300\nAnd a user then could actually be on\nVLAN 20 over here in the cafeteria.\n\n200\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.061\nAnd then roam across to the auditorium,\ngo all the way across the library, and\n\n201\n00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.169\nstill connect and be on VLAN 20.\n\n202\n00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:10.015\nAnd that is because the wireless LAN\ncontroller can do that as well as manage\n\n203\n00:11:10.015 --> 00:11:13.446\nthose configurations, push them out,\nmanage authentication.\n\n204\n00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:16.878\nYou name it, there's a ton of\ndifferent things that you can do.\n\n205\n00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:21.829\nIn medium to large size businesses\nthe idea of controlling, let's say 20, 30,\n\n206\n00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:26.396\n100 different access points one at a time,\nme going in and configure them.\n\n207\n00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:30.986\nIt drive me nuts, but being able to go the\nwireless LAN control, and configure it one\n\n208\n00:11:30.986 --> 00:11:34.975\ntime, and push them out across all\nof them, is gonna be a key for me.\n\n209\n00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:37.775\n&gt;&gt; Well, not only does it make it\neasier for the administrators, but\n\n210\n00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:39.125\nfor the clients as well.\n\n211\n00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:40.725\nYour customers or your employees,\n\n212\n00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:45.492\nthey don't have to go ahead and, look up\nthe SSID for each one of those devices.\n\n213\n00:11:45.492 --> 00:11:48.472\nIt should be seemless as they're\nroaming from cell to cell there,\n\n214\n00:11:48.472 --> 00:11:50.422\nso, it's a win win for everyone.\n\n215\n00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:53.282\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it's something\nyou'll probably end up seeing in\n\n216\n00:11:53.282 --> 00:11:56.530\nthe majority of the time especially if\nyou're using light weight access points.\n\n217\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.062\nCISCO really is proud of their\naccess points and their,\n\n218\n00:11:59.062 --> 00:12:01.790\nespecially their lightweight access\npoint and their LAN controllers.\n\n219\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.640\nNot the easiest thing to work with but\n\n220\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.568\nit's better than having to manually\nconfigure everything that's out there.\n\n221\n00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:11.340\nSo, just kinda realize that you'll also\nsee this as a big component in terms of\n\n222\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.980\nmanagement and, of course, configuration.\n\n223\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.940\nBeing able to push them out\nacross multiple access points and\n\n224\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.080\nof course controlling them.\n\n225\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.160\nIf one of them goes down you can actually\nknow exactly which one goes down, replace\n\n226\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.290\nit, bring it back up, push the exact same\nconfiguration out to it that you need to,\n\n227\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.510\nand you're ready to go.\n\n228\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.190\nSo these devices can be virtual devices,\n\n229\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.670\nthey of course can be individual\nlittle appliances that you buy.\n\n230\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.600\nBut whatever it is, the use of these\nis gonna be more and more prevalent\n\n231\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.040\non networks today, especially if\nyou need multiple access points.\n\n232\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.900\nSingle access point, you probably\nwon't worry about it too much.\n\n233\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.410\nMultiple access points, like right\nhere I think we have five or six.\n\n234\n00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.860\nAnd we do have a little wireless\nLAN controller that we use to\n\n235\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.600\nhelp us to manage those, and\nwe can change the channel.\n\n236\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.355\nWe can push updates to them, you name it,\nit actually works very well.\n\n237\n00:12:56.355 --> 00:13:00.174\nSo it is a component that you're likely\nto see in the future if you haven't dealt\n\n238\n00:13:00.174 --> 00:13:00.805\nwith it yet.\n\n239\n00:13:00.805 --> 00:13:05.567\nSo all these different devices are gonna\nbe devices that you have to understand\n\n240\n00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:08.560\nat least, the basic functionalities.\n\n241\n00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.710\nBecause, if not, they will become\nthat security vulnerability, and\n\n242\n00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.760\nthat threat that you'll\nhave on you network.\n\n243\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.832\nBecause, you don't understand what devices\nare actually plugged into your network.\n\n244\n00:13:17.832 --> 00:13:20.769\nSo make sure you pay attention\non something like this.\n\n245\n00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:24.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like Ronnie said, there with\nthe popularity gaining with our wireless.\n\n246\n00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:28.803\nAnd like he was mentioning with\nthe antenna with 30 users,\n\n247\n00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:31.506\nat what point what are those users doing?\n\n248\n00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:34.217\nHow many users do you have,\nthings you need to consider, so\n\n249\n00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:37.592\nyou don't have bandwidth saturation or\naccess point saturation there.\n\n250\n00:13:37.592 --> 00:13:43.107\nSo having larger environments, you'll see\nthe need for these access points there.\n\n251\n00:13:43.107 --> 00:13:45.312\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's pretty much the idea, so\n\n252\n00:13:45.312 --> 00:13:49.664\nmake sure you review these technologies,\nif you're not certain about some of these,\n\n253\n00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:52.545\ngo back, make sure you do\na little bit of reading on them.\n\n254\n00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:54.270\nBut it is key, once again,\n\n255\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.145\njust like I said at the beginning of\ntaking a look at some of the technologies.\n\n256\n00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:02.026\nIf you don't know about the devices\nthat are on your network to help\n\n257\n00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:04.804\nyou build your infrastructure,\nthat's gonna be a weakness for\n\n258\n00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:07.601\nyou when you start talking about\nsecuring your network as well.\n\n259\n00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:10.669\nAnd being able to analyze for\ndifferent traffic on network and\n\n260\n00:14:10.669 --> 00:14:13.970\nbeing able to take that analysis and\nmake it meaningful.\n\n261\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.340\nSo any place that your not sure of,\n\n262\n00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.790\nespecially in devices, make sure you go\nback and review that for your network.\n\n263\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.590\nAnd have a good grasp and\nunderstanding on their functionality and\n\n264\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.046\nwhy they work the way that they do.\n\n265\n00:14:23.046 --> 00:14:23.990\n&gt;&gt; I agree, Ronnie,\n\n266\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.826\nit's not necessarily an easy job being\nable to juggle all these components.\n\n267\n00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.906\nBut there are jobs available out there and\nthere is a severe deficit for\n\n268\n00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:33.233\nsecurity positions.\n\n269\n00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:37.856\nSo you're in the right place and we have\nenough resources for you to go ahead and\n\n270\n00:14:37.856 --> 00:14:39.590\nlearn this information.\n\n271\n00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.653\nSo learn it, nurture your baby,\nyour network that is, so\n\n272\n00:14:42.653 --> 00:14:44.800\nthat you can defend it and protect it.\n\n273\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.670\nBut, I think that covers all the devices\nthat we're gonna look at today, Ronnie.\n\n274\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.610\nSo, let's go ahead and wrap up this\nshow and I'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n275\n00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.760\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n276\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n277\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.819\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n278\n00:14:58.819 --> 00:15:04.805\n[MUSIC]\n\n279\n00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:08.120\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:16.171\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.200\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.580\nIn this episode, we will be describing\ndifferent network security systems and,\n\n7\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.890\nwell, how they can be implemented.\n\n8\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.150\nTo further explain this topic, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.950\nRonnie Wong in studios today,\nthank you for joining us, Ronnie!\n\n10\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.780\nAs we take a look at some of the different\ntypes of network security systems,\n\n12\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.700\nThat are out there for us.\n\n13\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.510\nAnd this particular episode, it's really\nnot deep diving into any one technology.\n\n14\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.130\nIt's just trying to make sure that we\nunderstand that there are, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.260\ngonna be some of the technology\nthat Cisco has put out there.\n\n16\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.150\nThat you may choose to partake in,\n\n17\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.860\nyou may not choose to partake in and\nit really comes down to a module on hey,\n\n18\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.610\nhere's our display of where that\nyou may want to take advantage of.\n\n19\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.840\nSo, it is a bit of a sales\npitchy kind of thing.\n\n20\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.710\nBut there are products I expect\nyou to know for the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.580\nSo I don't wanna put that past and\nit is important As your organization\n\n22\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.910\nmakes decisions on what to choose,\nit's really gonna be important.\n\n23\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.367\nAnd of course Cisco says\nchoose our products.\n\n24\n00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it comes down to.\n\n25\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.550\nSo at one time Cherokee, you and\n\n26\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.750\nI, we've been in the idea of a realm of\nnetworking and security for a while now.\n\n27\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.720\nNow as we start to take a look at this,\n\n28\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.660\nat one time security devices\nwere really just that.\n\n29\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.670\nThey were individual devices that\nwe had a purchase from a company.\n\n30\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.580\nWe ended up getting it then\nwe read the directions on\n\n31\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.500\nhow to get it implemented and installed.\n\n32\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.250\nAnd now it's pretty much it, right?\n\n33\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n34\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920\nwhen we start thinking about it,\nthat's kinda the key.\n\n35\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.060\n&gt;&gt; And it could go way back,\n\n36\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.610\nthey weren't even inter-operable\nwith different systems.\n\n37\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.790\nIt might've been this on this one type of\nnetwork, or with this type of equipment.\n\n38\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.610\nAnd so, it's really evolved.\n\n39\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.680\n&gt;&gt; It really has, and so, and\nthey were so, even at that point, siloed.\n\n40\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.760\nI don't wanna say siloed,\nit's probably not proper.\n\n41\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.290\nThey're so\nsegmented in certain ways, right?\n\n42\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.050\nSo you had essentially devices\nthat you would buy that were for\n\n43\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.210\nperimeter defense, right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.150\nRight on the edge of your network.\n\n45\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.420\nYou had devices or software, then, that\nmight've been on each individual host.\n\n46\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.260\nAnd they were kind of\njust set up that way,\n\n47\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.420\nwhere are you protecting your network?\n\n48\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.950\nAre you protecting the individual host?\n\n49\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.720\nWhat it is that you want to do.\n\n50\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.470\nYou've gotta realize that those days,\nI hate to say it, are kind of gone.\n\n51\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.190\nAnd so then the latest and\ngreatest craze and implementation,\n\n52\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.750\nof course, is to move beyond that idea,\n\n53\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.525\ncuz Cisco likes the term borderless\nnetworks, is what they like.\n\n54\n00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.085\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say UTM,\n\n55\n00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.985\ncuz that's another real,\nUnified Threat Management.\n\n56\n00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:54.225\n&gt;&gt; UTM, that's right Unified Threat, and\n\n57\n00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:58.395\nthat actually does go into the realm of\nthe borderless management idea in which\n\n58\n00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:03.660\nnow the devices can be located\nanywhere on the planet.\n\n59\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.160\nAnd they can still help you to\nessentially secure your network together.\n\n60\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.340\nAnd this is where we talk about\ncloud based solutions instead.\n\n61\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.520\nSo the terms that you'll end up seeing\nin the majority of time when you\n\n62\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.280\nhear about people talking about, right.\n\n63\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.770\nIs the individual host based solutions\nwhich mean you're hosting it,\n\n64\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.130\nyou're managing it,\nyou're doing everything.\n\n65\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.310\nNetwork based again, devices that\nyou might add into your network, and\n\n66\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.680\ninstead of just talking one machine,\n\n67\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.920\nthere's actually devices you add in,\nand then of course cloud solutions too.\n\n68\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.250\nNow when it comes down\nto cloud solutions and\n\n69\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.530\nsecurity solutions, that's where you\nhear that idea of cloud services, right?\n\n70\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.980\nThat's kind of the key that the smooth fad\nterm today in the realm of what we call\n\n71\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.560\nSaaS, I'm tring to make sure,\nSoftware as a Service.\n\n72\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.560\nAnd that is kinda the key that\nwe're looking at for most of\n\n73\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.310\nthe solutions that we're talking about in\nterms of a cloud solution for security.\n\n74\n00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.670\nSo that's what we need to actually\nunderstand is that there's many different\n\n75\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.630\ntypes of network security that we\ncan implement and we have to start\n\n76\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.200\nat the very beginning of several of these\ndevices, understand their implementation\n\n77\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.110\nof whether they're on Cloud,\non the host itself, or at the perimeter.\n\n78\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.440\nSo let's talk about the first one that we\ndo tend to see in the objectives here,\n\n79\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.170\nwhich is on a host to host basis.\n\n80\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.470\nNow when we start to implement that\non the idea of a host to host basis,\n\n81\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.660\nthis is where it gets\na little bit confusing again.\n\n82\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.420\nBecause what do we mean by that?\n\n83\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.070\nDo we mean individual PCs such as users\non our network and that's what we mean?\n\n84\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.110\nWell yeah, but\ndo we also call in individual host or\n\n85\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.280\nindividual computer or server?\n\n86\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.310\nYeah, even if they're also, let's say,\n\n87\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.320\nrunning a monitoring device that's\nmonitoring our entire network, well yes.\n\n88\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.050\nOkay?\nSo, you actually do call those too, but\n\n89\n00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520\nthen that device is running as\na server on my network may also be\n\n90\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.800\na network device at the same time.\n\n91\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.630\nRunning, again, something like an IPS or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n92\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.697\nFor my entire network as well, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:04.697 --> 00:05:08.150\nSo that's what we want\nto think about to okay?\n\n94\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.610\nSo the first one of course is\nour first real security device\n\n95\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.570\nconcept that we would have started\noff with, is the idea of a firewall.\n\n96\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.770\nA firewall can be implemented\nat the host level.\n\n97\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.080\nIt can be implemented at\nthe network perimeter level or\n\n98\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.130\nat the network device level, and\neven in the cloud today as well.\n\n99\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.340\nAnd now your company\nhas a decision to make.\n\n100\n00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.590\nWhere do I chose to implement this and\n\n101\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.000\nwhy should I choose to\nimplement it where I am?\n\n102\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.960\nSo let's talk about kind\nof the basics here.\n\n103\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.870\nCherokee, as far as a host based firewall,\nsince we work inside of a network,\n\n104\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.796\nin a Windows network, what's the host\nbased firewall called that you work on?\n\n105\n00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:53.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They don't get too creative\nwith this one, it's just Windows Firewall.\n\n106\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n107\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.480\nIt just comes down to the idea\nof the Windows Firewall.\n\n108\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.470\nSo if you're running on\nany Windows computer.\n\n109\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.905\nIn the background you've probably seen\nthe idea of the Windows firewall.\n\n110\n00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:08.159\nLet me see if I can get to my system here.\n\n111\n00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.330\nSo here I'm running a virtual machine on\nmy computer and if we take a look at it,\n\n112\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.619\nwe'll actually see an example\nof this host based firewall and\n\n113\n00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.820\nthe very basics of it, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.810\nIt's not super fancy, it gives me what\nI actually need, which is, again,\n\n115\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.780\ndefending itself from unauthorized\nintrusions in terms of, if you don't\n\n116\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.840\nhave a connection already, in other words,\nif I didn't make the connection to you,\n\n117\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.490\nyou're not just going to connect in and\njust make any connection that you want to.\n\n118\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.030\nSo it is a stateful\nfirewall is what it does.\n\n119\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.270\nBut this one blocks it on every single\nnetwork that it comes across and\n\n120\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.690\nallows us to be able to block it.\n\n121\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.650\nWe can turn it off if we choose to.\n\n122\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.630\nNow this is not the only\nimplementation of this one right here.\n\n123\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.600\nBut at the very beginning when we start\ntalking about the idea of host-based\n\n124\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.940\nfirewall, this is kinda\nthe one that I think about.\n\n125\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.090\nIn the Linux realm,\n\n126\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.760\nthis is when we start moving into\nthe realm of IP tables as well.\n\n127\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.430\nOkay?\n\n128\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.010\nSo IP tables, Windows Firewall,\nwe tend to see something like this.\n\n129\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Sure, when we're talking about what\npeople may encounter in their business, or\n\n130\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.710\nthrough their careers.\n\n131\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.057\nWe look at the market share, and\nthat's normally what we see.\n\n132\n00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, and then of course,\nat that point,\n\n133\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.440\nyou start moving into the realm of,\nwell network devices too, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.570\nNow in the idea of network devices,\nwhen we start to talk about,\n\n135\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.660\nthis is where you start hearing about\nthe Cisco ASA which is probably the most\n\n136\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.210\nprominent device that we tend\nto see in the realm of Cisco.\n\n137\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.390\nNow this product has\ndeveloped over the years.\n\n138\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.420\nWe used to know it as the Cisco Pix,\nbefore that it was just called\n\n139\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.100\na Pix firewall then Cisco bought Pix and\nthen it was a Cisco Pix firewall.\n\n140\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.130\nAnd then it became the Cisco ASA,\nis what it became.\n\n141\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.960\nAnd now today, it's the source fire or\nfirepower, the Cisco ASA with\n\n142\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.140\nFirepower is the newest and latest line\nof this particular firewall device.\n\n143\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.441\nIt's meant to provide you, well,\nborder type of security, right?\n\n144\n00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:05.286\nIt allows for internal and external\nnetworks that you are going to connect to.\n\n145\n00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:07.366\nSo these are the devices\nthat would purchase.\n\n146\n00:08:07.366 --> 00:08:10.114\nAnd the only limitation that\nyou have here of course is,\n\n147\n00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.830\nhow much are you willing to pay?\n\n148\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.160\nThat's pretty much\nthe limitation that you have.\n\n149\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.458\nHow much traffic needs to\ngo across these devices do?\n\n150\n00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:20.890\nSo that if of course,\nis something that Cisco is very proud of.\n\n151\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.270\nThey love these particular\ntypes of devices.\n\n152\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.160\nAnd for small to medium businesses,\n\n153\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.360\nthis is the way that they would\nrecommend this working out.\n\n154\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.520\nYou purchase these devices and\nyou're there.\n\n155\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.060\nBut Cisco of course doesn't\nleave it there, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.070\nToday of course you can have the\ncloud-based solutions that are out there.\n\n157\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd this is now a sub-term\nthat Cisco has coined.\n\n158\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.000\nInstead of just calling\nit software as a service,\n\n159\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.460\nwhich technically it is, they call\nit security as a service instead.\n\n160\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.780\nAnd this means you don't actually\nknow where the heck the Cisco ASA\n\n161\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.350\nappliance that you're connecting\nto really is in the world.\n\n162\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.800\nIt's actually mirrored at multiple\ndifferent sites all across\n\n163\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.410\ntheir particular cloud\nplatform that they have.\n\n164\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:08.260\nAnd it is a protection that can\nactually be anywhere as well, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.320\nNow this gives us the ability\nthen to have it monitored and\n\n166\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.360\nuptime, and everything because we're not\nhaving to worry about power outages.\n\n167\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.480\nWe simply log in to either a web interface\nor a software type of connection\n\n168\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.880\ninterface, that's secured, and\nwe now manage the firewall that way.\n\n169\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.840\nAnd it runs and\neverything goes through that network.\n\n170\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.990\nThis type of solution is probably more\nmeant in the realm if you actually have\n\n171\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.370\nmultiple tenants that you are working for.\n\n172\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.580\nSo let's say that we're in\na building with multiple tenants.\n\n173\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.010\nWell we can simply do one of two things.\n\n174\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.440\nI can firewall off my own network and\ntell them, look here's an IP address.\n\n175\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.870\nYou do with it as you choose to.\n\n176\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.090\nI'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n177\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.760\nBut if I have to worry about the physical\ncabling that somehow being managed by me,\n\n178\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.680\ninstead I can actually do\nthis type of cloud based\n\n179\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.650\ntype of firewall solution instead,\nfrom Cisco, and\n\n180\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.810\nthey can essentially allow me to print\nmultiple different firewalls virtual based\n\n181\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.670\ntypes of firewalls that will allow also\nthe management and each of those tenants.\n\n182\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.822\nAnd we can even give them\ncontrol already if we wanted to.\n\n183\n00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.841\nWe can say hey you can manage here.\n\n184\n00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.656\nHere's your firewall.\n\n185\n00:10:16.656 --> 00:10:18.498\nHere's your firewall.\n\n186\n00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:19.060\nHere's your firewall.\n\n187\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.310\nSo you can do something\nlike that if you need to.\n\n188\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.120\nSo in a medium to large business or\nwhether you want for every department.\n\n189\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.390\nYou need something else.\n\n190\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.940\nYou wanna think about that type of\n\n191\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.990\nimplementation there where they talk\nabout that idea of on the cloud.\n\n192\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.520\nYou'll see this helping out.\n\n193\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.026\nNow, inside of the firewall solution\nitself, they can offer the protection of,\n\n194\n00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:45.465\nwell a lot of different things including\nswitching, denial of service stacks,\n\n195\n00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:48.960\nsecurity operations centers if\nyou have something like that.\n\n196\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.160\nUsing the SEIM, even implementing IPS and\n\n197\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.640\nIDS types of solutions as well to make\nsure that the actual monitoring extends\n\n198\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.790\nnot only of course inside or\njust for your network itself.\n\n199\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.750\n&gt;&gt; At that firewall edge, but\n\n200\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.600\nyou wanna look at also what's\nhappening inside of your network.\n\n201\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.290\nBecause what if someone Traverses\nyour firewall, a bad guy and\n\n202\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.570\ngets past that first line of defense.\n\n203\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.290\nYou're still monitoring and\nable to go ahead and look at that.\n\n204\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where you can\nwork in conjunction with Cisco.\n\n205\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.860\nIn other words, they really do have a team\nof people that really can work with you\n\n206\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.490\nto help to make sure that everything\nis monitored a bit more securely.\n\n207\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.435\nOnce again,\nanother service that they can offer.\n\n208\n00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:28.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That you'd have to pay for, but\n\n209\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.449\nthey love this thing.\n\n210\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.010\nOkay, the other one that we also\nwanna make sure that we understand of\n\n211\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.190\ncourse is gonna be the Cisco IPS\ntypes of solutions as well.\n\n212\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.640\nNow one of the unusual things is Cisco\ndoesn't offer the host based in order for\n\n213\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.140\nevery individual computer type\nof IPS system, but Windows does.\n\n214\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.070\nAnd let's take a look at that Windows\nmachine, again if I can find it here.\n\n215\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.370\nSo on the Windows machine,\n\n216\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.810\neven though this is the basic firewall\nthat really blocks all traffic coming in.\n\n217\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.760\nThe other one that's actually\nthere is what's called Windows\n\n218\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.990\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n219\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.070\nOnce you actually use that Windows\nfirewall with advanced security,\n\n220\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.850\nthis now becomes a host based IPS, okay.\n\n221\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.860\nAn actual intrusion prevention\nsystem is what this one becomes.\n\n222\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:22.000\nNow it's still based around the rules\nof the way that the firewall works.\n\n223\n00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.950\nBut this really is.\n\n224\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:28.440\nIt is a fairly solid working type\nof IPS system that's host space.\n\n225\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.420\nNow Cisco may have a particular software\nthat you can implement in this way,\n\n226\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.230\nbut not that I know of.\n\n227\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.240\nSo I may be called out\non that in the future,\n\n228\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.480\nbut at this point,\nhere's just an example of what we may see.\n\n229\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.090\nMore common though in our networks\ntoday if we were to do this,\n\n230\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.690\nis something that we had talked about in\nan earlier episode in what IPS do for\n\n231\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.710\nus, which is that inline\ntraffic interrogation, right.\n\n232\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.810\nThe ability to stop the traffic as it\nhappens as we continue to move forward\n\n233\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.120\nhere and take a look.\n\n234\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.060\nSo if we were to compare\nthe idea of what this stuff does,\n\n235\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.490\nhere's what we wanna make sure\nthat we pay attention to, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.460\nUp here at the top,\nremember that in terms of\n\n237\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:18.000\ninline IPS as we purchase this as\na device, maybe from Cisco, we\n\n238\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.950\nmight put it right here behind the router\nand now we have an inline protection.\n\n239\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.710\nIf an attack occurs, goes through\nthe router, the IPS senses that attack and\n\n240\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:33.050\nstops it from ever getting anywhere\ninside to my network at all.\n\n241\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.474\nAnd this works based off of signatures,\ndefinitions, anomalies,\n\n242\n00:13:36.474 --> 00:13:38.314\nyou name it if you choose to.\n\n243\n00:13:38.314 --> 00:13:40.820\nIt can do something like that, okay.\n\n244\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.890\nNow you can actually easily make an IPS\nturn into what we call an IDS, and\n\n245\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.670\nIntrusion Detection System.\n\n246\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.920\nWhich is really the one that is\ndown here toward the bottom.\n\n247\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.020\nThis one does not stop the attack at all.\n\n248\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.480\nBut what it does is it makes\na copy of that attack and\n\n249\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.950\nsends it to the IDS to log\nthat the attack has happened.\n\n250\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.485\nAnd then it can send out an alert to\nwhoever's supposed to be monitoring that.\n\n251\n00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:07.205\n&gt;&gt; Network admin?\n\n252\n00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:08.800\nMust be Will Robinson.\n\n253\n00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, yeah.\n\n254\n00:14:10.365 --> 00:14:11.805\nThat's a little dated reference there.\n\n255\n00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:13.525\nDo you know what show that's from?\n\n256\n00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:15.075\n&gt;&gt; Danger, danger, Will Robinson.\n\n257\n00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:16.045\nIt's like a robot.\n\n258\n00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:17.615\nI don't remember exactly.\n\n259\n00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:19.155\nBut I have the memory somewhere.\n\n260\n00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:19.695\n&gt;&gt; Of the show?\n\n261\n00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:20.375\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n262\n00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:21.355\nLost in Space.\n\n263\n00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.255\n&gt;&gt; Lost in Space, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.085\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:24.085 --> 00:14:27.615\nSo yeah, if you have something like this,\nit gives you that ability to do so.\n\n266\n00:14:27.615 --> 00:14:33.580\nBut most of the time for us, IPS's usually\nare worth the effort for us to do this.\n\n267\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo remember at the network level, this\nis probably what we will end up seeing.\n\n268\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.970\nWhen we start to take a look.\n\n269\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:46.990\nNow, the device here, when we do this,\ncan also be directly on the router itself.\n\n270\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.720\nThere is what is called the Cisco IOS,\nIPS.\n\n271\n00:14:58.528 --> 00:15:03.720\nWhich is a device that they really would\nlove for people to take advantage of.\n\n272\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.300\nAnd as much as this been out there for\na long time, most people didn't,\n\n273\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.320\nis because it required you to have another\nsubscription to update everything there.\n\n274\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.800\nSo you have to have a security.\n\n275\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.810\nYou have to have a certificate.\n\n276\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.580\nYou have to download definitions.\n\n277\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.840\nYou have to unretire definitions.\n\n278\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.160\nRetire certain definitions to go on.\n\n279\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.150\nYou name it, that's another possibility.\n\n280\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:31.240\nAnd then today, Sysco's offering that\nthey would love is that Cisco NGIPS.\n\n281\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.280\n&gt;&gt; Next Generation Intrusion\nPrevention System.\n\n282\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.610\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty much their.\n\n283\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.660\n&gt;&gt; It's a mouthful.\n\n284\n00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.565\n&gt;&gt; Newest and latest model of things that\nthey really want you to have access to\n\n285\n00:15:43.565 --> 00:15:48.850\nif when you start to choose to do\nsome type of device like this.\n\n286\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.340\nDo you need intrusion prevention?\n\n287\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.250\nMake sure you take a look at\nthose two products specifically,\n\n288\n00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.280\nfrom the realm of Cisco.\n\n289\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.990\nThat's what you want to do you want to\nstop the attacks before they happen.\n\n290\n00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.633\nThe IPS is ready to go.\n\n291\n00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:04.948\nThis next generation IPS is good and\n\n292\n00:16:04.948 --> 00:16:10.928\nit really falls in line with what\nCisco really wants you to have.\n\n293\n00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:15.713\nAnd the reason why is that, they've\nintegrated so much technology into this\n\n294\n00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:21.240\nthing, right, that they really talk about\nthe ability for it to prevent attacks.\n\n295\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.380\nThey talk about the ability for\nit to stop real time attacks.\n\n296\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.710\nAnd then they talk about that ability for\nyou to do something even\n\n297\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.870\nafter the attacks as you go back and not\nonly remediation but as you review, as you\n\n298\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.770\nactually understand after the threat has\nhappened that not enough has going on.\n\n299\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.680\nAnd all this is fed into their\nglobal threat intelligence\n\n300\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.970\nnetwork that they call Talos,\nT-A-L-O-S, which is an insane,\n\n301\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:54.030\ngigantic organization of security\nprofessionals that update this device.\n\n302\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.760\nI think it's every three minutes.\n\n303\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.900\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; If I remember it correctly.\n\n304\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.199\nSomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds expensive.\n\n305\n00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:03.867\n&gt;&gt; It does, it is a bit pricey,\nthere's no doubt about that.\n\n306\n00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:05.226\n&gt;&gt; First pay all those people [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:07.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, never buys it and\nbuy subscription.\n\n308\n00:17:07.583 --> 00:17:11.536\nIf your organization is really\nneeding this, there's no doubt,\n\n309\n00:17:11.536 --> 00:17:13.237\nthis is kind of the way to go.\n\n310\n00:17:13.237 --> 00:17:16.676\nAnd again,\nif you wanna learn more about even this,\n\n311\n00:17:16.676 --> 00:17:21.230\nright, we do have actually\na Cisco Security show on that.\n\n312\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.200\nActually, the SME on it.\n\n313\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.017\nThe subject-matter expert on it\nwas Mr Todd Langley himself.\n\n314\n00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:30.911\nSo make sure you check that one out and\nhe'll show you how to configure\n\n315\n00:17:30.911 --> 00:17:34.490\nthe Cisco NGIPS right there and\nget that up and running as well.\n\n316\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.320\nSo, there's a ton of content right there\nthat you can learn right more about but\n\n317\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.280\nthat of course is the way that\nthey would like you to go.\n\n318\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.110\nNow, even beyond that, right,\nthe idea of the host or\n\n319\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:50.780\nthe cloud based solution here is what\nthey call the FirePOWER IPS, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.220\nSo this one is the device itself.\n\n321\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.454\nBut in the cloud,\nthey want this to be your Cisco,\n\n322\n00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:59.919\nyour FirePOWER IPS allows\nyou now edge-to-edge but\n\n323\n00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:04.394\neven your network to actually do all\nthe monitoring that it needs to.\n\n324\n00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:08.028\nSo not only, yes, you are getting the\nThales system on something like this right\n\n325\n00:18:08.028 --> 00:18:11.600\nat the edge of your network,\nyou're also getting it in the cloud.\n\n326\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.175\nYou name it, there's a ton of\ndifferent devices out there, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:19.948\nSo, that is kind of the key\nsystem that we have in place to\n\n328\n00:18:19.948 --> 00:18:23.107\nhelp us with intrusion prevention.\n\n329\n00:18:24.476 --> 00:18:29.200\nCisco's other product offerings\nright go even further.\n\n330\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.720\nMost of us when we start to tell\npeople as professionals like, hey,\n\n331\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.980\nI'm buying a computer for the first\ntime I need to put my computer online.\n\n332\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.410\nI'm gonna have it at home,\nwhat do I need to protect myself?\n\n333\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.230\nWell, most of us would think, of course,\nmaking sure your updates are going on and\n\n334\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.480\nthat you have an antivirus\ntype of solution.\n\n335\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.715\nCisco has one of the best antivirus\nsolutions out there that also implements\n\n336\n00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:56.560\nwith that idea of before the attack,\nprevention,\n\n337\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.133\nmitigating the attacks,\nreal time responses, and of course,\n\n338\n00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:04.037\nafter the attack if something like\nthat happens to be able to go back and\n\n339\n00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:08.109\nfigure out what's going on and log and\ndo everything else that needs to.\n\n340\n00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:11.650\nAnd this is what Cisco\ncalls the Cisco AMP.\n\n341\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.950\nA-M-P or\nAdvanced Malware Protection protection.\n\n342\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.472\nMalware exactly like it sounds.\n\n343\n00:19:16.472 --> 00:19:19.130\nIt does everything that it needs to.\n\n344\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.780\nAnd then of course,\nas this AMP solution, they do offer for\n\n345\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.022\nendpoint protection, they call it AMP,\nA-M-P for endpoints.\n\n346\n00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:33.919\nAnd work just like your antivirus does but\non a much more involved scale in terms\n\n347\n00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:37.421\nof updating, in terms of all\nthe stuff that needs to do.\n\n348\n00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:42.024\nThe AMP solution is one that you\nwould purchase at a network level and\n\n349\n00:19:42.024 --> 00:19:45.659\nthen have it applied and\nmanaged and monitored then,\n\n350\n00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:50.350\nbuy your entire network here or\nadd a network location, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.640\nSo you can actually apply\nthis just like you have for,\n\n352\n00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.810\nI'm trying to, for Windows just a thing.\n\n353\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I just found the link\nto a video that explains AMP.\n\n354\n00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:04.095\nCisco made it, and they kinda made it like\na little cartoon so it's very interesting.\n\n355\n00:20:04.095 --> 00:20:07.095\nIt's titled,\nUnderstand Cisco AMP in four minutes.\n\n356\n00:20:07.095 --> 00:20:09.725\nI put the link in the chat, and\nthen I'll also give it to you,\n\n357\n00:20:09.725 --> 00:20:10.865\nRon to put in the show notes.\n\n358\n00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:13.785\nBut, I found it interesting,\nbut that's just me.\n\n359\n00:20:13.785 --> 00:20:16.925\nIf you guys wanted to\nlook a bit more into it.\n\n360\n00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:19.305\n&gt;&gt; There are so many different\nproducts that are out there.\n\n361\n00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:23.370\nAMP, of course, costs a ton of money and\nevery other product like this at\n\n362\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.250\nthe network level is gonna cost\nyou a bit of money as well.\n\n363\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.190\nBut let me show you on my Windows\nas an example of the type of\n\n364\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.690\nsystem that we're talking about here.\n\n365\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.540\nNow, this one of course is not Cisco AMP,\nI wish I could tell you that I had this.\n\n366\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:42.100\nBut it really is kinda the same\nanalogous type of system, right?\n\n367\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.460\nWhere Cisco says we provide this\ntype of monitoring and protection.\n\n368\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.370\nWell, this one here that says,\nSystem Center Endpoint Protection.\n\n369\n00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.600\nSo you're already running like system\ncenter configuration management and\n\n370\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.790\nyou're doing all that stuff through\nthe Cisco's network of stuff, well,\n\n371\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.880\nthey also provide this,\nwhich is part of that entire package.\n\n372\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.730\nThen I guess update it one place and\nthen pushes out and\n\n373\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.940\nyou can even have something like\nthis on your systems as well.\n\n374\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.637\nSo, more than likely,\nyou'd see something very similar.\n\n375\n00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:13.580\nProbably more fancy with\nthe Cisco AMP solution.\n\n376\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.350\nA little bit more bells and whistles,\nin terms of what they want to do for\n\n377\n00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.050\nyour malware protection too.\n\n378\n00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.414\nSo just realize, I have that one.\n\n379\n00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:26.577\nAnd of course if you want to run this for\nyour entire network, they have the,\n\n380\n00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:30.157\nmake sure I'm telling you right,\nAMP for Networks which again,\n\n381\n00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:33.580\nis just a device itself that\nyou would have to, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.133\nSo, in terms of devices for\nyour network, you can do that and\n\n383\n00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:42.081\nthen, on the cloud they call it, FireAmp,\nI'm not lying I'm trying to make sure,\n\n384\n00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:43.562\nFireAmp Private Cloud.\n\n385\n00:21:43.562 --> 00:21:47.490\nAnd you can even have a virtual\nappliance if you wanted to do that too.\n\n386\n00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.866\nSo, there's a ton of these types of\nsolutions that are out there but\n\n387\n00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:52.474\nthis one is more about malware.\n\n388\n00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:56.527\nThe last two are kind of ones\nwhich are really designed for\n\n389\n00:21:56.527 --> 00:22:00.080\ngigantic firms more than anything else.\n\n390\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.650\nThe idea of the Web Security Appliance or\n\n391\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.480\nthe Cisco Cloud Web Security\nthese are normally virtual\n\n392\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.040\nappliances that we would run to be able\nto do, well, web appliances, right?\n\n393\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.760\nWe wanna make sure that\nour websites are secure.\n\n394\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.000\nMake sure that everything that's\nconnecting in is that way.\n\n395\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.470\nWe can host this as a virtual appliance\ninside of our own infrastructure for ESX.\n\n396\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.154\nWe can also, of course,\n\n397\n00:22:25.154 --> 00:22:30.214\nbuy an actual server itself called\nthe WSA the Web Security Appliance but,\n\n398\n00:22:30.214 --> 00:22:35.848\nif you wanted hosted by Cisco itself, they\nalso have the Cisco Cloud Web Security.\n\n399\n00:22:35.848 --> 00:22:38.829\nAnd their whole goal again,\nis to remove that\n\n400\n00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:43.380\nidea that the logic behind something\nlike the way that web servers and\n\n401\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.325\nnetworking, that has to be protected\nnot only the idea against malware but\n\n402\n00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:51.878\nalso from bad request,\nokay and so very good system.\n\n403\n00:22:51.878 --> 00:22:55.596\nThe other one is one that Cisco\nis probably going to be known for\n\n404\n00:22:55.596 --> 00:22:59.028\nall throughout the entire\nplanet cuz several years ago,\n\n405\n00:22:59.028 --> 00:23:03.696\nthey did an investment that most of us\nwould had just kind of choked out by far.\n\n406\n00:23:03.696 --> 00:23:07.172\nThey said, look, we know that\nthe best email security appliance\n\n407\n00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:10.700\non Earth is something that\nwe call IronPort, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.390\nIronPort was so good that Cisco, when\nthey bought it, paid $900 million for it.\n\n409\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.380\nThat's not something that\na company just goes, let's see,\n\n410\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.250\nhere's an email company that's 100\nmillion, here's one for 60 million.\n\n411\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:30.150\nBut they willingly said,\nemail protection, IronPort, $900 million.\n\n412\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:30.915\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n413\n00:23:30.915 --> 00:23:32.309\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty hefty.\n\n414\n00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:32.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.387\nYeah, that's pretty hefty.\n\n416\n00:23:34.387 --> 00:23:37.740\nOf course, you would think that it\nwould've kept the IronPort name.\n\n417\n00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.434\nAnd they still do to a point but today,\nof course, they call it the ESA,\n\n418\n00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:44.655\nthe Email Security Appliance,\nwhich is part of that, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:44.655 --> 00:23:48.840\nAnd the same thing with the web security\nyou might hear the term Webs Sense.\n\n420\n00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.850\nAll that's integrated in as well.\n\n421\n00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.163\nIt still works in the same way, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:52.163 --> 00:23:56.800\nSo you still have that ability to\nhost it as a virtual appliance.\n\n423\n00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.780\nYou can buy an actual email\nsecurity server itself.\n\n424\n00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.211\nBut today, of course, and the cloud email,\n\n425\n00:24:03.211 --> 00:24:06.745\nmake sure Cisco Cloud Email Security,\nokay?\n\n426\n00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:11.259\nIt says look, let's do this,\nlet's remove your adventure into\n\n427\n00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:16.810\nthe realm of having to even manage\nthe software or the hardware itself.\n\n428\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:23.838\nAnd don't do that, but let us host\nit in our own secure farm instead.\n\n429\n00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:26.667\nAnd so that way you can just pay for\nthe service and\n\n430\n00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:29.639\nstill have access to the same tools and\nutilities.\n\n431\n00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:33.939\nAdvantage of that, all these cloud based\nservices, you don't have to worry about up\n\n432\n00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:38.015\nkeep as far as the servers go, you don't\nhave to worry about retiring hardware.\n\n433\n00:24:38.015 --> 00:24:40.480\nYou don't have to worry\nabout buying new hardware.\n\n434\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.410\nThat is pretty much their goal, is to\nmake you kind of realize that it is worth\n\n435\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.956\npaying more so that you can have\nthe latest and up to date things that you\n\n436\n00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:54.602\nneed to with Cisco, and that that\nthey'll offer you more protection.\n\n437\n00:24:54.602 --> 00:24:56.162\n&gt;&gt; Paying for that peace of mind.\n\n438\n00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:58.953\n&gt;&gt; Paying for that idea being do that, and\n\n439\n00:24:58.953 --> 00:25:02.900\nyou can work together with\nthem if you choose to.\n\n440\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.552\nOnce again another service\nthat they offer but\n\n441\n00:25:05.552 --> 00:25:10.391\nall these are different things that we may\nconsider in the marketplace of security.\n\n442\n00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:14.522\nI hate to say that that's what\nit comes down to sometimes, but\n\n443\n00:25:14.522 --> 00:25:19.448\nin your organization, you may find out\nthat if you need a solution that has\n\n444\n00:25:19.448 --> 00:25:23.890\nto be implemented this week,\nit's worth paying that money.\n\n445\n00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.140\nIf you can actually wait for\n\n446\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.520\na solution over time, you may come\nup with your own better solution.\n\n447\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.070\nBut sometimes it is this ability and\nCisco prides themselves on saying look,\n\n448\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.485\nwe can really help you out right now,\nokay, or you can wait on Ronnie Wong.\n\n449\n00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:41.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which, fine, is not gonna be your best\n\n450\n00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:43.997\nbet as far as immediate help goes,\nbut overall though I mean,\n\n451\n00:25:43.997 --> 00:25:48.600\nthat's kind of the key is is don't look at\nit as, man this is just marketing, right.\n\n452\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.370\nLook at it as being would my\nnetwork really need this and\n\n453\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.080\nmost of the time you might find out,\nyes, it really does need this.\n\n454\n00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.300\nAnd it is something that\nwe're willing to pay for.\n\n455\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.720\nAnd if it is,\nthat's why you have all these solutions.\n\n456\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.520\nJust make sure you know,\nespecially the Cisco ones fairly well.\n\n457\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.670\nWe tried to show you a couple of examples,\nnot exactly the Cisco ones, but\n\n458\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.190\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n459\n00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:14.110\nAnd just realize if there's\na product that they want to push\n\n460\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.870\nmake sure you put the word\nCisco in front of it.\n\n461\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.620\nAs far as the exam that might\nhelp you out on the exam but\n\n462\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.311\nmake sure you know the names\nof these products too and\n\n463\n00:26:21.311 --> 00:26:23.710\nunderstand when you might\nchoose to use them.\n\n464\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.105\n&gt;&gt; Well sure Ronnie,\nnot just from the test taking standpoint,\n\n465\n00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:29.780\nwhich is why most of\nyou are probably here.\n\n466\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.770\nBut in real life you may also be requested\nto go ahead and purchase some of these\n\n467\n00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.340\nnetworks security solutions or\nat least provide some sort of input.\n\n468\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.850\nSo thank you for\nwatching today and stay tuned,\n\n469\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.550\nwe have more Cisco cyber\nsecurity headed your way.\n\n470\n00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.940\nRemember I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n471\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.947\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.060\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.190\nIn this episodes, we're gonna be\ndescribing basic network addressing.\n\n8\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.660\nSo with us today,\nwe have Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.140\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here as\nwe continue on taking a look at more of\n\n11\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680\nthe basic networking concepts we really\nhave to have under our belt as we start to\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.480\nmove forward in the realm of cyber ops\n&gt;&gt; Sir Ronnie, I know understanding\n\n13\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.560\nwork addressing that usually something you\nget right of the back when you're inner\n\n14\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.520\ninto ITs so how, where we going to start\nand how deeper we going to go with this.\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Well we're not going to go incredibly\ndeep but we need to start up with\n\n16\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110\nunderstanding what it has to be there for\ndevices to communicate.\n\n17\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.112\nNot only on the same IP network but\neven between different IP networks.\n\n18\n00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:03.556\nSo, the goal behind what we're\ntaking look at today of course is,\n\n19\n00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.769\nunderstanding the basic addressing\nneeds that have to go on.\n\n20\n00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.956\nAs well as understanding what has\nto happen within a single sub net.\n\n21\n00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:14.800\nAnd then of course across multiple sub\nnets if we are gonna start the idea of\n\n22\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.797\ncommunications.\n\n23\n00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.550\nSo that is pretty much the key\nof what we're going to be doing.\n\n24\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300\nSo we're really going to do some\nfundamentals in terms of saying,\n\n25\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.820\nare these devices naturally going to\nbe able to communicate with each other?\n\n26\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.024\nIf not,\nwhat else do we need to have happen and\n\n27\n00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:32.923\nmake sure that it gets there when we start\nassigning them to different devices.\n\n28\n00:01:32.923 --> 00:01:34.570\nSo that's what we are taking a look at-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n29\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.484\n&gt;&gt; And where it begins.\n\n30\n00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:40.183\nOkay, so let's talk about the idea\nhere of IP addresses within a subnet.\n\n31\n00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.852\nNow, this is not something I\ntypically like to do too much of, but\n\n32\n00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:45.607\nit's something we need to do.\n\n33\n00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:48.753\nWhich is we're just going to work with a\nsheet of paper right now, and essentially\n\n34\n00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:51.930\nkind of take some notes and make sure\nthat we understand what's going on.\n\n35\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.447\nLet's take a look at my machine and that\nwill help us out right at the beginning\n\n36\n00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:00.773\nwhen we start to take a look at the idea\nof basic IP network addressing too.\n\n37\n00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:06.825\nSo, when we start talking about within a\nsubnet, I guess that’s pretty much the key\n\n38\n00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:12.642\nis to make sure that we understand this\nidea of what we mean by the subnet, right?\n\n39\n00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:17.280\nRemember that an IP address has\ntwo portions of the IP address.\n\n40\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.000\nThere is going to be a network portion,\nalso known as network ID.\n\n41\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.600\nAnd then, of course, there's going to be\nwhat other people consider a node portion\n\n42\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.710\nof the address, or a host ID as well.\n\n43\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.820\nOkay, so within a subnet,\nthe key here is that every device\n\n44\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.500\nhas the same network ID, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.560\nSo within a subnet,\nfour communications happen.\n\n46\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.405\nEvery single device in that subnet\nshares a same common portion of what\n\n47\n00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.055\nwe call the network ID.\n\n48\n00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.932\n&gt;&gt; Like you were explaining to us\nthe other day about every house on that\n\n49\n00:02:56.932 --> 00:03:00.267\nparticular street shares\nthe street address that's part\n\n50\n00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.510\nof their actual full address.\n\n51\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so for example, right?\n\n52\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.030\nIf we were to take the idea of two\ncomputers being on the same network.\n\n53\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.352\nWe'll just use probably the most common\none that we generally end up seeing here.\n\n54\n00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:16.233\nWhich is gonna be let's say 192.168.1.\n\n55\n00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:21.611\nAnd I'll just start with 1.,\nlet me do 100 for right now and\n\n56\n00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.930\nwe'll give it a subnet\nmask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n57\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.032\nOn that particular network,\nthe subnet mask, if you remember,\n\n58\n00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:36.327\nshows us essentially which portion of that\n32 bit address is going to be the network\n\n59\n00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:40.898\nportion, which is going to be the first\nthree octets is what we'll see.\n\n60\n00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:46.184\nAnd then, another machine on\nthat same network 192.168.1,\n\n61\n00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.190\nand then I could go 110 if I wanted to.\n\n62\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo, both of those machines,\nif we were to assign IP addresses to them,\n\n63\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.520\nthey would share, well,\nthe same network portion.\n\n64\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.920\nSo, that is the key for communications to\nbegin to happen within that same network.\n\n65\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480\nNow, the other part of that key\nis at because they have to be\n\n66\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.108\nable to communicate,\nthey cannot share the actual host ID.\n\n67\n00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:20.480\nSo, every device within the same,\n\n68\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.709\nI can't spell same.\n\n69\n00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.170\nSame Network, okay.\n\n70\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.680\nHas to have a unique.\n\n71\n00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:33.075\nHost ID.\n\n72\n00:04:36.202 --> 00:04:40.021\nSo would be for\nus here on this one as an example,\n\n73\n00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:45.092\nthis is where we would find\nthe unique portion of this address.\n\n74\n00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:46.086\nLet me just copy and paste it.\n\n75\n00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.285\nThat way you don't have\nto watch me type here.\n\n76\n00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.101\nWell, maybe.\n\n77\n00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.011\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, looking at these\nexamples that you've given,\n\n78\n00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:58.806\nit's easy to go ahead and identify because\nwe're looking at a Class C address\n\n79\n00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:03.660\nwhich is historically one of\nthose classic addressing spaces.\n\n80\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.828\nHowever, guys, just remember that\nIt's not always that fourth octet\n\n81\n00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.166\nthat's gonna be signifying\nthat host portion of the ID.\n\n82\n00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:15.749\nIf you are using any kind of class\nlist and inter-domain routing, or\n\n83\n00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.810\nany kind of subnetting there.\n\n84\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.810\nIf you modify that subnet mask, remember,\n\n85\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.520\nyou'd have to go ahead and really\nlook at it from a binary perspective\n\n86\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.200\nto see the difference between that host\nportion and the network portion there.\n\n87\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.320\nYeah that's actually a good point for\nus to make, but\n\n88\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.490\nas a straight up example right\nnow we'll remember this, right?\n\n89\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.850\nWhat we're talking here is taking\na look at the subnet mask.\n\n90\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.780\nIf you'll remember that all of those that\nhave all binary ones which is what the 255\n\n91\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.150\nrepresents in each subnet,\nin each octet excuse me.\n\n92\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.880\nWell, the ones that begin and\nend with all zeros,\n\n93\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.570\nthat's gonna be our host ID portion.\n\n94\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.664\nSo, in this particular network here,\n\n95\n00:05:54.664 --> 00:06:00.305\nI just need to make sure that the fourth\noctet is the only one that I need.\n\n96\n00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:05.097\nNow, Cherokee is right in this sense,\nis that not everyone is going to be this\n\n97\n00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:09.893\neasy, where you'll always see where it\nends exactly along those octet lines\n\n98\n00:06:09.893 --> 00:06:14.686\nthat you normally see where the first\n24 bits of a 32 bit address is gonna be\n\n99\n00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:19.430\nthe network and then the last 8\nbits is gonna be the host instead.\n\n100\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.660\nThere are times where you will see\na single block of addresses like this one\n\n101\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.410\nhere, which is actually the 192.168.1.0\nnetwork where that can be sub divided,\n\n102\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.370\nor the idea of just division into\nmultiple, but smaller networks.\n\n103\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.759\nAnd that is a technical term that we use\nof course, that we call subnetting, right?\n\n104\n00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.915\nSo, if you've learned Vision,\n\n105\n00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:47.920\njust like we have all throughout our\ntime that we spent in elementary school,\n\n106\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.850\nor primary school at some point well\nit's the same thing but done in binary.\n\n107\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.559\nThat's essentially what subnetting\nis doing, but because you and\n\n108\n00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:00.201\nI did not learn how to probably work\nwith binary numbers as a child,\n\n109\n00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:04.180\nit becomes much more difficult\nas we're learning about it now.\n\n110\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.661\nBut, it does follow rules,\nit does follow a pattern.\n\n111\n00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:12.069\nAnd in networking, it's really\nessential that we understand, and\n\n112\n00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.629\ninside of a Cisco CCNA, and\nactually all throughout your CCNA, CCNP,\n\n113\n00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:22.118\nsubnetting and the ability to understand\nwhat devices belong together on a network.\n\n114\n00:07:22.118 --> 00:07:26.969\nAnd what devices do not belong together,\nare going to be very important for\n\n115\n00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.900\nanything that you face as a challenge.\n\n116\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.270\nBecause, we do tend to see a lot\nmore subnets in the realm of Cisco\n\n117\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.910\nin terms of odd subnets.\n\n118\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.930\nNot like the one that I showed here,\nbut different ones.\n\n119\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.740\nAnd you have to be able to\nidentify those machines\n\n120\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.030\nwhether they're on the same network.\n\n121\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.180\nOr whether they're not on\nthe same network as well, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.457\nSo, let's go and talk about some of\nthe characteristics in within a subnet.\n\n123\n00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:55.763\nSo, another thing that we also have\nhere is that every single network.\n\n124\n00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:05.024\nEvery network has 2 Special addresses,\nokay?\n\n125\n00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.780\nAnd we have to make sure\nthat we remember this.\n\n126\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.380\nAgain, basic networking, but\na good reminder for us, okay?\n\n127\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.870\nSo of course, when we start talking about\nthat idea of what every single one has,\n\n128\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.990\nthere of course is what we call\nthe Network Address itself.\n\n129\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.221\nNow, there is an irony here, right?\n\n130\n00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.662\nWe've already talked about a Network ID,\nand\n\n131\n00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:29.235\nthat's also what you'll\nhear it described as.\n\n132\n00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:35.720\nSo this is kinda the general portion\nof that, which is the Network ID here.\n\n133\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.726\nSo that is kinda the biggest\ngrouping that we have.\n\n134\n00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:43.450\nA subnet or a network is essentially\na group of IP addresses.\n\n135\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.696\nAnd this one is actually\na little bit easy, I say easy,\n\n136\n00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:49.742\nif you know binary,\na little bit easy to identify.\n\n137\n00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:53.010\nBut the way that you actually\nidentify the network address here is,\n\n138\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.390\nyou can't depend on seeing the numbers,\njust like what Cherokee was saying.\n\n139\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.173\nSo for instance, that may actually\nbe part of the same network that we\n\n140\n00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:06.637\nwere talking about, or\nit may actually not be, for all we know.\n\n141\n00:09:06.637 --> 00:09:09.710\nAnd so\nthat's why the subnet mask is important.\n\n142\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.349\nThe Network Address, the easiest\nway to identify this, if you can,\n\n143\n00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:14.993\nis to take a look at the binary.\n\n144\n00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:22.233\nAnd when you talk about the idea\nof the Network Address or\n\n145\n00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:27.471\nthe Network ID itself, this is where all\n\n146\n00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:32.880\nthe Host ID bits are binary zeros, okay?\n\n147\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.843\nSo if you take a look at that portion of\nthe address and you were to turn 192.168.1\n\n148\n00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:44.980\ninto binary, well, you would get it\nones and zeros, combination of those.\n\n149\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.880\nThe Host ID portion of that 32-bit address\n\n150\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.420\nwould actually be a contiguous string\nof all zeros, with no interruptions, or\n\n151\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.280\nnothing inserted in\nbetween in terms of ones.\n\n152\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.260\nSo that is actually very key for us,\n\n153\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.960\nbecause that's the beginning of where\na network actually can be divided.\n\n154\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.101\nThe other address that's also in every\nsingle network is gonna be what we\n\n155\n00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:16.260\ncall the Broadcast ID, Okay, or\nthe broadcast address, either one.\n\n156\n00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.747\nAll right, Cherokee, so\n\n157\n00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:29.000\nlet's hope this idea of describing\nthis works for us in this way.\n\n158\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.107\nSo if I were to say, hey,\nthe network address,\n\n159\n00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:38.052\nall binary zeros, okay,\nis what we have in the host bit.\n\n160\n00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:41.725\nThe Broadcast Address, then, even\nthough all the Network ID is the same,\n\n161\n00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:46.190\nwhat do you think all the host bits\nwould be, all the Host ID bits would be?\n\n162\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.880\n&gt;&gt; All ones?\n\n163\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.090\n&gt;&gt; All ones, exactly.\n\n164\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.919\nSo see, just even if you go,\nI've never taken a look at that binary,\n\n165\n00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.319\nI don't know what it is.\n\n166\n00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.236\nBut in contrast, right,\nthen you know that hey,\n\n167\n00:10:57.236 --> 00:11:00.723\nall the Host ID bits-\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I had a 50/50 shot there.\n\n168\n00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:02.011\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we've got zeros or\n\n169\n00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:02.929\nwe've got ones, so.\n\n170\n00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.312\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n171\n00:11:04.312 --> 00:11:06.899\nWell, you got it right,\nthat's all that matters, right?\n\n172\n00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:10.750\nAre all ones, and\nthat is very important as well.\n\n173\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.380\nBecause these are two addresses\nthat cannot be assigned to any\n\n174\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.970\nother device on our network, okay?\n\n175\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.100\nYou cannot assign\nthe Network ID to my computer.\n\n176\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.820\nI can't assign a Broadcast ID\nto Cherokee's computer and\n\n177\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.520\nexpect them to work.\n\n178\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.430\nOne represents, of course,\nthat entire network that I'm on.\n\n179\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.010\nThe other one represents a Broadcast ID,\nwhich is a special address that we use\n\n180\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.050\nfor, again, the idea of\nbroadcasting traffic across, well,\n\n181\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.670\neverybody else inside that same network.\n\n182\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.280\nSo these are two special\naddresses that you'll also find.\n\n183\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.048\nSo that means that if you, Cherokee,\n\n184\n00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:54.768\nwere to come across a machine that wasn't\nable to communicate on the network.\n\n185\n00:11:54.768 --> 00:11:59.797\nAnd I said, I manually assigned\nevery single address, Cherokee.\n\n186\n00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:03.290\nI know that I did them all right.\n\n187\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.600\nAnd then you came across one, well,\n\n188\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.639\nyou would actually maybe have\nto be able to eliminate it.\n\n189\n00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.940\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to bring you the bad news.\n\n190\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.664\nYeah, say, Ronnie, I think, yeah.\n\n191\n00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:14.287\nAnd it's kind of interesting, because it's\nalways going to be in the same location\n\n192\n00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:15.880\nwithin that address space, right?\n\n193\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.941\nSo we look at that first address,\nthose available within that IP range, and\n\n194\n00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:22.169\nthat's going to be the Network Address.\n\n195\n00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:25.010\nAnd then the broadcast\nshould be the last address.\n\n196\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.080\nSo only the usable or\n\n197\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.670\nsignable IP addresses are gonna fall\nin between these two IP addresses.\n\n198\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.220\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great way to\nactually think about that idea,\n\n199\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.560\nis that in between that, then, we can\nactually kind of do one other thing here.\n\n200\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.776\nSo the very first assignable address,\n\n201\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.539\nIf I can spell assignable,\nI think that's right.\n\n202\n00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:53.269\nThat looks weird, but\nI think that's right, assignable address.\n\n203\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.403\nThis is where all the Host bits,\n\n204\n00:13:00.403 --> 00:13:05.878\nID bits, are zeros except for\n\n205\n00:13:05.878 --> 00:13:08.506\nthe last one.\n\n206\n00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:17.781\nAnd that's a one, Is a one.\n\n207\n00:13:17.781 --> 00:13:22.556\nSo if you were to have, let's say, for\nexample, eight binary bits, okay, and\n\n208\n00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:23.835\nthey were all zeros.\n\n209\n00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:27.000\nAnd then your Host ID, you would know\nthat that would be your Network ID.\n\n210\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.110\n&gt;&gt; So as far as terminology goes, Ronnie,\n\n211\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.860\nI've heard a couple different things\nsuch as the least significant bit there.\n\n212\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.320\nOr even the delta,\nyou might see it in some textbooks.\n\n213\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.495\n&gt;&gt; Very nice, yes!\n\n214\n00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:40.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some very technical understanding there\n\n215\n00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:43.066\nin terms of binary math, very good.\n\n216\n00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:46.441\nSo the other thing that you have here,\nright, is that if you have all\n\n217\n00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:50.610\neight zeros, you know that that's your\nHost ID or your Network ID, right?\n\n218\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.170\nBut if everything is zero, so\nyou have seven zeros in a row.\n\n219\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.484\nAnd the least significant, the one\nthat's at the end, is a binary one,\n\n220\n00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:01.185\nthat's gonna be your very first\nassignable address as well.\n\n221\n00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:04.888\nSo that also means, then,\nthat we have this chance and\n\n222\n00:14:04.888 --> 00:14:09.092\nthis opportunity about the last\nassignable address as well.\n\n223\n00:14:09.092 --> 00:14:13.579\nAnd this is where all the HostID,\n\n224\n00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:18.320\noops, I gotta stop doing all that\ntyping and talking at the same time.\n\n225\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.810\nIt's not helping me out here.\n\n226\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:25.269\nAll of the Host bits are,\nwell, ones this time, oops,\n\n227\n00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:30.043\nones, [LAUGH] except\nthe least significant one.\n\n228\n00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:40.080\nFor the last, that is a zero.\n\n229\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.650\nAll right, so it's kind of neat.\n\n230\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.206\nAnd what we're saying is that then, on\nthis particular network, right, that means\n\n231\n00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:53.656\nthat if the first assignable address on\nthe host bit portion, eight bits, right?\n\n232\n00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:57.750\nSeven zeros and then a one,\nthat's your first assignable address.\n\n233\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.440\nThe very last one is when\nyou actually go to all ones.\n\n234\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.680\nAnd then the eighth and\nthe last one is all zeros, okay, or\n\n235\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.200\nis one zero, excuse me.\n\n236\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.138\nNow, you might be wondering,\nhow in the world does that work out?\n\n237\n00:15:11.138 --> 00:15:12.690\nWhy am I not seeing this?\n\n238\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.446\nWell, let's just take for an example,\nand I'll try and type it out here.\n\n239\n00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:21.890\nAnd this is just the host ID portion for\nus, so that we can see it, okay?\n\n240\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.960\nSo we just take a look at the last ID,\nwell, one, two, three, four.\n\n241\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.820\nWe're not gonna do all of this, but\nthis way you can kind of see it.\n\n242\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.610\nI wish they would line up nice and\npretty for us,\n\n243\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.880\nbut apparently they're not going to.\n\n244\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.783\nAll right, so this is what you'll\nactually begin to see as we start to take\n\n245\n00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.953\na look here, as just an example.\n\n246\n00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:50.064\nSo you can see as it continues on,\nright, so there's the binary portion.\n\n247\n00:15:50.064 --> 00:15:58.160\nSo the very last one that I can assign\nbefore I get to all ones here, right?\n\n248\n00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.169\nSo at some point, we have,\nwe'll just put a dot, dot, dot in between.\n\n249\n00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:04.323\nThen would be all [INAUDIBLE]\neverything but that.\n\n250\n00:16:04.323 --> 00:16:09.240\nSo that's where we get that idea of\nwhat the last assignable one is.\n\n251\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.710\nThe problem that you're gonna have\nis that they're not always gonna be\n\n252\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.740\nalways exactly these, right?\n\n253\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.558\nYou might find out in some of them,\n\n254\n00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.133\nyou only have four bits left, or\nthree bits left or seven bits left or\n\n255\n00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:24.480\nwhatever it might be and that is when\nwe get into the realm of subnetting.\n\n256\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.240\nNow if you're uncomfortable with\nsubnetting, you need to make sure you go\n\n257\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.030\nback and review the CCENT series,\nas well as the CCNA routing series too.\n\n258\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.805\nYou might even wanna hit up the network\nplus series inside the library.\n\n259\n00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:37.860\n&gt;&gt; I think net plus covers that as well,\nyeah.\n\n260\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because all of those\nare really gonna help you on the exam.\n\n261\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.150\nThey're not gonna say,\ncan you tell me everything.\n\n262\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.071\nBut it might be very easily on the exam,\nwhere you'll get one or\n\n263\n00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:48.294\ntwo questions like this.\n\n264\n00:16:48.294 --> 00:16:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Worked in there.\n\n265\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where it's worked in, and\nit's very important because it means\n\n266\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.190\nyou know exactly how\nthe binary addressing works.\n\n267\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.480\nIf you can't figure that out,\n\n268\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.340\nyou need to be able to very quickly\nwhen it comes down to Cisco exams.\n\n269\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.486\nThat's pretty much the key.\n\n270\n00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:04.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the key word.\n\n271\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.270\nIf you're not dealing with working\nat the binary math every single day,\n\n272\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.150\nit's kind of like a skill and\nyou can get a little rusty at it.\n\n273\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.780\nI'm guilty.\n\n274\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.050\nSo if you were to ask me right now,\nI might have to or\n\n275\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.050\na calculator, that little notepad.\n\n276\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.340\nBut unfortunately when you're doing in\nthe matter of minutes within the exam,\n\n277\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.930\nevery little precious moment counts.\n\n278\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.750\nAnd so that's why just repetition and\npracticing really come in handy here.\n\n279\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.170\n&gt;&gt; And there is nothing else that I\ncan tell you that's really gonna be\n\n280\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.830\nas helpful as understanding whatever\nquestions that you choose to get.\n\n281\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.980\nFor example, if you end up using\nthe transcender exams and stuff like that.\n\n282\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.420\nOr whatever it might be,\nwhatever practice exams that you want.\n\n283\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.490\nIt doesn't matter what time\nlimit that they give you for\n\n284\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.890\nthe exam, your goal is fairly simple,\n\n285\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.970\nespecially when it comes down to things\nlike this, is a minute per question.\n\n286\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.850\nSo even if you get it right and it takes\nyou ten minutes and you count it wrong.\n\n287\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.870\nEven in your own head you just\ncounted wrong [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n288\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.820\nas long as you're actually in\nthat minute or less category,\n\n289\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.730\nthat is when you know that you're\nreally ready for your Cisco exams.\n\n290\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.520\nAnd I'm not trying to scare you,\n\n291\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.610\nI'm just trying to tell you the reality\nof this because exams are expensive.\n\n292\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.540\nAnd I want you to be able\nto succeed like crazy.\n\n293\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.483\n&gt;&gt; Be successful, yeah.\n\n294\n00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:20.480\n&gt;&gt; And\nif you think about this particular exam,\n\n295\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.230\nit can be between 55 to 60 questions.\n\n296\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.390\nYou can get at least three of this,\n\n297\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.547\nvery quickly here like this is within the\nsame network or is this a broadcast idea.\n\n298\n00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Why is the device not\ncommunicating with the other device?\n\n299\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n300\n00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.930\nIt might be very quick where\nyou can lose points very much,\n\n301\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.750\nso by you not knowing some\nof the simple binary math.\n\n302\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.780\nSo here's just kind of the basic idea.\n\n303\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.200\nSo within a single subnet then or\n\n304\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.840\nwithin a single network, all the devices\nthat are on that same IP network,\n\n305\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.850\nlike what we talked about, all of\nthe network IDs are exactly the same.\n\n306\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.730\nDevices should be able to communicate\nwithout any trouble at all,\n\n307\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.500\nas long as of course they\nare connected together somehow.\n\n308\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.700\nUsing a switch, using a hub, or\n\n309\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.394\nwhatever it might be,\nthat they're all directly connected.\n\n310\n00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:10.200\nBut, Cherokee, that's not the only type\nof connection that we tend to use, right?\n\n311\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The idea of us just communicating with\n\n312\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.630\neach other is great, but there's times\nwhen we have to communicate with\n\n313\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.490\npeople that are outside\nof our network as well.\n\n314\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.181\nAnd we need to talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time, yeah,\n\n315\n00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:21.780\ncompanies have that option.\n\n316\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we need to talk about that.\n\n317\n00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.662\nWe need to talk about well,\n\n318\n00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:30.060\nnow that we understand that there has to\nbe communication within a network, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.880\nWhat about between networks and\nwhat happens there, too, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.100\nSo that is also where we want to\nstart to move and start to realized.\n\n321\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.890\nIf now there is another network\nthat I have to deal with,\n\n322\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.125\nhow is it that my computer knows\nexactly how to send that data\n\n323\n00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:50.510\nonto a network that it might not\nhave ever connected to before?\n\n324\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.900\nAnd that is another key\naspect of IP addressing.\n\n325\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.940\nSo, what do you think?\n\n326\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, we kind of spoke about\n[INAUDIBLE] and binary ending.\n\n327\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.983\nSo, this is where that subnet mask act as\nalmost like a translator for that router.\n\n328\n00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:12.299\nSo it can identify that belongs\nto the local area network or\n\n329\n00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:16.050\nneeds to send the data to another network.\n\n330\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt and\nthat's actually very good for us.\n\n331\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.520\nIs now we actually have to say hey,\n\n332\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.610\nbetween subnets, okay,\nwhat do we need to have between subnets?\n\n333\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.210\nWe've already described when we start\nworking with different networking devices.\n\n334\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.510\nThat router pretty much seems to be\nthe device that we need to have.\n\n335\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.400\nBut what is really so\nimportant about the router.\n\n336\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.310\nSo, now I've got all my devices\nconnected to a switch, Cherokee.\n\n337\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.750\nI now bring this router and\nI go all right,\n\n338\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.060\nI've got a router on my network now.\n\n339\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.700\nBig deal.\n\n340\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.950\nIt doesn't seem to actually work that way,\nwhere we just plug it in and\n\n341\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.940\nit just work, right?\n\n342\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.720\nThere may be some configuration, there may\nbe some concepts that we have to make sure\n\n343\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.850\nthat we understand and\nwe get on there too.\n\n344\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.050\nSo when it comes down to us\ncommunicating between subnets here,\n\n345\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.400\nokay, there's two possibilities, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.350\nAnd this is when we start talking\nabout the idea of what, routing, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.010\nWhen we actually start to send\ndata between networks then,\n\n348\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.540\nwe have to route the data from\nmy network over to your network.\n\n349\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.520\nWhen you start doing stuff like that,\nthere's two possibilities then, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.620\nAnd the reason why I'm\nfocusing on just those,\n\n351\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.330\nright, is because we're talking about IP\naddressing and that's actually key, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:30.590\nOne is what we call a default route, okay?\n\n353\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.660\nAnd of course, the other one is\njust a straight up well, route.\n\n354\n00:21:36.951 --> 00:21:43.755\nAnd routing tables, okay, and\nthis can be statically assigned or\n\n355\n00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:48.870\nstatically programmed or\nDynamically learned.\n\n356\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.276\nIf I can spell it.\n\n357\n00:21:53.276 --> 00:22:00.610\nAll right, so let's talk about this\nidea of the default route first, okay.\n\n358\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.790\nEvery single device on your network.\n\n359\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.370\nAs long as it communicates only with\nother devices inside your network,\n\n360\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.470\nyou don't ever have to worry about\nhow to get outside of the network.\n\n361\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.080\nBut the time that you do,\n\n362\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.210\nthat is when it's really important\nthat you understand this concept.\n\n363\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.560\nThe easiest way for me to show that,\n\n364\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.940\nlet me see if I can bring\nup my network adapter here.\n\n365\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.090\nOops, that's probably not the easiest way.\n\n366\n00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.430\nThere we go.\nNetwork preferences,\n\n367\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.620\nI couldn't remember what\nit was called here.\n\n368\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.299\nSo let's take a look at\nsomething like this.\n\n369\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.250\nAnd I'll zoom in for a moment, okay.\n\n370\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.910\nSo here in the realm and\n\n371\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.160\nI'm running on the MacBook, you'll\nsee different names for this, right.\n\n372\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.590\nSo in the Windows world,\nwe call this what?\n\n373\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.360\nThis says Router.\n\n374\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.510\nWhat would we call this, Cherokee?\n\n375\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Default Gateway.\n\n376\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.200\n&gt;&gt; We call it Default Gateway.\n\n377\n00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.260\nHere on this MacBook,\nthey call it router, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.010\nInside of Cisco world you may hear\nthe term default gateway, but\n\n379\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.700\nyou may hear the term\ndefault router as well.\n\n380\n00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.050\nAll those mean the exact same thing.\n\n381\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.610\nSo at this particular point\nwhen we start seeing this,\n\n382\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.620\nremember that we also talked\nabout addressing in itself.\n\n383\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.770\nEvery address has not only of course an IP\naddress, but it also has its Subnet Mask.\n\n384\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:19.290\nFor us to be able to well, use names,\nwe also need name servers.\n\n385\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.790\nHere is a couple of them.\n\n386\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.659\nThat's being kind of great out there, but\n&gt;&gt; Google?\n\n387\n00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:25.280\n&gt;&gt; Nor assigned.\n\n388\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.610\nBut notice this router id.\n\n389\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.910\nSo what is that router id about?\n\n390\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.150\nThat tells that my machine right now.\n\n391\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:40.180\nThat if it's not sending data to anything\nin the 10, because of the 255s here.\n\n392\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.837\n&gt;&gt; On that network.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, 46 network and\n\n393\n00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:46.600\nnotice the host portion here is\nall zeros on the subnet mask.\n\n394\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.589\nWhich means this last octet is all zeros\nor actually anything that it can be, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:51.589 --> 00:23:55.950\nSo that means that on this network,\nthat's fine.\n\n396\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.220\n&gt;&gt; But you gotta see this guy first.\n\n397\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.137\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.851\n&gt;&gt; If you want to send data out of this\n\n399\n00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:04.091\nnetwork, Think about this as being the key\nto the doorway out of your own network.\n\n400\n00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Good analogy.\n\n401\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.846\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much key, right.\n\n402\n00:24:05.846 --> 00:24:06.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:10.565\n&gt;&gt; So if you do not know, where am I\nsupposed to send this data to, if it's on\n\n404\n00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:15.330\n47.0, well it actually looks around and\nif it doesn't have this router it goes,\n\n405\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.392\nI don't have a clue where to\nsend that information to.\n\n406\n00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:19.913\n&gt;&gt; I say the troll on the bridge.\n\n407\n00:24:19.913 --> 00:24:23.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even when you do\nthat it doesn't go anywhere, but\n\n408\n00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:28.596\nhere it will be able to send it out and\nthen your router will take a look in that\n\n409\n00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:33.854\nrouting table to either find that you\nstatically routed the information saying,\n\n410\n00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:41.030\nhey if this is going to the 0.47 network,\nokay 10.0.47, sending out this interface.\n\n411\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:46.350\nIf this network is going to any place else\nsend it out to this interface as well, so\n\n412\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.220\nall of this is very possible but\nthat router ID is important.\n\n413\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:56.240\nNow I always, when I'm doing labs I\nassign .1, people assign, you can use\n\n414\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.890\nwhatever number that you want to, as long\nas it's not assigned to any other device.\n\n415\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure, in a business environment,\nit's very common practice for\n\n416\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.070\npeople to kind of pick something and\nstick with it, like a common theme, so\n\n417\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.951\nthat you're not confusing your co-workers.\n\n418\n00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you'll also see once again,\nwhen you get into the realm of subnetting,\n\n419\n00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.060\nokay it will not always be a .1, I only\ndo it as the first address inside to that\n\n420\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:26.820\nsubnet, so you might find out that your\nvery first number might be some like 49 or\n\n421\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.810\na nine or something like that,\nyou might end up seeing that as well.\n\n422\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.330\nSo all that's actually very important\nwhen we start to take a look\n\n423\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.860\nat some the information that we see there,\nokay?\n\n424\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.860\nSo being able to route between networks,\nthis is what we also have to\n\n425\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.990\nmake sure that we have on hand to\nunderstand what has to go on, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.980\nSo as just kind of a simple idea and\n\n427\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.230\nconcept here in terms\nof inside of a network,\n\n428\n00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.842\nwe've already talked about that and\nyou do need to be very proficient,\n\n429\n00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:02.890\nokay at being able to identify\na several things here.\n\n430\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.144\nAnd we're gonna come back after we,\ncuz I'm running out of time here,\n\n431\n00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:07.338\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n432\n00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:10.999\nwe're gonna do a little bit of a quiz\nis what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n433\n00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:12.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But for us,\n\n434\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.118\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nat least these things we talked about,\n\n435\n00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:19.358\nthat every single network right,\nis gonna have a network ID,\n\n436\n00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:21.131\nit's gonna have a broadcast ID.\n\n437\n00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:25.109\nWe need to know what the assignable\naddresses are, we need to understand that\n\n438\n00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:29.147\nby default they can communicate with each\nother and then if you are going to move\n\n439\n00:26:29.147 --> 00:26:33.270\nthat data off of your network,\nthere's not already a direct route.\n\n440\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.530\nYou're gonna also need a default router or\n\n441\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.710\na default gateway to help you out\nto make sure every node has it and\n\n442\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.570\nthat's also key, it can can't just be\nassigned at the router, okay that's it.\n\n443\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.149\nEvery single device that needs to\ncommunicate outside of the node,\n\n444\n00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:52.228\nwill have to have it configured on your\nmachine or on those machines just like I\n\n445\n00:26:52.228 --> 00:26:55.643\nhave it on mine and this is where\nthe importance of DHCP comes in.\n\n446\n00:26:55.643 --> 00:26:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Was gonna say,\nwe just spoke about that the other day.\n\n447\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so with the idea of DHCP,\nit really helps because it means I don't\n\n448\n00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.110\nhave to worry about making sure\nthat SSI on every machine, the DHCP\n\n449\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.865\nserver can take care of it as long as\nI understand those fundamentals there.\n\n450\n00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:15.120\nSo that's a good little review for what\nwe have, but we're gonna actually test\n\n451\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.630\nout our own knowledge on just a quick quiz\nthat will also have in just a little bit\n\n452\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.805\nof time, but for this particular episode\nthough, I've pretty much run out of time.\n\n453\n00:27:25.805 --> 00:27:28.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie, well thank you for\ngoing ahead and introducing us to\n\n454\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.710\nthe basics here, you got me shaking in\nmy boots, I don't know what's headed or\n\n455\n00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.310\nin store for the next episode, but stay\ntuned so you guys can find out as well.\n\n456\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.670\nI think we are out of time for\nthis particular show so\n\n457\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.670\nlet's go ahead and sign off, remember,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n458\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:08.206\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:11.999\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.695\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamental Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:16.990\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.260\nNow if you've been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.770\nwe know that Ronnie has some tricks\nup his sleeve in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.650\nRonnie's going to go ahead and\ngive us a quiz.\n\n10\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.770\nSo, thank you for\njoining us today, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.580\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.500\nThank you for having me back on the show.\n\n14\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.970\nThe idea of learning IP addressing, and\n\n15\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.900\nif you're already good at it,\nthat's great, that's wonderful.\n\n16\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.940\nIf you need a refresher on it,\n\n17\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.210\nmake sure that you do check out some of\nthe shows inside of our course library.\n\n18\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.270\nTo help really get you ready for\nwhat you're gonna be facing,\n\n19\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.580\nespecially when it comes\ndown to Cisco exams.\n\n20\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.830\nThe questions that you'll find of\ncourse are not super difficult but\n\n21\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.480\nthere's a timing element to it\nthat you have to be ready for and\n\n22\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.970\nyou also are not gonna have time to do\neverything that you think you're gonna do.\n\n23\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.590\nFor example, usually you'll get some\ntype of eraser board that you'll\n\n24\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.100\nactually be able to use and you thinking\nthat you can take the time to work out\n\n25\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.120\nevery single question as far as this goes,\nyou can, but you're gonna run out of time.\n\n26\n00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.120\nSo the key, of course then,\n\n27\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.850\nis to understand some of the different\ntypes of questions that you may encounter,\n\n28\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.210\nespecially when facing this\non an exam like situation.\n\n29\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.120\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\n\n30\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.110\nis we're gonna kinda take you through\na few of them is what we're gonna do.\n\n31\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740\nYou'll generally end up seeing\nthat a lot of the things,\n\n32\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.590\nespecially with IP addressing right,\nthere may be some drag and drops.\n\n33\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.260\nYou have to put the right IP\naddresses in the right locations.\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.050\nBut it comes down to key concepts.\n\n35\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.320\nDo you understand IP addressing and\nwhere they really do function well or not?\n\n36\n00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.260\nYou've got to know that.\n\n37\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.780\nAnd so I want to take you\nthrough just a host of some\n\n38\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.480\nof the different questions that you may\nlikely encounter and also get ready.\n\n39\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.760\nSo we'll start off with some things\nthat you'll see that are, of course,\n\n40\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.610\nin a diagram format that\ncan help us out too.\n\n41\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.500\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer and\n\n42\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.350\nthat will get us started\nas we take a look here.\n\n43\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.030\nOkay?\n\n44\n00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.590\nSo normally on the exam you might be\npresented with a fairly simple diagram.\n\n45\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.140\nThere's not gonna be anything too complex.\n\n46\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.780\nNow when I say that, it doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't look over the entire thing.\n\n47\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.880\nYou should, but\n\n48\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880\nalways make sure you focus in on what\nit is that they're asking you to do.\n\n49\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.310\nAnd another key element, of course,\nthen behind this is understanding.\n\n50\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.500\nThat means normally the majority of it.\n\n51\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.680\nAs you see these diagrams, if they've\nalready got everything else labeled,\n\n52\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.030\nthat means that they probably work\nperfectly and they're really only\n\n53\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.290\ntrying to get you to focus in on\none particular area of the exam.\n\n54\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.010\nSo, Cherokee,\nthe question is down here at the bottom.\n\n55\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.683\nWhat is the correct default router\naddress to allow for 10.0.44.66/29 so\n\n56\n00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:52.681\nit can actually send to 19216864.20/24,\nOkay?\n\n57\n00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:58.680\nSo you take a look at the diagram and\nyou have four different choices,\n\n58\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.370\na, b, c or d, and this is of course\nas you are reading this, right?\n\n59\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.490\nYour timer as you've scanned\nover the diagram and\n\n60\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.765\nyou've taken a look at\nsome of the answers here.\n\n61\n00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:16.600\nYou probably have already read\nthrough 15 to 20 seconds of it And\n\n62\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.840\nusually, you try for\nabout a minute for a question.\n\n63\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.810\nSo you're already down to 40 seconds,\nCherokee.\n\n64\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.430\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nAnd now,\n\n65\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.490\nI have to decipher what it is they want\nme to actually answer because sometimes\n\n66\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.450\nif you read too fast, you can't hit\nthat back button with these systems.\n\n67\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n68\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.050\nSo I wanna make sure that I\nunderstand it before I continue.\n\n69\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.670\nSo the first thing I\nprobably look at is to\n\n70\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.920\nunderstand I'm reading\nthe diagram correctly.\n\n71\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.766\nSo look at that first IP address.\n\n72\n00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:40.004\nWhat is that?\n\n73\n00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:45.400\n10.0.46.66/29 I see that my destination is\n\n74\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.010\na /24 address so I do know that\nit has to go through a router and\n\n75\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.070\nthen in fact they're\nasking me which router?\n\n76\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.980\nSo, if I look all the way to the left\nI can see my machine over all\n\n77\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.770\nthe way on the left hand side there\nthe 10.0.46.66 switch layer two.\n\n78\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.030\nThat's the icon for\n\n79\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.800\nthat which at this point in the game,\nThey're probably not gonna label it for\n\n80\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.950\nyou but I don't know they're not\ngonna say something like switch.\n\n81\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.090\nI look at my router logo\nthere right next to it and\n\n82\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.240\nthat's the first router that I have to\ntraverse in order to go out all the way on\n\n83\n00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.970\nthe right hand side,\nthat 192.168.64.20 /24.\n\n84\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.930\nSo I'm gonna go with b.\n\n85\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.920\n&gt;&gt; B is the correct answer,\nand the strange thing is, and\n\n86\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.400\nCherokee worked through the logic that we\nreally want to make sure they work through\n\n87\n00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.580\nwhile we're studying, while we're\ngetting ready for the exam, but\n\n88\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.860\nit should be second nature to what\nyou need to do on the exam yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.234\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit stand up I guess,\nyeah.\n\n90\n00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:47.360\n&gt;&gt; We got to speed it up a little bit but\none of the key things that could have been\n\n91\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.370\ndone right away, so this is just as a hand\non any exam that you're taking with Cisco.\n\n92\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.870\nIf you take a look at the term\ndefault router, well that means what?\n\n93\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.750\nFirst and foremost you know\nwhat that default router is and\n\n94\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.850\nthat means you know\nthe default gateway is.\n\n95\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.230\nIs your default gateway gonna be\non anybody elses remote network?\n\n96\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.760\nNo.\n\n97\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.270\nOkay?\nSo if you know that,\n\n98\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.300\nthat means you kind of eliminated it\ndown to two possible answers here.\n\n99\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.950\nOkay?\n\n100\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.550\nSo even at that point you really have\n\n101\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.570\ndone it very quickly if you've just\nread the question go, all right,\n\n102\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.340\ndefault router,\nI'm not going to worry about this guy.\n\n103\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.150\nI don't even want to look\nat those answers at all, so\n\n104\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.900\nI wouldn't even worry about that.\n\n105\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.540\n&gt;&gt; Were you timing me?\nDid I make it in my 60 seconds?\n\n106\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.120\n&gt;&gt; You did not.\n\n107\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.374\nYou actually went over.\n\n108\n00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:27.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n109\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.790\n&gt;&gt; So that's what it would be.\n\n110\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.850\nThis is kind of the key.\n\n111\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.390\nBut it's good to think about logic,\nand actually thinking about your logic\n\n112\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.870\nwhile you're doing this during\npractice is really a good idea.\n\n113\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.020\nBecause it will help you to go faster.\n\n114\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.980\nI know it seems strange, but\n\n115\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.930\ntaking that slow now understanding the\nconcepts is gonna speed you up later on.\n\n116\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.080\nDon't worry about getting fast at\nthe same time you don't know the concept.\n\n117\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.970\nWe know the concept, you can get faster.\n\n118\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.240\nIf you don't know the concept,\ngetting faster isn't going to help you.\n\n119\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure, just like weightlifting or\nsome other sport,\n\n120\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.820\nyou focus on your technique before\nyou focus on your speed or whatever.\n\n121\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good analogy,\nso great.\n\n122\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.280\nSo here notice something else, default\ngateway we've already talked about this.\n\n123\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.030\nWe know default gateway has\nto be on the same subnet.\n\n124\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.800\nWell, I can take a look just at,\nOf that one.\n\n125\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.786\nNotice it is a /30 and-\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n126\n00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:20.005\n&gt;&gt; My computer though was a /29.\n\n127\n00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.580\nSo the only logical answer here,\n\n128\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.910\neven if I didn't know anything about\nsubnetting and nothing about subnetting.\n\n129\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.960\nThat should have helped me as well.\n\n130\n00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.830\nSo if I wanted to do a little bit\nof a process of elimination and\n\n131\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.030\ntaking a look at Some of the information.\n\n132\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.500\nA diagram can be insanely\nhelpful on the go.\n\n133\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.930\nBut a lot of times,\n\n134\n00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.300\na diagram can also hurt you in\nterms of time on the exam itself.\n\n135\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.300\nSo Cisco is not trying to see\nif you read the entire diagram.\n\n136\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.970\nI guarantee you, they don't care.\n\n137\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.880\nThey just wanna know,\ncan you get to the right answer?\n\n138\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.460\nBecause Cisco is all about the idea\nof Taking what you know and\n\n139\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.540\nbeing able to apply it as quickly as\nyou can and have it applied accurately.\n\n140\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.240\nSo it is a key concept that\nwe're going over right now\n\n141\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.050\nin getting something ready for\nthe exam like that.\n\n142\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.470\nSo just take a little bit of time\nas you start to go through and\n\n143\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.670\nyou start to think about\nthese processes here.\n\n144\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.350\nEven if you don't have a diagram set\nup for you or a question like this.\n\n145\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.490\nYou can write out your own and\nmake sure that you go,\n\n146\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.050\nall right,\nlet me follow the logical steps through.\n\n147\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.350\nAnd once you do that,\nmake sure it becomes habit for\n\n148\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.250\nyou that you're not\nhaving to think about it.\n\n149\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.370\nYou see the key terms like default router,\n\n150\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.480\nyou know you're focusing\nin only on the router.\n\n151\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.880\nDon't worry about the rest of\nthe question, cuz if you do,\n\n152\n00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.270\nyou will find yourself always\npushing that time limit.\n\n153\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.090\nAnd it's not gonna be easy.\n\n154\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.580\nSo the Cisco cyber security\nfundamentals right?\n\n155\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.933\nIt's the first of two different\nexams that you'll have.\n\n156\n00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:50.549\nBut they already expect you\nto know these concepts so\n\n157\n00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:52.934\nthat you don't have to\nstruggle through them.\n\n158\n00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.544\nYou don't have to think about them and\n\n159\n00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.221\nthat's why we're reviewing them\nright here, right now too.\n\n160\n00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:57.732\nOkay?\n\n161\n00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:58.392\nSo Cherokee,\n\n162\n00:07:58.392 --> 00:08:01.921\nany other questions on something like\nthis if you were to face it on the exam?\n\n163\n00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:03.500\n&gt;&gt; No let's truck along.\n\n164\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.500\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what you've got [LAUGH].\n\n165\n00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.170\n&gt;&gt; So, the next one just\na little bit harder here.\n\n166\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.570\nAs we take a look now\nwe've still got a diagram,\n\n167\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.130\nso we're going to kind of\nhit all the diagrams and\n\n168\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.380\nthen we'll kind of move through\nthe logical working out of things instead.\n\n169\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.790\nSo here on this diagram,\nwhich address allows for traffic from?\n\n170\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.550\nWell, the same thing.\n\n171\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.520\nIt's almost the exact\nsame identical question,\n\n172\n00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.330\nas what we're actually seeing here.\n\n173\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.755\nSo on a regular exam, if this were a\nMicrosoft exam, you know what I would do?\n\n174\n00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:35.706\nI would hit that back key and\nI would come back there and go,\n\n175\n00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:38.055\nI know exactly what\nthe answer is going to be for\n\n176\n00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:40.780\nthis question because It's\nan identical question.\n\n177\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.100\nOops, let me not cancel that and\nerase that.\n\n178\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.030\nIt's gonna be an identical question here.\n\n179\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.830\nBut it really isn't.\n\n180\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.790\nIt actually requires you\nto think a little bit more.\n\n181\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.630\nBut now they're focusing you in on exactly\nwhat interface needs to be configured.\n\n182\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.660\nSo on this one, Cherokee no, now we've\nkind of a little bit more difficulty.\n\n183\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.980\n&gt;&gt; So, this one's a little bit\ndifferent because I actually heard,\n\n184\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.050\nI overheard you and\nMike talking about this one.\n\n185\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.005\nSo I'm gonna use that to my advantage\nhere, because I did hear you say\n\n186\n00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:17.626\nthat which one, the answer d/\n70 was the broadcast address.\n\n187\n00:09:17.626 --> 00:09:25.786\nSo logic tells me that a 71 because the\nMyBroadcast address is my last address,\n\n188\n00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:30.830\nthat .71 is going to be\nassignable IP address.\n\n189\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.058\n&gt;&gt; That would be wrong.\n\n190\n00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:35.348\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; 71 is actually the broadcast address.\n\n191\n00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:37.000\n&gt;&gt; 71 was your broadcast address.\n\n192\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.870\nIf 71 was your broadcast address,\nthen I'm gonna go with A.\n\n193\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.856\nA, now, A is also wrong too, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:43.856 --> 00:09:46.815\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm failing\nthe Cisco exam here.\n\n195\n00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:47.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n196\n00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:49.881\nas we start to take a look,\nthis is why you have to slow down.\n\n197\n00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.708\nYou were kinda rushing.\n\n198\n00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:52.992\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\nI was trying to rush through this.\n\n199\n00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Yep, trying to rush through it.\n\n200\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.500\nUnderstanding the concept, what is it\nthat they're really asking you for?\n\n201\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.060\nWhat has to be on this\ninterface to make this work?\n\n202\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.170\nNow, this requires you to understand\nwhat this entire network is,\n\n203\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.040\nwhat network is 10.0.46.66 actually on?\n\n204\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.790\nAnd that is the key for what we do.\n\n205\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.223\nIf you have not memorized, and\nI know this goes way beyond the scope.\n\n206\n00:10:17.223 --> 00:10:18.094\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n207\n00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:19.782\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm saying,\n\n208\n00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:21.059\nI'd have to work this one out on paper,\n\n209\n00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:23.130\nbecause I'm not that fast in\nmy mind right at this moment.\n\n210\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.680\n&gt;&gt; And actually, that's a great thing,\nbecause I want to give you a hint.\n\n211\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.086\nIf you haven't watched\nthe accelerated ICND1.\n\n212\n00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:31.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with Todd Landley.\n\n213\n00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:32.350\n&gt;&gt; With Todd Landley on it.\n\n214\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.150\n&gt;&gt; Super fast.\n\n215\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.760\n&gt;&gt; He essentially shows you how\nto do this stuff insanely fast\n\n216\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.320\nI was already good at submitting,\nI really was really good at submitting,\n\n217\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.760\nTom made me faster and\nI was kind of surprised at those.\n\n218\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.510\nSo it's not that it can't be done,\nit's just that you have to know,\n\n219\n00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.420\nyou observe the mask and\nwhat this translates out to be here.\n\n220\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:59.545\nSo, with the idea of a slashed 29,\nthat's gonna be 25.255.255.248.\n\n221\n00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:02.949\nAnd what that tells me is that,\nthat's actually in series of 8.\n\n222\n00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:06.100\nIn other words,\nmy network block is gonna be in 8's here.\n\n223\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.290\nWell, 66 is not in one\nof those blocks of 8.\n\n224\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.700\nWe go 8, 16, 24, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, he's got patterns, yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\nyou start off with the idea of well,\n\n226\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.640\neight times eight I know that's\npart of that kinda chunk and idea.\n\n227\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:28.120\n64 then 10.0.46.64 is\ngoing to be my network ID.\n\n228\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.770\nSo that eliminates A,\nthat's my network ID.\n\n229\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:38.500\nWell what is the next one after 64,\n64 plus 8 that's gonna be 72.\n\n230\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.806\nSo 72's the next network ID, one back\nfrom that is gonna be my broadcast.\n\n231\n00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:43.554\n&gt;&gt; My broadcast.\n\n232\n00:11:43.554 --> 00:11:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Which is 70, 71.\n\n233\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.880\nSo then there's 70 here,\n\n234\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.240\nwhich is the assignable address that I\ncan have, and then there's this one.\n\n235\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.620\nThis is kind of an oddball one here, but\nthis one's not even in the same network.\n\n236\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.550\nSo you have to again, think in those\nterms about eliminating the one.\n\n237\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.530\nSo right away, if I didn't know anything\nelse, I know I could eliminate c,\n\n238\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.412\nbecause I know slash 29 and c,\nslash 60, with the 66, on 64.\n\n239\n00:12:12.412 --> 00:12:14.260\nYeah that's not gonna work.\n\n240\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.360\nSo I know that that one I can get rid of.\n\n241\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.690\nIf I can figure out\nwhat the network ID is.\n\n242\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.896\nI know I'm now left with B or\nD at this point, and\n\n243\n00:12:21.896 --> 00:12:26.399\nif I can figure out what the next\nnetwork block is 66 + 8, 72.\n\n244\n00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.065\nI know that's gonna be my\nbroadcast which is B, and\n\n245\n00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:33.440\nthat now leads me to well D as my answer.\n\n246\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:40.290\nIf you're kind of going like how insane,\nhow did he do that?\n\n247\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.950\nIt's from years of practice.\n\n248\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.059\nI'm not gonna tell you that this was\nsomething I learned yesterday or\n\n249\n00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:45.764\ntwo hours ago.\n\n250\n00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:48.513\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, and now I'm just realizing,\ndid I say that 70 was the broadcast of 71?\n\n251\n00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:49.526\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's always the latter.\n\n252\n00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:51.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm looking at the answer now.\n\n253\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.530\nSo yeah, I'm just a perfect example.\n\n254\n00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.540\nSlow down, read what you're doing here\nbecause then you're gonna be like,\n\n255\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.480\nwait a second no.\n\n256\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.210\nSlow your role then continue.\n\n257\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you can.\n\n258\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.000\nWhile you're studying and while you're\nlearning, while you're practicing.\n\n259\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.050\nSlow down.\n\n260\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Get faster, but only after you\nhave mastered those concepts.\n\n262\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.060\nIt doesn't help if you haven't mastered a\nconcept and you're still trying to do it.\n\n263\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.331\nSo that's why I say do it before the exam.\n\n264\n00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:19.310\n&gt;&gt; I got to go back and watch the Todd\nLamley shows to get faster at it actually.\n\n265\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.390\nI was watching them and\nthose were some really good ones actually.\n\n266\n00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're really\ngreat in that series,\n\n267\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.590\nand if you think that I'm kind of\nbeing harsh, Todd Lamley literally\n\n268\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.790\nmade me subnet in my head while onscreen,\nso we did that together.\n\n269\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.410\nSo that's I could do that.\n\n270\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.290\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well you kind of are.\n\n271\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n272\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.840\nto a point I'm not being like that but so.\n\n273\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.540\nSo there you go.\n\n274\n00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.310\nYou have this ability to\nkind of work through it.\n\n275\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.490\nJust trying to show you some\nof the example-like things.\n\n276\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.120\nNow, it is very possible that you will get\nquestions that sound insanely similar,\n\n277\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.090\njust like what I just showed you.\n\n278\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.628\nVery much so.\nBut once again, Cherokee gave us a hint,\n\n279\n00:13:54.628 --> 00:13:58.820\nyou don't have a back button where\nyou can review what you just learned.\n\n280\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.690\nSo it means you have to be\nvery confident about your\n\n281\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.454\nanswers when you start to do this.\n\n282\n00:14:03.454 --> 00:14:05.980\nA mistake is a mistake, is a mistake.\n\n283\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.330\nIt doesn't matter whether you go,\n\n284\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.560\nI knew what the right answer was after\nyou hit Next, it doesn't matter.\n\n285\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I see a note here in chat.\n\n286\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.980\nIt does say that William says based\nupon his experience with Cisco exams,\n\n287\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.180\nsometimes Cisco will have those,\nat least a throwaway question.\n\n288\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.490\nCompTIA, a little more lenient,\nyeah that's our C right there,\n\n289\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.030\nthat's our throwaway question for\nthis one.\n\n290\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.440\nCompTIA, I've noticed that they\nusually have two throwaway questions.\n\n291\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.300\nBut yeah, moving forward,\nCisco is not as generous, per se,so.\n\n292\n00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.140\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at at least\none more with a diagram here.\n\n293\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.638\nSo Cherokee, look, the diagram looks\nalmost exactly the same again Cherokee.\n\n294\n00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:46.019\nSo, what are they doing and\n\n295\n00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:50.407\nyou'll find this out that that is a common\nmethodology, is because you're expecting\n\n296\n00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:55.410\nsomething different and you're expecting\nthere can't be another question like this.\n\n297\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.380\nAnd noticed that here it is.\n\n298\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.520\nHere's the third one in row, based really\nprimarily along the same exam pattern,\n\n299\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.820\nis what you're seeing,\nas far as the question.\n\n300\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.740\nUsing the diagram, and\nnotice this one is telling you.\n\n301\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.740\nIt's the idea here of psycho programming,\nis what we're talking about.\n\n302\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.070\nThey're saying look at the diagram,\n\n303\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.090\ntake a look at the diagram I'll\nlet things sink into your head.\n\n304\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.660\nCan this actually be reachable at this\npoint with the addressing that you see?\n\n305\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n306\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.130\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n307\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.510\n&gt;&gt; I've slowed down.\n\n308\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.670\nWoosah.\n\n309\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n310\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.120\n&gt;&gt; I don't need to do any math for\nthis one, so\n\n311\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.490\ni think you kind of gave it a little,\nbrought it down a notch here, so.\n\n312\n00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:40.140\nJust by looking at the IP addresses there,\nwe have 192.168.10.101/24.\n\n313\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.851\nAnd I have to communicate\nwith that default gateway\n\n314\n00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:49.456\nthere of 192.169.10.1/24, but\n\n315\n00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:55.385\nthe actual network portion of\nthat address is different there.\n\n316\n00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:59.098\nLet's see we've got our 168 and our 169.\n\n317\n00:15:59.098 --> 00:16:04.560\nSo do I think that that node\ncan reach the other node?\n\n318\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.060\nThen no.\n\n319\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are correct, okay.\n\n320\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.800\nHere's what happens on\nsomething like this.\n\n321\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.130\nAnd we saw this yesterday.\n\n322\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.109\nI actually gave this quiz kind\nof to Mike Roger yesterday, and\n\n323\n00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:16.787\nhe breezed right though, right?\n\n324\n00:16:16.787 --> 00:16:19.700\nHe read this address, and\nhe made an assumption.\n\n325\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.730\nAnd that assumption is\nthat what did this read.\n\n326\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.210\nCherokee slowed down, and\nshe caught it right away.\n\n327\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.716\nNotice that this is 192.168.\n\n328\n00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:31.073\nWhat does your eye almost do if\nyou read through it too fastly?\n\n329\n00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.540\n&gt;&gt; It almost looks the same.\n\n330\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.230\n&gt;&gt; It almost looks identical here,\nif you're reading too fast.\n\n331\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.798\nBut that is not the same as 192.168 so\neven though it seems the same right?\n\n332\n00:16:41.798 --> 00:16:45.631\n192.168.10, 192.169.10.\n\n333\n00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:51.640\nThat tells you that it is not going to be\nreachable so this again is saying what?\n\n334\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.570\nSpeed up because they're saying\ntake a look at the diagram.\n\n335\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.110\nThey know that your eye is gonna do what?\n\n336\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.833\nBrowse very quickly through the diagram\nbefore you make an answer and selection.\n\n337\n00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:04.684\nAnd the problem with just browsing\nis your mind will auto correct this,\n\n338\n00:17:04.684 --> 00:17:06.398\njust like our phones auto-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n339\n00:17:06.398 --> 00:17:07.322\n&gt;&gt; Correct what we do.\n\n340\n00:17:07.322 --> 00:17:10.219\nAnd you know how reliable your\nauto-correct on your phone is?\n\n341\n00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:13.232\nYou can imagine how reliable it\nis on the exam on your mind-\n\n342\n00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:13.819\n&gt;&gt; In your brain\n\n343\n00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:14.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] so\n\n344\n00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:19.006\nthis is something that I don't want\nto say it's a tricky question,\n\n345\n00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:21.004\nit is a valid question, okay?\n\n346\n00:17:21.004 --> 00:17:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Attention to detail.\n\n347\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.341\n&gt;&gt; Very much so.\n\n348\n00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:27.234\nThe very fact that you don't think\nsomebody can fat finger 169, right?\n\n349\n00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:31.905\n192.169 instead of 168 into\nthat router interface?\n\n350\n00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:34.970\nIt happens all the time and people go, no.\n\n351\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.860\nI know cuz I'm a CCNA and\nI've typed this in a million times.\n\n352\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.290\nI would never type it in wrong.\n\n353\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.250\nYou do a show run.\n\n354\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.220\nYou find out something.\n\n355\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.570\nPeople typed it in wrong all the time.\n\n356\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.350\nSo it is sounding that you definitely\nwant to make sure that you\n\n357\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.170\nare paying attention to,\nwhen you start talking about addressing.\n\n358\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.330\n&gt;&gt; The other tricky nature behind\nthis is that on the other side,\n\n359\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.859\nwhat did we do as well?\n\n360\n00:17:56.859 --> 00:18:00.508\nWe also started with 1 9 2 1 6 8 so\non this.\n\n361\n00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:03.975\n&gt;&gt; And they kinda trick us with the subnet\nmask to make it look like it's the same\n\n362\n00:18:03.975 --> 00:18:07.876\nthere with that slash 24, but it's not\nreally ticking they're just testing their\n\n363\n00:18:07.876 --> 00:18:09.950\nknowledge and\nthat's what their goal is so.\n\n364\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah very easily so\nit just takes one of those unusual things.\n\n365\n00:18:13.277 --> 00:18:17.939\nAll right so now, that we've kinda worked\nwith that a little bit more let's see what\n\n366\n00:18:17.939 --> 00:18:19.102\nwe can actually do.\n\n367\n00:18:19.102 --> 00:18:20.703\n&gt;&gt; I thought we were finished.\n&gt;&gt; No we're not finished\n\n368\n00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:24.430\nwe got a couple more here that we can do\nuntil we run out of time at least okay.\n\n369\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.923\nSo let's take a look at\nthis first one up here.\n\n370\n00:18:26.923 --> 00:18:31.099\nWhat address is valid in this\nparticular number, okay?\n\n371\n00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:35.132\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; 198.197.196 136/29?\n\n372\n00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:38.858\n&gt;&gt; So I just realized a few moments\nago that I can't do this in my head so\n\n373\n00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:41.869\nI'm gonna need your help\nhere working it out Ronnie.\n\n374\n00:18:41.869 --> 00:18:43.108\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n375\n00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:46.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nas you start to take a look at this right?\n\n376\n00:18:46.062 --> 00:18:49.282\nThe very fact of that /29 is the key.\n\n377\n00:18:49.282 --> 00:18:52.059\nYou need to know what that subnet\nmask turns out to be, right?\n\n378\n00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:55.623\nWhich is gonna be 255.255.255\n&gt;&gt; 252?\n\n379\n00:18:55.623 --> 00:18:56.408\n&gt;&gt; 248.\n\n380\n00:18:56.408 --> 00:18:56.953\n&gt;&gt; 248.\n\n381\n00:18:56.953 --> 00:19:02.793\n&gt;&gt; Yep /29, /30 would be 252 is what\nwe would end up seeing there, okay?\n\n382\n00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:08.708\nSo with that idea of 248 I know that\neach block, well blocks of eight.\n\n383\n00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:11.575\nThe great thing is in every\nsingle subnet that you have,\n\n384\n00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:14.564\nthere is one network that\nappears in every single on,e and\n\n385\n00:19:14.564 --> 00:19:17.621\nthis is what I learned from Todd Landing,\nwhich is 128.\n\n386\n00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:22.289\nSo I know something, if I know that every\nsingle network has a 128 network in it,\n\n387\n00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:23.770\nthis is network op right?\n\n388\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.231\nFor 8, right?\n\n389\n00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.130\nSo which is 136.\n\n390\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:32.810\nSo what is the next network\nafter 136 which is gonna be 144,\n\n391\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.403\nso I know that B right here is.\n\n392\n00:19:35.403 --> 00:19:39.204\nIt's probably gonna be eliminated\nas far as a network address.\n\n393\n00:19:39.204 --> 00:19:41.364\nLook, C is gonna be eliminated why?\n\n394\n00:19:41.364 --> 00:19:46.386\nLook at the prefix of the cybermask\nthat what we are talking, okay?\n\n395\n00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:49.551\nSo, that actually leaves us with\njust these two possibilities here.\n\n396\n00:19:49.551 --> 00:19:51.181\n&gt;&gt; 42 and 43.\n\n397\n00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 42 and 43, okay?\n\n398\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.196\nWhen we start thinking about that then, if\n144 is my network, it's possible that what\n\n399\n00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:05.377\nboth of these are valid, except for the\nfact that every single network has what?\n\n400\n00:20:05.377 --> 00:20:06.804\n&gt;&gt; A network ID and a broadcast.\n\n401\n00:20:06.804 --> 00:20:13.018\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, if 144 is my next network,\nwhat does this have to be?\n\n402\n00:20:13.018 --> 00:20:13.618\n&gt;&gt; My broadcast.\n\n403\n00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:16.046\n&gt;&gt; My broadcast so\nthat eliminates and leaves me with?\n\n404\n00:20:16.046 --> 00:20:16.698\n&gt;&gt; D.\n\n405\n00:20:16.698 --> 00:20:19.090\n&gt;&gt; D, there you go\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks.\n\n406\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so again that's a lot-\n&gt;&gt; Can I take you to the exam with me?\n\n407\n00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:23.466\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n408\n00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:29.174\nthat's the logic that I'm trying to show\nyou to work through as you start to think.\n\n409\n00:20:29.174 --> 00:20:32.348\nSo hopefully,\nas you're hearing me kind of talk it out,\n\n410\n00:20:32.348 --> 00:20:35.260\nit's also solidifying in your brain too.\n\n411\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.985\nWe're just going to do this one more,\nas we start to take a look here,\n\n412\n00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:42.610\nbecause if not, I'll go all afternoon and\nwe're kind of toast on that.\n\n413\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.360\nAnd we don't need to do that,\nbecause you'll get more\n\n414\n00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.060\nof this on the CCENT exam and\na CCNA routing and switching.\n\n415\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.130\nI can't guarantee you\nwon't get it on this when,\n\n416\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.880\ncuz it's really essential\nthat you know it.\n\n417\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.160\nBut notice this one, okay?\n\n418\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.090\nWhat's the broadcast\naddress to this network?\n\n419\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.480\nSo this one has a /28.\n\n420\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.190\nNotice how the high numbers are?\n\n421\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.340\nSo let me give you a quick speed tip.\n\n422\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.202\nI already told you that every single\nsubnet that you will ever have,\n\n423\n00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:11.365\nit is above 128.\n\n424\n00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:14.412\nGuess what,\ndon't start counting down at zero here.\n\n425\n00:21:14.412 --> 00:21:19.145\nSo I know that this subnet mask is what,\n255.255.255.240.\n\n426\n00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:21.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Which gives me a blocks of 16.\n\n427\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.890\nI know that 128 is actually\na block of six, is in there too.\n\n428\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.560\nNext address after that is 144.\n\n429\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.040\nThen address after that is 160.\n\n430\n00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.309\nSo, what is the broadcast\naddress then of 160?\n\n431\n00:21:35.309 --> 00:21:37.892\nWhat's the easiest way for\nme to figure that out.\n\n432\n00:21:37.892 --> 00:21:42.930\nWell, easiest way for me to figure it out\nin my brain is what's the next network?\n\n433\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.672\n160 plus 16 is 176, so\nI know that if I scan through here,\n\n434\n00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:49.493\nI need one address down.\n\n435\n00:21:49.493 --> 00:21:50.544\n&gt;&gt; Lower than 176.\n\n436\n00:21:50.544 --> 00:21:51.357\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n437\n00:21:51.357 --> 00:21:53.770\nYep, there's 175.\n\n438\n00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.410\nAnd that would be\nthe broadcast address as well.\n\n439\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.160\nSo, I showed you a little bit longer\nway to get at the answer this way.\n\n440\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.770\nBy eliminating the answer.\n\n441\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.240\nBut then,\nI also showed you the method here.\n\n442\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.620\nA little bit quicker in being\nable to see that and spot it too.\n\n443\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.710\nIt does take time.\n\n444\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.399\nIt takes effort to do so.\n\n445\n00:22:11.399 --> 00:22:13.579\nThis is not something you’re gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n446\n00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Don't think that in hour.\n\n447\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.720\n&gt;&gt; And I love subnetting,\nbut it's just being fast and\n\n448\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.505\nput on the spot like that, but\nthat's what the certification is, so.\n\n449\n00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:25.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is considered\nthe hardest topic on CCNA or\n\n450\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.050\nCCENT, you'll have to do this, okay?\n\n451\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.813\nSo for the cyber security, it's not that\nthey'll make you do all of this right, but\n\n452\n00:22:33.813 --> 00:22:36.887\nthey'll expect you to be able to\nidentify devices that are in the same\n\n453\n00:22:36.887 --> 00:22:37.592\nsubnet or not.\n\n454\n00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:41.487\nThey expect you to know, there's a reason\nwhy that address is not working because\n\n455\n00:22:41.487 --> 00:22:45.050\nit's not in the same subnet or\nis a broadcast ideas that you given.\n\n456\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.020\nWhatever it might be, these are key\nconcepts in understanding of course,\n\n457\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.040\nthe idea of the default router as well.\n\n458\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.830\nBoth these are really great.\n\n459\n00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.380\nMake sure you review this.\n\n460\n00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.280\nIt is still a primary\nconcept on all CCNA exams,\n\n461\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.640\nregardless of which flavor and\nversion that you choose.\n\n462\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.420\nSo you might get two questions,\nyou might get three, you might get five.\n\n463\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.385\nOn like CCNA Routing Switching, you'll\nget half of the questions just about, or\n\n464\n00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:11.530\n40% of the questions\nbased on stuff like this.\n\n465\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.200\nSo be ready for it as well.\n\n466\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.990\nSo that's a good review for you there.\n\n467\n00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:19.440\nBut also here getting ready for the cyber\nsecurity fundamentals and cyber ops.\n\n468\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.480\nJust gonna be key.\n\n469\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.210\nSo make sure you study.\n\n470\n00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.866\n&gt;&gt; I haven't got my voucher yet,\nso I do have a little bit of time.\n\n471\n00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:27.477\nBut I appreciate you taking the time to go\nahead and explain that with me and, well,\n\n472\n00:23:27.477 --> 00:23:29.150\nwith you guys out there today.\n\n473\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.270\nSo thank you for joining us today Ronnie,\nand thank you for joining us.\n\n474\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.717\nBut stay tune we do have some more Cisco\ncybersecurity shows headed your way.\n\n475\n00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:39.356\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign out for\nthis particular episode.\n\n476\n00:23:39.356 -->

understand.\n\n12\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.310\nThis really does account for when you take\nthe Cisco cybersecurity fundamentals exam,\n\n13\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.230\na good 12% of your exam so even though it\nseems easy, and even though you might go,\n\n14\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.170\nI can't believe I'm\nhaving to do this again.\n\n15\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.980\nIt is worth the review,\nit is worth your time and effort to make\n\n16\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.580\nsure that you do have solid fundamentals\ndown before you go in and take the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.110\nIt's one of the weirder CCNAs that\ndon't require you to do a CCENT, and\n\n18\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.730\nthen specialize in something.\n\n19\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.870\nThis is actually one that\nsays cyber security fundmill.\n\n20\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.590\nIt says we have our own two exams.\n\n21\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.200\nThey don't require you\nto do a CCNT before.\n\n22\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.820\nBut, do they expect you to know the stuff?\n\n23\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.240\nYou better believe it.\n\n24\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.470\nSo would you get questions\nfrom basic networking things?\n\n25\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.940\nYes, you will get at least 10,\nor I say 10, 12% in the exam,\n\n26\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.660\nis gonna be based on some of\nthese basic networking questions.\n\n27\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.750\nToday, we are focusing in on the use\nof VLANs, and of course what they are,\n\n28\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.990\nand then how does this affect data\nvisibility within our networks.\n\n29\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.430\nAnd those are key concepts for us,\nas we begin to take a look and understand.\n\n30\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.078\nIf you remember going back just\na couple of episodes, maybe three or\n\n31\n00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:41.876\nfour episodes ago.\n\n32\n00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:45.435\nWe were talking about the idea\nof networking devices and\n\n33\n00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:48.490\nessentially what a switch does for us.\n\n34\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.060\nIt is a basic connectivity device\n\n35\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.290\nthat allows us to connect multiple devices\ntogether, and then data can be forwarded\n\n36\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.400\nto individual ports based on their\nMAC address, on the Layer 2 address.\n\n37\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.980\nAnd that is really key in the way\nthat networks work today.\n\n38\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.890\nMuch more speed can be had, the other\nthing is we have less collisions,\n\n39\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.550\nwe actually don't have any\ncollisions just about.\n\n40\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.830\nAnd the foundational idea behind that,\nof speed and\n\n41\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.930\nno real need for\ncollisions makes our networks.\n\n42\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.520\nIt's incredibly fast.\n\n43\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.200\nWe don't have to share a bandwidth for\neverybody.\n\n44\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.240\nEverybody connects into\na 100 megabit port or\n\n45\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.250\na gigabit port,\nessentially gets a gigabit connection,\n\n46\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.230\nwhen it comes down to the brass\ntacks of everything that you have.\n\n47\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.500\nSo it really is a fundamental\ndevice that we have\n\n48\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.620\nby itself a switch that\nyou get right of the box.\n\n49\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.390\nEvery single device that\nplugs in to it though,\n\n50\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.380\nthat means that they will share\nthat connections in those way.\n\n51\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.430\nIf you start assigning IP addresses,\nyou cannot just assign one in one network.\n\n52\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.910\nYou can't take +A on a 24 port switch.\n\n53\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.560\nYou can't take six addresses there and go.\n\n54\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.770\nI'm gonna put this in a different\nnetwork than the next six, and\n\n55\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.080\ndifferent network than the next six,\na different network than the next six.\n\n56\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.650\nInstead of chopping that up and\n\n57\n00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.640\nsubdividing that particular\nswitch by default.\n\n58\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.660\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n59\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.690\nAs you plug devices into the switch, you\ngonna have to sign them all to the same\n\n60\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.920\nIP network that they\nare generally gonna be on.\n\n61\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.890\nAnd as much as that works,\nit doesn't work well in every situation.\n\n62\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.790\nSo ideally, or\n\n63\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.210\nI say ideally Cisco would say of course\nthat's the way that you want it to work.\n\n64\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.283\nAnd that means if you have a new\ndepartment that comes on board.\n\n65\n00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:40.400\nYou're gonna buy a new switch.\n\n66\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.320\nAs you start to, your business\nstarts to grow out and grow up.\n\n67\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.008\nIt, they absolutely want you to\nbuy more and more devices, but\n\n68\n00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.967\nthe key though is that we really\ncan't afford to do things like that.\n\n69\n00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:56.004\nIn a perfect world we might have an actual\nIT budgets, what you just explained,\n\n70\n00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.687\nI could have one physical switch,\none physical device and\n\n71\n00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:03.782\nhave two separate logical networks on it,\nbut how do we do that?\n\n72\n00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:04.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:04:04.486 --> 00:04:04.986\n&gt;&gt; And that is the key.\n\n74\n00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:07.499\nVLAN's are pretty much the way that\n\n75\n00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.760\nswitches do function.\n\n76\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.090\nRight out of the box,\nevery single port on a switch\n\n77\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.290\nactually resides in what we call a VLAN,\nor a virtual local area network.\n\n78\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.300\nAnd this is the way that they have\nlogically segmented the switch.\n\n79\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.370\nSo even though they're all the same,\n\n80\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.290\nthey're all the ports are on\nthe same physical device itself,\n\n81\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.930\nwe can treat those ports as if they're\non individual devices if we choose to.\n\n82\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.180\nIn other words, we can kind of chop up\nthat switch without really having to\n\n83\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.350\ntake a bandsaw, and saw through it and\nmake individual switches here.\n\n84\n00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.850\nThe way that we do that is logically,\n\n85\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.780\nand that's why they call it\na virtual local area network.\n\n86\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.480\nWe can initiate some\nconfiguration on this switch,\n\n87\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.950\nto help us to do something like that.\n\n88\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.510\nSo let's go ahead and see here, if I\ncan show you what we're talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.630\nI went ahead and I made a console\nconnection into my switch here.\n\n90\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.530\nAnd as I do so it's gonna ask me for\na password, and\n\n91\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.640\nI'm gonna type in my super\nsecret password there.\n\n92\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.580\nThen I'm gonna do a show vlan brief.\n\n93\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.390\nNow, as I already created a couple\nof different vlans for us.\n\n94\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.710\nYou can see right here vlan10 and vlan20.\n\n95\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.380\nAnd inside those vlans I've\nalso added in these ports.\n\n96\n00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.930\nNow a VLAN is a layer 2 technology, that\nhelps us to create layer 3 segmentation.\n\n97\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.686\nI know that sounds weird,\nbut it really isn't.\n\n98\n00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:38.084\nIt allows us to build that layer 2 device\nand separate them out, and form their own\n\n99\n00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:42.350\nlittle minor switch if that's kinda\nthe easiest way to describe it.\n\n100\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.795\nThen I can create another VLAN And\ndo the same exact thing and\n\n101\n00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:49.090\nform another VLAN right here.\n\n102\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.041\nAnd now, even though this is one physical\nswitch all together, it actually acts like\n\n103\n00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:58.444\nwell three switches according to\nthe default VLAN which is VLAN1, that's\n\n104\n00:05:58.444 --> 00:06:03.156\nnormally the one that's always made, and\nthen these are the two that I created.\n\n105\n00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:06.810\nTo create a VLAN,\noops let me see if I can get out of that.\n\n106\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.310\nI go into my global configuration, and\nthen I just say vlan 30 if I want it too.\n\n107\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.740\nAnd now I type in the do show vlan brief.\n\n108\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.100\nLook at that I have to have\nan interface on it to make that work.\n\n109\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.964\nBut that's why that's not working yet, and\n\n110\n00:06:26.964 --> 00:06:32.653\nyou actually have to have it tied in and\nplugged in so, interface,\n\n111\n00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:38.157\nfa0/9, and then vlan mode access,\nnot vlan, switchport.\n\n112\n00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:40.890\nSee I've even got the wrong commands here.\n\n113\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.550\nSwitchport mode access.\n\n114\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.630\nAnd then switch port, access VLAN 30.\n\n115\n00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:52.030\nDo show VLAN brief.\n\n116\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.860\nHere we go, without a particular interface\non it is says what you need the VLAN.\n\n117\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.190\nSo here it is, I just created a new\nVLAN by adding an interface into that.\n\n118\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.640\nSo, it really is helpful, because if\nI now have a small organization and\n\n119\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.250\nI'm subdividing my organization\ninto two different departments,\n\n120\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.970\nI don't have to go out and\npurchase a new switch instead.\n\n121\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.595\nI can simply do something like this, and\nconfiguring the VLANs are fairly easy,\n\n122\n00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:23.947\nfairly quick for us to do, and this allows\nus like I said to create separate IP\n\n123\n00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:26.819\nversion three,\nof a networks on the same switch.\n\n124\n00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.114\nNow the other thing that I also need to\nmake sure that we understand about VLANs,\n\n125\n00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:33.020\nand we'll come back to this\ndiagram here in a moment.\n\n126\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.166\nIs that VLANs, will allow us to\nspread multiple switches too.\n\n127\n00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:43.781\nSo if I go ahead and I connect this\nswitches together, I can have VLAN 10 on\n\n128\n00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:48.471\nboth of these switches plug in something\non the other switch into VLAN 10,\n\n129\n00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:53.308\nplug in something on another switch\ninto VLAN 10 and they'll both share that\n\n130\n00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:58.402\nsame connection, even though they're\nactually across two different devices.\n\n131\n00:07:58.402 --> 00:08:01.470\nWhich can come in really handy,\nlet's say, well,\n\n132\n00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.360\nwhy would you wanna create\nVLANs to begin with?\n\n133\n00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.410\nWell, like we spoke about earlier with\nsubnetting, it's one way to ahead and\n\n134\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.680\nsegment your network.\n\n135\n00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.931\nVLANs are another example of how\nyou can segment your network.\n\n136\n00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:17.009\nAnd if you recall how Layer 2\nswitches work with the broadcast and\n\n137\n00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:22.056\nthe traffic that's generated,\nwith address for a solution protocol,\n\n138\n00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:27.551\ndevices that communicate frequently with\neach other will have less traffic and\n\n139\n00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:29.440\nbroadcast traffic.\n\n140\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.460\nAnd so they say, hey, let's go ahead and\n\n141\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.750\nput the people who talked\ntogether the most.\n\n142\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.160\nKind of the opposite in school.\n\n143\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.420\nUsually your teacher would\nseparate you from your friends so\n\n144\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.740\nyou can't talk during class.\n\n145\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.340\nBut in a business environment,\nteamwork is key, right?\n\n146\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.160\nSo let's go ahead and\nseparate VLAN 10 as our sales department.\n\n147\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.050\nAnd maybe VLAN 20 as our\npurchasing department.\n\n148\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.020\nAnd so we can have multiple\nstories in a building.\n\n149\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.164\nAnd although the people aren't sitting\nnext to each other, from the network side\n\n150\n00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:59.503\nof things, it just makes your network\nmore efficient, faster, less traffic, so.\n\n151\n00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:03.030\n&gt;&gt; And using the departments is actually\na great idea and a great example.\n\n152\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.170\nAnd the reason why is we don't want\ntraffic from one department going\n\n153\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:14.290\nacross the same type of interface or\nwire than traffic from another department.\n\n154\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.880\nThe reason why is because the very fact\nof all of that traffic then, if its\n\n155\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.760\nintermingled it can arrive on somebody's\ndesk that its not supposed to arrive on.\n\n156\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n157\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.150\nby using VLANs we can separate that out.\n\n158\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.060\nSo on this switches, right, without\nanything else intervening don't worry\n\n159\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.600\nabout the left hand side,\nI'll explain that in a moment here.\n\n160\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.003\nIf we only separate,\nironically VLAN 10 on these two switches,\n\n161\n00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:39.588\nall the devices in VLAN 10 will be\nable to communicate with each other\n\n162\n00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:42.105\nwithout any hinderance at all,\nnothing at all.\n\n163\n00:09:42.105 --> 00:09:45.283\nBut if I wanted to\ncommunicate with VLAN 20,\n\n164\n00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:50.080\nit doesn't do that by accident,\nit doesn't do it by default.\n\n165\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.660\nSo broadcast traffic from VLAN 10\ndoesn't go out across to VLAN 20,\n\n166\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.160\neven though they are on\nthe same physical switch.\n\n167\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.250\nIt's just not going to happen.\n\n168\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.780\nEven as we spread this out\nacross multiple switches,\n\n169\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.660\nall of the VLAN traffic will\nessentially remain inside that.\n\n170\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.560\nAny broadcast traffic inside of VLAN\n20 will remain inside of VLAN 20.\n\n171\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.710\nAnything inside of VLAN 10\nwill remain inside of VLAN 10.\n\n172\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.966\nNow there is a situation though that\nyou do need traffic to actually go,\n\n173\n00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.630\nwell, from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20.\n\n174\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.420\nAnd that is what we also\nhave to worry about too.\n\n175\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.420\nFor us to do this, remember that\nswitches operate on layer two,\n\n176\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.507\nVLANs are layer two technology.\n\n177\n00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:36.128\nBut if we are going to send and receive\ntraffic, it's normally based off of,\n\n178\n00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.660\nwell layer three addressing.\n\n179\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.260\nAnd that means that well,\nswitches don't do anything on layer two.\n\n180\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.210\nSo data for to move from one VLAN-\n&gt;&gt; Layer three\n\n181\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.980\n&gt;&gt; To another one has to go through\n\n182\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.656\nlayer three.\n\n183\n00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:52.394\nI made a smaller example a little bit\nearlier but it kinda playing that's why\n\n184\n00:10:52.394 --> 00:10:55.565\nlike I don't worry about, but\nit's kinda easier for us to see.\n\n185\n00:10:55.565 --> 00:11:02.620\nSo if both of these, let me see if I can\ndo this, if I put this port on one VLAN.\n\n186\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.320\nAnd I put another port on another VLAN,\nand I did this on purpose, right?\n\n187\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.510\nThey're just about right\nnext to each other.\n\n188\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.257\nI mean, if you were to take a look at the\nwires, they're not probably but three or\n\n189\n00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:19.480\nfour millimeters apart in terms of\nwhere they're actually plugged into.\n\n190\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.680\nBut they are separated so\nmuch so that the traffic,\n\n191\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:28.800\nI can't directly link this guy,\nto essentially talk to this guy.\n\n192\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.730\nIf there on different VLANs, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.720\nSo it's not gonna actually happen that,\nof course.\n\n194\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.805\nWhy would Ashley just do\nthe whole thing here?\n\n195\n00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:40.870\n[LAUGH]\nSo it's not gonna actually do that.\n\n196\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.870\nSo this is where we need to include in\nwhat we call a layer three device or\n\n197\n00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.040\na router to make something\nlike this happen.\n\n198\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.300\nIf we were to try and do this,\nlet me get rid of that line.\n\n199\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.240\nAnd what happens here is\nwe would really need for\n\n200\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.870\nthe data to go through the switch here.\n\n201\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:08.390\nOn the back plane of the switch\ninside of the router and\n\n202\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:13.309\nget router back out to,\nwell the other device.\n\n203\n00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:16.640\nSo it comes out and comes down here.\n\n204\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.879\nThat is what we would needed to do here\nif we were to do something like this.\n\n205\n00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:24.540\nThis particular configuration,\nit can happen on the same device.\n\n206\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.570\nThere are what we call layer 3 switches.\n\n207\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.380\n&gt;&gt; Router on a stick.\n\n208\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis is actually that idea here,\n\n209\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.360\nwhich is the router on\na stick configuration.\n\n210\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.780\nWe don't tend to really see\nthat a lot in real business.\n\n211\n00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.480\nI'm not saying you can't,\nI'm pretty sure somebody's doing it.\n\n212\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.145\nBut you can see this.\n\n213\n00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:44.654\nSo even on the same physical switch,\nif you want those devices to be\n\n214\n00:12:44.654 --> 00:12:49.570\nable to communicate across VLANs,\nit requires a layer three device.\n\n215\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.690\nA switch, or a layer three switch for\nyou to be able to do so.\n\n216\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.820\nSo it is very important that we\nunderstand that particular configuration\n\n217\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.360\nif we need data visibility between VLANs,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.120\nSo, if something like that happens,\nthat's great.\n\n219\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.330\nAnd that's what the-\n&gt;&gt; So we need a router or\n\n220\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.510\na layer three switch?\n\n221\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.929\n&gt;&gt; Right a router or layer three switch\nfor anything like that to happen.\n\n222\n00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:16.549\nNow this also indicates then that for\ncyber security professionals and\n\n223\n00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:20.350\nof course the fundamentals\nof cyber security.\n\n224\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.160\nThat means we do want to implement VLANs\nbetween all of our departments as much\n\n225\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.230\nas we can.\n\n226\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.460\nSo that we don't co-mingle traffic\nthat we really don't want getting out.\n\n227\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.730\nYou don't want HR traffic\nto be on the same network.\n\n228\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.356\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; As everybody else is doing stuff.\n\n229\n00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or accounting.\n\n230\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Or accounting, yep.\n\n231\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.970\n&gt;&gt; All on the same traffic that\nthe IT help desk everyone else uses.\n\n232\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.480\n&gt;&gt; You don't want that.\n\n233\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.270\nYou don't want the guess network to\nactually be inside of your regular\n\n234\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.430\nproduction network stuff.\n\n235\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.860\nIt's just not something\nyou want to happen.\n\n236\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.460\nSo implementing VLANs is\na measure of security.\n\n237\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.529\nIt's not the only measure of\nsecurity that you should implement.\n\n238\n00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:57.191\nBut it's a great way to be able to segment\nthat off smaller at the same time to show\n\n239\n00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:00.130\nsome accountability\nbetween those devices too.\n\n240\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.734\nTo where you go look, as long as they're\nplugged into their particular VLANs,\n\n241\n00:14:04.734 --> 00:14:06.440\nis not gonna matter.\n\n242\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.383\nYou can even implement it a little\nbit stronger by using something that\n\n243\n00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:15.504\nwe call a VMPS which is\na VLAN Management Protocol Server.\n\n244\n00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:19.895\nAnd what this allows you to do instead\nis instead of actually assigning each\n\n245\n00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:24.440\nport into a VLAN, you can actually\nassign Mac addresses into VLANs.\n\n246\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.410\nSo regardless of what switch it is yep.\n\n247\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.351\n&gt;&gt; So there is a little bit I think we've\neven talked about this before Ronnie.\n\n248\n00:14:30.351 --> 00:14:33.045\nThere are some security\nconcerns with VLANs.\n\n249\n00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:38.366\nBecause if we look at a layer to\nthe frames at this particular point.\n\n250\n00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:41.709\nThe eight or two dot one Q\nframes that are being utilized,\n\n251\n00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:46.200\nthey actually add in additional piece\nof header information called a tag.\n\n252\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.040\nAnd it is possible that someone\ncould go ahead and craft and\n\n253\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.840\nmanipulate and\nfalsify tag information to jump.\n\n254\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.110\nVLAN hopping is what it's called\nfrom one VLAN to another.\n\n255\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.930\nBut, the chances of someone\nphysically being in\n\n256\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.640\nyour environment with that skill level,\nyou kind of have to outweigh the pros and\n\n257\n00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.250\nthe cons in this kind of situation.\n\n258\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you allow the idea of all security and\n\n259\n00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:11.718\nall your security measures together.\n\n260\n00:15:11.718 --> 00:15:15.300\nIf you're allowing someone to do\nVLAN hopping, that's something else.\n\n261\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.120\nBut most of the time,\n\n262\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.710\nyou're not gonna allow somebody to get\nonto your network that's doing that.\n\n263\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.535\nAt least unauthorized doing that as well,\nokay.\n\n264\n00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:23.098\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n265\n00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:25.402\nwhere is there a weakness\nin this system then?\n\n266\n00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:28.688\nIf there's a weakness in the system,\nit is normally right here\n\n267\n00:15:28.688 --> 00:15:32.390\nif we're doing something like\nthe idea of router on a stick.\n\n268\n00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.580\nAnd that is because, VLAN traffic,\nall VLANs go across a link like this.\n\n269\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.776\nAnd that link is typically what\nwe call a trunk link, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:46.431\nA trunk says that hey, even though this\nport should normally be on one VLAN,\n\n271\n00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:48.395\na trunk says, I'm allowing for\n\n272\n00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:52.782\nall traffic from all VLANs to flow\nacross this particular connection.\n\n273\n00:15:52.782 --> 00:15:56.496\nAnd when you do something like that,\nThat also means,\n\n274\n00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:59.581\nthen if somebody else can spoof or\nnot spoof.\n\n275\n00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:03.340\nIf somebody else can actually\ntap into this line okay or\n\n276\n00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:09.070\nget a copy of the traffic going across\nhere, well that's all VLAN traffic, okay.\n\n277\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.690\nAnd that is something that you\nreally don't want to happen okay?\n\n278\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.600\nSo this is the link that you\nreally have to be concerned with.\n\n279\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.160\nSo much so that on certain devices\nyou need to be very careful.\n\n280\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.740\nFor example, the switch I showed you is\na Cisco 3550, which is a great switch.\n\n281\n00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:30.362\nWorks in production, we've actually\nhad a 55 3550's working production for\n\n282\n00:16:30.362 --> 00:16:32.010\nprobably ten years now.\n\n283\n00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.709\nAnd as old as they are, as I mean really\nlast generation technology as they are,\n\n284\n00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:40.130\nthey're great switches and\nthey still work.\n\n285\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.830\nBut one of the default configuration for\nthat switch,\n\n286\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.430\nlet's me see if I can show you\nsomething here, Jackie on my screen.\n\n287\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:53.060\nLet me do a show run, as I wanna show\nyou on the interfaces what happens.\n\n288\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.320\nSo here's the basic configuration.\n\n289\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.047\nThere is something right here, as I zoom\nin which is at switchport mode dynamic and\n\n290\n00:17:02.047 --> 00:17:05.370\nthis key term right here,\nwhich is desirable.\n\n291\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.200\nAnd that means by default out of the box,\nif I have a device that I can\n\n292\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.610\nset as a trunk on my end,\nin other words on my end of it.\n\n293\n00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:21.170\nAnd I take a connection a cable and\nplug it into FastEthernet port number two.\n\n294\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:27.270\nIt says,\nI desire dynamically to be a trunk, okay.\n\n295\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.530\nNow, why does that affect?\n\n296\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.990\nWhat it is that we are talking about.\n\n297\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.950\nWell, the reason that it affects us\nright is that even though I might have\n\n298\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:41.480\nestablished this trunk manually, in\nthe way that I do it on that 3550 though,\n\n299\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.390\nI might be able to take my laptop and\n\n300\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.810\nconfigure it to say, I'm going to\nreport myself as a trunk link.\n\n301\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.830\nPlug in to port number two.\n\n302\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.320\nAnd that now also form a trunk.\n\n303\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.750\nAnd that means what,\nVLAN traffic from where?\n\n304\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.230\nFrom both VLANs can go across that link.\n\n305\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.830\n&gt;&gt; So, check to make sure it's not\ndynamic by default go ahead and\n\n306\n00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.220\nassign it at a particular port number.\n\n307\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not just a port number.\n\n308\n00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.430\nAssign a particular mode which is\ndon't dynamically trunk, okay?\n\n309\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So don't do that.\n\n310\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.820\nBut that's the default\nconfiguration on that one.\n\n311\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.706\nSo you normally go in there and\nyou turn that stuff off.\n\n312\n00:18:14.706 --> 00:18:18.980\nSo even there's a protocol called\nDTP Dynamic trunking protocol now not\n\n313\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.330\nevery switch, newer switches like\n3560s and stuff, they don't do that.\n\n314\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.740\nBut on that 3550 though,\nthat's the default configuration.\n\n315\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n316\n00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.990\n&gt;&gt; So if you think about that, and\nyou're not turning off those other\n\n317\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.330\nports on your switch well that means\nthat they're on and if somebody goes,\n\n318\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.600\nI wonder if that ports on the plugin and\nlink light.\n\n319\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.470\nThey get a link light.\n\n320\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.050\nThey know now that they can set\nsomething out of the trunk and\n\n321\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.890\nnow they can get all the traffic, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.720\nAnd that can be bad, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.270\nIt can be bad.\n\n324\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.340\nSo let's take a look in an example\nof what this can actually do,okay?\n\n325\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.680\nSo in my set up here for\nthe lab that I have to show you, right,\n\n326\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.970\nis I've done exactly that, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:02.790\nI am going to capture data traffic\nfrom this trunk here, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.600\nNow what I've done instead of actually\ntapping into it, the easiest way to\n\n329\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.160\ntap into this physically is\nto find an old four-port hub.\n\n330\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.818\nIt really is.\n\n331\n00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:14.580\nA four-port hub plug in between, right?\n\n332\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.320\nAnd then plug your laptop into that hub.\n\n333\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.910\nPlug both of those links\nin that hub as well.\n\n334\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.545\nA hub does what?\n\n335\n00:19:20.545 --> 00:19:21.970\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; As traffic goes in?\n\n336\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.170\n&gt;&gt; It sends it out to every other port.\n\n337\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.790\n&gt;&gt; To every where.\n&gt;&gt; Which means it can send it out to\n\n338\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.470\nmy laptop if I'm running\nsomething like Wireshark.\n\n339\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.510\nI can capture every bit of traffic\nthat goes across that trunk.\n\n340\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.140\nOkay, that's exactly what that means.\n\n341\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.420\nSo let me show you how this\ncan be really bad here.\n\n342\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.932\nSo I've got my machine,\nthe laptop that I'm using,\n\n343\n00:19:40.932 --> 00:19:44.690\nplugged in as one device on\nthe 47 network here, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.620\nAnd I've also got the 46 network.\n\n345\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.280\nAnd I've got a VM plugged into that one,\nwhich is this guy right here, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.030\nNow, I've set up that idea of\nthe router on the stick configuration.\n\n347\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.020\nWe're not going over that today.\n\n348\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.730\nBut you can see it right\nhere on the screen.\n\n349\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.400\nEverything is set up correctly,\ninterface is turned on.\n\n350\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.280\nEverything is good and ready to go.\n\n351\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.570\nSo from right here on this particular\nmachine if I do an ipconfig,\n\n352\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:18.670\nI just wanna show you my IP Address,\nthere is 46.103, so I'm using DHTP.\n\n353\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:24.720\nAnd then, I should be able to ping\n10.0.46.1, that's gonna be my router,\n\n354\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.240\nmy default gateway right my\njust like what you show here.\n\n355\n00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.000\nThe default gateway to the VLAN\n20 network is right there.\n\n356\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.790\nSo this is essentially my computer going\ninto the switch port number 12, I think.\n\n357\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.803\nIt's going in switch port number 12 and\n\n358\n00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:45.497\ninstead of heading over to switch\nport number 24, which is where 47 is.\n\n359\n00:20:45.497 --> 00:20:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Gotta make a pit stop.\n\n360\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.635\n&gt;&gt; Have to go up to the router.\n\n361\n00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:49.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It gets routed back down.\n\n362\n00:20:49.008 --> 00:20:53.380\nAnd then, this gonna send them back\ndown into the other one, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.136\nSo, that's what we have.\n\n364\n00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:58.466\nSo here is sending out of\nthe virtual machine and\n\n365\n00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:01.390\nhitting another net on my laptop, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.920\nSo that's the connection\nthat we have in between.\n\n367\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.410\nThe other thing that I did as I turn\non something called port mirroring.\n\n368\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.860\nPort mirroring allows me to capture\nthe traffic from that one interface.\n\n369\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.610\nOkay, I can actually\ndo more than one here.\n\n370\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.440\nTrying to get to the end here.\n\n371\n00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.709\nAnd you can see the configuration\nright here, if I can zoom in,\n\n372\n00:21:23.709 --> 00:21:27.000\nmonitor session one, okay,\nand source interface.\n\n373\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.269\nAnd this is one that I've\ngot connected to the router.\n\n374\n00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n375\n00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.823\n&gt;&gt; It serves as my trunk.\n\n376\n00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:37.161\nAnd I'm telling it,\nspit out all the traffic onto Fa02.\n\n377\n00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:42.020\nAnd that's now connected to an interface\nover on the other side of my machine.\n\n378\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.840\nSo I've really got wires\njust going everywhere.\n\n379\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.750\n&gt;&gt; You can't move too much, Ronnie.\n\n380\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nCan't really move too much here, but\n\n381\n00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.930\nI've got wires going everywhere.\n\n382\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.819\nSo every bit of traffic that goes\nacross that particular connection.\n\n383\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.380\nOops, is actually gonna work,\nokay, so that's port mirror.\n\n384\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.570\nSo anything that goes across that trunk,\nit should come back through and\n\n385\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.010\nwe should see that.\n\n386\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.990\nSo here it is on my machine,\nlet me see if I can launch up.\n\n387\n00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.870\nOr did I already do it?\n\n388\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.440\nLet me see if I've already done that.\n\n389\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:14.940\nNope, I haven't.\n\n390\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.550\nI wanted to make sure I\nturned on Wireshark here.\n\n391\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.680\nLet me go to a different desktop.\n\n392\n00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.170\nSo I'll turn Wireshark on.\n\n393\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.710\nAnd now I have to pick\nthe correct network adapter.\n\n394\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:36.790\nAnd my network adapter happens to be this\nEthernet four network adapter, okay?\n\n395\n00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.980\nSo if I select that adapter, right there.\n\n396\n00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.500\nI'm gonna go ahead and have that start\ncapturing traffic across the interface.\n\n397\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.710\nAs you can see,\nthere's tons of traffic going across and\n\n398\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.000\neverything that it's doing,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n399\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.170\nThat's what I want it to do.\n\n400\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.980\nNow, I'm gonna go back into this VM,\nif I can find it.\n\n401\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.450\nAnd I'm simply going to send a ping,\njust as I was doing a little bit earlier.\n\n402\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.940\nLet's send it to that guy,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n403\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.505\nThis is 101 I think.\n\n404\n00:23:05.505 --> 00:23:06.050\nYep.\n\n405\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.956\nSo that's my actual\nphysical host machine but\n\n406\n00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:15.369\nnow I'm going to turn it into the switch.\n\n407\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.350\nOops, not from there.\n\n408\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:26.035\nI need to Telnet differently,\nI forgot that inside of a Cisco or\n\n409\n00:23:26.035 --> 00:23:29.053\nnot Cisco, Microsoft servers.\n\n410\n00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:29.890\n&gt;&gt; You gotta use.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you\n\n411\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.625\ngotta use something like PuTTY, yeah.\n\n412\n00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:35.270\n[LAUGH] That's why I was like,\nwhy is that not working?\n\n413\n00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.160\nI know why it's not working,\ncuz I used the wrong software.\n\n414\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.030\nSo I'm just using PuTTY.\n\n415\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.775\nThere it is, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:43.980\n10.0.47.2 use Telnet.\n\n417\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.735\nAnd now I'm gonna click open.\n\n418\n00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:52.071\nAnd you can see right away,\nit's in that session.\n\n419\n00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:57.429\nSo now I type in admin and\nthen my super secret password.\n\n420\n00:23:57.429 --> 00:24:00.112\nAnd then there it is,\nI'm on switch number 1.\n\n421\n00:24:00.112 --> 00:24:05.167\nEnable asking me for my,\nenable secret password as well.\n\n422\n00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:07.049\nI start doing a show run.\n\n423\n00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:11.304\nYou start seeing the actual information.\n\n424\n00:24:11.304 --> 00:24:17.150\nI'm be there, I might go ahead and\nget into a configuration and\n\n425\n00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:21.020\ncreate a vlan 40, and do a no vlan 30.\n\n426\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.070\nSo this is me on that 46 network,\n\n427\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.680\nessentially clicking or connecting to\nthe vlan interface on the 47 network.\n\n428\n00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.879\nOr vlan 10 to vlan 20,\nconnecting and using telnet.\n\n429\n00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:38.730\nThe whole time I was doing that,\noops, zoomed in too much,\n\n430\n00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.224\nI need to find that wire shark.\n\n431\n00:24:40.224 --> 00:24:41.580\n&gt;&gt; You had a lurker.\n\n432\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n433\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.410\nSo here, I've got wire shark turned on.\n\n434\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.017\nLet me turn that off.\n\n435\n00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:49.300\nAnd now, there's been a lot of\ntraffic that's gone through this\n\n436\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.558\nwire shark connection.\n\n437\n00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:52.609\nLet me see if I can actually now pull in.\n\n438\n00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:53.318\n&gt;&gt; Our telnet traffic.\n\n439\n00:24:53.318 --> 00:24:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Telnet.\n\n440\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.740\nAnd now you can see here's\nall the telnet traffic.\n\n441\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.470\n&gt;&gt; And we got a comment in chat here.\n\n442\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.895\nRyan, William says he's been\nbrainwashed to never use telnet.\n\n443\n00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:03.543\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n444\n00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:06.916\nI have a very strong suspicion\nthat Ronnie's gonna go ahead and\n\n445\n00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:10.493\nshow us right here, why William\nshould follow his brainwashing.\n\n446\n00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:11.023\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n447\n00:25:11.023 --> 00:25:11.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n448\n00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.820\nright here you see all\nthe telnet traffic right?\n\n449\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.280\nSo you should just use SSH, there's no\ndoubt that's pretty much the safe thing.\n\n450\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.310\nBut notice this there is 46.103\nwhich is that server that I was on,\n\n451\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.830\ngoing into that VLAN interface so\nI can manage the switch using telnet.\n\n452\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.670\nThe hard thing about this is that,\nif I right click one of these and\n\n453\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.297\ngo then to follow TCP stream\nyou see look at that.\n\n454\n00:25:34.297 --> 00:25:36.377\n&gt;&gt; There you go plain text.\n\n455\n00:25:36.377 --> 00:25:37.267\n&gt;&gt; And plain text.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n456\n00:25:37.267 --> 00:25:38.620\n&gt;&gt; Until we don't wanna see-\n\n457\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.440\n&gt;&gt; Plain text on the passwords.\n\n458\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n459\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.630\nSo this is not something that you\nreally want to have happen to you ever.\n\n460\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.350\nSo you have to be very careful in\nunderstanding your configurations.\n\n461\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.050\nAs much as vlans help with security and\nsome benefits behind it, it also means you\n\n462\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:59.740\nalso have to make sure that you're\nsecuring your trunks, just as much.\n\n463\n00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.120\nIf not, you're gonna end up\nseeing stuff like this happen.\n\n464\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.250\nSo yes, there is no doubt that\nwe shouldn't never use telnet\n\n465\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.300\nin a lab environment,\nit's perfectly fine for\n\n466\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.230\nme to demonstrate while you don't\nwanna use it type of protocols.\n\n467\n00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.780\nCuz you can see where everything\nis coming in to do any of this.\n\n468\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.640\nSo the more traffic that there is and you\ncan see where actually it's doing a lot.\n\n469\n00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.520\nThere's some duplicate acknowledgements\nthat are going on, so I've got some\n\n470\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.990\ntraffic degradation that's happening\nacross this network for a bit of time.\n\n471\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.940\nSo, you're actually starting\nto see information like that.\n\n472\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.340\nAnd that's kind of key.\n\n473\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.930\nKnowing what can be monitored and\nwhat can't.\n\n474\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.130\nThis is the only weakness that we\nhave in terms of data visibility.\n\n475\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.600\nThat we have to really worry\nabout which are the trunk leaks,\n\n476\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.820\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n477\n00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.440\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nyou leave the physical security open,\n\n478\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.600\npeople can just plug right into those\nvlans and get whatever they want to.\n\n479\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Dress up as a pizza delivery person,\n[LAUGH] or an electrician,\n\n480\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.570\nsomeone coming to fix ceiling tiles,\nor whatever.\n\n481\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.260\n&gt;&gt; So but in this sense,\nvlans are very helpful, but\n\n482\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.780\nat the same time you still\nhave to worry about them.\n\n483\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.900\nSo don't let this be kind of\na weakness going no, I've got vlans,\n\n484\n00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.000\nI won't worry about it.\n\n485\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.222\nIf they have to communicate with\n\n486\n00:27:07.222 --> 00:27:07.797\neach other-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n487\n00:27:07.797 --> 00:27:08.359\njust be aware of those capabilities.\n\n488\n00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:09.622\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Through other devices.\n\n489\n00:27:09.622 --> 00:27:12.151\nYeah, you've got to actually worry\nabout that layer 3 connection.\n\n490\n00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:16.077\nMust of us are probably going to do this\ninside of the layer three switch anyway,\n\n491\n00:27:16.077 --> 00:27:18.780\nso we don't have to worry\nabout that too much.\n\n492\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.000\nBut it still means we have to\nworry about vulnerabilities,\n\n493\n00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.190\nand here is just an example of one.\n\n494\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.821\nSo make sure you understand that, in terms\nof the visibility on those trunk leaks.\n\n495\n00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:28.915\nAll data that flows across and\nthat's allowed to,\n\n496\n00:27:28.915 --> 00:27:31.409\nthat's what's going to happen and\nyou're going to see it.\n\n497\n00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:35.409\n&gt;&gt; Well, I appreciate you taking\nthe time to explain what vlans are and\n\n498\n00:27:35.409 --> 00:27:40.113\nthen actually showing us those associated\nrisks with the configuration and for\n\n499\n00:27:40.113 --> 00:27:43.698\nexample, what protocols not\nto use on our networks.\n\n500\n00:27:43.698 --> 00:27:46.750\nAnd so hopefully that helps you guys\nin your studies, don't go anywhere,\n\n501\n00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.400\nwe do have some more information\nheaded your way, but I\n\n502\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.020\nthink we are out of time for this episode,\nso we're gonna go ahead and wrap up.\n\n503\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.450\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n504\n00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n505\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.625\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITpro

00:00:17.800\nCherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.405\nIn this episode, we will be taking a look\nat describing ACL's access control list,\n\n7\n00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.932\nand how they apply to packet filtering.\n\n8\n00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:29.649\nWith us today, we have Ronnie Wong\nin studios, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.943\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:34.453\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back,\nas we continue to learn more and\n\n11\n00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:38.208\nmore about some of the basic concepts\nthat we really have to have on hand,\n\n12\n00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.570\nas we start preparing for\nthe world of cyber ops, right?\n\n13\n00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.690\nAnd the very fact is, of course,\nthese basic networking concepts, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.930\neven a little bit of the security that\nwe've been seen just recently, is really\n\n15\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.760\ngonna be foundational, especially when\nwe start talking about troubleshooting.\n\n16\n00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.460\nAnd of course, making sure that we\nunderstand what is normally applied.\n\n17\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.010\nSo, when we start dealing with devices,\nand there are going to be kind of the,\n\n18\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.840\nalong the physical path in\nwhich data tends to travel,\n\n19\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.790\nwe can implement the idea of some type\nof packet filtering that goes on.\n\n20\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.470\nAnd inside of the realm of Cisco,\nreally where it begins is what we call,\n\n21\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.936\nof course, ACLs or Access Control Lists\nis what we wanna talk about.\n\n22\n00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:23.383\n&gt;&gt; Now, that term access control list,\nit is just pretty generic,\n\n23\n00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.077\nor I should say it's kind\nof like an umbrella term,\n\n24\n00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:28.853\nyou can see ACLs applied\nto wireless access points.\n\n25\n00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:32.651\nWe can look at permissions,\nlike in NTFS permissions being utilized.\n\n26\n00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:36.561\nAnd an access control list is really\njust a list that controls access to\n\n27\n00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:38.420\na particular component.\n\n28\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.600\nSo, when we look at it from\na packet filtering side, and\n\n29\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.780\nbecause this is a Cisco\ncertification series,\n\n30\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.220\nI can only imagine that Cisco's gonna\nwant us to look at their equipment.\n\n31\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.660\nAnd so, I think we have a cool,\n\n32\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.850\ncouple of cool surprises as far as demos\ngo in store today, right, packets.\n\n33\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780\nRonnie, you're gonna show us how\nthose packets actually work?\n\n34\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.310\nHopefully, that's what\nwe're gonna end up doing.\n\n35\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.980\nIf everything works correctly,\nwe should do that.\n\n36\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.360\nBut as we begin, we wanna make sure that\nwe understand when we use, of course,\n\n37\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.130\nACLs and why we want to use ACLs,\nas well and the way that they go.\n\n38\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.696\nMost of the time, when you first\nstart entering into the realm\n\n39\n00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:18.569\nof just regular Cisco Security, one of the\nkey components in understanding about it\n\n40\n00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.949\nis going to be the idea of\ncreating an access control list.\n\n41\n00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.955\nWell, what in the world is\nan access control list?\n\n42\n00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:26.998\nJust like what Cherokee was talking about,\n\n43\n00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:32.010\nit is fairly similar to what you\nsee all across all of the network.\n\n44\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.550\nThe very fact that inside of Microsoft,\nyou can have access control lists, and\n\n45\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.680\nit really is about saying hey,\nwho can get access to what?\n\n46\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.780\nAnd who can't get access to what?\n\n47\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.000\nBut the way that we do it here for Cisco\nis that we're really not even concerned\n\n48\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.590\nabout access to individual files, as much\nas we are concerned about whether or\n\n49\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.660\nnot, and who, can gain access to what.\n\n50\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.890\nAnd so, at this point, we're really\ntaking look at the layer three\n\n51\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.740\nidea of actually saying here is\nwhere we want to stop the traffic,\n\n52\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.770\nor here is where we want to allow it.\n\n53\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.140\nHence the term packet filtering.\n\n54\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.370\nIf you remember way back early on in our\nseries, we talked about this in terms of\n\n55\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.470\nthe OSI model that it breaks down\ninto some different PDUs, right?\n\n56\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.870\nWhat's PDU stand for?\n\n57\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.870\n&gt;&gt; Protocol Data Unit.\n\n58\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Protocol Data Unit, see?\n\n59\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.520\nThat's a good term for us.\n\n60\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.552\nThe highest protocol data unit that\nwe tend to deal with, of course,\n\n61\n00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:28.974\nis that layer four,\nin which we call the idea of a segment.\n\n62\n00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:29.497\nRight, segment?\n\n63\n00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:30.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, segment.\n\n64\n00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:32.577\n&gt;&gt; And then, at layer three,\n\n65\n00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:34.270\nit is called a-\n&gt;&gt; Packet.\n\n66\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.200\n&gt;&gt; A packet.\n\n67\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.760\nLayer two, of course, is a-\n&gt;&gt; Frame.\n\n68\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Frame, yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.770\nSo, when it breaks down to that, and\nyou hear the term packet filtering, well,\n\n70\n00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.650\nthis should lead your mind into this\nis layer three protocol data unit, and\n\n71\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.920\nthat means that this is probably\ngonna be based on IP addresses.\n\n72\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.780\nAnd sometimes, you can do a little\nbit deeper than that, which is,\n\n73\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.160\nof course,\nthe idea of layer four information, too.\n\n74\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.283\nBut primarily, it really is about\nIP addressing and filtering,\n\n75\n00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:03.348\nbased off of well, a couple of\ndifferent conditions there, and\n\n76\n00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:05.582\nwe need to make sure\nthat we understand those.\n\n77\n00:04:05.582 --> 00:04:08.728\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, the reason you say\nlayer four is that because well,\n\n78\n00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.406\nif we look at our three basic\npackets filtering rules,\n\n79\n00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:13.753\nthat the most rudimentary\ntypes of firewalls.\n\n80\n00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:18.077\nWe've got blocking by IP address, we've\nalso got blocking by protocol type, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:22.462\nthen blocking by port numbers which, when\nwe spoke about the OS side model earlier,\n\n82\n00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:26.570\nwe know that, port numbers\nare associated with the session layer.\n\n83\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.440\nSo, is that where we're kind of looking\nat cropping up that OSI a little bit?\n\n84\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.790\nBur normally, if people will just\nreference them as starting at layer three.\n\n85\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's really where it begins, right,\n\n86\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.660\nis that we have to say,\nhere's a source and here's a destination.\n\n87\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.900\nAnd then we can be more specific.\n\n88\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.510\nIn other words, set additional conditions.\n\n89\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.260\nSo, not only do we say that we can connect\nthe IP, which is a layer three address for\n\n90\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.860\nus, and say, I want to filter this,\n\n91\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.220\nif they've got this IP address\nfrom getting access to here.\n\n92\n00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.600\nI can just filter by that one IP address,\nand\n\n93\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.640\nnot even worry about the idea\nof protocols or anything else.\n\n94\n00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.200\nBut if I wanted to be more specific than\nthat, we could even do something like that\n\n95\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.090\nwhere I say, this one IP address,\nI want it to be able to get there.\n\n96\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.800\nAnd on everything, they want to connect\nto, except for this one protocol.\n\n97\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.730\nA great example of that is a protocol that\nwe actually used in a couple episodes ago,\n\n98\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.180\nor maybe even last episode\nthat we had in our series,\n\n99\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.380\nwhere we talked about the use of tell net.\n\n100\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.610\nNow, we use Telnet on purpose, because we\nknow that the protocol itself is insecure.\n\n101\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.430\nBut at the same time, it's not that I\nwanna block IP address, it's just from\n\n102\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.610\naccessing networks, and maybe,\nthat I really only wanna block something\n\n103\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.590\nlike Telnet, especially from that one\nIP address, or multiple IP addresses.\n\n104\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.910\nWell, this allows us to\nset this up where we,\n\n105\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.590\nthe first initial condition is\ngonna be based on layer three.\n\n106\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.570\nSo, when you hear about the idea of packet\nfiltering at the beginning the primary\n\n107\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.370\ncondition, of course is,\nwhat is the source or destination?\n\n108\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.219\nSecondarily then, we base it on\nthe idea of port numbers, and\n\n109\n00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.324\nor, I'm gonna mix those\ntwo words together, and or\n\n110\n00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:10.077\nthe idea of protocols and\nport numbers, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:13.213\nSo, it's really key that we've\ngot to understand that something.\n\n112\n00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:20.328\nAt this point, we cannot just\nsay I want to block just Telnet.\n\n113\n00:06:20.328 --> 00:06:23.352\nSo, you can't create a packet\nfilter that says block Telnet, and\n\n114\n00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:25.192\nyou're probably saying, well, why?\n\n115\n00:06:25.192 --> 00:06:27.773\nWell, it's because I don't have what?\n\n116\n00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:30.438\nThat layer three information,\nbecause that begins at what,\n\n117\n00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:32.400\nlayer four information, at least.\n\n118\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.070\nAnd actually, Telnet's actually all\nthe way up there at layer seven.\n\n119\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.970\nSo, when we start with the idea, and\nyou hear that term packet filtering,\n\n120\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.380\nyou've got to remember,\nif I don't have this then I can't do that.\n\n121\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.850\nSo, it always have to begin at layer three\nwhen you start implementing the idea of\n\n122\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.000\npacket filtering.\n\n123\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.230\nSo, let's begin with that concept and\n\n124\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.210\nthat idea, of what it is that\nwe're actually trying to do.\n\n125\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.440\nWell, really, when it comes down to it,\nthe packet filter itself is gonna be on\n\n126\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.960\na per interface basis, as well,\nand that is also key for us.\n\n127\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.940\nSo, that means that as data\npacket arrives on an interface,\n\n128\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.240\nthere's really two directions to it,\nright?\n\n129\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.209\nIt can be entering into the interface,\nor it can be leaving the interface.\n\n130\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.070\nUsually, I'm gonna say usually, because\nit doesn't happen all the time, but\n\n131\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.940\nprimarily, most of us\nare really doing that.\n\n132\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.470\nWe're trying to block data from\ngetting into that interface,\n\n133\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.130\nrather than data from\nleaving an interface, per se.\n\n134\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.440\nBut you can set that up if you want to,\nas well.\n\n135\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.110\nSo, direction is always\ngonna be important.\n\n136\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.510\n&gt;&gt; And also Ronnie, isn't it true we have\nto go ahead and set our inbound rules and\n\n137\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.680\nour outbound rules, and we're gonna have\noptions in the syntax as parameters,\n\n138\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.850\nand sometimes, if you're reading a book,\nit might say ingrass for\n\n139\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.810\nthat inbound traffic, and\negress for outbound traffic.\n\n140\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see that a lot.\n\n141\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.249\nThe very fact is everybody\nuses different terminology.\n\n142\n00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:55.571\nSo, you do need to be\nfamiliar with those terms.\n\n143\n00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:59.311\nCisco, well, they kinda really\ntry to use the simplest terms.\n\n144\n00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.000\nWhich is where the engineers come in.\n\n145\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.969\nAll right,\nthey're not trying to describe something\n\n146\n00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:03.832\neloquently\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:08:03.832 --> 00:08:04.433\n&gt;&gt; Or more, or\n\n148\n00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:07.710\nwhat sounds syntactically\nbetter in this sentence here.\n\n149\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.345\nSo normally you hear that idea\nof ingress or egress, for\n\n150\n00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:12.824\nsomeone that is a writer for\nthese technical books.\n\n151\n00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:13.834\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha ok.\n\n152\n00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:17.892\n&gt;&gt; Where as if you're the actual engineer\nand program this stuff you go inbound,\n\n153\n00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:21.260\noutbound that makes more sense and\nmore easily done.\n\n154\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.020\nSo when we start to do this, I'm trying\nto make sure I remember where I am here,\n\n155\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.940\nis that we were talking about\nthe idea of IP addresses.\n\n156\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.910\nAnd of course, inbound and\noutbound traffic on the interface.\n\n157\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.480\nSo what can we actually do and\nwhy might we choose to do this?\n\n158\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.700\nSo let's say that what I have is that\nI want to make sure that I block\n\n159\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.530\nCherokee's computer from getting\naccess to a resource on my network.\n\n160\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.640\nWell, what type of block am I doing?\n\n161\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.500\nI can simply deny all traffic,\njust simply do so and say hey,\n\n162\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.070\nI want to block everything.\n\n163\n00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.947\nSo on that interface it takes a look at\nall the packets coming to that interface\n\n164\n00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:01.882\nand it doesn't matter\nwho the packet is from.\n\n165\n00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:05.647\nIt doesn't matter when it occurs,\ndoesn't matter how big the packet is,\n\n166\n00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:06.921\nhow small the packet is.\n\n167\n00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:12.260\nThe only thing that really matters at this\npoint if that's all I wanted to do is\n\n168\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.370\nwhat is in the layer three information\nbased on the source address that we see?\n\n169\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.810\nNow, when that happens, right we can\nhave them IP addresses constantly\n\n170\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.150\nhitting that interface, and\nthey can be allowed to come through.\n\n171\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.290\nBut then I can setup essentially a filter\nthat says when you see this IP address,\n\n172\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.820\nCherokee's computer,\nwhatever that might be,\n\n173\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.640\nand we're gonna do this one\nin a little bit of time here.\n\n174\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.470\nBut when you see this address,\ngo ahead and drop the packet, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.070\nIt doesn't matter if she's\nsending top secret information.\n\n176\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.870\nIt doesn't matter if she's sending recipe\nof the week or whatever it might be.\n\n177\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.670\n&gt;&gt; We don't want to hear from her.\n\n178\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.530\n&gt;&gt; We don't want to hear.\n\n179\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.950\nAnd we just simply drop the packet.\n\n180\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.680\nAnd that's not based on, and\nagain, the idea of content, right?\n\n181\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.650\nIt's just saying, on that IP address,\nlet's just drop that, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.389\n&gt;&gt; And that could be useful\nin situations such as,\n\n183\n00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:03.270\nsigning up black lists\nfrom security companies.\n\n184\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.997\nIf they see a lot of attacks generating\nfrom a particular IP address space.\n\n185\n00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:09.988\nThen you might wanna just say, look,\nspecially on like email servers,\n\n186\n00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:12.680\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nblock and be done with it.\n\n187\n00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it really does help, right,\n\n188\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.840\nthat as you start seeing\nthat where you go, alright.\n\n189\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.460\nI just don't want some types of\nconnections coming in from the outside,\n\n190\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.100\nyou might do that.\n\n191\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.450\nOr if it is something that is really\nspecific where it's from one particular IP\n\n192\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.810\naddress or it's actually a subnet of\nIP addresses, you can do that as well.\n\n193\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.250\nAnd so we can set up blocks\nto help us to do that.\n\n194\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.790\n&gt;&gt; They even have websites, like alien\nbolts that compile all these bad\n\n195\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.415\nIP addresses for people to go ahead and\ncheck on on the regular basis.\n\n196\n00:10:40.415 --> 00:10:43.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nnow there is a limitation behind this.\n\n197\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.180\nSo let's take a look.\n\n198\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.390\nLet's talk about something else,\ntoo, at the same time.\n\n199\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:46.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n200\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.472\nI could also take Cherokee's computer and\nsay,\n\n201\n00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:53.564\nI want her to be able to access everything\non my network, but this one machine.\n\n202\n00:10:53.564 --> 00:10:58.139\nWe could do that as well, where we can\nactually set up where it's based on\n\n203\n00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:03.330\nnot only the source IP address, but\nalso the destination IP address too.\n\n204\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.770\nSo I could set it up to deny Cherokees'\ncomputer from getting access to\n\n205\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:13.200\neither this one network entirely or\neven that one machine if I chose to.\n\n206\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.254\nSo not only can we do some type of access\ncontrol that is based on a source address,\n\n207\n00:11:19.254 --> 00:11:23.543\nwe can do it based on the source and\ndestination address.\n\n208\n00:11:23.543 --> 00:11:26.135\nAnd when you start\nimplementing with source and\n\n209\n00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:30.282\ndestination address This is when we\nstart adding in that second condition,\n\n210\n00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:33.640\nsuch as port number or\nprotocol that we add in there.\n\n211\n00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.120\nAnd it can actually be done in\nseveral different ways, but\n\n212\n00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.030\nwe're just kinda making sure that we\nunderstand at least the most basic and\n\n213\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.770\nmost common way that we do this.\n\n214\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.550\nSo, it really depends on what your need\nis at the moment if you choose to do\n\n215\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.510\nany of these.\n\n216\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.710\nAnd that's kinda the key when\nwe start to do this, okay.\n\n217\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.230\nNow there's also something else\nthat we can do, which is of course\n\n218\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:00.280\nset up multiple conditions even\nin one access control list.\n\n219\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.340\nAnd when you do so you'll see different\nsequences happening as well, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.530\nSo let's just go ahead and\ntake a look at an example of the reason\n\n221\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.800\nwhy we might do an access control list,\nand let me see if I can bring this up.\n\n222\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.470\nSo that we can show something else here.\n\n223\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.700\nSo here, we're gonna do this logically and\n\n224\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.350\nthen we're gonna show you\na demo of this in a moment.\n\n225\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.590\nAnd I've got several scenarios here on why\nwe might choose something like this so\n\n226\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.040\nthat we can understand what\nwe're doing here, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.660\nSo let's take a look at this network.\n\n228\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.120\nSo I take a look at the diagram here,\n\n229\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.280\nI notice I have a network over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n230\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.000\nI know that with the router in the middle\nthat means I'm also separated and\n\n231\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.760\nthere's a network over here on\nthe left-hand side as well.\n\n232\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.430\nSo I have different machines that\nare on that particular network.\n\n233\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:50.360\nWhat I may choose to do is I may choose\nto create an ACL to only allow for\n\n234\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.238\nthis one computer to access\nthe entire 46.0 network.\n\n235\n00:12:56.238 --> 00:12:56.790\nOkay.\n\n236\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.300\nSo I can do that.\n\n237\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.748\nSo that way everything else on\nthis entire 0.47.0 network,\n\n238\n00:13:03.748 --> 00:13:10.477\nalright, 10.0.47 network,\nis essentially going to be blocked, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:14.849\nSo we can do that, where we're\nsaying in this entire network only\n\n240\n00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:19.630\none computer can go across that\nrouter's interface and get access in.\n\n241\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.940\nSo the great thing is if you're\nin control of this network,\n\n242\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.730\nit means do you have to actually create\nan access control list to do so?\n\n243\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.890\nNow when you start doing that, you have to\npick what interface it's going to go on.\n\n244\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.540\nOkay?\n\n245\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.055\nSo if I know that I take a look at a\nquestion like what I'm seeing right here.\n\n246\n00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:41.763\nWell it says I only\nwant to allow 0.47.101,\n\n247\n00:13:41.763 --> 00:13:45.900\nokay, to access this 46 network.\n\n248\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.940\nNow any other networks available here,\nokay?\n\n249\n00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.960\nSo I don't see any other networks\nconnected to this router.\n\n250\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.000\nI can simply implement them what is\ncalled a standard access control list\n\n251\n00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.650\nwhich only looks at the source IP address.\n\n252\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.280\nSource layer three\naddress to help us out to\n\n253\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.760\nblock those IP hackers that come across.\n\n254\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.490\nSo when we take a look there is\ntwo things that have to be done\n\n255\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.950\nwhen we start setting\nup Access Control List.\n\n256\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.850\nThe first one is to create\nthe Access Control List itself.\n\n257\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.910\nWhen we start to take a look at the idea\nof that Access Control List here.\n\n258\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.373\nWell, what we do is we go into the router.\n\n259\n00:14:24.373 --> 00:14:26.850\nWe get into the global configuration mode.\n\n260\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.210\nAnd once I'm inside of that global\nconfiguration mode the way that the access\n\n261\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.950\ncontrol list is going to be configured\nis by doing, access-list, and\n\n262\n00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:42.100\nwe give it a number and\nthe standard one is from one through 99.\n\n263\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.410\nAnd then I tell it whether\nI want to permit or\n\n264\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:50.000\ndeny the entry of this list, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.140\nSo here it says this access control list\nis the one that permits data to go across.\n\n266\n00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.097\nThen I'm gonna use a well,\nkind of an alias is what this is.\n\n267\n00:15:02.097 --> 00:15:06.621\nI can use the word host to indicate\n\n268\n00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:11.002\na 32 bit subnet mask instead.\n\n269\n00:15:11.002 --> 00:15:14.880\nIt's 255.255.255.255 and\nthen just type in the IP address.\n\n270\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.910\nNow is there another way you could\nwrite that out if you wanted to.\n\n271\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.660\nYes, there is.\n\n272\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.270\nTechnically, let me see\nif I can do this here.\n\n273\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.290\nThe other way to write this out\nis just a little bit longer.\n\n274\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.594\nOops, let me see if I can stretch\nthis out so we can see it.\n\n275\n00:15:33.594 --> 00:15:36.148\nIf I chose not to use\nthe keyword host here.\n\n276\n00:15:39.343 --> 00:15:40.750\nWe'd have to do it this way.\n\n277\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.660\nOkay.\n\n278\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.256\nNow you might say, Rodney,\ndidn't you just say 255.255.255.255?\n\n279\n00:15:47.256 --> 00:15:48.340\nWell, yes I did.\n\n280\n00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.541\nCuz that is gonna be\nthe real true subnet mask.\n\n281\n00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:53.417\nBut an access control list,\n\n282\n00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:57.024\nyou have to use what is called\na wild card mask instead.\n\n283\n00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:00.655\nIt wasn't a subnet mask all the ones\nrepresent the network portion.\n\n284\n00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:05.584\nWell in the wildcard mask it's actually\nall zeros represent the network portion.\n\n285\n00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:07.965\nThe portions that we\nwant to pay attention to,\n\n286\n00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:10.620\nthe bits that we wanna pay attention to.\n\n287\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.145\nSo both of these are possible\nconfigurations here that will bring you\n\n288\n00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:18.197\nthe same result as what\nwe're talking about.\n\n289\n00:16:18.197 --> 00:16:22.650\nSo for me using the word host\nmeans a lot less typing.\n\n290\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.653\nAnd a lot less having to remember subnet\nmask, or not subnet mask, wildcard masks.\n\n291\n00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.320\nAnd usually that's a little bit tricky.\n\n292\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.280\nMake sure you catch up on that\nbefore you go on for the exam.\n\n293\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.871\nMore than likely with\na security type exam,\n\n294\n00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:39.102\nI would expect to see an access\ncontrol list question.\n\n295\n00:16:39.102 --> 00:16:40.881\nI can't tell you how many.\n\n296\n00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:44.380\nBut overall, though, I would expect,\nI need to have this down.\n\n297\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.870\nSo if you don't have this down yet,\nmake sure you go back and bone up.\n\n298\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.690\nTake a look at the CCNA routing and\nswitching, take a look at the idea,\n\n299\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.040\nof course, of the CCENT.\n\n300\n00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.353\nThat will also help you out, too.\n\n301\n00:16:55.353 --> 00:17:00.263\nAll right,\nnow once we've got that list in there.\n\n302\n00:17:00.263 --> 00:17:06.080\nAt the end of every single access\ncontrol list that you create,\n\n303\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.486\nthere's also an implicit but\nhidden deny any.\n\n304\n00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:14.552\nAnd what that means is that at\nthe end of everything that we see here\n\n305\n00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:23.451\nYou don't have to watch me\nmangle my own typing here.\n\n306\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.896\nSo this one is hidden.\n\n307\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:38.060\nWhat you'll end up seeing is\nwhat's called a deny any.\n\n308\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.880\nOkay, so in this particular list\nthere's actually one entry which\n\n309\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.940\nsays to permit the host here.\n\n310\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.420\nBut then everything else is denied.\n\n311\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.408\nSo that's how I can limit only the access\nto that one single IP address.\n\n312\n00:17:57.408 --> 00:18:01.260\nAnd it should work out for us if I've\nactually got everything correct, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.660\nNow at this point I've also got to pay\nattention to well, a couple of things.\n\n314\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.070\nNow I'm using a lab that I\nset up a little bit earlier.\n\n315\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.650\nSo I'm also having to pay\nattention to the interface.\n\n316\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:13.290\nAnd that's key.\n\n317\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.450\nRemember that,\nthere's always two components to this.\n\n318\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.410\nWhich of course is the idea of,\nI'm not only creating the access list but\n\n319\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.590\nalso applying it to an interface.\n\n320\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:26.300\nOn this one here, I believe it needs\nto actually be a .20 as we do this.\n\n321\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.420\nWe're actually gonna take\na look at the interface here.\n\n322\n00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.608\nAnd we get into that interface and\n\n323\n00:18:30.608 --> 00:18:35.153\nthis is how we apply an access\ncontrol list to that interface itself.\n\n324\n00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:35.752\n&gt;&gt; And so Ronnie,\n\n325\n00:18:35.752 --> 00:18:38.811\nwhen you say interface that arrow that\nyou have on that diagram right up there.\n\n326\n00:18:38.811 --> 00:18:41.253\nThat's pointing to the .20 interface?\n\n327\n00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:44.102\n&gt;&gt; Yep, 0.0.20 which is a subinterface,\n\n328\n00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:47.420\ncuz we did a router on\nthe stick configuration.\n\n329\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.300\nBut it's actually pointing\nto that interface.\n\n330\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.710\nSo that is where this particular access\nlist is gonna end up getting applied.\n\n331\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.420\nAnd that is key for\nus to be able to do this.\n\n332\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.445\nSo if everything is configured correctly,\nthat's what we need now.\n\n333\n00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:02.898\nThe only thing I need to find out\nfrom Cherokee before we begin is.\n\n334\n00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:06.180\nWhat is the actual IP address\non your network adapter?\n\n335\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.991\n&gt;&gt; On my machine?\n\n336\n00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.097\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so my machine,\n\n337\n00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:12.572\ncurrently I'm 10.0.47.112.\n\n338\n00:19:12.572 --> 00:19:19.385\n&gt;&gt; .112, so I'm gonna change this\nhere to match the demo, hopefully.\n\n339\n00:19:19.385 --> 00:19:20.794\nThat I'm gonna do correctly,\n\n340\n00:19:20.794 --> 00:19:24.470\nif I can actually make my fingers\nwork the way that I want to.\n\n341\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.600\nSo that's pretty much the key is we're\ngoing to do this one here, and to try and\n\n342\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.530\nhelp us out.\n\n343\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.830\nNow I have a machine over on the other\nside which I believe is correct,\n\n344\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.065\nwhich is a 46.103 right now.\n\n345\n00:19:36.065 --> 00:19:40.010\nAnd everything should be good and\noperational and going.\n\n346\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.944\nSo we don't have Cherokee's computer,\nwe might have it plugged in.\n\n347\n00:19:43.944 --> 00:19:47.819\nCan you ping that 10.0.46.103?\n\n348\n00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.197\nAnd let's verify that you\ncan get through there.\n\n349\n00:19:50.197 --> 00:19:52.324\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n350\n00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.896\nAnd we'll try to ping this device.\n\n351\n00:19:53.896 --> 00:19:56.897\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n352\n00:19:56.897 --> 00:20:01.575\nping 10.0.46.103.\n\n353\n00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.397\nAnd we were able to go ahead and\nreceive a reply.\n\n354\n00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:06.663\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthat's actually great so far, right?\n\n355\n00:20:06.663 --> 00:20:11.580\nI haven't applied any access\ncontrol list yet on the router.\n\n356\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.819\nMy machine is on the same network\nthat Cherokee's machine is on.\n\n357\n00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:19.300\nBut I also have another thing\nthat's running on my machine,\n\n358\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.460\nwhich is a virtual machine,\nthat is on that 46.103, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.361\nSo, Cherokee, essentially what's happening\non her computer is going out her network\n\n360\n00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:27.952\ninterface.\n\n361\n00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:30.729\nGoing into a switch which is on VLAN 20.\n\n362\n00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.327\nI think that's correct here.\n\n363\n00:20:32.327 --> 00:20:34.495\nAnd then it's going up to the router.\n\n364\n00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:37.900\nDoing that router on a stick thing,\n[LAUGH] coming out on that same interface.\n\n365\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.450\nGoing into another\ninterface on the switch.\n\n366\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.320\nAnd then connecting here inside\nthe VLAN on my machines.\n\n367\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.100\nSo hopefully that's the path\nthat everything has taken.\n\n368\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.410\nIf it is, well I should then\nbe able to go to the router,\n\n369\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.190\nlet me see if I can find the router here.\n\n370\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.340\nWhere did I put the router?\n\n371\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.250\nThat's what I have to find.\n\n372\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.080\nLet me see if I can find the router.\n\n373\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.130\nOops, wrong one.\n\n374\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.958\nThere we go.\n\n375\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.346\nI knew I'd find it sooner or later.\n\n376\n00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.106\nIt's on my computer somewhere.\n\n377\n00:21:06.106 --> 00:21:10.324\nSo here's me consoled\ndirectly into router 1.\n\n378\n00:21:10.324 --> 00:21:14.700\nAnd on router 1, show access-list,\n\n379\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.612\nnotice I don't have any access lists here.\n\n380\n00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:24.740\nI am gonna make sure\nthat I can ping 0.47.112.\n\n381\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.700\nNotice I give five pings so I know that\nthe router can see Cherokee's computer.\n\n382\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.191\nCherokee's computer can see the router and\nthat's great too.\n\n383\n00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:33.130\nThat's what we want.\n\n384\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.990\nBut now we're gonna create\nthis access control list.\n\n385\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.440\nSo I can get inside\nthe global configuration.\n\n386\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.370\nThen I am going to always\ndo a two stem method.\n\n387\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.190\nOther people do this differently.\n\n388\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.190\nI always do it this way.\n\n389\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.010\nI create the access list first\nthen I apply it to the interface.\n\n390\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.646\nI don't wanna say I always do it right.\n\n391\n00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:52.412\nBut I always try to do that\nis what I wanna do here.\n\n392\n00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:58.101\nSo here, the way that we do it is\nwe start typing in access-list.\n\n393\n00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:02.837\nRemember that this is gonna be, well,\n1 through 99 is what we have here.\n\n394\n00:22:02.837 --> 00:22:04.128\nSo here it is.\n\n395\n00:22:04.128 --> 00:22:06.866\nI'm just gonna pick access list one.\n\n396\n00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:09.562\nThen it's gonna be a permit.\n\n397\n00:22:09.562 --> 00:22:11.493\nI do not have to enter in anything else.\n\n398\n00:22:11.493 --> 00:22:15.610\nBecause on a standard access control\nlist it's only looking at the source IP\n\n399\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.850\naddress.\n\n400\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:22.869\nThis should be host,\nwhich is at one computer,\n\n401\n00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:26.186\n0.47.112 here.\n\n402\n00:22:26.186 --> 00:22:28.747\nAnd now,\nI'm simply going to mark a log here.\n\n403\n00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:32.448\nNow, you don't have to do log, and\nactually matching based on this,\n\n404\n00:22:32.448 --> 00:22:33.970\nespecially a permit.\n\n405\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.340\nThat could really overrun\nyour router very quickly.\n\n406\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.890\nI know that there's only one machine.\n\n407\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.740\nSo I'm not so\nworried about it at this point.\n\n408\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:46.847\nRight, now, the other thing I'm\ngoing to do, is just do a deny any.\n\n409\n00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:48.630\nNow, that's already in there.\n\n410\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.658\nBut for me to be able to see it I'm\ngonna also type in this word log, and\n\n411\n00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.058\nactually spell it out.\n\n412\n00:22:54.058 --> 00:22:57.040\nAnd that way it will tell me whether or\nnot it's been denied or not too.\n\n413\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.219\nOkay, so that's what we'll see there.\n\n414\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.880\nNow, at this point, Cherokee,\njust see if you can ping that thing again,\n\n415\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.980\njust very quickly.\n\n416\n00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n417\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.530\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you can still\nget through there, Cherokee.\n\n418\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.052\n&gt;&gt; What happened?\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n419\n00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:13.117\nI just created that access control list.\n\n420\n00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:14.741\nWell, you gotta remember, right?\n\n421\n00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.989\nI said that there's really\na two step method to this, and\n\n422\n00:23:17.989 --> 00:23:20.840\nthat's what we also have to remember.\n\n423\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.190\nIs that I forgot that second part.\n\n424\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.840\nEven though I just told you,\ndon't forget that second part.\n\n425\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.660\n&gt;&gt; To apply it to the interface.\n\n426\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.340\n&gt;&gt; To apply it to the interface.\n\n427\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.850\nSo when we start to take\na look then at doing this,\n\n428\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.880\nwe have to do that next part as well.\n\n429\n00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.738\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go to the interface\n\n430\n00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:39.020\ng0/0.20 here, and\nI'm gonna stop this interface right now.\n\n431\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.190\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n432\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.610\nBut I am just going to stop it\nby issuing a shut down command.\n\n433\n00:23:45.015 --> 00:23:48.140\nCuz I wanna see the if this\nreally blocks it at the end.\n\n434\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.677\nI know the shutdown will block it,\n\n435\n00:23:49.677 --> 00:23:51.797\nguaranteed it's gonna\nblock the connection.\n\n436\n00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.939\nBut I now want to apply\n\n437\n00:23:57.782 --> 00:24:04.190\naccess-group And still the same,\naccess list here.\n\n438\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.491\n&gt;&gt; Number one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for one reason or another.\n\n439\n00:24:05.491 --> 00:24:10.774\nWhen you actually plan the physical\ninterfaces, it's called access-group,\n\n440\n00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:15.277\nbut if you were to try and apply this\nto your Telnet lines or SSH lines,\n\n441\n00:24:15.277 --> 00:24:18.009\nyou'd actually type in access-class.\n\n442\n00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:20.440\nI don't know why, but\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n443\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n444\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.470\n&gt;&gt; So, not that you have to know that, but\n\n445\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:26.630\nit's just something that's always on my\nmind when I start typing this stuff in.\n\n446\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.800\nThen, I have to choose the direction, so\n\n447\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.780\nis it actually coming into\nthe interface or going out?\n\n448\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.470\nWell, if Cherokee's computer is\nplugged into that interface which is-\n\n449\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm trying to connect to it.\n\n450\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n451\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.390\n&gt;&gt; So, that means inbound.\n\n452\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.710\nAll right,\nthis is where we always then verify.\n\n453\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.720\nOops, I did something I shouldn't\nhave done, which is I need to go and\n\n454\n00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.860\nmake sure that interface\nis no longer shut down.\n\n455\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.729\nNow, if I type in a do show access,\noops, I'm starting to see stuff.\n\n456\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:04.150\nTried again, do show access-list,\n\n457\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.950\nso it will show me that right now\nit's already seeing something.\n\n458\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.900\nThat at least nine matches here is\nactually permitting it to go through, and\n\n459\n00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.680\nthen anything else is actually\nshut down Go ahead and\n\n460\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.250\nsee if you can do this instead this time,\nokay?\n\n461\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.980\nOpen up a Web browser and\nsee if you can connect to that address.\n\n462\n00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.520\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n463\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.250\n&gt;&gt; So on Cherokee's computer here.\n\n464\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.094\n&gt;&gt; I'll go ahead and\npull up Safari on my computer,\n\n465\n00:25:30.094 --> 00:25:35.183\nand that was going to be 10.0.43.103.\n\n466\n00:25:35.183 --> 00:25:38.168\nOops, it would help if I\nhad my IP address, 10.0.46.\n\n467\n00:25:38.168 --> 00:25:41.526\n&gt;&gt; Six, yep.\n\n468\n00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:45.017\n&gt;&gt; 46.103, all right.\n\n469\n00:25:45.017 --> 00:25:49.367\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here's just a basic\nwebpage I created on that server,\n\n470\n00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:50.570\nthat's all I did.\n\n471\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.510\nI just set it up as just\na simple Web server so\n\n472\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.130\nCherokee can connect in,\nthat's exactly what I wanted.\n\n473\n00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.780\nLet's take a look at my computer and\nshow you the result here.\n\n474\n00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.230\nJust a moment, okay?\n\n475\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.450\nIf I hit that, do show access list again,\nyou can now see where her's jumped up,\n\n476\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.490\nand it really is specifically matched\nto her IP address right there.\n\n477\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n478\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that looks like it worked.\n\n479\n00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.100\nNow, let's prove that this is\nactually working this way.\n\n480\n00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.240\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna block me, aren't you?\n\n481\n00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna block you, but\nwe're gonna try it differently, right?\n\n482\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.440\nCherokee, I'm gonna have you,\n\n483\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.020\nsince I had you manually assign that\naddress, let's just change your IP\n\n484\n00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.960\naddress on your interface-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n485\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.516\n&gt;&gt; To a different IP address.\n\n486\n00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:29.233\nLet's do .115,\n\n487\n00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:33.420\nand let's see if we actually get any\ndenies that end up matching here.\n\n488\n00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.490\nSo, Cherokee's simply going into their Web\ninterface there, and now at this point,\n\n489\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.419\nshe's just going to verify that\nher IP address has changed.\n\n490\n00:26:41.419 --> 00:26:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Yep, .115.\n\n491\n00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, so .115.\n\n492\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.380\nRemember that we don't take a look\nat any of these protocols here\n\n493\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.120\nas far as whether it's the web protocol or\nanything.\n\n494\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.060\nLet's try this again.\n\n495\n00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to go under Safari and\nclear my history so\n\n496\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.780\nthat it's not anything lingering.\n\n497\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.190\nI wanna start fresh here.\n\n498\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.618\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nrelaunch that.\n\n499\n00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:03.400\n&gt;&gt; So she just cleared out her browser\nhistory and that's perfectly fine and\n\n500\n00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.880\nhopefully let's see what happens here.\n\n501\n00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.826\nIf she can't get connected\nthen I've done something wrong\n\n502\n00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] dot one zero three\n\n503\n00:27:09.223 --> 00:27:12.544\n&gt;&gt; and notice that\n\n504\n00:27:12.544 --> 00:27:13.426\n&gt;&gt; Safari cannot connect.\n\n505\n00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n506\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.250\nHer result is she can't connect.\n\n507\n00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.330\nSo this proves to you at least\na very basic concept We can block,\n\n508\n00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.260\nbased on an IP address and make it so\nspecific that it can be one but\n\n509\n00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.110\nyou can turn this around and\nmake the entire network.\n\n510\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.460\nLet's take a look at nine once again,\nfor the end result here too.\n\n511\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.670\nNow notice that it says look.\n\n512\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.370\nI actually at that time got a lot\nmore matches which is at 204.\n\n513\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.910\nThat's just from our last\ntime connecting in and\n\n514\n00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.760\nall this staff I had to go across\nthere Where as before on 112 notice\n\n515\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.770\nthat that number is no\nlonger kind of jumping up.\n\n516\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.770\nI'm getting a ton of different of stuff\nthat is happening across here and\n\n517\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.370\nthat's because there's a lot of other\nconfigurations that are happening and\n\n518\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.800\nit's getting denied as well.\n\n519\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.450\nAnd you can see this where\nit says list 1 is denied.\n\n520\n00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.600\nYou know this completely all\nacross the entire network on\n\n521\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.360\neverything that it was\ntrying to go through.\n\n522\n00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.350\nAnd here's kinda the telling one.\n\n523\n00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.770\nWhich is the one that\nshe just tried to do.\n\n524\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.180\nWhich just says hey,\nthe List 1 denied 115,\n\n525\n00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.830\nwhich is what I had you change\nit to that for 10.0.46.103.\n\n526\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:23.100\nSo that is just a basic example of\njust using, just the source address.\n\n527\n00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.380\nBut we still need to take a look at\na couple of more examples, but Cherokee,\n\n528\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.730\nI've run out of time I believe.\n\n529\n00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:33.650\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, we can go ahead and\ncontinue our shows here with a part two.\n\n530\n00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.190\nSo that's what we've been\ndoing as we go along.\n\n531\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.690\nNot a problem at all, Ronnie.\n\n532\n00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.530\nSo go ahead and stay tuned,\nbecause like Ronnie said,\n\n533\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.730\nwe do have a lot more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n534\n00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.540\nBut we did wanna have time for\nthis episode so stay tuned.\n\n535\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.050\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n536\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.820\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n537\n00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n538\n00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.012\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n539\n00:28:53.012 --> 00:28:57.125\n[MUSIC]\nThank you for\n\n540\n00:28:57.125 --> 00:29:03.409\nwatching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:16.908\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:19.431\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.737\nIn the last episode,\nwe were looking at ACLs, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:25.510\nhow they apply to different interfaces.\n\n7\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.690\nWe'd looked at the great demo,\nthank you for that, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.590\nAnd now we will be continuing\nwith some demos and well, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.370\nRonnie Wong is back in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.938\nSo thank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:39.651\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here as\nwe continue on taking a look a little bit\n\n12\n00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:43.378\nmore about some of the ACLs that we also\nhave to make sure that we understand.\n\n13\n00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:46.298\nAnd we really did we just\ntook a look at the idea of\n\n14\n00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:51.124\nstandardize ACLs where it allows us to\nblock, based on the source IP address.\n\n15\n00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:55.345\nACLs are all about the idea of packet\nfiltering, which is gonna be, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.050\nlayer three address.\n\n17\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.570\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you did talk about that\nparticular packet filtering, but you also\n\n18\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.270\nmentioned extending filtering, so what are\nwe going to be looking at in this show?\n\n19\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we started to take a look\nthen, not only do we have, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.510\nstandard ACLs that we can do,\nwe can also do extended.\n\n21\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.260\nThere's a whole list of different\ntypes of ACLs that are out there, but\n\n22\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.770\nwe're really just gonna\nfocus on these two.\n\n23\n00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.350\nWhich is, of course, gonna be the basic,\nor the standard, and the extended ones.\n\n24\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.770\nThere's reflexive, there's Time-Based,\nthere's so many different ones out there.\n\n25\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.010\nBut for us, we're gonna take a look\nat this idea of extended, and\n\n26\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.080\nwe might be wondering, well,\nwhat is the difference?\n\n27\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.660\nWhen you talk about basic,\nI keep saying basic,\n\n28\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.890\nstandard access control lists,\nit's only based on the source IP address.\n\n29\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.190\nIt doesn't take a look at anything else,\nand I mentioned this in the last episode.\n\n30\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.220\nIt's not looking at the amount of content,\n\n31\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.040\nit's not looking at\nthe importance of the content.\n\n32\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.020\nIt's not looking at anything,\nexcept for that IP address.\n\n33\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.840\nWith the idea of extended\naccess control list though,\n\n34\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.930\nit gives us the ability now to not only\ntake a look at the source IP address, but\n\n35\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.730\nalso the destination IP address.\n\n36\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.590\nAnd even add in another condition,\nbased on both of those,\n\n37\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.910\nif we wanted to as well, and that's the\none that we're really going to be using.\n\n38\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820\nMore often than not,\n\n39\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.730\nespecially in the needs of being very\nspecific in what we want to accomplish.\n\n40\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.360\n&gt;&gt; So, in that last demonstration,\nyou are able to make some settings and\n\n41\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.130\nblock a particular IP address.\n\n42\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.160\nWhat was that originally we were at 112,\nand we blocked it, and I switched to 115.\n\n43\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.520\nNow, what you're saying is in addition to\nthe IP address, we can add an additional\n\n44\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.830\nparameter, and make it even more\nspecific for that particular block rule.\n\n45\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.260\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n46\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.190\nThe way that we can do this, of course,\n\n47\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.800\nis by kinda taking a look at\na scenario that we might wanna choose.\n\n48\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.640\nAnd I had mentioned the idea of,\nwell, using Telnet before.\n\n49\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.010\nAnd we have done this now\nacross a couple of episodes.\n\n50\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.790\nWell, we're gonna use it at least\none more time to help us out.\n\n51\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.260\nSo, let's take a look at my\nscreen as we get started here\n\n52\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.540\nto kind of give us a scenario.\n\n53\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.210\nNow, let's say that we realize something,\nwe all have now for years and\n\n54\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.720\nyears, that Telnet access is bad, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.930\nIt's not something we want to do\nused on a production network at all.\n\n56\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.040\nInside of a lab environment, go hog wild.\n\n57\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.100\nMake sure you use it so\nthat you can understand what's going on.\n\n58\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.410\nBut overall though, in a production\nenvironment it should never be used.\n\n59\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.140\nEven if you go,\nI know everybody on my network,\n\n60\n00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.620\nyou probably don't want to do that,\ncuz that implements a bad habit.\n\n61\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.400\nBut sometimes, you may find out that you\nstill have Telnet on your network, because\n\n62\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.250\nyou might have older devices that don't\naccept anything, but a Telnet connection.\n\n63\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.390\nBut at the same time, if you can\nget away from it, of course do it.\n\n64\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.850\nSo, let's say that what we have\nhere is a situation like this,\n\n65\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.110\nis that we realize that people\nhave been connecting in across to,\n\n66\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.500\nlet's say some network\ninfrastructure devices.\n\n67\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.341\nUsing Telnet,\n\n68\n00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.930\nregardless of what we've told them,\n&gt;&gt; You caught me.\n\n69\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.463\n&gt;&gt; Time and time and time again.\n\n70\n00:03:56.463 --> 00:03:58.749\nYep, that they should use SSH,\n\n71\n00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:04.490\nthey still decided that they wanted\nto use, of course, telnet instead.\n\n72\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.960\nThe reason why,\npeople use what they grow up with.\n\n73\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.400\nIt's standard, it works,\nit does everything that we need to.\n\n74\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.270\nI'm not on it long enough, so\nthat anybody really matters.\n\n75\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.480\nWhat we showed you in a previous\nepisode that using Telnet,\n\n76\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.930\nit says everything in clear text or plain\ntext, and that includes even passwords.\n\n77\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.130\nSo, it's never a good idea\nif you're doing this.\n\n78\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.270\nOne of the things we can do\nthen is that we can actually do\n\n79\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.230\nexactly what this thing is saying.\n\n80\n00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.110\nNow, I had mentioned\nin a previous episode,\n\n81\n00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.450\nI said you can't just block Telnet.\n\n82\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.590\nAnd here you're reading this and\ngoing, Ronnie, you're blocking.\n\n83\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.970\nThat's exactly what you said you can't do.\n\n84\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.860\nBut notice what I actually put here, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.560\nWhich is also what a layer\nthree address here, but\n\n86\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.300\nthis says two, this entire network, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.510\nSo, this gives me\na destination IP address.\n\n88\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.520\nBut it also means that I need\na source IP address as well,\n\n89\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.410\nif we're going to do this.\n\n90\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.400\nSo, this is where we can build an access\ncontrollers that will help us to do this.\n\n91\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.230\nNow, when you start to\ndo something like this,\n\n92\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.380\nyou have to take a little bit of\ntime if you're not familiar with it.\n\n93\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.530\nAnd my recommendation is once you\nlearn the syntax, type it out,\n\n94\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.470\nor write it out on a sheet of paper.\n\n95\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.300\nI know that that sounds silly,\nit sounds slow.\n\n96\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.660\nBut I guarantee you something that\nthis is going to help you out\n\n97\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.560\nmore than anything else, when you\nstart to try and implement it quicker.\n\n98\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.930\nI know that as a certified CISCO\ninstructor in authorized training for\n\n99\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.330\nalmost a decade now, right, heck,\nyeah, right at about a decade now.\n\n100\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.660\nFor being an instructor like that,\n\n101\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.490\nin some of the things that we've had to\ndo, and even in real practice of things,\n\n102\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.430\nthere's a lot of access control\nlists that you have to write.\n\n103\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.070\nAnd it's very easy to get the logic wrong,\nif you don't write it up.\n\n104\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.040\nSo, I've always as, when I had a Windows\ncomputer, is I've taken notepad and\n\n105\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.500\nsuch, you just typed it up,\n\n106\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.020\nto make sure that I follow the logic\nthrough in what was going to happen.\n\n107\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.550\nBy following the logic through, and\n\n108\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.560\nnow, you have it typed out somewhere,\nif something doesn't work on the router,\n\n109\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.430\nyou don't have to go back in and\ntry and figure it out from there.\n\n110\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.250\nYou can simply type, let me see if I still\nhave, I didn't, I closed it out here.\n\n111\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.940\nWhat I can do now inside of my MacBook,\n\n112\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.950\ncuz it's really been relatively recently\nthat I switched over to a MacBook.\n\n113\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.740\nI said,\nthat's kind of been a couple of years now.\n\n114\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.870\nBut it's easy to text on text edit and\ndo the same thing.\n\n115\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.490\nSo from here, I know on the configuration\nI can just start typing in certain things.\n\n116\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.990\nSo, as I'm going to the router,\nI might know I need enable, and\n\n117\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.810\na config t to get me into\nglobal configuration.\n\n118\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.050\nBut then when I wanna configure\nthat access control list,\n\n119\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.540\nI know it's going to be access-list.\n\n120\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.130\nAnd I know that I need well, something\nabove a 99, so I'm just going to do 101.\n\n121\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.280\nNow, once I have that,\nI'm gonna copy this syntax, so\n\n122\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.620\nI make sure that I don't\ndo that's wrong here.\n\n123\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.970\nI now need to decide\nwhether I'm permitting or\n\n124\n00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.540\ndenying traffic, so I know I need to deny.\n\n125\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.740\nThis is where it becomes\ntricky after this point.\n\n126\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.460\nBecause then, you have to\nactually decide on the protocol.\n\n127\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.500\nSo, just like I told you here,\nblock Telnet.\n\n128\n00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.140\nSo, on this one,\nTelnet is a tcp on layer four, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.637\nSo I want to block Telnet, and\nnow I need a source and destination, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:38.675\nNow here, you can actually\nhave a couple of examples.\n\n131\n00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:45.776\nIf I wanted to,\nI can actually do on 10.0.46.0.\n\n132\n00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:52.388\nAnd if I do this, I have to\nremember to use the wildcard mask.\n\n133\n00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:58.140\nFrom that point on, I can also say,\nhey, I want it to go to 47.0.\n\n134\n00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.305\nAnd once again, that wildcard mask.\n\n135\n00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.686\nHere, now,\nthe other thing that I have is at\n\n136\n00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:11.688\nthe end here you see this word equal,\nor eq.\n\n137\n00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:14.970\nWhich is short for equal, and then 23.\n\n138\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.773\nSo, I'm just gonna stop right here,\nso that we can work through the logic\n\n139\n00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:19.550\ntogether, and\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n140\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.790\nI could've pointed it out\non the simple diagram.\n\n141\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.810\nBut this is literally what I do\nwhen I create access control lists,\n\n142\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.880\nbecause it is going to be helpful, and\n\n143\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.250\nI'll show you here in just a moment\non why this will be helpful.\n\n144\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.620\nSo, when I actually want to\ncreate something like this and\n\n145\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.360\ngo all right, is this what I want to do?\n\n146\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.920\nI want to deny telnet, here it is\nequal to 23, so what are we doing?\n\n147\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.185\nWell, right here I'm saying\nthe 46 network, altogether.\n\n148\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.600\nAnd because I did not\nlist a port number or\n\n149\n00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.830\na protocol right here, I'm saying don't\nworry about what the source port is, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.080\nBut what are they trying to connect to?\n\n151\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.600\nSomewhere in the 47 network, and the\ndestination port number's gonna be what?\n\n152\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.590\n23, which is gonna be telnet.\n\n153\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.060\nSo, it's here that you have\nto follow that logic through.\n\n154\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.150\nIf you don't, it's gonna be really bad.\n\n155\n00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.280\nThe other thing that you\nmay also have to consider,\n\n156\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.790\njust like I did here,\nis I might need that permit any, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.820\nSo here, when we start to take a look\nat this one, is access-list 101,\n\n158\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.760\noops, yep, I do need a space there.\n\n159\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.830\nAnd this one is gonna be a permit,\nremember, we need a protocol.\n\n160\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.120\nNow, I can permit only TCP,\nbut if I do so,\n\n161\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.160\nthere's an implicit deny all\nat the end of all this, right?\n\n162\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.460\nSo, there's a hidden deny all.\n\n163\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.220\nSo, that means UDP traffic is not\ngonna be permitted, nor anything else.\n\n164\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.160\nSo, instead,\n\n165\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.510\nif I want to permit everything,\nI use the protocol called IP instead.\n\n166\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.730\nAnd that will allow us to do that as well.\n\n167\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.470\nAnd here, I need to permit\nany going to any destination.\n\n168\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.250\nSo, even though I only wrote it one time,\nthere's any, here,\n\n169\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.100\nI think I also need to add in an any here.\n\n170\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.320\nI don't wanna throw anybody off.\n\n171\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.530\nMake sure I don't do that.\n\n172\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.440\nSo now, this actually says, look, you're\nessentially saying what, on the 46th\n\n173\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.800\nnetwork, if you're on the 46th block that\nfrom going in if you're using telnet.\n\n174\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.590\nBut allow for everything else to go\nthrough, if you choose to use SSH,\n\n175\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.610\nor something else like that instead.\n\n176\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.260\nSo that is the rule that we want\nto set in there as we get started.\n\n177\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.030\nThe other thing, of course,\n\n178\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.949\nis to make sure we apply it to the-\n&gt;&gt; The interface.\n\n179\n00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:35.950\n&gt;&gt; Interface that we need.\n\n180\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.030\nSo, since I know that I'm going\nto be on that 46 network, and\n\n181\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:46.510\nthat's going to be a dot, actually, I am\neven on the wrong sub interface there.\n\n182\n00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.892\nSo, this is where I would go into,\n\n183\n00:10:53.892 --> 00:10:58.869\ninterface g0/0.10, and now that I\n\n184\n00:10:58.869 --> 00:11:03.859\nam on there it would be IP access-group.\n\n185\n00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:10.408\nThis time, IP access-group and then 101.\n\n186\n00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:13.130\nAnd this is gonna be inbound, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.980\nSo, the reason why this helps you out is,\n\n188\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.510\nI'll show you right here\nwhy it's very good.\n\n189\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.320\nIf you can say, all right,\nI know this is a good list,\n\n190\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.250\nyou think syntactically\neverything is good.\n\n191\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.140\nYou don't have to type it\nout again on the router.\n\n192\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:35.616\nI know this is funny, but I can simply\njust take this information and copy it.\n\n193\n00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:40.960\nThen, I can go to my router\ninterface right here, and\n\n194\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.880\nI can right-click and paste it in.\n\n195\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.190\nAnd notice it typed it in for me.\n\n196\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.030\nSo, that makes it very easy.\n\n197\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.390\nNow, if you have syntactical errors,\nit's gonna show you right here.\n\n198\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.200\nIt's gonna say yep, invalid, invalid,\ninvalid, invalid, whatever it might be.\n\n199\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.670\nBut it shows you that, and\nif you would have had an Enter\n\n200\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.640\nat the end here, it would have even\ncaptured that and sent that along.\n\n201\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.730\nAnd it would have actually\ngiven me all that.\n\n202\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.860\nSo, it allows you to just go ahead and\n\n203\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.280\nbe able to do this without\nhaving to type it in again.\n\n204\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.920\nWhere this becomes helpful,\nright, is if I need to remove it.\n\n205\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.510\nSo, what if I go crud,\nI'm gonna block everybody?\n\n206\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.829\nEverybody's gonna be mad and upset.\n\n207\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:30.177\nI can simply come back here, and\nthen I just have to do this.\n\n208\n00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:37.579\nAnd just type in a no,\ncopy it again, paste it again, and\n\n209\n00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:40.210\nthat particular configuration is erased.\n\n210\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Canceled out.\n\n211\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.157\n&gt;&gt; Without me having to do what?\n\n212\n00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:44.140\nGo, what was it again?\n\n213\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.280\nSo, typing it out is really one of\nthe helpful things that you can do.\n\n214\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.650\nNow, just when I say it on the exam,\nare you gonna have to do that?\n\n215\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.400\nNot really, but you will be able to\nget a pick on what you wanna do.\n\n216\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.990\nSo here, let's see if we've actually\nbeen successful at doing this, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:03.064\nSo now that I have that,\nI always like to do a show, Access-list,\n\n218\n00:13:03.064 --> 00:13:05.380\nI should have two of them.\n\n219\n00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.870\nHere's the standard one that\nwe also created earlier.\n\n220\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.970\nSo, that one is just based on the 47\ntrying to gain to access to the 46 network\n\n221\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.150\nis what we did.\n\n222\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.640\nAnd now on the extended one, is showing\nthat is permitting everything so\n\n223\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.630\nfar, and look, it even changed\nmy syntax to the word telnet,\n\n224\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.900\neven though I actually type in a 23, and\nknew exactly what I was looking for here.\n\n225\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:36.860\nSo, this one should be denied when I tried\nto connect in using that 46 network.\n\n226\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.173\nSo, let me go back over here.\n\n227\n00:13:38.173 --> 00:13:41.917\nAnd so here I am on this machine,\nand I have to use PuTTY,\n\n228\n00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:46.970\nbecause on Windows machine, telnet is\nnot easy to be able to get access to.\n\n229\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.270\nAnd I am going to click\non the Telnet button.\n\n230\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.957\nLet me zoom in, so\nthat we can see it a little bit easier.\n\n231\n00:13:54.957 --> 00:13:58.785\n10.0.47, and I'm gonna do a .2.\n\n232\n00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:00.296\nNow, you might be wondering,\nlike what the heck is .2?\n\n233\n00:14:00.296 --> 00:14:05.320\n.2 Is the switch that's on the management\ninterface on that switch here.\n\n234\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.531\nGonna click Open.\n\n235\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.757\nAnd give it, it's kind of,\nI'm assuming that the.\n\n236\n00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:20.530\nIt's kind of locked up,\na little bit funky there.\n\n237\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.000\nActually, it's showing me\nsomething that I want.\n\n238\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.099\nBecause I said I was blocking, right, so-\n&gt;&gt; You shouldn't be able to get access.\n\n239\n00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:27.437\n&gt;&gt; I should be able to, see?\n\n240\n00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:30.950\nI've already forgotten what I told\nyou I was going to do, let's see.\n\n241\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.860\nNow notice that I have\nthese three matches here.\n\n242\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.860\nSo, let me see if I can scroll up here,\nso that you can see, there we go.\n\n243\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.440\nSo now notice it has these three matches.\n\n244\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.955\nSee, I forgot that I'd already done it.\n\n245\n00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:43.170\n&gt;&gt; That have been denied.\n\n246\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that had been denied.\n\n247\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.521\nNow, I did forget one thing, or at least\nI thought I did, right, which was the,\n\n248\n00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:50.450\ncuz I always start thinking\nabout it afterwards.\n\n249\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.590\nI didn't apply it to the interface, but\nbecause I copied it to the whole thing,\n\n250\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.040\nI applied it to the interface at the same\ntime, which really is helpful, too.\n\n251\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.040\nSo now I'm denied, but\nthat means I can't get network error, so\n\n252\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.390\nthat is what I'm expecting to see.\n\n253\n00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.890\nBut let's try this with SSH,\nand see what happens too.\n\n254\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.295\nSo, we'll select the same PuTTy\nconnection, and this time SSH,\n\n255\n00:15:12.295 --> 00:15:16.400\neven in PuTTY, is selected by default,\nwhich is kinda neat.\n\n256\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.473\n&gt;&gt; They try to help you out.\n\n257\n00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.350\n&gt;&gt; 47.2\n&gt;&gt; .2, all right.\n\n258\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.835\n&gt;&gt; So now, once again, if I did\neverything right, and that's a big if-\n\n259\n00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:28.077\n&gt;&gt; You should be able to connect\n\n260\n00:15:28.077 --> 00:15:28.600\nthis time.\n\n261\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.740\n&gt;&gt; I should click Open.\n\n262\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.940\nAnd look at that, I am now getting this.\n\n263\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.470\nAnd you haven't seen this, right?\n\n264\n00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.190\nIt's pretty much saying, hey,\nyou sure you want to connect?\n\n265\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.310\nAnd here is a certificate that\nyou're gonna need to go ahead and\n\n266\n00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.050\nput on your computer if you want.\n\n267\n00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.120\nSo, I say yes.\n\n268\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.010\nAnd there it is, it says login as.\n\n269\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.193\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou're able to get in to that device.\n\n270\n00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:51.411\n&gt;&gt; I should be able to do admin, and\nthen my super secret password, 123.\n\n271\n00:15:56.939 --> 00:15:57.728\nAnd there we go.\n\n272\n00:15:57.728 --> 00:16:02.568\nSo, we were able To simply\nuse an access control\n\n273\n00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:07.980\nlist to help us here and\nnow notice, there it is.\n\n274\n00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.800\nThe matches are coming in,\nit's seeing the traffic,\n\n275\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.680\neverything is actually doing what we wanna\ndo, but telnet is still being denied.\n\n276\n00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.320\nAnd I've still got a lot of other\nthings happening with access list one\n\n277\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.840\nthat we see.\n\n278\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.330\nSo, being able to kinda manage that and\nwork that out the way that we want to\n\n279\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.260\nis pretty much a key for\neverything that we want to be able to do.\n\n280\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.179\nNow, you might be saying this\nCherokee cuz I know did, okay great.\n\n281\n00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:35.608\nSo, I have to do that for every single\nprotocol that I want to block and do.\n\n282\n00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:41.277\nWell to a point, right, you can actually\nkind of gather these things together and\n\n283\n00:16:41.277 --> 00:16:44.470\nnotice what happens here on this list.\n\n284\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.270\nThey actually create sequence numbers, so\n\n285\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.920\neven though I typed in access\nlist 101 twice, right?\n\n286\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.660\nIt really created a single access list,\n\n287\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.040\nwhich was 101 and\nthen it made each one a condition.\n\n288\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.860\nSo more and\n\n289\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.500\nmore, we can do something like that on a\nsingle access list instead to create that.\n\n290\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.810\nNow, we're not gonna do all that, but\n\n291\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.580\nI do wanna show you an example\nof what you might end up seeing.\n\n292\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.810\nLet me, not remove that diagram, but let\nme go ahead and show you one like this.\n\n293\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.440\nSo let's say that instead,\n\n294\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.839\nwe wanted to do something fairly similar\nto what I have here, as an example.\n\n295\n00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.080\nI don't want to allow for all traffic to\ngo but I really only want to allow for\n\n296\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.540\nlike HTTP and SMTP and\n\n297\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.270\nFTP over into this one machine that\nlet's say it houses all of it.\n\n298\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.130\nI know that would be silly but let's say\nit actually does all of it together.\n\n299\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.090\nWell, that is different than just simply\nblocking a single protocol, right.\n\n300\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.310\nThat sounds different,\nbut it really isn't.\n\n301\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.274\nThe way that we do that, we focus in on\nthis configuration just a little bit here.\n\n302\n00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:50.042\nYou can see that right here\nyou do the same thing,\n\n303\n00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:52.949\npermit tcp, that protocol,\n\n304\n00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:58.437\nfrom any particular IP address\non this network, okay.\n\n305\n00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:02.789\nSo we're not even focusing\nin on the network itself and\n\n306\n00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:07.234\nthen to any destination as\nlong as destination is what,\n\n307\n00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:11.126\nwell www,\nwhich is HTTP in Cisco protocol land.\n\n308\n00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:15.015\nAnd this one, of course,\nis the same thing to SMTP which would be\n\n309\n00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:19.280\nour email server and then 20 and\n21 that sounds like FTP.\n\n310\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.134\nRight, so\nwe can do something like this very easily.\n\n311\n00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:24.949\nAnd then once you actually\nhave that typed in,\n\n312\n00:18:24.949 --> 00:18:27.770\nyou'll get a single access list dash 102.\n\n313\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:34.004\nAnd then each one of those will become\na sequence number of 10, 20, 30, 40.\n\n314\n00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:37.880\nAnd now you'll have a single access\nlist with all those conditions in it.\n\n315\n00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.260\nMake sure you also apply it, of course, to\nthe proper interface, that's always key.\n\n316\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.110\nAnd that will also help out in just about\n\n317\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.390\neverything else that we really want\nto make sure that we configure.\n\n318\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.480\nNow, there are some tricky one, okay.\n\n319\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.580\nSo I want to point out one more\nwhich is a little bit tricky,\n\n320\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.410\nwhich is the idea of just DNS, right.\n\n321\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.800\nRemember DNS is such a gigantic open\nprotocol, you can take a Windows Server\n\n322\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.680\n2012 machine, load it up to just\nthe default configuration, install DNS on\n\n323\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.150\nit and you go, okay that's gonna be my DNS\nserver it's not gonna do anything else.\n\n324\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.000\nThere's a lot of different protocols\nrunning in the background and\n\n325\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.390\nthat means that there could\nbe a lot of open ports and\n\n326\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.020\na lot of open connections\nthat we worry about.\n\n327\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.270\nSo instead, you may go look, I don't know\nevery single thing that's open on here.\n\n328\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.975\nBut I do know something,\nthat I only really want from this side\n\n329\n00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:33.782\nof my router to only build access\nto this one machine using DNS.\n\n330\n00:19:33.782 --> 00:19:38.400\nAnd if you do that, you've got to remember\nthat DNS is tricky because it does TCP.\n\n331\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.258\n&gt;&gt; On on side.\n\n332\n00:19:39.258 --> 00:19:41.500\n&gt;&gt; It can do, as well as UDP.\n\n333\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.590\nSo in this one here,\nit's a little bit more strange,\n\n334\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:50.000\nin the very fact that you have to\nactually kind of think about both sides,\n\n335\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.450\nUDP and now notice that this one\nis a little bit different here.\n\n336\n00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:59.080\nOkay, whereas at the beginning\nwe do say udp any port going to,\n\n337\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.550\nwell, I said 353.\n\n338\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.615\nBut now, notice that in a second one,\n\n339\n00:20:04.615 --> 00:20:08.910\nwe're saying that hey,\nwhat if we actually start off?\n\n340\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.980\nThe source is gonna be what,\n53 going to well, any port.\n\n341\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.710\nSo now,\nwhere's our response coming back, right.\n\n342\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:21.180\nSo, it's leaving us at 53 and\ncoming back towards you.\n\n343\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.384\nSo we have to be able to do that because\nit does have to respond that right,\n\n344\n00:20:24.384 --> 00:20:27.638\nDNS and not just to one of those services,\nyeah we'll, that's fine,\n\n345\n00:20:27.638 --> 00:20:29.440\nwe'll just use the same port.\n\n346\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.720\nIt has do do it on both sides.\n\n347\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.400\nSo this is where it is a little bit\ntrickier because this time, we really\n\n348\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.910\ndidn't have where the source was tied\ninto that port or to the bigger protocol.\n\n349\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.570\nAnd then it says I don't care what\nthe destination is, it's gonna respond.\n\n350\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.180\nSo, you have to allow for both and\nyou do have to pay attention on\n\n351\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.340\nthings like that if you're\ngonna do something like this.\n\n352\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.420\nSo, just realize that\nwith ACLs there are a ton\n\n353\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:01.600\nof different matters that you can actually\nget involved in when you start doing this.\n\n354\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.020\nAnd there is also one more key that\nwe have to talk about as well.\n\n355\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.550\nRemember that with access control lists,\nit has to inspect\n\n356\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.170\nevery single packet that\ncomes across the interface.\n\n357\n00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.860\nSo when data hits that interface, so just\nlike, let me see, yeah so like right here,\n\n358\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.770\nthis is a great example of\nwhat's happening, okay.\n\n359\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.720\nNotice that I keep getting all\nthese different log messages that\n\n360\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.070\nare going across.\n\n361\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.660\nAnd I have that access control\nlist on list 1 there, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.450\nWell what is happening?\n\n363\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:40.120\nIt's saying, hey every time\na packet hits this, I have to\n\n364\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.240\nactually look at that packet, and I have\nto verify it against what, those rules.\n\n365\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.360\nWell, you don't get two\npackets like what we saw.\n\n366\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.560\nWe showed you just by connecting that one-\n&gt;&gt; Thousands.\n\n367\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you can get thousands\nof packets within a few minutes\n\n368\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.460\nvery quickly here.\n\n369\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.630\nSo you're actually making\nthe CPU on your router\n\n370\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.720\nhit very hard-\n&gt;&gt; Work for it.\n\n371\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.801\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and if you have a very busy\ninterface it becomes a little bit slower.\n\n372\n00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:06.053\nSo you do have to worry about that and\n\n373\n00:22:06.053 --> 00:22:10.871\nthat is because routers don't do what\nwe call stateful inspection,okay.\n\n374\n00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:15.249\nRouters are at a stateless configuration\nand that means that they don't take\n\n375\n00:22:15.249 --> 00:22:20.096\na look at where it came from, they don't\nevaluate whether it's malicious traffic or\n\n376\n00:22:20.096 --> 00:22:25.250\nwhether it's good traffic, they don't\ncare, they don't care what size it is.\n\n377\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.170\nThey just think look,\nit's another packet for me to evaluate.\n\n378\n00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.870\nWell, that's a problem when it comes down\nto router resources and different things.\n\n379\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:38.890\nSo even though we can use this, and a lot\nof companies still use this like crazy,\n\n380\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.730\nand it's great for them and it works,\n\n381\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.940\nthe very fact is we may actually wanna\nconsider something a little bit different.\n\n382\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.400\nBut remember this idea, the ACLs\nare what we call that idea static or\n\n383\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.350\nstateless types of packet filtering.\n\n384\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.090\nSo it doesn't look at things like\nwhat a firewall would look at.\n\n385\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.700\nAnd we're gonna talk about that\nin a different episode as well.\n\n386\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.220\nBut overall though, hopefully in these\ncouple of episodes that we showed you,\n\n387\n00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.710\nyou really did have kind of a good\ncouple of examples of using ACLs and,\n\n388\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.790\nof course, being able to see how\nACLs end up working here too.\n\n389\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.231\n&gt;&gt; I think so Ronnie, we've been able\nto look at some different examples and\n\n390\n00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:17.339\neven run through the demonstrations\nto see how this generic term,\n\n391\n00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:21.280\naccess control list, really can be very\nspecific, in terms of packet filtering and\n\n392\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.300\nlocking different types of connections.\n\n393\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.112\nAnd as you mentioned, firewalls,\nthey do have they special function and\n\n394\n00:23:29.112 --> 00:23:35.129\nwe can also look at how access control\nlists can be utilized with firewalls.\n\n395\n00:23:35.129 --> 00:23:39.441\nAnd I have a feeling that's what's coming\nup in the next episode, so stay tuned,\n\n396\n00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:41.576\ndon't go anywhere, get comfortable.\n\n397\n00:23:41.576 --> 00:23:44.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap things up for this show and\n\n398\n00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.330\nI'm gonna sign off as your show host,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n399\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.073\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n\n4\n00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.115\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.800\nIn the last couple of episodes we were\nlooking at being able to filter via\n\n6\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.930\nACLs with IP addresses.\n\n7\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.040\nIn this show, we're gonna be examining\ndifferent types of filters that we can\n\n8\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.820\napply to those ACLs.\n\n9\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.410\nWith us today in the studios we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.950\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.980\nhaving me here as continue to take a look\nat this idea of filtering traffic.\n\n13\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.590\nIn previous episodes we\nreally did focus in on ACL's.\n\n14\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.170\nUsually, on the router because\nthat's kind of the very first\n\n15\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.240\nway that we start implementing\nsome type of security and\n\n16\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.230\nlimiting traffic by going through\nan interface on a router.\n\n17\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.150\nIn CC&amp;A and\nif you're working with Cisco routers and\n\n18\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.700\nswitches that's pretty much\nthe primary method of doing so.\n\n19\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.070\nAnd making it very long and\nit can get very complex.\n\n20\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.760\nBut there are other methods out there\nthat we must be familiar with too,\n\n21\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.610\nas we enter into that realm,\nof course, of becoming more and\n\n22\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.460\nmore seasoned security professionals.\n\n23\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480\nAnd then, of course,\neven into the realm of cyber ops.\n\n24\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.730\nAnd taking a look and\nexamining output, examining the idea\n\n25\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.370\nof what these things really do give us in\nterms of output, and understanding that.\n\n26\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.270\nSo today, we are going to contrast.\n\n27\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.900\nNot only the basic packet\nfiltering idea of ACLs,\n\n28\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.590\nagain just a little bit\nof a brief overview.\n\n29\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.470\nWe're gonna also take a look at stateful\nfirewalls as well as the idea of DPI or\n\n30\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.260\nDeep Packet Inspection.\n\n31\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.433\nSo those are kind of three techniques that\nwe're really going to kind of compare and\n\n32\n00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:52.697\ncontrast just briefly.\n\n33\n00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:56.889\nJust so that we have a well rounded\nidea of what we might actually see.\n\n34\n00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.072\nAnd when do we actually\nchoose to use these things.\n\n35\n00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:03.887\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, when I started getting into\nthe realm of IT, it was a while ago,\n\n36\n00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:05.580\nit was over ten years ago.\n\n37\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.664\nI'll say this,\n\n38\n00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:12.191\nwhen it comes to firewalls it wasn't\nas complicated back then as it is now.\n\n39\n00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:17.908\nAnd that's because it wasn't as common\nto have all these fancy devices.\n\n40\n00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:20.130\nBecause it was really\nexpensive to utilize them.\n\n41\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.140\nBut now that we've seen the costs go down\nit's more common to have different types\n\n42\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.150\nof firewalls.\n\n43\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.730\nIt might a be a little overwhelming\nwhen you have all these different\n\n44\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.050\noptions out there.\n\n45\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.623\nBut I do wanna try to break it down for\nyou so we can just clarify.\n\n46\n00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:40.210\nAnd also establish at which layer of\nthe OSI model, things are happening.\n\n47\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.430\nSo, if we can pull up my screen,\n\n48\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.119\nI'd like to show you something\nthat I've compiled here.\n\n49\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.390\nThe first type of filtering that we'd like\nto talk about will be packet filtering.\n\n50\n00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.580\nAnd this is going to be down here\ntowards the bottom starting at layer\n\n51\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.480\nthree like we spoke about in\nthe last couple of episodes.\n\n52\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.078\nAnd we even did a few demos.\n\n53\n00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:00.970\nAnd you could see how that\npacket filtering works there.\n\n54\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.480\nSo, remember there are three basic\nrules that are being utilized\n\n55\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.400\nwith packet filtering.\n\n56\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.970\nWe had our IP address filtering.\n\n57\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.440\nWe have our type, or like Ronnie likes\nto say, port numbers being utilized.\n\n58\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860\nSo it uses a little bit of layer four but\n\n59\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.510\ngenerally that's how we go ahead and\ncoin that particular term.\n\n60\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Let's make sure that as we take\na look at the idea of packet filtering.\n\n61\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.410\nThe real application of packet filtering\nfor us in the realm, of course,\n\n62\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.240\nof network devices is gonna be\nsome type of access control list.\n\n63\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.920\nAnd Cisco loves these\naccess control lists.\n\n64\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.690\nAnd you have to know just a few\nbasic functions here, too.\n\n65\n00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.570\nWhen you start implementing\naccess control lists,\n\n66\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.640\nremember that we took a look\nat it in previous episodes.\n\n67\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.860\nThere were probably a few things I forgot\nto mention, so I'll mention them here.\n\n68\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.930\nHopefully that will help you\nget them covered as well.\n\n69\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.361\nBut one is that we can do\na standard access control list.\n\n70\n00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.317\nAs well as the idea of\nan extended access control list,\n\n71\n00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:54.388\nstandard based only on the source IP.\n\n72\n00:03:54.388 --> 00:03:57.703\nJust like what Cherokee was\ntalking about on layer three.\n\n73\n00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:03.216\nAnd then, the basis of extended access\ncontrol list of course is source and\n\n74\n00:04:03.216 --> 00:04:04.538\ndestination IP.\n\n75\n00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:08.102\nAnd then, we can add in additional\ncondition such as the port or\n\n76\n00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:13.310\nthe destination or the protocol or the\ntype as Cherokee was pointing out as well.\n\n77\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.340\nNow, this is very key for\nus because this access control list is not\n\n78\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.990\nonly important in the which\none we choose to use.\n\n79\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.994\nBut also as we create access control lists\nwe have to remember a very good best\n\n80\n00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:25.628\npractice.\n\n81\n00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:29.563\nWhich is, you want the most\nspecific types of filters that\n\n82\n00:04:29.563 --> 00:04:32.970\nyou're gonna create to\nbe at top of the list.\n\n83\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.340\nAnd you work generally down\ntoward the bottom of the list.\n\n84\n00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.690\nSo the only thing that really matters\nin an access control list, or\n\n85\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.790\nin a packet filter for\nus is whichever match or condition.\n\n86\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.310\nI was trying to think of what it is.\n\n87\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.430\nWhichever particular\ncondition it matches first as\n\n88\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.350\ndata is moving into that interface.\n\n89\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.460\nIt doesn't evaluate anything after that.\n\n90\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.850\nIf it matches and\nit's the very first thing in that list,\n\n91\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.420\nit doesn't evaluate the rest\nof the list to go on.\n\n92\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.570\nIt just matches whatever is at the top.\n\n93\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.930\nAnd if it doesn't happen to actually\nmatch anything in that entire list.\n\n94\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.010\nThere's also at the very end of every\naccess control list an implicit deny all.\n\n95\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.270\nSo it's very important that we\nremember at least these concepts too.\n\n96\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.695\nNow, Cherokee also said something a little\nbit strange about the way that the packet\n\n97\n00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.388\nfiltering works in terms\nof access control lists.\n\n98\n00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:31.320\nWhich was this idea of\nbeing a stateless idea.\n\n99\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.180\nAnd so, Cherokee, when we've talked\nabout that, what might we mean here?\n\n100\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.480\n&gt;&gt; So stateless means that it really\n\n101\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.810\ndoesn't look at anything other than\nthose three main things we spoke about.\n\n102\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.650\nIt doesn't identify any\nconnection information.\n\n103\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.220\nSo you can kind of think of\nstateless as doing less work.\n\n104\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.080\nOr if we look at this diagram,\nalso down here at the bottom,\n\n105\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.110\nwe have a diagram of an Ethernet frame.\n\n106\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.174\nAnd broken down into the different header\nspots here, you can see here, DA for\n\n107\n00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:03.868\ndestination address, SA for\nsource address, the length and the type.\n\n108\n00:06:03.868 --> 00:06:06.970\nThose are really gonna be\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n109\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.630\nAnd as we progress and move towards\nother things, like session information,\n\n110\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.580\nthat we might look at additional uneven\napplication, multi-layer inspection.\n\n111\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.270\nWe'll be looking at additional\nfields within that frame.\n\n112\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.530\nBut really stateless is\nlooking at the less, or\n\n113\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.380\nthe least, amount of information so\nit's pretty basic.\n\n114\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.280\nAt least all forms of firewalls will have,\nat minimum, those three requirements.\n\n115\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we can implement the use\nof just regular packet filtering\n\n116\n00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.420\nnot only on firewalls a lot of times.\n\n117\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.735\nBut we can also of course,\ndo them on router interfaces too.\n\n118\n00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:44.580\nLess usually where we\nwill see that more often.\n\n119\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.400\nNow don't get me wrong you can actually\ndo it on even virtual interface,\n\n120\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.180\nif you want to, yes.\n\n121\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.520\nYou definitely can.\n\n122\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.860\nIf you wanted to make\na telnet connection or\n\n123\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.240\nsomething like that instead I'm actually\nusing an basic you can also do that too.\n\n124\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.710\nSo they can be applied\njust about anywhere.\n\n125\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.160\nAnd of course, that means you need to\natleast be able to take a look and\n\n126\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.679\nunderstand.\n\n127\n00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:08.900\nWhether or not a particular access\ncontrol list has been applied.\n\n128\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.288\nSo let us take a look at\nmy machine just briefly.\n\n129\n00:07:11.288 --> 00:07:14.339\nWe're not gonna go over everything we\nhave covered the previous episodes\n\n130\n00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:15.972\ncuz we're still using the same thing.\n\n131\n00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:19.058\nBut if I actually need\nto verify whether or\n\n132\n00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:22.243\nnot I have an access\ncontrol list on board.\n\n133\n00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:28.198\nOr especially if you're working with\nthe router, it simply show access-list.\n\n134\n00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:32.270\nAnd that should tell you\na couple of things, whether or\n\n135\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.080\nnot you have a standard\naccess control list.\n\n136\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.015\nAnd if it's working or not as well, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:39.920\nNow, I logged these so we could see it.\n\n138\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.090\nBut what we're hoping to see,\n\n139\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.140\nright, is matches happen on all\nof my conditions that I need to.\n\n140\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.258\nIf I ever create an access control list\nand I see that regardless if there's 10,\n\n141\n00:07:50.258 --> 00:07:52.122\n20, 30, 40, 50, right?\n\n142\n00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:54.831\nAnd all of a sudden you see\nthe number 10 condition, and\n\n143\n00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:58.627\nthen the number 20, number 30 condition,\nthey all have matching values.\n\n144\n00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:02.156\nAnd then number 40 doesn't have anything,\nnumber 50 has a lot.\n\n145\n00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:05.033\nThey kind of let you\nknow something that maybe\n\n146\n00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:08.976\nthe number 40 condition has\nnever actually been hit at all.\n\n147\n00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:13.381\nAnd that might actually allow you to think\nabout the idea of more efficiency for\n\n148\n00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:14.791\nsome reason or another.\n\n149\n00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:18.154\nThat somewhere along the line that\nparticular one rule may have been\n\n150\n00:08:18.154 --> 00:08:20.240\novershadowed by something else.\n\n151\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.440\nSo you could get rid of that.\n\n152\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.170\nAnd that means you don't have to\nevaluate all the way down to a blank\n\n153\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.710\none that doesn't match anything.\n\n154\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.100\nAnd then it just continues to go on here.\n\n155\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.590\nThe same thing with the extended\naccess control list, as well.\n\n156\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.400\nSo it should give you\nthat information too.\n\n157\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.230\nSo this kind of a very easy way\nto be able to see whether or\n\n158\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.620\nnot it's doing what you\nwant to be able to do.\n\n159\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.380\nYou always have to work through\nthe logic of these things, so\n\n160\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.130\nit is probably the primary way that we\nbegin to really learn about the nature and\n\n161\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.340\nthe use of filtering network traffic.\n\n162\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.660\nSo always begin with the idea of the IP\naddressing, and then if necessary,\n\n163\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.870\nas you see right here on the standard,\nIn the extended access control list\n\n164\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.580\nwhere you start adding in a little\nbit more on the application layer.\n\n165\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.980\nYou can even match up there based on\nthat port number is what it's doing.\n\n166\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.940\nSo it is a strong foundation for\njust about everything else that\n\n167\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.580\nwe are going to take a look at, that\nyou understand at least at this level.\n\n168\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.020\nSo that's pretty much the idea\nbehind just basic packet filtering.\n\n169\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.810\nAnd the stateless side,\nas Cherokee was mentioning, also goes to\n\n170\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.110\nthe very fact that it means that it's\nvery intensive on the device itself.\n\n171\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.063\nBecause every packet that goes across\nthe interface has to match up to these\n\n172\n00:09:41.063 --> 00:09:43.982\naccess control list\nthat we see right here.\n\n173\n00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:47.945\nSo, it doesn't matter if it's Malware or\nif it's good information or\n\n174\n00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.750\nbad information.\n\n175\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.880\nEvery single one of these has to actually\ngo through and say, hey is this a match or\n\n176\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.300\nis it not a match.\n\n177\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.650\nEvery single packet that\ngoes across that interface.\n\n178\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.030\nIt doesn't stop to go,\nI don't need to inspect this packet.\n\n179\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.647\nIt just says, yep.\n\n180\n00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:07.199\nIt's supposed to go through these filters\nand if it matches it does, if not, I'll\n\n181\n00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:10.990\neither drop it or I'll let it go through,\nit just depends on what I need to do.\n\n182\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.290\nSo usually it drops it if\nit doesn't match at all.\n\n183\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.574\nBut just kind of remember that that\nmeans it's a lot of CPU usage.\n\n184\n00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:22.239\nHigh resource utilization normally\nleads to slower network traffic so you\n\n185\n00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:27.330\ndo have to be careful when implementing\nthings like ACLs as a packet filter.\n\n186\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.060\nSo just kinda remember that\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n187\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and\njust like Ronnie mentioned there.\n\n188\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.310\nThe further up,\nif we can look back at my machine.\n\n189\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.933\nIt will kinda make sense that, that's why\nwe wanted to paired up with the OSI model\n\n190\n00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.280\nbecause as we gain additional features.\n\n191\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.920\nDifferent filtering\nparameters that we can apply.\n\n192\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.610\nThat's more information that these\ndevices have to look at, and\n\n193\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.630\nwhen we get all the way up.\n\n194\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.070\nAnd we'll speak about things that are\nhappening at the application layer here.\n\n195\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.563\nBut when we get to the top of that\nOSI stack it might even be smart or\n\n196\n00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:03.226\nwise to choose something like an SSL\noffloader that can go ahead and\n\n197\n00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:06.822\nrelieve that devices CPU,\nthe processing power.\n\n198\n00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:10.025\nAnd kind of offload that so\nyou have two different devices handling\n\n199\n00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:13.395\nthese things for\nimplementing load and balancing.\n\n200\n00:11:13.395 --> 00:11:17.235\nBut, the next topic we'd like to cover\nhere is going to be stateful inspection\n\n201\n00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:18.270\nfirewalls.\n\n202\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.666\nSo on the flip side, Ronnie was\njust talking about stateless, but\n\n203\n00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:27.781\nif we look and move up the OSI model,\nand take a look at stateful information.\n\n204\n00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:32.165\nIt really comes into play when we're\ntalking about that TCP three way\n\n205\n00:11:32.165 --> 00:11:33.010\nhandshake.\n\n206\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.440\nAnd if you don't know what I'm\ntalking about, go back a few episodes,\n\n207\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.250\nwe cover that and they're other\nseries that covered that as well.\n\n208\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.727\nBut understanding that we have to\nestablish that communication is very\n\n209\n00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:49.579\nhelpful because then our firewall can\nensure that we're not getting any kind\n\n210\n00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:50.789\nof rogue packets.\n\n211\n00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:55.293\nOr someone's not trying to hijack any\nkind of communication that we have,\n\n212\n00:11:55.293 --> 00:12:00.082\nby looking at the information associated\nwith a particular session from host to\n\n213\n00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:01.330\nhost there.\n\n214\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.380\nSo that's what stateful is.\n\n215\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.250\nAnd it can be pretty beneficial\nthere in that sense.\n\n216\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.420\n&gt;&gt; It really is beneficial in terms of\nthe way that things are evaluated right?\n\n217\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.960\nWith the idea of using a stateful firewall\nbecause of the way that the conditions\n\n218\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.512\nare met.\n\n219\n00:12:17.512 --> 00:12:21.151\nIs that it has to already be moving\nthrough our interface before we will\n\n220\n00:12:21.151 --> 00:12:24.240\nactually allow for\na connection coming back in.\n\n221\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.390\nSo we're saying there has to be some\nthat goes outbound from my firewall and\n\n222\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.450\nthe return has to be in response to that.\n\n223\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.010\nSo that actually means that\nthe three-way handshake,\n\n224\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:38.450\nwhen it initiates, it has to come\nfrom inside of my own network.\n\n225\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.870\nThen the second part of that [INAUDIBLE]\nhas to be returned from the outside and\n\n226\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.680\nthen I acknowledge\nthe connection is happening.\n\n227\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.143\nAnd when we do something like that,\nright, inside that firewall,\n\n228\n00:12:50.143 --> 00:12:51.492\nthat stateful firewall.\n\n229\n00:12:51.492 --> 00:12:54.264\nIt establishes this\ntranslation type of address and\n\n230\n00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:56.784\ngives us what we call\nthe established message,\n\n231\n00:12:56.784 --> 00:13:00.760\nsaying this is now an established\npattern of communication.\n\n232\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.118\nWhat this also does it it means that\nCherokee cannot take her computer from\n\n233\n00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.867\nthe outside and think that she\ncan spoof that in coming back in.\n\n234\n00:13:08.867 --> 00:13:12.819\nAnd the reason why is that she had to be\nvery good at guessing sequence numbers\n\n235\n00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:16.730\nthat actually are initiated as\nthese connections are going in.\n\n236\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.930\nOr as it comes back in, and\nCherokee's initiated it from the outside.\n\n237\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.185\nHer sequence number may begin at one, for\n\n238\n00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:28.097\nall we know and\nits return is expecting 1366.\n\n239\n00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:30.660\nSo, that way she has to be\nable to guess the right one.\n\n240\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.810\nNot saying it can't happen, but in the\nspeed and the efficiency and the way that\n\n241\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:40.180\nthings happen today, very difficult if\nnot nearly impossible for it to happen.\n\n242\n00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.620\nSo, it really is key.\n\n243\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.260\nThe other part,\n\n244\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.240\nespecially about the resource nature of\nthis, is that doesn't necessarily have to\n\n245\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.940\ndo any real filtering on every single\npacket that comes to the interface.\n\n246\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.052\nThe packets that come to the interface, if\nit says it's not part of the data traffic,\n\n247\n00:13:58.052 --> 00:13:59.670\nit says I'm dropping it.\n\n248\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.360\nI'm not even gonna look and\ncheck for an IP address.\n\n249\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.480\nSo I'm not even gonna look at layer three,\nI'm not gonna do it at all.\n\n250\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.680\nIf it's not already a part of\nthe established connection,\n\n251\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.460\njust says drop, that's all it does.\n\n252\n00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.210\nSo that way if it's being\nhit hard that's fine, but\n\n253\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.760\nthe only time it has to do further\ninspection on the packet itself,\n\n254\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.050\nwhether we're talking about layer three or\nlayer four.\n\n255\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.640\nIs if it's because of that\npreviously established connection\n\n256\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.930\nthrough that three-way\nhandshake that we set.\n\n257\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.630\nBut you might be wondering,\nlike I did, it's like,\n\n258\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.980\nwell, what about UDP traffic then?\n\n259\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.572\nHow the heck do we do something like that?\n\n260\n00:14:35.572 --> 00:14:40.151\nSince UDP doesn't initiate a three-way\nhandshake, you have to kinda realize that,\n\n261\n00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:44.280\nwith UDP, it's based on the very\nfirst connection that's made.\n\n262\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.711\nSo if it's not based on that response,\nin other words it has to be able to figure\n\n263\n00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:51.614\nout something as the return\ntraffic comes back in.\n\n264\n00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:56.463\nThat says yes, this is in response to that\nvery first GDP session that we created to\n\n265\n00:14:56.463 --> 00:15:01.060\nthis destination address is not along\nthat, it will still drop the packets.\n\n266\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.606\nBut it knows how to do that.\n\n267\n00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:05.953\nIt knows how to be smart enough to go here\nis the very first one that was made from\n\n268\n00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:08.720\nthis connection, for\nthis particular session.\n\n269\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.800\nAnd it knows exactly what to expect back.\n\n270\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.370\nAnd when it does that, it automatically\nsets that particular UDP traffic up\n\n271\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.730\nin the same way as being established.\n\n272\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:23.170\nSo even though primarily it's based on\nthe nature of TCP as far as the three-way\n\n273\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:28.630\nhandshake, we can also do UDP traffic\nusing stateful inspection, as well.\n\n274\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.960\nIf there's anything that\nreally serves your network\n\n275\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.050\nat the perimeter of your network, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.530\nIt's gonna be a firewall.\n\n277\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:42.473\nThat's gonna be one of the most helpful\ndevices because you will not get unwanted\n\n278\n00:15:42.473 --> 00:15:46.915\ntraffic, at least, trying to initiate\na connection from the outside.\n\n279\n00:15:46.915 --> 00:15:51.182\nAnd if you set it up correctly,\nin other words being the only entry, and\n\n280\n00:15:51.182 --> 00:15:54.384\nof course the only exit point\ninside of your network,\n\n281\n00:15:54.384 --> 00:15:57.392\nyou're gonna have\na relatively secure network.\n\n282\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:00.812\nAs long as you don't have\nsomebody bypassing that,\n\n283\n00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:02.919\nit's probably fairly secure.\n\n284\n00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:07.269\nYeah, and then, if we continue\nto move up that OSI stack, and\n\n285\n00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:12.972\nwe're getting here up towards the top\nfour, our application-aware devices.\n\n286\n00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:18.160\nNow, different companies, Barracuda,\nCisco, they all have different products\n\n287\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.305\nand solutions that can be implemented\nto be tailored to specific companies.\n\n288\n00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:26.105\nThere are a lot of different names\nthat you might hear these types of\n\n289\n00:16:26.105 --> 00:16:29.965\ndevices being called,\nsuch as an application layer gateway.\n\n290\n00:16:29.965 --> 00:16:35.250\nWe've got Cisco's variation,\nthe Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n291\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:42.656\nThey kind of brand or package it as an\nNGIPS, which, what is the new generation?\n\n292\n00:16:42.656 --> 00:16:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Next Generation.\n\n293\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.780\n&gt;&gt; Next-generation intrusion\nprevention system.\n\n294\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.827\nSometimes you'll even hear terms\nlike next-generation firewalls.\n\n295\n00:16:50.827 --> 00:16:52.254\nWhat else do they call them?\n\n296\n00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:57.210\nDPI, deep packet inspection, and that's\nreally what we wanna mention as well here.\n\n297\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.816\nSo just be aware that,\nas we're moving up that OSI model,\n\n298\n00:17:01.816 --> 00:17:06.433\nnow that device is able to\nactually inspect the data here.\n\n299\n00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:11.328\nSo if you look at this ethernet frame,\nwe have minimum of 46 up to\n\n300\n00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:15.520\n1,500 bytes for\nthe allotment of that data there.\n\n301\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.480\nAnd of course, if it's less than that,\nthat's why I have this pad here.\n\n302\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.460\nYou might have some filler or fluff\ninformation just to make it that size.\n\n303\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.294\nBut what we're doing at this level\nis actually inspecting that data.\n\n304\n00:17:27.294 --> 00:17:32.940\nAnd so these devices can be very\nuseful from a security standpoint.\n\n305\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.035\nBecause if they see any\nkind of binary signature or\n\n306\n00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:40.752\ncoding that look similar to a malicious\nsignature and coding, then they can\n\n307\n00:17:40.752 --> 00:17:45.544\nreally just go in and extract that\nmalicious or suspicious-looking code and\n\n308\n00:17:45.544 --> 00:17:49.692\nallow the remaining portion of\nthat information to flow through.\n\n309\n00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:53.944\nSo it's pretty helpful,\nI guess, in that sense there.\n\n310\n00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:57.976\n&gt;&gt; When you start taking a look at\nthe idea of deep packet inspection,\n\n311\n00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:02.157\nit really is amazing in the concepts and\nwhat it really does, right?\n\n312\n00:18:02.157 --> 00:18:06.154\nWe're really taking a look at the idea\nhere that Cherokee's showing us,\n\n313\n00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:10.537\npacket filtering, which really operates\non the basis of layers 1 through 3 and\n\n314\n00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:15.113\na little bit into 4, just recognizing that\nthere are ports that we have to connect to\n\n315\n00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:17.508\nor protocols that we need to use.\n\n316\n00:18:17.508 --> 00:18:19.810\nBut then, when we get into\nthe stateful inspection, right,\n\n317\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.790\nthat TCP or UDP has to already be\nestablished before we move on.\n\n318\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.125\nSo it's here that they'd take a look at\nwhat Layer 3, or Layer 4 and Layer 5,\n\n319\n00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:31.780\nI wanna make sure I'm\nactually saying it right,\n\n320\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.100\n[LAUGH] Layer 4 and\nLayer 5 information as well.\n\n321\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.300\nOnce you start getting\ninto the upper layers,\n\n322\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.770\nwell, that's when it looks inside\nthe application data itself.\n\n323\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.480\nNow, the reason why this is\nimportant is because there is data,\n\n324\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.390\nokay, that you have to send.\n\n325\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.930\nAnd inside of that 46 to 1,500,\nyou might find some applications\n\n326\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:59.060\nautomatically embed the source\nIP address inside of that data.\n\n327\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.300\nAnd when it does that,\nas it goes through the firewall,\n\n328\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.730\nthe firewall doesn't know that\nsomething may be embedded in there.\n\n329\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.230\nAnd what it does is, it looks to\nthat packet and goes, wait a minute.\n\n330\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.173\nThis doesn't look right,\n\n331\n00:19:11.173 --> 00:19:14.011\nbecause there's some extra information\nthat I wasn't expecting to see in here.\n\n332\n00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:16.640\nWell, then it can drop it.\n\n333\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.470\nAnd the way that we used to have to\ndeal with this as an organization,\n\n334\n00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.310\na lot of times, or previous organization,\nI should say, that I worked for, is,\n\n335\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.800\nwhen I did some training into\nan army base, there was a certain\n\n336\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.440\nprotocol that we were using at the time\nto see if we could get connected.\n\n337\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.670\nAnd using that particular protocol to get\nconnected, their firewalls were saying,\n\n338\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.969\nwe won't allow that particular\nprotocol to get through.\n\n339\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.710\nAnd so we said, well, what can we do?\n\n340\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.160\nWell, what we actually decided to do was\nessentially mask the port number and\n\n341\n00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.320\nthe ports of our traffic\ninside of port 80.\n\n342\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.570\nAnd that wouldn't normally work, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.800\nSo as long as you're just doing stateful\ninspection, it does the three-way\n\n344\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.830\nhandshake, you're connected,\noperating on port 80, everything's fine.\n\n345\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.520\nBut then,\nwhen it went back through their firewall,\n\n346\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.770\nright, it took a look inside of\nthe data and says, wait a minute.\n\n347\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.420\nThat's not port 80 traffic,\nit's Port 19, whatever it was, 35 or\n\n348\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.770\nwhatever it might be.\n\n349\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.700\nAnd it said, yeah, that's not correct.\n\n350\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.930\nAnd it said, that traffic is now not good.\n\n351\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:26.350\nSo it was able to dig in there and\nfind that information and realize that.\n\n352\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.540\nA particular type of\ndeep packet inspection,\n\n353\n00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.930\nthen, allows the firewall to say,\nlook, let me go ahead and verify this.\n\n354\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.118\nAs long as the source IP address and\n\n355\n00:20:38.118 --> 00:20:43.099\nwhat I find inside when I look in the\npacket is the same, and everything's good\n\n356\n00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:48.350\nthere as far as whatever I'm expecting\nto see, well, then we're good.\n\n357\n00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.019\nSo it will regenerate your\nframe check sequence.\n\n358\n00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:54.220\nIt will do a lot of different things\nto make sure that it happens.\n\n359\n00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.855\nBut up there, at the presentation or\napplication layer,\n\n360\n00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.660\nis where it tends to do that.\n\n361\n00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.340\nSo no longer are we really dependent\nupon the lower five or six layers so\n\n362\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.750\nmuch, as much as actually\ngetting directly in there so\n\n363\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.300\nthat we can actually use that information.\n\n364\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.870\nNow, if we take a look at my screen, I'm\ngonna show you something here, which is,\n\n365\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.254\nof course, a couple of things.\n\n366\n00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:17.013\nJust I forgot to do this when we\nwere talking about the idea of\n\n367\n00:21:17.013 --> 00:21:18.610\nstateful firewalls.\n\n368\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.138\nOne of the premium stateful firewalls\nthat is out there in the world today,\n\n369\n00:21:22.138 --> 00:21:23.540\nof course, is the Cisco ASA.\n\n370\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.670\nAnd this is a previous-generation\ntechnology.\n\n371\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.705\nI know that sounds strange, but\nwhat Cherokee was talking about,\n\n372\n00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:32.980\nthe Cisco FirePOWER or Sourcefire,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n373\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.100\nToday it's called FirePOWER.\n\n374\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.605\nIt used to be called Sourcefire.\n\n375\n00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:38.462\nCisco Sourcefire is\nessentially the Cisco ASA,\n\n376\n00:21:38.462 --> 00:21:41.770\nwhich is a stateful firewall appliance.\n\n377\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.590\nBut now, with the ability to do\npacket inspection in itself,\n\n378\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:51.090\ndeep packet inspection, and have\nan actual integrated inspection engine\n\n379\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.370\ninside of it, so now it actually\ndoes live time in this way, right?\n\n380\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.140\nIt can help you to be able to do so\nmuch more.\n\n381\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.560\n&gt;&gt; Interesting that you say real time or\nlive time, Ronnie.\n\n382\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.210\nBecause that's something else that I\nkinda wanna touch on real quick, is that,\n\n383\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.580\nwith our firewalls, it's happening and\ninspecting all at the same time.\n\n384\n00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.780\nRemember, proxies can be\nsimilar in certain ways.\n\n385\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.170\nFor instance,\na firewall can be implemented as a proxy,\n\n386\n00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.940\nlike you were saying\nat that military base.\n\n387\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:25.450\nHowever, proxies are based off of\nthat store and forward methodology.\n\n388\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.820\nSo proxies are not firewalls,\nwhereas some firewalls can be proxies.\n\n389\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.138\nDid I just confuse everyone, or what?\n\n390\n00:22:31.138 --> 00:22:34.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a little bit confusing when\n\n391\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.140\nyou realize that not\neverything is actually that.\n\n392\n00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.344\nBut some of those things are actually\nwhat, yeah, whatever it might be.\n\n393\n00:22:39.344 --> 00:22:40.153\n&gt;&gt; A lot of options out there.\n\n394\n00:22:40.153 --> 00:22:41.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a lot of options.\n\n395\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.550\nBut this idea of deep packet\ninspection is gonna be more and\n\n396\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.060\nmore important, because the problem is not\njust stopping the information anymore.\n\n397\n00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.950\nIt's realizing that the very fact that we\nlive in this world, in Cyber Ops terms,\n\n398\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.420\nright, that we have to not only\ntry to prevent for access in.\n\n399\n00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.000\nWe also have to actually monitor\nconstantly, live time, everything that we\n\n400\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.090\ncan, and then have a post-evaluative\nprocess, too, in case something happens.\n\n401\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.080\nSo the idea of the stateful firewall,\nit can prevent everything live time.\n\n402\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.110\nBut this doesn't tell me if\nan attack has actually happened.\n\n403\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.280\nIt really can't.\n\n404\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.360\nIt can say, yeah, I let this traffic in,\nbut that's about it.\n\n405\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.120\nBut it didn't tell me what the end result\nwas of that traffic that got let in.\n\n406\n00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.690\nIt doesn't even tell me\nwhen it drops packets.\n\n407\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.512\nIt just drops packets.\n\n408\n00:23:26.512 --> 00:23:30.967\nAnd you can take a look, but finding\ndropped packets is, again, like trying to\n\n409\n00:23:30.967 --> 00:23:35.900\ngo, all right, I've got a whole flood of\nhay that I'm gonna drop on your doorstep.\n\n410\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.650\nMake sure you pick the right ones out.\n\n411\n00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.950\nIt's everything, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.000\nSo it's right here on the Cisco ASA.\n\n413\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.500\nYou can actually do just regular\nstateful firewalls here, man.\n\n414\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.210\nSo I'm showing here on this interface.\n\n415\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.185\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhy the heck did you bring up the lab?\n\n416\n00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:53.264\nI brought up the lab because,\neven though I was doing everything on real\n\n417\n00:23:53.264 --> 00:23:55.982\nequipment for, and\nthis is actually a real ASA, that's what I\n\n418\n00:23:55.982 --> 00:23:59.136\nwanted to point out to those of you\nthat are sort of getting ready, yeah.\n\n419\n00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthese labs are cool in that aspect.\n\n420\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.991\nYou're working on real equipment, and\nyou guys have access to that also.\n\n421\n00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:07.507\n&gt;&gt; And that's the reason why, is because\nthere may be things that I could show you\n\n422\n00:24:07.507 --> 00:24:09.431\non the ASA that I have right here.\n\n423\n00:24:09.431 --> 00:24:12.610\nBut if you don't have an ASA you might\nbe wondering like what's happening?\n\n424\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Where am I gonna get one of those?\n\n425\n00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhere am I gonna get one of those?\n\n426\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.220\nWell, right here, okay,\nis what you're actually going to do.\n\n427\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.350\nSo, you can get in here and you can follow\nsome lab instructions just so that you can\n\n428\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.350\nget connected, that's exactly what I did\nand then, you can take a look around.\n\n429\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.550\nAnd this is great cuz even at\nthe basic level of this one,\n\n430\n00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.320\nthis is several hundred dollars\nthat you don't have to spend.\n\n431\n00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.940\nSo here, I just went in and once I\nconnected in, I selected Configuration.\n\n432\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.120\nAnd then, inside of configuration, you'll\nnormally end up at the very beginning,\n\n433\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.180\nhere, under Device Setup.\n\n434\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.670\nAnd we wanna take a look\nat those firewall rules.\n\n435\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.650\nAnd you can click on Firewall.\n\n436\n00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.720\nAnd now, once you go,\nall right, firewall rules,\n\n437\n00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.450\nthere don't see to be a lot of them\nright here in the middle, right?\n\n438\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.570\nSo notice, they call them Access Rules.\n\n439\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.530\nAnd they do work very similar\nto the way that ACLs work.\n\n440\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.580\nBut look at all the other things\nyou can configure here, NAT rules,\n\n441\n00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.700\nService Policies, AAA for\nyour authentication.\n\n442\n00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.630\nHere's the basic filtering rules,\nPublic Servers,\n\n443\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.700\nURL, Threat Detection, Identity Options.\n\n444\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.600\nYou name it there is a ton of different\noptions and that even goes a bit further.\n\n445\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.180\nHere's the ACL Manager that way\nyou actually know that you have\n\n446\n00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.250\nAccess Control List Manager.\n\n447\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:29.975\nRight here so that you can see\na bunch of different things,\n\n448\n00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:34.122\nwhen it comes down to you\nconfiguring a firewall for\n\n449\n00:25:34.122 --> 00:25:37.730\nlayer four or stateful inspection.\n\n450\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.750\nBut you can also use this to do well,\nthe idea of deep packet inspection.\n\n451\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.758\nNow, the problem that you have\nright here on doing some of that,\n\n452\n00:25:46.758 --> 00:25:49.222\nit's not in the GUI interface, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:49.222 --> 00:25:53.120\nSo, all of these require you to\nactually set up class mapping.\n\n454\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.910\nAnd you can do it, don't get me wrong.\n\n455\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.750\nYou can kinda work through it and\nonce you actually get creative and\n\n456\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.280\nworking around different objects here, and\n\n457\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.500\ncreating class maps and stuff,\nyou can actually create this.\n\n458\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.540\nAnd this can actually become a very\ngood deep packet inspection for\n\n459\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.370\nyou but\nit requires a lot of configuration.\n\n460\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.070\nAnd we're not talking about\nall the configuration yet.\n\n461\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.810\nFor those that are wanting more of this,\nyou might think about trying to go for\n\n462\n00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.580\nyour CCNP security instead.\n\n463\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.280\nAnd you'll get into that idea of\nactually creating these types of filters\n\n464\n00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.540\nby using just a regular firewall.\n\n465\n00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.380\nBut with the Cisco NGIPS,\n\n466\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:36.010\nyou're talking about the\nNext-Generation IPS, that is live time.\n\n467\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:41.650\nIt is something that prevents, it monitors\nand it also of course, gives us reports.\n\n468\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.030\nAfter the fact when something happens, and\n\n469\n00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:49.830\nthat is why it is the technology to be on\nthe watch for, everybody loves this thing.\n\n470\n00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.340\nThe only thing that it does though,\nit hurts your wallet in ways that\n\n471\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.970\nyou can't even imagine even\nin a small organization.\n\n472\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.360\nCan you afford to buy one?\n\n473\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.790\nYeah, but to actually keep up with\neverything that they're wanting you\n\n474\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.490\nto keep up with because it is,\nit's live time connected into so\n\n475\n00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.700\nmany different locations to\nget the information it needs.\n\n476\n00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.840\nYou just don't have enough money and\n\n477\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.710\nsubscription if you're just\na small company doing it.\n\n478\n00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.660\nBut the good thing is the combination of\nusing packet filters, using just a regular\n\n479\n00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.310\nstateful firewall, and learning a little\nbit more about how that works here.\n\n480\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.250\nThere's a lot of configuration guides\nthat you can go out there and get and\n\n481\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.385\nstart to actually take a look and\nsee how it works.\n\n482\n00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Implement on the equipment\nthat you already may have.\n\n483\n00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nof course even using this lab here can\n\n484\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.000\nhelp you to at least understand some\nof it a little bit more better.\n\n485\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.850\nSo, just realize that all of\nit is actually right there for\n\n486\n00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.450\nyou to take a look around.\n\n487\n00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.040\nSo, don't just toss this thing away\njust because you go, it can go deep.\n\n488\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.850\nIt can, you just have to kinda\nmanually massage it to do it and\n\n489\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.866\nit will work for us.\n\n490\n00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:51.840\nBut overall though,\nit's a great aspect of understanding that\n\n491\n00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.100\nthere's not one fit for\nany one size company, right?\n\n492\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.813\nIt really does depend on one,\nhow much money you're willing to spend.\n\n493\n00:27:59.813 --> 00:28:00.911\n&gt;&gt; Sure [LAUGH].\n\n494\n00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Two,\nhow much time are you willing to spend in.\n\n495\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.053\nAnd three, what do you really need.\n\n496\n00:28:04.053 --> 00:28:08.170\n&gt;&gt; Do you need that, yeah, is it, are you\ndealing with sensitive information or\n\n497\n00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.380\nare you not and so\n\n498\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.634\nthat's gonna obvious it contribute\nto your overall decision as well.\n\n499\n00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:17.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, overall though,\nthose are pretty much the three\n\n500\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:22.040\ntypes of packet filtering methods that\nwe're just gonna focus in on here, but\n\n501\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.920\nyou may actually have others\nthat you wanna deal with.\n\n502\n00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.700\nBut on the exam,\nthese are the three that you have to\n\n503\n00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.440\nfeel comfortable with being able\nto understand and describe.\n\n504\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you might even be left\nwith a little bit of homework there.\n\n505\n00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.940\nJump into your labs,\n\n506\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.660\nplay around, this is a little foreign\nto use that you do feel comfortable.\n\n507\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.040\nBut that does about wrap it up for\nthis particular show.\n\n508\n00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.210\nWe do have additional\nshows headed your way, so\n\n509\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.150\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular episode.\n\n510\n00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.640\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n511\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n512\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.245\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n513\n00:28:52.604 -->

--> 00:00:12.330\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.124\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the Cisco\nCybersecurity Fundamentals Series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:17.811\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.656\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be comparing capture packet methods.\n\n7\n00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.639\nIf you've been following\nalong with this series,\n\n8\n00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:28.010\nyou may already have seen Wireshark,\na different utility that we've been using.\n\n9\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.075\nBut in this episode we're gonna go\nahead and explore a little bit more.\n\n10\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:35.215\nWith us today to help us look at\nthese topics is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:36.705\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:40.235\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back in\nthe studio as we continue on taking a look\n\n13\n00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:45.015\nat some of these security fundamentals\nthat we really have to, just to have\n\n14\n00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:50.110\nkind of a set in our mind before we really\nget started into the realm of Cyber Ops.\n\n15\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.010\nAnd that idea, of course,\nis the idea of packet capturing.\n\n16\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.140\nWhen we start taking a look\nat packet capturing we have\n\n17\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.045\npreviously an episode used\nwhat we call Wireshark.\n\n18\n00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:06.720\nAnd Wireshark is a tool that we\ncan use to help us to go ahead and\n\n19\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.910\ntake what was captured and\ndisplay that on our screen.\n\n20\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.280\nBut unto itself, right,\nWireshark is just an application and\n\n21\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.550\nif we don't have a capturing method,\nwell, that's where we have a problem.\n\n22\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.100\nSo when we start talking about this idea,\nthat's what we have to actually focus in\n\n23\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.470\non, is that in network security and in\nCyber Ops, in the realm of cyber security,\n\n24\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.210\nwe have to understand those fundamental\nmethods that we are probably gonna see.\n\n25\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.600\nAnd when we start to think about,\n\n26\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.220\nthere's always issues in dealing with\nthis, especially if you're brand new to it\n\n27\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.100\nbecause you may not have thought\nabout some of these issues.\n\n28\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.040\nFirst and foremost is what tool are we\ngonna use for some type of analysis.\n\n29\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.800\nWireshark is a great example of\na tool that we can use to analyze and\n\n30\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000\nto see the traffic, but a lot of\ntimes in terms of using Wireshark,\n\n31\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960\nit spits out so much more information.\n\n32\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.780\nAnd if we're just new at it we\nmay not be able to make heads or\n\n33\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.490\ntails of the amount of\ninformation that we get to see.\n\n34\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.990\nSo we have to worry about that\nparticular bit of analysis.\n\n35\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.390\nSecondly, we also have to worry about the\nidea of the tool that we're gonna use or\n\n36\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560\nthe technology that we're gonna\nuse to capture packets as well.\n\n37\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.393\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthe idea of packet capturing,\n\n38\n00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:23.990\nwe also have to think about that.\n\n39\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.860\nAnd there are several different\ntools when it comes down to\n\n40\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.228\nthe realm of networking and\nnetwork security.\n\n41\n00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:34.128\nWe're specifically gonna focus in on\nthree different types of utilities and\n\n42\n00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:36.650\nit's strange in a way that\nCisco of course words it.\n\n43\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.790\nAnd we're going to spend a majority\nof our time talking about this,\n\n44\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.660\nwhich is really going to be the key and\nthe fundamental behind it.\n\n45\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.320\nWe're going to talk about what we\ncall in-line traffic interrogation.\n\n46\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.255\n&gt;&gt; Interrogation?\n\n47\n00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:49.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what it sounds like.\n\n48\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.450\nYeah, exactly the idea of interrogation.\n\n49\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.540\nIs kind of the key and\n\n50\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.990\nI'm using those terms because they\nare found on the Cisco exam objectives\n\n51\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.800\nas you start to try and do some studying\non your own and start to do that.\n\n52\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.900\nYou got to find that maybe looking at\nthose key terms are really gonna help you\n\n53\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.070\nout but it may not cuz it's fairly generic\nin what they're trying to describe.\n\n54\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.180\nAnd yeah, Cisco does have product\noffering for some of these too.\n\n55\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.150\nWe're also going to talk about the realm\nof what we call network taps as well and\n\n56\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.730\nthis really comes from the telecom\nworld the idea of taps but\n\n57\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.854\nwhen we use them in terms of networking it\nreally also is another helpful method and\n\n58\n00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:30.260\nwe'll talk about\nthe methodology behind that.\n\n59\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.120\nAnd then finally the one that we\nalso used previously in our show,\n\n60\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.250\nwhich of course is the idea\nof traffic mirroring.\n\n61\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.800\nI'm not gonna be able to say it.\n\n62\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.940\nI'm gonna say milfering.\n\n63\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.640\nI don't know what that even means.\n\n64\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.460\nLike millering or something like that.\n\n65\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.570\nSo just kind of realize\nthat traffic monitoring,\n\n66\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.390\nmirroring, see, I was gonna use\na different term no matter what.\n\n67\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.630\nTraffic mirroring is another method that\nwe can also use to help us to capture\n\n68\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.640\npackets, and we need to have at least\nan understanding of each one of those and\n\n69\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.590\ntalk about what it is that they really do,\nand how we actually compare them and\n\n70\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.500\ncontrast them, just a little bit,\nwhen we get started here.\n\n71\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.640\nSo there's one other thing that\nwe also have to worry about too.\n\n72\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.020\nAnd this is where it takes time.\n\n73\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.890\nIt takes you being willing to slow\ndown in your logic of the way\n\n74\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.380\nthat things work and understand the nature\nof what it is you're trying to capture.\n\n75\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.810\nAnd the reason why that's also important\nis because the placement of these\n\n76\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.650\nparticular tools and\nthe traffic that we capture, right?\n\n77\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.030\nDepending on where we\ncapture the information,\n\n78\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.490\nwe may capture too much information.\n\n79\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.370\nSo, in that particular logic,\n\n80\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.180\nit may be that we are not even\ncapturing the right information.\n\n81\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.820\nCuz we don't know.\n\n82\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.740\nCuz we are getting so much information.\n\n83\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.240\nIt could be that we're\nlimiting ourselves too much.\n\n84\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.430\nSo, we're not capturing, again, based on\nthe right filters, or anything like that.\n\n85\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.350\nYou may also end up finding out that\nyou're not using the right technology\n\n86\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.270\nto show what you need to.\n\n87\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.170\nSo, there's a lot of different\nthings that come through experience,\n\n88\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.760\nthat comes through knowledge, but\nit helps if you take a look and go,\n\n89\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.490\nwhere do I need to capture this,\n\n90\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.880\nunderstand where you're gonna actually be\nusing these utilities and these methods\n\n91\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.030\nbecause if not you may be capturing\nsomething that doesn't even matter.\n\n92\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.790\nAnd that is just wasted time.\n\n93\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.700\nAnd in terms of security and\nCyber Ops time is pretty much the key\n\n94\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.940\ncritical element that makes us different\nfrom the idea of just doing security.\n\n95\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.990\nSecurity is all about of course\nestablishing that secure ground.\n\n96\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.100\nMaking sure everything is\nfundamentally the way that we want to.\n\n97\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.790\nThey are hardened the way that we want to.\n\n98\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.890\nWe're using the correct protocols,\nwe're following the same policies and\n\n99\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.310\nprocedures, and\nwe're establishing a firm security base.\n\n100\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.490\nBut when it comes to the realm of\nCyber Ops, you have to add in that\n\n101\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.290\ntime element of when you actually spot\nthese things and what do you do about it.\n\n102\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.240\nAnd this is where Cisco has constantly\ntried to move the realm of security.\n\n103\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.600\nAnd this is why there's a big\npush towards this idea too.\n\n104\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.100\nSo if you take a look at\nthe most modern Cisco products,\n\n105\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.470\nright, they're always\ndoing it in this way.\n\n106\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.470\nAnd you hear about it in this\nkind of of terms here, right?\n\n107\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.810\nYou hear about the idea of making sure\nthat Cisco is preventing attacks, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.930\nMaking sure that they're actually\nresponding to the attacks as well.\n\n109\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.500\nAnd then of course there is also the idea\nhere of the traffic review or the idea of.\n\n110\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.590\nI'm actually saying an attack has\nhappened and now what do we do about it?\n\n111\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.520\nSo real time of course and\nthen post attack analysis.\n\n112\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.620\nAnd then of course being able to prevent.\n\n113\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.770\nThose are really kind of the key areas.\n\n114\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.569\n&gt;&gt; Is that all?\n\n115\n00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:35.441\n&gt;&gt; That's all yeah.\n\n116\n00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:36.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it really is,\n\n117\n00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:39.972\nit's about the idea of that we\nhave to be more comprehensive and\n\n118\n00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:44.265\njust say, I know that if I block against\nthis I'm gonna be secure against that,\n\n119\n00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:46.030\nwhat if that still gets through?\n\n120\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.630\nAnd you have to go how far did it get and\n\n121\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.460\nthen what is the actual overall impact and\nwhen did it happen?\n\n122\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.290\nSo all that actually become very much\n\n123\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.440\na part of the mindset you have to have\nin terms of implementing security today.\n\n124\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.480\nIf you don't you'll find\nyourself behind the times and\n\n125\n00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.140\nthat's really not a good place to\nbe when it comes down to security.\n\n126\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.830\nIf you want to continue to\nlearn on a daily basis.\n\n127\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.072\nSecurity is here on the go.\n\n128\n00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:16.110\nCyber Ops security is kind\nof the cutting edge and\n\n129\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.140\nthe idea here of where Cisco\nis really trying to take us.\n\n130\n00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.660\nAnd so we do need to learn a little\nbit more about this methods.\n\n131\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.650\nAnd we're gonna spend some\ntime to take a look at them.\n\n132\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nWhich method are you gonna start with?\n\n133\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, let start with this idea of\nthe in line traffic interrogation.\n\n134\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.740\nAnd this is by far the most, I'm trying\nto think of the most intimidating term.\n\n135\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.228\nI was trying to think of the correct word,\nthat we have.\n\n136\n00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:44.240\nIn-line traffic interrogation,\neven that idea of the term interrogation\n\n137\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.775\nsounds intimidating to me\nwhen you start to think about\n\n138\n00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:49.215\n&gt;&gt; That's very invasive.\n\n139\n00:07:49.215 --> 00:07:51.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really it is.\nIt's one of those things that\n\n140\n00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:53.755\nbrings you back to a police\ndrama of one sort or another.\n\n141\n00:07:53.755 --> 00:07:58.023\nBut when we start taking a look at this\nidea of what it is, the key word Believe\n\n142\n00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:01.492\nit or not its not actually\nthe idea of traffic interrogation,\n\n143\n00:08:01.492 --> 00:08:04.600\nit's the term in line\nis really the key word.\n\n144\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.732\nAnd the idea behind that\nin line type of packet\n\n145\n00:08:08.732 --> 00:08:12.333\ncapturing that we need to be able to do.\n\n146\n00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:17.325\nWe actually have to think about it that\nhey if I can do this as going live time,\n\n147\n00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:22.473\nright, real time then I have a a better\nchance of stopping it before it actually\n\n148\n00:08:22.473 --> 00:08:27.550\naffects anything or too much of anything,\nor anything really important.\n\n149\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.050\nThat's the whole goal.\n\n150\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.610\nSo let's take a look at a couple of\ndifferent methods right here on my screen,\n\n151\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.720\nas we talk about this idea overall.\n\n152\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.190\nSo when it comes to inline traffic\ninterrogation, as far as a packet capture\n\n153\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:46.480\ntype of technique, there's really two\ndifferent ones we wanna at least describe,\n\n154\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.800\nand I hope that this diagram helps\nyou to understand why it's this way.\n\n155\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.230\nSo, take a look at the diagram\nup here on the top.\n\n156\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.430\nAnd we're gonna talk, of course,\n\n157\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.190\nabout the idea of an intrusion\nprevention system, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.710\nIn this idea, the intrusion prevention\nsystem, notice that what we have inline\n\n159\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:07.680\nhere on the right-hand side, of course,\nis gonna be my untrusted network.\n\n160\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.230\nThe people I really don't trust\nout there on the Internet as well.\n\n161\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.380\nAnd then I have router in between them.\n\n162\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.270\nAnd that really does help filter out the\nmajority of the traffic that could be just\n\n163\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.320\ncoming by.\n\n164\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.357\nBut then I also have this\nother device right here,\n\n165\n00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:22.820\nthe intrusion prevention system.\n\n166\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.812\nThe intrusion prevention system\nis designed to be able to\n\n167\n00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:32.596\nessentially intercept\nthe traffic that's coming off\n\n168\n00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:36.970\nof this interface and\nthen analyze that traffic.\n\n169\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.450\nIn other words, capture that traffic and\nmake a decision based of it.\n\n170\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:47.570\nBut the key is that it's actually doing it\nwhen, when it occurs and that is the key.\n\n171\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.440\nSo this means that if an attack goes on,\n\n172\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:56.510\nthis particular device itself gives us\nthat ability to say it's happening now.\n\n173\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.850\nLet me do something about it, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.460\nNow the IPS, and we're gonna talk about\nthis a little bit more distinctly later\n\n175\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.790\non, but it really comes down to\na couple of basics here, okay.\n\n176\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.800\nThe first one is simple.\n\n177\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.200\nWhen an IPS makes the decisions to capture\nthe traffic and to do something about it,\n\n178\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.350\nit does it based off of signatures\nthat you essentially download, and or\n\n179\n00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.050\nanomalies that kind of gives your device\na picture of what it is expecting to find.\n\n180\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.700\nSo it works really like an antivirus does\nwhen you start to really take a look.\n\n181\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.520\n&gt;&gt; So with that concept of\nkeeping those signatures and\n\n182\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.290\ndefinitions if we're using an analysis\nengine that is based up of signatures\n\n183\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.560\nit really is important to keep those\nsignatures up to date otherwise\n\n184\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.150\nyou may miss some of those zero\nday attacks have just happened.\n\n185\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:50.800\n&gt;&gt; This is why the IPS the nature of the\nIPS is usually subscription based as well.\n\n186\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.660\nThe very fact that even though you\nmight buy the appliance and they\n\n187\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.430\nmight give you a coverage for a particular\namount of time, usually about a year.\n\n188\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.580\nYou do need to update that and\nreview that, right?\n\n189\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.650\nAnd make sure that you always get\nthe latest updates and definitions.\n\n190\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.190\nAnd the key behind that, of course,\nis that once you have those definition on\n\n191\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.580\nthere, is applying them, making sure\nthat they are applied as you need them.\n\n192\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.430\nSo it is a neat concept but\nit is something we do have to think about.\n\n193\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.120\n&gt;&gt; It is really neat.\n\n194\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.900\nI think there are a couple different\ntechnologies that are really just\n\n195\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.810\nemerging that we really\nhaven't seen too much of yet.\n\n196\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.450\nDifferent types of analysis engines.\n\n197\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.350\nIf you look at I see you\nhave the anomalies there.\n\n198\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.310\nBut there's also this new concept.\n\n199\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:35.050\nI mean its been out for a little while but\nbehavioral or heuristic based where\n\n200\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:41.070\nit can almost predict or notice how,\neven subconscious reactions I saw.\n\n201\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.130\nHave you ever played\nGuitar Hero on the Wii?\n\n202\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.242\n&gt;&gt; I would say no.\n\n203\n00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:47.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, okay, so I haven't either, but\n\n204\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.930\nit was almost like a little Guitar Hero.\n\n205\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.940\nThey had a little guitar playing a game,\nand\n\n206\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.070\nhow they reacted to these\nbubbles falling down.\n\n207\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.300\nSo your response times,\nyour error rates, and things like that.\n\n208\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.470\nEssentially could be\na way to authenticate and\n\n209\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.530\nlog in, but that's just an example\nof that heuristic analysis there.\n\n210\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.740\nAnd so it just depends on your need and\n\n211\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.720\nthen which analysis engine works best for\nyou.\n\n212\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, when you're in production and\nwhen you're starting to do this thing,\n\n213\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.020\nyou do have to choose between the way\nthat your IPS will essentially work.\n\n214\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.010\nBut its basic function again comes down\nto, let me capture the information,\n\n215\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.370\nlet me make some type of analysis whether\nit's heuristic, whether it's signatures,\n\n216\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.790\nwhether it's anomaly based.\n\n217\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.570\nWhatever it might be is\nreally at that point\n\n218\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.910\nbeyond the idea of just capturing it but\nit doesn't live time and that's nice.\n\n219\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.865\nThe only other thing about this,\n\n220\n00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:40.920\nright,is that once it does that,\nit tends to drop the packets so\n\n221\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:47.350\nthat the attack can no longer be forwarded\nalong to where it needs to go, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.890\nSo by doing something like this an IPS,\nreally does take a look at that,\n\n223\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.600\nreally that idea of things that\nyou have to worry about, but\n\n224\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.170\nIPSs do not understand a lot of the other\nthings that go on inside of networks.\n\n225\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.970\nAs this takes a look, it really is just\nlooking for this information, right?\n\n226\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.450\nAnd even though heuristics can help,\nthe idea of heuristics can also lead to\n\n227\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.250\nfalse positives for\na long time before it kind of learns.\n\n228\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.650\nAnd it does take a lot of time for\n\n229\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.170\nit to kind of get up to date\nto where it needs to be.\n\n230\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo you are leaving yourself a little\nbit exposed as you start to do that.\n\n231\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.180\nBut the problem that the IPS has, which\nis why we also have the second one listed\n\n232\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.650\nhere, which is the web application\nfirewall, okay, to do this.\n\n233\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.790\nIs that you might find out that the IPS\nworks extremely well against those\n\n234\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.940\nknown types of attacks,\nwhich is great, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.578\nThe anomalies is that it again can\nsay hey,here is what regular traffic\n\n236\n00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:46.488\nshould look like,\nyou are sending me abnormal traffic,\n\n237\n00:13:46.488 --> 00:13:48.869\nI'm blocking anything that looks abnormal.\n\n238\n00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:54.158\nWhich is okay too but there is certain\ntypes of application traffic though\n\n239\n00:13:54.158 --> 00:14:00.000\nthat comes across your network that\nrequires a logic of things to work.\n\n240\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.520\nSo in other words,\nthe request patterns of things.\n\n241\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.090\nThe ability to say, hey I'm requesting\nthis and this is when I'm expecting to see\n\n242\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.400\nwhen I make this request and\nthen you return to me something else.\n\n243\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.940\nIt's like if a child asks for a banana and\n\n244\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.090\nyou give them an apple,\nthey may not be satisfied with that.\n\n245\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.770\nThe web application firewall\nessentially does the same thing.\n\n246\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.130\nSo in this particular instance,\nas a request is made over on the left-hand\n\n247\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.480\nside inside of the LAN, it can then\ngo to the firewall app and say, hey,\n\n248\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.540\nI need to retrieve this web page, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.050\nAs it goes out now,\nit proxies that request.\n\n250\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.720\nOkay, and that request says here's\nwhat you should be getting back.\n\n251\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.840\nWhen it goes out to the Internet on\nthe right hand side, and it returns it and\n\n252\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.570\nnow what is returned though is\nan attachment to a file of some sort.\n\n253\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.740\nThe web application firewall says wait a\nminute, the request said I'm getting a web\n\n254\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.070\npage and what I got back from that server\nwas a file, that's not a web page.\n\n255\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:10.850\nSo in this sense the web application\nfirewall takes a look at logic and\n\n256\n00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.948\ngoes A is supposed to also give me B,\nbut you sent me C, okay.\n\n257\n00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:21.238\nI don't like that, and when it does that\nit essential drops it, so this one instead\n\n258\n00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:26.560\nIs really based on that idea of the logic\nof the request to what is returned.\n\n259\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.830\nSo understand that this is what you\nsay that you are going to retrieve and\n\n260\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.170\nwhen it gets back other information and\nit says, nah.\n\n261\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.480\nI don't think that this\nis what should be done.\n\n262\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.480\nThis is when IPS cannot understand and do.\n\n263\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.421\nSo this is instead what\nyou're actually looking for.\n\n264\n00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:46.801\nThe key here in understanding this\nmethodology is why we would choose to use\n\n265\n00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:49.304\nthis over something else like Wire Shark,\n\n266\n00:15:49.304 --> 00:15:52.937\nlike what we were talking about\nas far as a method of analysis.\n\n267\n00:15:52.937 --> 00:15:55.775\nBut it comes down to what\nwe need to happen, right,\n\n268\n00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:57.964\nthe purpose of what has to happen here.\n\n269\n00:15:57.964 --> 00:16:01.397\nThe idea of actually capturing\nthe packets at this point,\n\n270\n00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:05.811\nwhen we start talking about the in-line\ntraffic interrogation, I'd say\n\n271\n00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:11.550\nI'm not really interested in the very fact\nof, who sent this and what's going on?\n\n272\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.970\nI'm needing to stop it.\n\n273\n00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.400\nThat's what I'm needing to do.\n\n274\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.590\nI'm needing to make sure that bad requests\nor a legitimate request that gets\n\n275\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.220\nsent out doesn't return a bad return,\nyeah, response.\n\n276\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:30.050\nSo, when I think about this, the idea is\nsome type of in-line traffic interrogation\n\n277\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.580\nis about stopping some type of attack,\n\n278\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.020\nsome type of thing that I really\ndon't want on my network.\n\n279\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.422\nIt's not about analysis so much,\ncan you do analysis from the information?\n\n280\n00:16:40.422 --> 00:16:43.350\nYes, of course,\nyou can do analysis from the information.\n\n281\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.930\nBut the goal is fairly simple.\n\n282\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.650\nStop it.\n\n283\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.560\nI really don't care.\n\n284\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.620\nI just want to make sure it doesn't happen\nat least through the perimeter here.\n\n285\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.190\nSo that's what we actually end up seeing.\n\n286\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.800\nSo, that is kind of the first\n\n287\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.290\nof the types of different methods that\nwe wanna make sure that we understand.\n\n288\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.770\nThis one is all about that.\n\n289\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.553\nIt's all about stopping\nthe overall thing from happening.\n\n290\n00:17:06.553 --> 00:17:10.349\nSo one of those methods is clear, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.899\nNow, there are other methods that are out\nthere and we've kind of used them as\n\n292\n00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:19.140\nwell but let's make sure that we also\ntake a look at them as well, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.550\nNow, this one most of us may have kind\nof heard of or may not have heard of.\n\n294\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.420\nAnd the reason why is that,\n\n295\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.330\nthese are relatively expensive\nin what they do instead.\n\n296\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.850\nAnd that is what we call a network tap,\nT-A-P.\n\n297\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.280\nNow, I know this is strange as\nI was typing this out earlier.\n\n298\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.270\nI, for some reason thought that\nthis was a terminal access point.\n\n299\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.310\nNow I was like, that sounds right but\nthen as I remember that it's not.\n\n300\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.755\nIt's actually Test Access Point.\n\n301\n00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:47.729\nNow you might be saying,\nRonnie, of course,\n\n302\n00:17:47.729 --> 00:17:50.820\nI can read why you're emphasizing this?\n\n303\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.480\nWell, don't forget some of the weirdest\nquestions that may come are just,\n\n304\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.320\nyou recognize what this device is and\nyou actually know the proper acronym.\n\n305\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.100\nTerminal Access Point is not\nthe same as Test Access Point, so\n\n306\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.870\nthat may just be a single very easy\nquestion that you can get right on your\n\n307\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.280\nSecurity Fundamentals exam,\njust by doing some of that, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.570\nSo, how in the world does\nthis methodology work out?\n\n309\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.520\nWell, I wanted to make sure\nthat you understood, of course,\n\n310\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.035\njust regular direct cabling, right?\n\n311\n00:18:20.035 --> 00:18:25.004\nWe've connect router one to router two,\nit allows us to send traffic both ways\n\n312\n00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:29.697\non that one connection, it makes sense,\neverything is actually great.\n\n313\n00:18:29.697 --> 00:18:34.260\nBut, if I actually implement\na network TAP though,\n\n314\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.030\nI am now putting in a device\nin the center here and then,\n\n315\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:45.020\nthe cabling of each of my routers\nonly goes directly to the TAP.\n\n316\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.800\nIt's exactly like it sounds like.\n\n317\n00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.170\nI am tapping the line-\n&gt;&gt; A wiretap.\n\n318\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.890\n&gt;&gt; In between.\n\n319\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever watched Burn Notice?\n\n320\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.119\n&gt;&gt; I have watched Burn Notice.\n\n321\n00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.403\n&gt;&gt; It's like Michael West and\nstuff right here, right?\n\n322\n00:18:53.403 --> 00:18:55.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much it is.\n\n323\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.241\nIt is very much the idea of the same\nthing as As some type of spy-\n\n324\n00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Espionage.\n\n325\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe goal behind this is strange, right?\n\n326\n00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:10.180\nWhereas the in-line traffic\ninterrogation is all about stopping it,\n\n327\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.800\nthis offers no ability\nto stop the traffic.\n\n328\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.430\nSo, in between router one, router two,\nwherever you place this TAP In between\n\n329\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:24.760\nrouter one and your LAN, whatever you\nchose to do, is not stopping anything.\n\n330\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.610\n&gt;&gt; So this is just like\na passive form of analysis.\n\n331\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.350\n&gt;&gt; It can be.\n\n332\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.140\nBut this is not even an analysis yet,\nright?\n\n333\n00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.580\nThe only thing that it is doing\nis actually going to make a copy\n\n334\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.980\nof everything that flows through\nthat particular connection okay?\n\n335\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.421\nSo if it is going from router\none all the way to router two,\n\n336\n00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:46.726\nit will make a copy of that traffic and\nsent it down to whatever computers\n\n337\n00:19:46.726 --> 00:19:51.137\nrunning whatever your analysis tool is,\nokay, so that's make sense.\n\n338\n00:19:51.137 --> 00:19:55.809\nThen, if you're sending it back the other\nway, it will do the same thing and\n\n339\n00:19:55.809 --> 00:19:58.802\nmake a copy of it and\nsend it back this way as well,\n\n340\n00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:02.990\nokay, so what we're actually\ngetting is all the traffic.\n\n341\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.170\n&gt;&gt; So this is where it kind\nof gets a little fuzzy.\n\n342\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.290\nSometimes you'll see it before notice,\n\n343\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.240\na packet analyzer versus\na packet capture utility.\n\n344\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.308\nSo just to be clear,\nif a utility is simply capturing and\n\n345\n00:20:13.308 --> 00:20:16.769\nthen doesn't have any kind of filters or\nmethods to go ahead and\n\n346\n00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:20.451\nanalyze that traffic then,\nit's just a packet capture utility.\n\n347\n00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:26.451\nWhereas, you'll also see a lot of\ndevices and software that are called\n\n348\n00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:32.210\npacket analysis devices which capture and\nallow the analysis.\n\n349\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's kind of the key as well, right?\n\n350\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.810\nThe very fact of,\n\n351\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.860\nwe used to call them just packet\nsniffers is what we called them, right?\n\n352\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.460\n&gt;&gt; True, there you go.\n\n353\n00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.375\nAnd then you've got\nthat whole other route-\n\n354\n00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:42.110\n&gt;&gt; That packet analyzer.\n\n355\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Plus,\nthere's actually those like an alpha card.\n\n356\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.730\nIt's a physical hardware and\nit's just sniffing.\n\n357\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.820\nSo, you kind of have to understand\na little differentiation between\n\n358\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.750\nthose terms.\n\n359\n00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is and of course, Cisco\nnow introduces the term network TAP or\n\n360\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.190\nTAP itself.\n\n361\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:03.240\nAnd, our key here is understanding that\nthis particular tool in what it does and\n\n362\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:09.550\nlet me emphasize this one here\nif I can is the word Copies,\n\n363\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.690\nall of the data yeah, is the idea, right?\n\n364\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:18.460\nSo a network TAP, it doesn't do\nanything to slow down the traffic.\n\n365\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.340\nIt doesn't do anything\nto analyze the traffic.\n\n366\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.720\nIt essentially says, if you pass through\nme, I'm going to copy the traffic, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.620\nNow, the other thing that it does,\n\n368\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.200\nright, is that once it copies it,\nit can send it to an analyzer tool.\n\n369\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.456\nIt usually has to.\n\n370\n00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:38.326\nYou don't have to, it can capture it and\ncache it right there but,\n\n371\n00:21:38.326 --> 00:21:39.860\nwhy are you capturing it?\n\n372\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.433\n&gt;&gt; Then what's the point, yeah.\n\n373\n00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:41.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well if you're not going to\n\n374\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.480\nanalyze it at some point here.\n\n375\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.470\nAnd if you get everything going across\nthose links, right, the very fact is,\n\n376\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.830\nyou need to be able to analyze it, filter\nit down to the information that you need.\n\n377\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.620\nIf not, you may find out that it's\nactually more than you bargained for.\n\n378\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:03.400\nAnd too much data, okay, is probably\nthe same as not enough data, right?\n\n379\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.710\nOne is overwhelming and\n\n380\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.180\nthen you have to sift through\neverything that may not be relevant.\n\n381\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.850\nWhereas, if it's too little data,\n\n382\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.940\nyou don't have enough data to sift through\nto get the information that you want.\n\n383\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.140\nBoth are inefficient.\n\n384\n00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.620\nBoth are essentially, terrible ideas.\n\n385\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:23.700\nSo the goal here, in terms of TAP though,\nis that we want to capture everything.\n\n386\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.649\nAnd by using this, because it's normally\na physical device in between it really\n\n387\n00:22:28.649 --> 00:22:33.114\nhelps because it is a high speed passive\ndevice the majority of the time.\n\n388\n00:22:33.114 --> 00:22:36.746\nThere are active TAPs that are out\nthere but on the passive TAPs,\n\n389\n00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:40.914\nit means that the only time you really\nhave to worry about anything is if you\n\n390\n00:22:40.914 --> 00:22:44.940\nhappen to break the connection,\nthe physical connection.\n\n391\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.340\nPassive ones don't even normally require\nany electricity to go through them,\n\n392\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.530\nit really can handle everything at wire\nspeed the way that it needs to, so\n\n393\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.820\nit really is a good thing for us.\n\n394\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.800\n&gt;&gt; But we would actually need to have\nthat physical access because here,\n\n395\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.180\nyou're actually tapping into that\nphysical wired connection, right Ronnie?\n\n396\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.030\n&gt;&gt; You definitely have to and of course,\n\n397\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.720\nif you wanna do it with multiple devices,\nyou're gonna end up seeing that\n\n398\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.358\nit's gonna be more expensive\nwhen it comes down to it, okay?\n\n399\n00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:15.190\nAll right, so let's talk about\nthat one that you and I used,\n\n400\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:20.430\nCherokee, in a show earlier in our\nseries which is what we call SPAN.\n\n401\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.020\nCisco calls it SPAN.\n\n402\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.115\nWe call it port mirroring or\ntraffic mirroring instead.\n\n403\n00:23:25.115 --> 00:23:28.680\nIt's kind of the key that we want.\n\n404\n00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.780\nAnd, here is the keyword for\n\n405\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.870\nthis one right here which is gonna\nbe the term duplicates traffic.\n\n406\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.025\nNow, I want us to make sure\nthat we understand, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:41.857\nNetwork TAPS makes a copy\nof everything and then,\n\n408\n00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:45.880\ncan send it on to the analyzer\ntool that's running.\n\n409\n00:23:47.311 --> 00:23:51.453\nSPAN though,\nactively duplicates the data of\n\n410\n00:23:51.453 --> 00:23:56.029\nwhatever port we choose or\nports we choose to copy.\n\n411\n00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:58.770\nAnd send to a single port now.\n\n412\n00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.880\nLet me tell you why this can be good and\nwhy this can be bad at the same time.\n\n413\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.090\nSo when we talk about this idea of\nduplicating from the monitored ports\n\n414\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.290\nto a decision port that can be monitored,\nthere's a couple of things that go on.\n\n415\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.690\nLet's kinda give a real world example.\n\n416\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.670\nIf I have a 35 50 switch, for\nexample, which I have right here.\n\n417\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.790\nIf I have that and\n\n418\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.740\nI now have, I think this is a 48\nport switch, or I think it's 24.\n\n419\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.870\nLet me check.\n\n420\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.910\nYeah, it's 24, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.420\nSo I just wanna make\nsure I was right here.\n\n422\n00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.320\nIt's a 24 port switch.\n\n423\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.530\nAnd I have a 100 megabit port\nthat is connected to my laptop\n\n424\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.840\nthat is running Wireshark.\n\n425\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.090\nIf I wanted to, I could implement SPAN,\nwhich is, again, port mirroring.\n\n426\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.760\nPort mirroring essentially says, hey,\n\n427\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.100\nwhat data do you want me to duplicate and\nsend to that one port?\n\n428\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.750\nI could do an interface range command and\nsay look I want ports three through 24\n\n429\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:04.320\nto be duplicated and sent to port number\ntwo where this one is actually connected.\n\n430\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.600\nSounds great except that\nthey're all 100 megabit ports.\n\n431\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:14.370\nIf I'm connecting in at 100 megabits and\nnow if I had every other port filled up.\n\n432\n00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.400\nAnd they were constantly communicating and\nchattering on the network.\n\n433\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.470\nThat is a lot of traffic, then,\nthat's trying to go to one port.\n\n434\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.410\nSo you can oversubscribe that port\nvery easily if you're not careful.\n\n435\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.830\nSo you have to actually be very\ncareful with the idea SPAN.\n\n436\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.500\nIt can return to you some information,\nwe did see that earlier in our episode.\n\n437\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.020\nBut, you do have to be careful\non the ports that you monitor,\n\n438\n00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.960\neven some of what we did earlier and this\nis the example that I am using right here\n\n439\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.900\nis that we were essentially just saying\nhey I want a port mirror in the trunk.\n\n440\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.950\nThe trunk allows me to capture all of\n\n441\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:56.040\nthe traffic going across the trunk\nregardless of what vlan that they are in,\n\n442\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.670\nI can send a duplicate of\nthat to this port right here.\n\n443\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:05.640\nAnd if I running Wireshark I get that\nability then to see all of those packets\n\n444\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.080\ngoing across the trunk port.\n\n445\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.150\nNow when I say that, the caveat is this.\n\n446\n00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.780\nIt doesn't do everything\nsingle packet of traffic.\n\n447\n00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.540\nLike the network tap would do.\n\n448\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.590\nInstead, it says, hey,\nthere were like 1,000 sent,\n\n449\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.910\nbut I only sent you 907 of them.\n\n450\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.520\nAnd you're like, why.\n\n451\n00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.880\nWell, if it's a duplicate,\n\n452\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.320\nif it's a corrupted packet that went\nacross it just drops that stuff.\n\n453\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.100\nIt says, nah, if it's malformed it says,\nyeah, I'm not even going to try and\n\n454\n00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.180\nduplicate that.\n\n455\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.040\nIt just decides to drop\nanything like that.\n\n456\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.890\nSo in that sense,\nyou're not gonna get everything, but\n\n457\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.420\nyou will get some of\nthe things that go across.\n\n458\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.950\nSo what are we actually\ntrying to do with this one?\n\n459\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.110\nWe're trying to be very specific,\nokay, and\n\n460\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.470\nthis is why we actually need to\ntalk about this idea of filtering.\n\n461\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.450\nAnd we probably don't want to actually\ndo this with every single port or\n\n462\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.870\neven a trunk a lot of times.\n\n463\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.230\nWe'd rather actually say, whoa wait\na minute, that's a ton of traffic.\n\n464\n00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:11.290\nDo I have enough bandwidth here to be\nable to run the capture that I need?\n\n465\n00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.920\nAnd you'll probably find that\nyou may not have it all.\n\n466\n00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.420\nSo on this particular methodology,\nit's because you're looking for\n\n467\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.240\nsomething specific,\nis what you're looking for.\n\n468\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.130\nYou're trying to figure something out.\n\n469\n00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.740\nNow can you use this because\nit's the only thing you have?\n\n470\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.990\nYes, okay?\n\n471\n00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.200\nDo you have to realize that you may get a\nlot of retransmits, in other words things\n\n472\n00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.500\naren't actually going as fast because\nit's dropping off a lot of stuff.\n\n473\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.710\nBecause it can hit the CPU pretty hard.\n\n474\n00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.320\nIf this thing is operating on a full\ngigabit and you're actually taking up\n\n475\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.040\na gigabit, you're maxing the CPU out when\nyou're saying well, I'm really expecting\n\n476\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.860\nyou to work at two gigs because I need you\nto duplicate that and send it over here.\n\n477\n00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.680\nAnd you're on a hundred megabit port?\n\n478\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.980\nOuch, that's a lot of traffic\nto kind of jam through that.\n\n479\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.010\nSo Wireshark will only take as\nmuch as it can get fed into it.\n\n480\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.870\nAnd if it's only at a hundred megabits and\nyou've got gigabits of\n\n481\n00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.590\ndata coming through, you're gonna\nhave some port droppage there too.\n\n482\n00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.640\nSo just kind of remember the idea behind,\nor course the packet capture\n\n483\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.250\nmethods that we use, is what is\nthe purpose behind what we're doing here.\n\n484\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.500\nOne, like we take a look at,\nof course is blocking everything.\n\n485\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.700\nTwo, is the idea here that we\nare going to copy everything and\n\n486\n00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.620\nwe need to take all of it and\ndo some kind of analysis on.\n\n487\n00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.730\nThree, we're really looking for\nsomething specific here, and so\n\n488\n00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.960\nwe might use some like SPAN to\nreally focus in on what we need, and\n\n489\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.190\nto limit the amount of\ntraffic going over that.\n\n490\n00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.650\nMost of the time, you may just put that in\non one port instead of every port instead.\n\n491\n00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.070\nCuz you're trying to find out if this\nparticular port is doing what it needs to.\n\n492\n00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Ronnie for\ntaking the time to explain in line traffic\n\n493\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.010\ninterrogation, taps and\ncopying and z-reference.\n\n494\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.620\nAnd also looking at port mirroring.\n\n495\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.630\nWell, when we capture\nall of this information.\n\n496\n00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.650\nI'm not really sure what\nto do with everything.\n\n497\n00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.800\nBut I have a feeling we're gonna take\na look at that in the next episode.\n\n498\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800\nSo stay tuned and\nwe'll look at some traffic analysis.\n\n499\n00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.210\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n500\n00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.730\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n501\n00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:02.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n502\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.410\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n503\n00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:11.926\n[MUSIC]\n\n504\n00:29:11.926 --> 00:29:14.668\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:10.000\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals Theories.\n\n5\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.970\nIn the previous episode, we examined\ndifferent methods of packet capturing.\n\n7\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.040\nIn this episode,\nwe will be looking at analysis output.\n\n8\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.130\nSo with us today in studios\nwe have Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.920\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on to take a look at.\n\n11\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.130\nA little bit more in the idea of packet\ncapture and the idea of analysis here.\n\n12\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.650\nRemember that in a previous episode\nwe talked about this idea of\n\n13\n00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.300\ndifferent methods, right?\n\n14\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.580\nCapturing packets is really one of\nthe fundamental techniques that we must\n\n15\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.450\nbe able to use or methodologies we must\nuse, when we start to analyze traffic.\n\n16\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.860\nAnalysis of traffic can tell us whether or\nnot we're consuming too much bandwidth,\n\n17\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.340\nwhether or not we actually have to\nwork on other networking issues,\n\n18\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.630\nprotocols that are being\nsent across a network.\n\n19\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.690\nYou name it there is so\nmuch to be learned, and\n\n20\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.830\nthere's entire courses that you\ncan take just on the idea here of\n\n21\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.530\npacked at capturing,\nand doing the analysis.\n\n22\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.360\nAnd some if you may want to consider when\nyou start to move a little bit further on\n\n23\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.960\nto your security crew.\n\n24\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.290\nBecause it is essential that you at\nleast have the basic foundation down for\n\n25\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.052\nthe fundamentals and\nalso for Cisco Cyber Ops.\n\n26\n00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:32.720\nBecause you have to be able to take a look\nat that data, but at the same time,\n\n27\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.159\nyou wanna learn more about it so\nthat you can get used to doing this, and\n\n28\n00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.880\nit becomes second nature.\n\n29\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.910\nAnd that's where it becomes\na little bit harder.\n\n30\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.860\nSo today we are picking up from where we\ntalked about in a previous episode where\n\n31\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.030\nwe look at the methodology that we use.\n\n32\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.220\nAnd now we're gonna talk about how we\ntake a look at the analysis as output,\n\n33\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.110\nto show us information that\nwe need to be able to see.\n\n34\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.230\nAnd we of course, are primarily\ngoing to use Wireshark because,\n\n35\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.560\nwell it's a very simple tool, it's free,\n\n36\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.210\nit's something that's a standard inside\nof the industry, a de facto standard.\n\n37\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.380\nAnd it's something you have to really\nmake sure that you kind of get your\n\n38\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.370\nfeet wet in it.\n\n39\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.080\nSo that is where we are going to begin.\n\n40\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.230\nNow we're gonna take a look at\nit of course in using span and\n\n41\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.380\nalso talking about\nthe idea of using NetFlow.\n\n42\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.750\nBut at the beginning we need to talk about\nthe use of network taps again, and make\n\n43\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.480\nsure that we understand what the analysis\nof what it is that we have to be able to\n\n44\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.250\ndo, to make it work and make sure that\nwe understand those fundamentals there.\n\n45\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.700\nSo let's go back to my diagram.\n\n46\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.488\nAnd as we pick up, we saw this exact\nsame diagram in a previous episode.\n\n47\n00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.650\nBut I wanna make sure we point\nout a couple of other things that\n\n48\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.020\nI didn't mention on purpose.\n\n49\n00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.210\nCuz I was like, I need to save that for\n\n50\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.920\nthis show to make sure that we\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n51\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.316\nRemember that in this particular aspect\nwhen we start talking about the TAPs and\n\n52\n00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:53.180\nthe test access points,\nthen it is really another central device\n\n53\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.580\nthat we put in between where\nwe want our data to flow.\n\n54\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.930\nSo that a copy of all the data\nthat flows between those devices.\n\n55\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.260\nWill get captured, and\nthen once it does that,\n\n56\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.650\nit will copy it and\nas it all flows through the TAP, and\n\n57\n00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.260\nit sends it on to these network\nanalyzer tool that was running.\n\n58\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.960\nNow when we start to use\nsomething like this,\n\n59\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.350\nnotice here Cherokee,\nanything unusual about this diagram?\n\n60\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.820\n&gt;&gt; Maybe just the double arrows there?\n\n61\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAs you take a look at this idea,\n\n62\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.230\nI do show two different connections\n\n63\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.870\ngoing directly to this analyzer\ntool that's running whatever it is,\n\n64\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.360\nI know I'm gonna be using something\nlike Wireshark if I were doing it.\n\n65\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.470\nBut it could be any tool\nthat you actually use.\n\n66\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.200\nBut at this point, yes, two different\nconnections running through there.\n\n67\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.080\nYou have a clue on why we would actually\nneed something two different connections\n\n68\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.230\ngoing to that analyzer tool.\n\n69\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.980\n&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure what\nwe're trying to represent here.\n\n70\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.610\nMy guess would be that we are signifying\nsome type of load balancing\n\n71\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.980\nto assist with that traffic.\n\n72\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first time I looked\nat a diagram like this I thought\n\n73\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.200\nthe same thing.\n\n74\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.060\nMaybe it's just so much traffic that it\nneeds to load balance across these two.\n\n75\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.884\nBut also notice that I brought up this as\nbeing single headed arrows as well which\n\n76\n00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:06.126\nindicate unidirectional traffic.\n\n77\n00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:09.579\nSo it's not load balancing anything\nthat with unidirectional traffic,\n\n78\n00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.101\nit doesn't seem to make sense.\n\n79\n00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:13.970\nCuz, it would have to kind of balance\nthat out of sending and receiving and\n\n80\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.280\ngetting everything done.\n\n81\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.900\nBut what this is actually\nshowing us though,\n\n82\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.340\nis that it needs two connections for\na couple of reasons.\n\n83\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.350\nAnd let me talk about this\nunidirectional traffic first.\n\n84\n00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.410\nThe way that the different\nTAPs end up working and\n\n85\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.270\nthe analysis that we get is that we\ndon't drop any packets at all none.\n\n86\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.740\nAnd the reason why we\ndon't drop any packets is,\n\n87\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.900\nbecause we're not having to also compete\nwith traffic going the other way.\n\n88\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.440\nBecause only receiving\ntraffic on this end.\n\n89\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.490\nThe TAP essentially sends\nout the data here and\n\n90\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.630\nwe don't have any return traffic out.\n\n91\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.590\nSo the analyzer tool doesn't do any art\n\n92\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.830\nbroadcast doesn't do\nany type of broadcast.\n\n93\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.000\nIt's not trying to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n94\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.290\nIt's nowhere near any type of congestion\nat all it's designed to do that.\n\n95\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.490\nSo you not only have these two\nphysical ports here that connect\n\n96\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.390\nthe network devices that you\nwere trying to TAP into but\n\n97\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.400\nyou also have these two other TAPs here.\n\n98\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.410\nAnd what each one of them\nends up representing is,\n\n99\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.420\nwell all of the traffic from router one\nwill go over one link and it can send,\n\n100\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.570\nand it can see both send and receive\ntraffic cause it gets a copy of it.\n\n101\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.350\nAnd then all the traffic\nover here on router two,\n\n102\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.730\nwill go over the other link, so\nthat way you have true dedicated bandwidth\n\n103\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.870\nbetween what you see from router two,\nand also router one.\n\n104\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.390\nSo that way you are not\nmissing any traffic at all.\n\n105\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.900\nSo this tool is designed to copy all of\nit and not drop any packets at all And\n\n106\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.280\nthat means you will receive a ton of data,\nand this is where the analysis comes in.\n\n107\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.810\nYou actually get many more packets,\n\n108\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.200\nmuch more information than you would\nnormally get from even just Wireshark.\n\n109\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.900\nThis was actually give you tons more cuz,\nyou are gonna get it at wire speed.\n\n110\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.420\nSo if each of these\nare gigabit ports that means,\n\n111\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.448\nthey are sending two gigs\nof data down this so.\n\n112\n00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.830\nYour monitoring machine\nhere also will need two\n\n113\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.625\nNICs to receive that traffic as well.\n\n114\n00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:13.390\n&gt;&gt; And those NICs, I'm just assuming\nthat they would need to be at\n\n115\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.636\nleast the speed of the transmitting\ndevice in order to handle that capacity.\n\n116\n00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Normally it is or you might need a\nspecial NIC, it depends on the TAP itself,\n\n117\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.750\nso some of these TAPs also\ncomes with another NIC.\n\n118\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.870\nFor whatever your analyzer tool\nis running on or it may even\n\n119\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.830\nbe a special device from them because\nthey are designed to work that fast.\n\n120\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.220\nThey are trying to not slow anything down.\n\n121\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.040\nSo in the analysis of everything that\nyou get this is where it becomes more\n\n122\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.500\nimportant that you take a look\nat the amount of information.\n\n123\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.650\nAnd then whatever your analysis is,\n\n124\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.530\nyou've got to know exactly\nwhat you're looking for here.\n\n125\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.080\nI don't really have an example of\na TAP analysis because these devices\n\n126\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.220\nare expensive and\nwe just don't have one lying around here.\n\n127\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.590\nBut just kind of realize, you can look at\nit on things Wireshark if you choose to,\n\n128\n00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.170\nand you would just use the filtering\ntechnique to make sure that you see\n\n129\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.725\nthe information that\nyou need to see on it.\n\n130\n00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:08.980\nBut that's kind of the key when you\ntake a look at the analysis here,\n\n131\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.650\nits trying to get every single bit of data\nthat you actually need to come across and\n\n132\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.550\nits not hindering any other regular\ntraffic going across that connection.\n\n133\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.910\nSo it's all about true\ndata visibility here, and\n\n134\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.650\nthat is a key term that we're gonna run\nacross in a little bit of time here.\n\n135\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.250\nIt is that in security terms, right?\n\n136\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.900\nThese TAP and\nthe idea of packet filtering.\n\n137\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.570\nWell, most of the time when we take a look\nat packet filtering we're really only\n\n138\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.480\nlooking at the header information.\n\n139\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.115\nMost of us are not looking\ninto the data itself.\n\n140\n00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:49.420\nWhen you think about where malware and\nstuff occurs, it's not in the actual\n\n141\n00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.277\nheader information a lot of times\neven though it actually can be.\n\n142\n00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:55.225\nWhat you're looking for\nis those malformed packets,\n\n143\n00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.537\nthe information that's changed inside.\n\n144\n00:07:57.537 --> 00:08:00.831\nAnd a TAP can allow you to\ngather the entire packet.\n\n145\n00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:05.739\nAnd actually inspect all of that at\nwhat we call true data visibility,\n\n146\n00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:09.650\nis what the TAP really\ngives us the ability to do.\n\n147\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.760\nSo you can have very high end machines\nthat will show you everything and\n\n148\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.120\nanalyze every single line and code in it.\n\n149\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.080\nBut this is what gives it to you and\nyou don't lose anything and that has key.\n\n150\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.280\nNo drop pockets here by\nusing TAPs is the key.\n\n151\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.100\nA tool that we used earlier in\nan episode instead just to show that we\n\n152\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.420\ncould do some type of traffic,\nof pocket filtering and pocket capturing.\n\n153\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.110\nIs gonna be the use of\nwhat we call a SPAN here.\n\n154\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.941\nAnd we were gonna mention that in the\nepisode right before this one as far as\n\n155\n00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:39.634\na sequence goes.\n\n156\n00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:45.570\nBut this particular one is actually\nsomething that we have to worry about.\n\n157\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.350\nEspecially as our Cisco\nequipment gets older.\n\n158\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.820\nIt's lovely, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.000\nIt's really great if you have the latest\nand greatest Cisco equipment.\n\n160\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.628\nAnd you replace it on an end of\nlife cycle every three years.\n\n161\n00:08:57.628 --> 00:09:01.340\nAnd you're never really\nfar behind on technology.\n\n162\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.873\nBut there are a lot of\nshops that you go into.\n\n163\n00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:06.331\nThat the equipment that you're working\non is probably the equipment that was\n\n164\n00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.083\naround before.\n\n165\n00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:10.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might have even entered into the IT\n\n166\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.270\nfield and\nyou're still having to work on it.\n\n167\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.014\nAnd that's true.\n\n168\n00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:14.890\nLike there's 35 50 over here.\n\n169\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.810\nIt's a great switch.\n\n170\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.514\nIt's what I actually learned how\nto do a lot of my networking,\n\n171\n00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:20.340\nas far the switching technology came on.\n\n172\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.300\nAnd I still see it in production today.\n\n173\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.689\nAnd now you're talking about 10, 11,\n\n174\n00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.411\n12 years ago when I was\nworking on these things.\n\n175\n00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:33.690\nAnd even then, it was kind of\na retiring technology at that point.\n\n176\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.730\nSo, the nice thing is, I told you that\nthese devices are built rock solid.\n\n177\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.240\nBut, at the same time, they're actually\nkind of way behind in terms of bandwidth.\n\n178\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.191\nA lot of times for neuro networks go.\n\n179\n00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.860\nAnd even though they work and\nthey'll function the way they want to.\n\n180\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.113\n&gt;&gt; Just a little dated with technology.\n\n181\n00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:52.520\n&gt;&gt; They're a little bit dated, but\nyou know, but most companies say,\n\n182\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.760\nit's still working, why replace it?\n\n183\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.870\nCuz it's really hard to actually\ndecommission something that is working.\n\n184\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.643\nSo remember that here in SPAN,\nit makes a duplicate of the traffic.\n\n185\n00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:04.230\nAnd this is where we\nhave to worry about it.\n\n186\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.220\nSo two things happen here, right?\n\n187\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.460\nWith the duplication of traffic, that\nmeans the CPU usage can get pegged out\n\n188\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.900\nif you're duplicating a ton of traffic.\n\n189\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.540\nWith that duplication and then telling it,\n\n190\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.060\nit needs to forward that\nduplicate to another port.\n\n191\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.240\nYou can also oversubscribed that port\n\n192\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.080\nmeaning that port is 100 megabit port and\nyou're sending 200 megs over.\n\n193\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.560\nIt can drop packets, it normally does.\n\n194\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.820\nYou have to kinda get that idea.\n\n195\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.810\nSo you can oversubscribed easily.\n\n196\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.776\nIf you tend to send too much data,\npackets can even just be dropped.\n\n197\n00:10:37.776 --> 00:10:41.420\nBecause it's like,\nI don't know what else yo do with it.\n\n198\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.560\nNow, form packets, broken packets,\n\n199\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.410\nlike that, that never gets captured\nin compared to the idea of TAPS.\n\n200\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.750\nAny of that stuff that happens\nwhere it's a regula stuff,\n\n201\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.280\nwe'll still capture all of it so\nthat we can analyze it later on.\n\n202\n00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.120\nAnd the idea of using\nsomething like SPAN or\n\n203\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.088\ncopying this traffic,\nit is not going to work.\n\n204\n00:10:58.088 --> 00:10:59.662\nBut this is one that we can show you.\n\n205\n00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:04.495\nAnd show you some of the breakdowns of\nwhat happens here when you start to see\n\n206\n00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:07.030\nsomething like this too.\n\n207\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.460\nSo let me go ahead and change over.\n\n208\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.238\nLet me see if I can find my switch again.\n\n209\n00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:14.410\nSo make sure, and\n\n210\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.320\nI already configured this cuz the goal\nhere is not for you to configure that.\n\n211\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.330\nYou wanna learn how to do it, make sure\nyou check out the CCNA security show.\n\n212\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.500\nWe actually go over there as well\nas the CCNA routing and switching.\n\n213\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.130\nAnd you'll see that.\n\n214\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:33.755\nBut if I type in a show monitor\nsession one, you'll see session one.\n\n215\n00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:38.192\nAnd it will tell you the source\nport here is going to be Fa0/1 and\n\n216\n00:11:38.192 --> 00:11:41.090\nthat is a trunk going to my router.\n\n217\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.060\nAnd then I am sending it\nto Fa0/2 which is gonna be\n\n218\n00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.560\ndirectly connected to my computer.\n\n219\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.700\nI've got Cherokee's computer connected,\nI think to VLAN 20.\n\n220\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.120\nAnd then, I have a virtual\nmachine connected to VLAN 10.\n\n221\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.130\nSo it's quite a love\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fancy\n\n222\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.416\n&gt;&gt; Setup just for the two or\n\n223\n00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:01.612\nthree steps that we're gonna show you.\n\n224\n00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:05.537\nBut it does take a little bit of time for\nus to get used to.\n\n225\n00:12:05.537 --> 00:12:09.920\nSo before I've do anything else,\nlet's make sure we understand logical.\n\n226\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.030\nWhatever goes over Fa0/1,\nwhich is the trunk.\n\n227\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.798\nWhich means the traffic that Cherokee\nwill send in VLAN 20 going up to trunk.\n\n228\n00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:21.131\nAnd then coming back out the trunk into\n\n229\n00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:25.680\nVLAN 10 where I have\na web server connected.\n\n230\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.460\nAll of that should be captured.\n\n231\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.154\nSo, on that trunk, I may able to capture\neverything even though we're actually in\n\n232\n00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:31.970\ntwo distinctive VLANs.\n\n233\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.810\nWe talked about data visibility in VLANs.\n\n234\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.120\nNormally, when data's actually in one\nVLAN it's actually going to be not\n\n235\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.360\nvisible at all.\n\n236\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.270\nAnd data in another VLANs\nshouldn't be visible, so\n\n237\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.690\nyou shouldn't be able to cross out.\n\n238\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.920\nSo that's actually kind of the key here.\n\n239\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.069\nIf everything is set up correctly,\n\n240\n00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:50.799\nI should then be able to\ngo to Wireshark here.\n\n241\n00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:52.783\nAnd I'm gonna continue without saving.\n\n242\n00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:57.350\nAnd it's gonna begin to capture\ndata in the background.\n\n243\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.640\nSo, as I do something like this here,\n\n244\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.160\nI'm going to get Cherokee to\nconnect to that web server.\n\n245\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.600\nSo, Cherokee will just\nconnect to the web server.\n\n246\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.000\nI don't know if we have that up or not.\n\n247\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.080\nBut as we start seeing the data here,\n\n248\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.650\nwhat should happen is that Cherokee should\nbe able to connect to that web server.\n\n249\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.360\nAnd hopefully,\nshe'll tell me when she does.\n\n250\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.090\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n251\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.800\nGive me one moment here.\n\n252\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n253\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.620\nSo, she is going to connect, and\n\n254\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.460\nwe're actually just capturing all\nthe data that's coming across right now.\n\n255\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm connected.\n\n256\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.870\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat we should start seeing is, yep,\n\n257\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.540\na little bit more traffic\ngoing across there.\n\n258\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.050\nAnd trying to find that out.\n\n259\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.740\nAnd then, go ahead and\nclose out of that connection.\n\n260\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.570\nAnd now I'm going to stop here.\n\n261\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.910\nAll right, so\nnow I've stopped the capture.\n\n262\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:51.112\nAnd then, I am going to apply\nthe filter of HTTP and press Enter.\n\n263\n00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:53.910\nAnd now you're starting to see something.\n\n264\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.550\nUsually, we get a lot more packets\nwhen we start to take a look at HTTP.\n\n265\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.390\nAs we actually make that connection to\nseveral different requests that goes on.\n\n266\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.740\nAnd you can see right here at the top as\nI did that, it changed it to bootp for\n\n267\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.820\none reason or another.\n\n268\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.490\nBut we are seeing HTTP right here.\n\n269\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.765\nI don't know, that's weird.\n\n270\n00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:16.918\nBut as I did this, you can see this is\nfrom Cherokees computer the 47.100.\n\n271\n00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:21.480\nAnd here's the destination\nthat she connected to.\n\n272\n00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.393\nHTTP getting a request and please retrieve\nthis webpage it was able to send back and\n\n273\n00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:30.325\nthen get that particularone web page,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n274\n00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:33.990\nThat's what we wanted to be able to see.\n\n275\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.390\nNow, when we start doing something like\nthis and it's an active webpage, right?\n\n276\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.010\nYou actually get some different\nchanges that will go on.\n\n277\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.770\nAnd what may also end up happening is\nthat you'll get a lot of drop packets.\n\n278\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.150\nWhere you'll see some re-transmissions and\nsome different things.\n\n279\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.955\nSo let me see, there we go so here's\nsome other things that may happen to.\n\n280\n00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:51.959\nSo let me kind of scroll in.\n\n281\n00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.774\nSo I just took the filter off in\ncase you're wondering like what did\n\n282\n00:14:54.774 --> 00:14:55.336\nhe do there.\n\n283\n00:14:55.336 --> 00:15:00.940\nAnd I'm scrolling up here to packet 41.\n\n284\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.820\nAs I start to look across here,\n\n285\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.780\nthis is where you're starting\nto see some weird things happen.\n\n286\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.110\nYou can see here in\nthe info TCP out of order.\n\n287\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.560\nNotice that, hey,\nit's port 80 is trying to connect back in.\n\n288\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.670\nSay hey I'm getting there but something\nis out of order, out of order, and\n\n289\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.870\nthen it's getting a duplicate ACK.\n\n290\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.500\nUsually, this happens at\nthe beginning of packet captures.\n\n291\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.570\nI just start seeing that.\n\n292\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.550\nAnd this is where you're starting to\nsee the dropping of packets here.\n\n293\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.298\nNotice the re-transmissions that's because\nI didn't get that please send it again.\n\n294\n00:15:30.298 --> 00:15:32.093\nThat's what we are seeing here.\n\n295\n00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:34.757\nAnd we're starting to constantly\nget a little bit more of that.\n\n296\n00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:39.751\nSo this particular one it took a little\nbit of time before it got a very simple\n\n297\n00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:40.478\nwebpage.\n\n298\n00:15:40.478 --> 00:15:43.750\nAnd then,\nit took that reassmbly here of somethings.\n\n299\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.782\nNow, just when you go Ronnie where\nin the world did you learn that?\n\n300\n00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:49.350\nWell, you can learn it in\na couple different places.\n\n301\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.610\nBut let's take a look at this duplicate\none because I know there's information\n\n302\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.401\nhere we can look at just briefly.\n\n303\n00:15:55.401 --> 00:16:00.227\nIf I take a look at the detail information\nin the bottom pane Underneath the layer\n\n304\n00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:04.132\nfour information,\nremember Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n305\n00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:06.030\nHere's our layer two.\n\n306\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.230\nHere's our layer three.\n\n307\n00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.050\nThere's our layer four information.\n\n308\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.290\nIf I go ahead and use the drop\ndown arrow and scroll out that.\n\n309\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.620\nLet me see if I can trying to scroll.\n\n310\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.480\nHere we go, a little bit down.\n\n311\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:23.890\nNotice down here at the bottom,\nit says SEQ/ACK analysis.\n\n312\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.190\nI can click on that and\nthen it tells me duplicate to ACK frame.\n\n313\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.230\nAnd it just gives me\nsome more information.\n\n314\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.810\nSo you can start seeing some\nof these unusual things here\n\n315\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.500\nwhen you start to take\na look at it more and\n\n316\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.290\nmore in detail that will help you\nout in terms of the analysis.\n\n317\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.410\nSome of it's just because we did\na really quick packet capture.\n\n318\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.330\nNormally the best thing to do is\nlet it go like two, three thousand.\n\n319\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.930\nI know I'm kind of a little bit impatient.\n\n320\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.590\nI went to 400 or 383 somewhere\naround there, is what I remember.\n\n321\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.990\nI did a little bit more here.\n\n322\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.866\nAnd then, at this point,\nthat's what you're looking for\n\n323\n00:17:02.866 --> 00:17:06.320\nis your constantly looking for\nthese unusual retransmissions because\n\n324\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.530\nit starting indicates that\nyou're dropping a lot of frames.\n\n325\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.980\nEverything is starting to happen in a way\nthat you really don't want it to happen.\n\n326\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.660\nSo that's kind of the key when you\nstart using something like span.\n\n327\n00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.000\nIt is causing your CPU to get\nchallenged a lot more, right?\n\n328\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.360\nEspecially as the more data\nthat flows through there,\n\n329\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.500\nyou have to be careful in using this.\n\n330\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.220\nSo, of course, the people that sell\nNetwork Tap say well don't use span.\n\n331\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.180\nBut you need to use them in combination.\n\n332\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.430\nIf you know exactly what you're\nlooking for, span works great.\n\n333\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.810\nBut if you're looking for\neverything, you're looking for\n\n334\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.620\nthe needle in the haystack,\nthis is not the tool that you should use.\n\n335\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.680\nCan you, to a point.\n\n336\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.410\nBut with all the retransmission and\n\n337\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.650\nthe packets that are dropped but you\ndon't even know about that were dropped,\n\n338\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.080\nyou may have dropped off stuff that you're\nreally looking for and it doesn't help.\n\n339\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.000\nSo you do have to worry\nabout stuff like that.\n\n340\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.520\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is for\nthings like general network traffic flow.\n\n341\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.100\nFor instance, if I just installed\na VOIP telephone system,\n\n342\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.730\nI'm experiencing issues with jitter and\nyou know things like that.\n\n343\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.610\nI could utilize a tool like\nWireshark where it's nonessential\n\n344\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.780\nevery individual packet is accounted for.\n\n345\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.700\nBut I can see the general flow of like and\n\n346\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.052\nthat UDP traffic to make sure I've\nprioritize correctly and things like that.\n\n347\n00:18:20.052 --> 00:18:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wireshark is kinda of\nthe neat tool to help us to do,\n\n348\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.720\nI mean very large things like that.\n\n349\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.490\nAs long as we have the ability to\ncapture it the way that we need to.\n\n350\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.965\nIf we don't, we do end up with\nthe usual transmission like this.\n\n351\n00:18:34.965 --> 00:18:38.248\nAnd it's not bad that we do as we\ndo as long we can trace down what's\n\n352\n00:18:38.248 --> 00:18:41.503\ncausing it or whether it's normal or\nwhether it's not normal.\n\n353\n00:18:41.503 --> 00:18:43.000\nAnd this is the tool to do it.\n\n354\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.429\nBut it really is a very effective tool for\n\n355\n00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:48.795\nus when we start to take a look\nthe analysis part, okay.\n\n356\n00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:52.641\nThe key also, when you're using\na tool like this for the analysis,\n\n357\n00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:56.730\nis don't try and\ndo it as it's continuing to capture.\n\n358\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:02.608\nGo ahead and like I said capture, two,\nthree, four, five thousand packets and\n\n359\n00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:07.010\nthen stop it here, and\nthen you go ahead and you can save it.\n\n360\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.260\nSo know that you can save the file.\n\n361\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.380\nAnd once you save that file you can\nnow take it and analyze it later on.\n\n362\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.370\nIt's better because if not\nyou'll kind of get like,\n\n363\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.330\nI wonder what else is going on and\nyou won't be focused in.\n\n364\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:25.920\nSo earlier, let me see if I can show you\none, cuz I did make one here earlier.\n\n365\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.800\nI don't know where I actually\nput it that's the key.\n\n366\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.260\nI thought I did make a packet\ncapture earlier here.\n\n367\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.630\nI was hoping it would bring me\nto the same exact location.\n\n368\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.267\nLet me do a file open recent there it is.\n\n369\n00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:43.600\nI think that's the one, capture one, yeah.\n\n370\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.360\nSo, let me continue without saving.\n\n371\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.780\nSo, this is what I did for\nmy home network, is what I ended up doing.\n\n372\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.135\nBut, you can see here,\nthis one actually gave me about two oops,\n\n373\n00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:57.350\n2,000 packets here, is what did\nactually gave me about 2,000 of them.\n\n374\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.700\nAnd I let it run for a little bit of time.\n\n375\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.270\nAnd because I'm on\nan insanely slow network,\n\n376\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.170\nI can start to see some other things.\n\n377\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.810\nSo mine turned out, there it is.\n\n378\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.820\nSegment had to be reassembled here,\n\n379\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.970\napplication data,\nthere's some payload of information.\n\n380\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.240\nAnd here's one of these TCP\nacknowledged unseen segment.\n\n381\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.180\nSo in other words this says\nI dropped something but\n\n382\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.230\nI'm gonna say I caught that\nacknowledgement of it.\n\n383\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:31.630\nAnd notice once again, down here at\nthe very bottom as I expand it out so\n\n384\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.310\nthat we could a little bit more,\n\n385\n00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:38.250\nexpert Info (Warn/Sequence): ACK\nsegment that wasn't captured.\n\n386\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.670\nAnd it's usually common at\nthe very start of a capture.\n\n387\n00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.260\nAs I continue to scroll\ndown through there,\n\n388\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.100\nyou'll actually see because I'm on that\nsatellite connection, it tends to drop.\n\n389\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.280\nThere's a bunch of retransmissions, some\nduplicated acknowledgements that go on,\n\n390\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.230\nretransmissions, previous\nsegment not captured.\n\n391\n00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.200\nAnd those are regular on my network\nbecause of how slow it is in comparison.\n\n392\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.510\nDoes it still work fairly well, sure.\n\n393\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.580\nBut overall though, that is what you're\nlooking for when you start to take a look\n\n394\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.585\nat the idea of analysis a lot of\ntimes is trying to discover that.\n\n395\n00:21:11.585 --> 00:21:16.270\nHere's a great example of what we can\nuse to help us to do some analysis.\n\n396\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.170\nAnd we've still got another one to go,\n\n397\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.450\nbut I think I've run out\nof time at this point.\n\n398\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.900\nSo we still have to actually deal\nwith net flow at some point.\n\n399\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.850\n&gt;&gt; You would be correct there Mr. Ronnie.\n\n400\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.500\nWe were able to look at\nTAP in this episode, and\n\n401\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.660\nyou also showed us how to utilize\nWireshark and analyze that information.\n\n402\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.800\nBut in the next episode,\nwe will cover that inline traffic\n\n403\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.410\ninterrogation utility called NetFlow,\nso stay tuned.\n\n404\n00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.840\nAnd we have some great\ninformation headed your way.\n\n405\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.336\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n406\n00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:45.456\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n407\n00:21:45.456 --> 00:21:46.401\n&gt;&gt; And

look a little bit\nmore of another tool we can use\n\n14\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.930\nto help us to do a bit\nof packet analysis here.\n\n15\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.300\nNow whereas we were taking a look\nagain at using TAPS to help us\n\n16\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.230\ncapture all of the traffic, we also talked\nabout the use of port mirroring, or\n\n17\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.870\nSPAN in Cisco terminology.\n\n18\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.160\nAnd we used Wireshark to helped\nus to see the information.\n\n19\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.270\nRemember that with each\none of those products,\n\n20\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.780\nwe can see just about everything.\n\n21\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.420\nWith TAPS, we capture it, we can then\nsee the output of everything that\n\n22\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.740\ncan come across an interface\nwith no packet loss at all.\n\n23\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.991\nWith the use of SPAN, if we're only\nreally looking for a specific things,\n\n24\n00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.758\nis really going to be helpful?\n\n25\n00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:29.552\nBecause as we try to send everything\ntowards a SPAN port, or that idea of\n\n26\n00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:33.980\ntraffic mirroring, or port mirroring,\nwe tend to overwhelm report at times, and\n\n27\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.812\nthat means we're gonna get duplicates,\nwe can get retransmissions.\n\n28\n00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:42.840\nWe are actually going to see that hey,\nit may actually tax the CPU a bit harder\n\n29\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.880\non the switch itself,\nwhen we start to do this.\n\n30\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.350\nNow, the other thing that we\nalso want to take a look at,\n\n31\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.120\nis really from the router side.\n\n32\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.690\nAnd also instead to take a look at the\nability to not only capture the idea of\n\n33\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.850\npackets, but the ability to capture\nsomething that we call flow.\n\n34\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.610\nAnd that's really what the key is\nthat we want to make sure that we do.\n\n35\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.514\n&gt;&gt; So, you say this term packets and flow.\n\n36\n00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:10.220\nWhat would be the difference between them,\nor how do they relate?\n\n37\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we start talking about\nindividual packets we understand that\n\n38\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.410\nthey are pretty much what we sent from\na device to some destination device,\n\n39\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.010\nbut each one is counted individually and\nseparately.\n\n40\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.200\nSo, everything that we send across,\n\n41\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.710\nwe actually do have the individual\npackets that go across.\n\n42\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.240\nAnd, when we start to take a look at\nthem in terms of using something like\n\n43\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.700\nWireshark, the tool that\nwe can use to view them.\n\n44\n00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.830\nWell, the idea of actually\ncapturing packets\n\n45\n00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.060\nthere is no interrelationship\nbetween them.\n\n46\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.350\nUsually we spot a interrelationship,\n\n47\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.210\nbecause we understand the TCP traffic,\nwe can spot a source and\n\n48\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.240\ndestination, and then we can look\nat the sin, the sinac, and the acc.\n\n49\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.590\nAnd it makes sense, right?\n\n50\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.120\nWe logically group that together,\nand we can see it.\n\n51\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.430\nBut when we start talking about flow,\nwe're actually saying, look, let's let\n\n52\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.390\nthe device itself grouped together,\nthose packets that belong together.\n\n53\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.640\nAnd a flow is actually comprised of all\nof the packets that are sent across.\n\n54\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.600\nThey have seven key matching\nfields that they all are actually\n\n55\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.850\ngoing to have identical, is pretty much\nwhat we talked about in terms of flow.\n\n56\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.100\nSo, that way what we're seeing is kind of\nthe entire conversation, and understanding\n\n57\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.520\nthis and the reason why it's important\nis that the idea here is that if we can\n\n58\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.450\nsee information like that, we can actually\nfind out what may be causing a bottleneck.\n\n59\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.440\nNot just that we're getting a ton\nof these packets coming across.\n\n60\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.380\nBut we might even be able to say,\n\n61\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.300\nhere's the device that's actually\ncausing the bottleneck and\n\n62\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.580\nhere's the actual traffic flow\nthat's causing it that we have.\n\n63\n00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.680\nWe can also use it, of course,\nto identify that one application.\n\n64\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.410\nWe can actually use it to identify, and\n\n65\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.170\nhelp us to understand how much bandwidth\nis being used when we start to see it.\n\n66\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's been watching Netflix at work.\n\n67\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.000\nWe're on to him.\n\n68\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.680\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n69\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.905\nAnd, so when you start seeing stuff\nlike this, it is that ability to take\n\n70\n00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:18.315\na look at the nature, and the idea of\nusing what we call flow is what we have.\n\n71\n00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:22.085\nNow, by identifying this,\nright?, how we do that.\n\n72\n00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:27.120\nWireshark itself is really directed\ntowards individual packets,\n\n73\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.600\ncapturing whatever you send it.\n\n74\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.630\nWhich is fine, and it works.\n\n75\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.170\nCan you actually be able to\ncapture flow data with it?\n\n76\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.020\nWell to a point, you can.\n\n77\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.910\nYou can use things like TCP dump\nto help you to do it as well.\n\n78\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.290\nN top of course can help you do it.\n\n79\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.180\nBut we're gonna use Wireshark to help\nus to see what we want to see as well.\n\n80\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.550\nThe other thing that we also want to know\nof course is from the realm of Cisco, that\n\n81\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.290\nit, within Cisco products do they have\nsomething that really helps you do this.\n\n82\n00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.150\nBuilt in to just about every single\niOS that's running on Cisco routers,\n\n83\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.400\nI'm not gonna say every single one,\n\n84\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.357\nbut the majority of them,\nyou can use what we call NetFlow.\n\n85\n00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:10.330\nCisco's NetFlow is one of the things that\nthey developed at the very beginning, and\n\n86\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.960\neverybody found it so\nuseful they began to adopt it and\n\n87\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.270\neven make it into different\nopen standard sources.\n\n88\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.080\nSo it's not only limited to Cisco anymore,\nbut\n\n89\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.120\nCisco is the one that\nreally started showing,\n\n90\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.800\nhere's why this information is important,\nand here's why it's actually really good.\n\n91\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.790\nWell Cisco's particular product,\nof course, is called Cisco NetFlow, and\n\n92\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.750\nthis is built right into the OS.\n\n93\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.600\nNow, the problem that we have is\nthat there's a couple of things.\n\n94\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.980\nWe can see the summarized data of what I'm\ntalking about, such as size of packets,\n\n95\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.720\nand even the flows that are going\nacross the interfaces on the router.\n\n96\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.470\nWe can see all that, but this time without\neven needing the use of that wire chart.\n\n97\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.409\nAnd there's even, of course, different\nanalysis tools that you can purchase, or\n\n98\n00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.460\nyou might even be able\nto do on a trial basis,\n\n99\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.528\nthat can help you to see\nthe flow of the data.\n\n100\n00:05:58.528 --> 00:06:01.960\nIt requires a bit of configuration and\nyou can just go to your favorite\n\n101\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.974\nsearch engine, and figure out,\nwhich one you want to try and\n\n102\n00:06:04.974 --> 00:06:08.390\nthen follow the instructions,\nand get all of that setup.\n\n103\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.804\nBut for us, we're gonna set it up on\nthe Cisco side on the router, so that we\n\n104\n00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:17.657\ncan see kind of the summary information\nwithout needing anything else to help us.\n\n105\n00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:23.102\nAnd we're also gonna end up seeing this,\nusing of course the Wireshark here to\n\n106\n00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:28.510\nhelp us, to see the flow of the data and\nhow it gathers it together as well.\n\n107\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.060\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So, there are a couple of things that\n\n108\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.230\nwe need to take a look at when we do this.\n\n109\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.080\nNow, I mentioned the idea of\nthe seven key fields here,\n\n110\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.950\nthat when we start talking about flow.\n\n111\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.760\nAnd I do need to make sure that I\nmention at least all seven of them.\n\n112\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.570\nMake sure you learn this, cuz it's going\nto be important when it comes down to\n\n113\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.280\nthe exam of,\nwhat actually indicates a flow of data.\n\n114\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.030\nFairly simple stuff that you and\nI would think about, right?\n\n115\n00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.860\nSourced and destination IP address\nmakes sense, okay, sourced and\n\n116\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.710\ndestination port number.\n\n117\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.790\nWell the great thing is those\nare the four out of the seven,\n\n118\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.060\nso that's easily done,\nI can understand that, right?\n\n119\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.280\nSo, as long as you understand that your\nsource port, going to your destination\n\n120\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.090\nport makes sense, and then of course going\nfrom the other end makes sense as well.\n\n121\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.210\nAnd then from that point\nthe layer three protocol type for\n\n122\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.950\nus, that's pretty much gonna be IP.\n\n123\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.817\nSo, the great thing is\nfive out of the seven,\n\n124\n00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:19.427\n&gt;&gt; Not bad.\n\n125\n00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly bad,\nwe can actually figured that out then.\n\n126\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.560\nAnd then of course there\nis type of service.\n\n127\n00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.320\nA bias of information.\n\n128\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.280\nAnd this again is going to be matching.\n\n129\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.320\nSo, all of the data in the same flow,\nthat particular chunk of information on\n\n130\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.690\nthe TOS byte, that they call a lot of\ntime TOS, that is gonna be the same.\n\n131\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.310\nAnd then also of what we call Ingress,\n\n132\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.000\nor egress type of traffic out\nof that interface as well.\n\n133\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.440\nYou might see the term IF index,\nyeah, IF index,\n\n134\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.270\nI want to make sure I say that right.\n\n135\n00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.003\nBut those are all gonna be the same when\nwe start talking about the flow of data.\n\n136\n00:07:56.003 --> 00:07:58.791\nNow, to be able to see\nthat inside of Wireshark,\n\n137\n00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:02.673\nwe have to add a couple of extra\ncommands that we normally don't do.\n\n138\n00:08:02.673 --> 00:08:05.728\nIn terms of the way that\nthe Cisco router works.\n\n139\n00:08:05.728 --> 00:08:10.080\nIf you have your own device,\nyour own product that you want to use,\n\n140\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.290\nmost of the time,\nyou just run that on a machine.\n\n141\n00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.620\nYou make sure it's configured correctly.\n\n142\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.980\nAnd once you do that and it's running\non that machine, then you're up and\n\n143\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.970\nready to go.\n\n144\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.730\nSo go out and do a search for\nnet flow analysis or net flow analyzer,\n\n145\n00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.160\nsomething like that.\n\n146\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.470\nAnd you'll see that there are multiple\ncompanies that offer free software for\n\n147\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.200\na trial period, right?\n\n148\n00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.140\nAfter that they're gonna say okay,\nyou're done with this.\n\n149\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.050\nThey're expecting you to buy it, is what\nthey're actually expecting you to do.\n\n150\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Not like the WinZip, their free\n30 day trial that lasted forever.\n\n151\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.304\n&gt;&gt; That lasts forever?\n\n152\n00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:44.786\n[LAUGH] No, not exactly like that.\n\n153\n00:08:44.786 --> 00:08:46.780\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my diagram and\n\n154\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.930\nthis will help to visualize what\nit is that we are going to do.\n\n155\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.920\nNow I went in and\ntyped out the instructions here and\n\n156\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.440\nI'm going to type these instructions\ndirectly into that router when we're done,\n\n157\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.120\nso that we can see this to help us out.\n\n158\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.360\nNow here's the literal diagram of\nwhat I actually have connected.\n\n159\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.580\nSo, here is my laptop\nright up here in vlan 20.\n\n160\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.500\nThere's a virtual machine also\nin vlan 10 that's running.\n\n161\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.800\nI have a trunk here, okay.\n\n162\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.478\nSo, there's an interface,\na g0/0.10, g0/0.20, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:27.290\nAnd then, once I have everything set up,\nand literally there\n\n164\n00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.650\nis a 35/50 switch here that's separating\nall this out, this is a trunk link here.\n\n165\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.770\nAnd then, I have a router directly\nconnected out to the Internet so\n\n166\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.910\nthat we can make sure that\nwe have good traffic.\n\n167\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.120\nI was gonna just do this\nwithin a virtual machine,\n\n168\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.400\nand when you actually just send pings and\nstuff, I can do that.\n\n169\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.480\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n170\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.440\nBut you don't really get to see the flow\nof data the way that you normally\n\n171\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.380\nwant to see it.\n\n172\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.510\n&gt;&gt; So we're working on real equipment?\n\n173\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.870\n&gt;&gt; So we're working on real equipment.\n\n174\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.360\nHopefully, if I do everything correctly.\n\n175\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.880\nI always have to put that should,\n\n176\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.120\neverything should work\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n177\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.170\nSo here's what we're doing.\n\n178\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.690\nLet me make sure we follow the logic here.\n\n179\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.890\nI believe we do cover this inside of\nthe Cisco CCNA Routing &amp; Switching show,\n\n180\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.340\ninside of the second part of it.\n\n181\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.010\nSo make sure you go back and\nyou take a look at that.\n\n182\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.620\nDon does a much more deep, a deeper dive\ninto what we're going to show you here.\n\n183\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.710\nBut I wanted you to see\nit also in Wireshark and\n\n184\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.780\nthat's why I'm putting it here too, so we\ncan see the analysis afterwards too, okay.\n\n185\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.720\nSo the way that we do this of course\nis that even though it's called\n\n186\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.990\nCisco Net Flow, and\nwe're gonna take this router right here,\n\n187\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.920\nit's a 2821, and we type in,\nip flow-export, and\n\n188\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.040\nwe give it the destination of where\never that monitoring software is.\n\n189\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.610\nI've got Wireshark running\non my computer here.\n\n190\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.140\nNow I'm gonna turn that\non in just a moment,\n\n191\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.800\nafter I've finished configuring it.\n\n192\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.690\nAnd then, once I do that, these next\ntwo lines here, where it talks about\n\n193\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:03.370\nthe refresh rate, on the template, and\nthe options on the refresh rate, this is\n\n194\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:09.180\nto help Wireshark to be able to format\nthose data packets, to capture flow.\n\n195\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.140\nRemember that Wireshark in itself\nnatively doesn't know how to do this.\n\n196\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.105\nSo what we're saying is, hey, router,\nwhen you get this flow down in,\n\n197\n00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:20.410\nI need to add in a couple of templates.\n\n198\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:26.280\nIn other words, how you're going to report\nthat data out to the export machine, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.590\nNow, the one thing I did want to point\nout here, cuz this is actually really\n\n200\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.110\nimportant, even though I\nalways don't remember it here.\n\n201\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.690\n2055 and I believe 99 by 96, these\n\n202\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.830\nare the two ports that\nare default used for net flow.\n\n203\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.460\nIf you do any other port, you've got\nto add a lot more configuration lines.\n\n204\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.140\nSo, if you are wondering\nif this ever happens here,\n\n205\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.880\nmake sure you take a look at this 2055 and\nmake sure that is in there.\n\n206\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.510\n&gt;&gt; So when you mentioned the other\nport number the nine, what was it?\n\n207\n00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.075\n&gt;&gt; I think 996.\n\n208\n00:11:57.075 --> 00:12:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, is that for encryption, or is\nthat for a different type of transmission?\n\n209\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.250\n&gt;&gt; Actually it is for the same thing.\n\n210\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.240\nSo those are just the two default ones\nthat they actually ended up with,\n\n211\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.200\nfor net flow.\n\n212\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n213\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.834\n&gt;&gt; But like I said, if you don't put\nthat in there, it's gonna tell you hey,\n\n214\n00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:13.770\nyou forgot something,\nthis is an incomplete command.\n\n215\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.260\nSo it has to be 2055 or I think it's 9996,\nI could be wrong on that.\n\n216\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.040\nMy memory is not serving\nme correctly this morning.\n\n217\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.870\nIf you don't do that and you do,\nno I'm just gonna put that 5000.\n\n218\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.720\nCan you do that?\n\n219\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.460\nYes.\n\n220\n00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.580\nBut you have to add a lot more lines\ninto because now it's saying yeah,\n\n221\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.520\nI don't see those nets flow down but\nyou want me to report it as 5,000?\n\n222\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.200\nSure.\n\n223\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.260\nBut make sure that I actually know that,\n\n224\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.410\nyou're gonna connect this number\nto this number and do that.\n\n225\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.634\nSo I'm gonna leave it at default.\n\n226\n00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:40.972\n&gt;&gt; Extra work.\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n227\n00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:42.390\nI already told you those two and\n\n228\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.410\nthen we actually need\na different version here, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.390\nIP export version number 9 or 5.\n\n230\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.550\nNow you can either do a 5, 9, or a 1.\n\n231\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.060\nI always try to use the latest version\nnumber which I'm gonna assume is 9\n\n232\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.980\nat this point.\n\n233\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.520\nBut if for\n\n234\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.300\nsome reason you go to your router and\nyou type in a 9 here, doesn't work, use 5.\n\n235\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.810\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n236\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.840\nAnd then where is the source?\n\n237\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.960\nWhat is it that I'm going to try and\ncapture?\n\n238\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.140\nNow this one is gonna be\na little bit different here.\n\n239\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:15.430\nI'm going to actually try and\ncapture let's say just this,\n\n240\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.380\nthe one where my virtual\ninterface is on for my VM.\n\n241\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.940\nSo this way when the router connects\nout bound, it's gonna go across\n\n242\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.920\nthat g0.0.20 go out to the Internet and\nwhen traffic comes back,\n\n243\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.990\nit's going to go straight back down\nthat particular interface instead.\n\n244\n00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.940\nSo, I want to capture that\nsource data that is coming and\n\n245\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.500\nentering in, really just for\nvlan 10 is what I'm doing.\n\n246\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.794\nSorry, the export is actually\ngoing to go out of 20 there.\n\n247\n00:13:45.794 --> 00:13:47.071\nNo the source okay.\n\n248\n00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:48.792\nI was gonna say why did\nI type that in wrong?\n\n249\n00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:50.907\nSo the source what I'm trying to do,\n\n250\n00:13:50.907 --> 00:13:54.262\nand then at the end I have to\ntell it to actually capture it.\n\n251\n00:13:54.262 --> 00:13:58.394\nSo there is a route-cache flow.\n\n252\n00:13:58.394 --> 00:14:02.403\nWhen you do that you are telling it\ncapture all the data on the complete\n\n253\n00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:04.230\ninterface itself.\n\n254\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.866\nSo regardless of what VLAN it's on,\ncapture it if you want to.\n\n255\n00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:13.580\nYou can also do this IP flow egress or\nip flow ingress.\n\n256\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.150\nIf I wanted to do it on\nthe specific sub-interface.\n\n257\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:23.550\nCan you actually just do ip flow egress\nand ingress on the physical interface?\n\n258\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.550\nSure you can.\n\n259\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.410\nThis is kinda more of a summary command.\n\n260\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.630\nI'm just gonna use that cuz\nit's easier for me to remember.\n\n261\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.280\nThat's how I remember doing\nit the first time, okay?\n\n262\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.550\nSo let's take a look at what\nwe're going to do then and\n\n263\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.020\nmake sure that we catch this up here.\n\n264\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.870\nLet me go, there it is.\n\n265\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.800\nHave my router number 1, oops, and\n\n266\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.945\nthen let me verify that I can actually\nping out to the, oop, not that.\n\n267\n00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:46.000\nThat's not a good address to ping.\n\n268\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.380\nOf course I have to wait here.\n\n269\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.510\nI did 7, it should have been 8s here.\n\n270\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.682\nSo, of course every two seconds\nI just have to wait for it.\n\n271\n00:14:52.682 --> 00:14:56.200\nSo I'm just trying to verify that I have\ngood connectivity out to the Internet.\n\n272\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.180\nAnd I do.\n\n273\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.117\nSo I know that I can get outside and\nI know I can remain here.\n\n274\n00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:04.885\nNow, instead of you watching\nme kind of type in everything,\n\n275\n00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:08.490\ncuz that's gonna be horrendous, but\nwe'll go ahead and start doing it here.\n\n276\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.850\nThere is another way that's gonna\nbe quicker for us to do this, but\n\n277\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.130\nlet me go ahead and start.\n\n278\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:20.214\nIP flow-export, and then the destination,\n\n279\n00:15:20.214 --> 00:15:26.454\nand this is gonna be 10.0.46.100.\n\n280\n00:15:26.454 --> 00:15:30.210\nAnd then, with that port number,\nand this is a UDP port, by the way.\n\n281\n00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.801\nNot that that really matters for when you\ntype it in, it doesn't ask you TCP or UDP.\n\n282\n00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:42.540\nIP flow-export, So\nI'm telling it where the data's gonna go.\n\n283\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:48.210\nAnd I need this version 9\nbefore I do anything else.\n\n284\n00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.050\nAnd then on the IP flow-export.\n\n285\n00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:58.363\nAnd this is where I have to add in\nthat template to tell it to capture.\n\n286\n00:15:58.363 --> 00:15:59.904\nRefresh right?\n\n287\n00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:02.836\nI'm just gonna do five.\n\n288\n00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.880\nI can do it every one second if I want to.\n\n289\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.709\nBut this is just pretty\nmuch telling it to do it.\n\n290\n00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:14.260\nFive and keep it consistent\nhere just as an example.\n\n291\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.120\nAnd then I need to actually\ntell it where is the source.\n\n292\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.670\nAnd I was telling you wrong.\n\n293\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.613\nThat pie supposed to be ten\ninstead of 20 on my diagram\n\n294\n00:16:30.613 --> 00:16:35.565\nbecause that is, yeah,\nbecause my VM is on VLAN 10.\n\n295\n00:16:35.565 --> 00:16:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n296\n00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.130\n&gt;&gt; That's me.\n\n297\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.122\nThat's just me doing it wrong.\n\n298\n00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:44.770\nAll right, oops, it's not even fast\nethernet, it's gigabit ethernet.\n\n299\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.867\nSee?\nI can't do anything right.\n\n300\n00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:46.970\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n\n301\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.470\n&gt;&gt; I've just got it all typed out wrong\non my notes is what's happening here.\n\n302\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.360\nAll right, so now that I have that,\n\n303\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.030\nI need to go in to the interface\nthat I am going to be capturing on.\n\n304\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.115\nWhich is going to be the external side or\nwhere I'm gonna turn on the the cache on.\n\n305\n00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:03.627\nSo this is the one that's\nfacing the Internet and\n\n306\n00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:07.720\nthat's capturing both the data\nthat's coming in and going out here.\n\n307\n00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.733\nOnce I enter that interface,\nit's ip route-cache flow.\n\n308\n00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:16.460\nAll right, so I've gotten that turned on.\n\n309\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.550\nI'm also going to go to\nmy physical machine here.\n\n310\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.340\nAnd start implementing Wireshark.\n\n311\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.420\nAnd on this one, I'm gonna turn\nit on the physical interface and\n\n312\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.210\nlet it start capturing in the background,\nokay?\n\n313\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.750\nSo not really a big deal,\n\n314\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.830\nyou see as some traffic kind of coming in\nand actually nothing going in right now.\n\n315\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:45.500\nAs I move onto my VM though,\nlet's see what I can do here.\n\n316\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.480\nLet me close out of all of this and\nwe'll try it here.\n\n317\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.645\nSo I'm gonna see if I\ncan connect to ITProTV.\n\n318\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.809\nAnd there it is, I'm connected to ITProTV.\n\n319\n00:17:56.809 --> 00:18:04.610\nI'm gonna see if I can stream some video,\nsome data going across there.\n\n320\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.430\nAnd you can see it's\nactually coming across.\n\n321\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.590\nThere's that little intro.\n\n322\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.820\nOpen up another tab and let's go to the\nCisco side where we're actually talking\n\n323\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.340\nabout what we're doing here.\n\n324\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.230\nSo for this particular exam topic,\nI always like taking a look at these.\n\n325\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.110\nThis is when you know that Cisco is\nready for your to take the exam.\n\n326\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.790\nWhere you can download a complete\nlist of the topics in a PDF format.\n\n327\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.490\nAnd let me see if I can\ndownload this again,\n\n328\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.960\nbecause there's the third\ntime that I've done it.\n\n329\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.450\nSo that's fine,\nyou can see that we can do that.\n\n330\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.270\nNotice I can navigate around,\nshow some of the details, you name it,\n\n331\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.200\nit's just all of this information\nright here that we can go to.\n\n332\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.750\nIf we wanted to, we can add in\njust a few other things here.\n\n333\n00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.726\n&gt;&gt; Just go ahead and\ngenerate this traffic.\n\n334\n00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.917\n&gt;&gt; Yep, just generating\na little bit of traffic and\n\n335\n00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:53.590\nyou can kind of read on some of\nthe different things that's happening.\n\n336\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.580\nWe did have a question about ransomware,\nunusually-\n\n337\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.485\n&gt;&gt; How appropriate.\n\n338\n00:18:57.485 --> 00:18:58.835\n&gt;&gt; That happened too.\n\n339\n00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:02.540\nSo you kind of realize that there are a\nbunch of different things going on, but\n\n340\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.140\noverall, that's traffic\nthat we have generated.\n\n341\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.110\nEverything looks good at this point.\n\n342\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.497\nSo let me go ahead and\nstop the capture here on Wireshark.\n\n343\n00:19:14.531 --> 00:19:15.950\nI'm gonna stop it.\n\n344\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:23.380\nAnd then, before I go to that, I'm gonna\ncome back here onto the router and\n\n345\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.290\nthere's a couple of different\nverification commands that we can do.\n\n346\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.061\nSo I'm gonna do a do show ip flow export.\n\n347\n00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:42.700\nSo now, oops, you know what?\n\n348\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.710\nI kind of did this wrong,\nbecause I did .46 here.\n\n349\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.160\nI think I know, let me see.\n\n350\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.252\nI did show run, that's just me.\n\n351\n00:19:52.252 --> 00:19:56.969\nIp flow-export.\n\n352\n00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:06.070\nThat's supposed to be 47,\nis what's that's supposed to be, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.195\nSo, I need to change that, if I'm actually\ngonna capture the data correctly.\n\n354\n00:20:10.195 --> 00:20:12.110\n[LAUGH] That is not good.\n\n355\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.000\nLet me see here.\n\n356\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.560\nOops.\n\n357\n00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.590\nLet me not cancel that.\n\n358\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.240\nTry it again.\nI have to tell it no, I don't want that.\n\n359\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Want to generate more traffic?\n\n360\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then I have to go back and\n\n361\n00:20:26.468 --> 00:20:28.316\ngenerate some traffic once I\nactually get this correct.\n\n362\n00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:30.170\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n363\n00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n364\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.758\nFigured out here correctly.\n\n365\n00:20:36.093 --> 00:20:39.058\nAll right, so now,\nbefore I do anything else,\n\n366\n00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:41.813\nlet me verify that it's\nwhat I want it to be.\n\n367\n00:20:41.813 --> 00:20:44.441\nAll right, so\nthat is the correct destination,\n\n368\n00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:47.144\nat least I believe it is\nthe correct destination.\n\n369\n00:20:47.144 --> 00:20:53.910\nLet me see that I can prove that\nto be true before I tell you.\n\n370\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.650\nI might have actually sent\nit to some other location.\n\n371\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.319\nNope, that's the correct one.\nAll right, let me try and\n\n372\n00:20:57.319 --> 00:21:00.900\ngenerate traffic again,\ncuz that's gonna be terrible.\n\n373\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.010\nI'm gonna pull up a machine here and\nit's gonna say yeah,\n\n374\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.050\nyou're not doing anything here.\n\n375\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:12.300\nAll right, so now, let's find this\nmachine again, we'll try it once again.\n\n376\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Let's try CNN.\nI haven't checked the news.\n\n377\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.230\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n378\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.091\nLet's try CNN.\n\n379\n00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:22.520\n&gt;&gt; Might be too political though [LAUGH].\n\n380\n00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.490\n&gt;&gt; What doesn't anymore.\n\n381\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.130\nThere we go.\n\n382\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.140\nSo there's some CNN data has comes in.\n\n383\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.378\nLook, he nearly died after\ntrying to lift 1,100 pounds.\n\n384\n00:21:31.378 --> 00:21:32.024\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n385\n00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.092\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why.\n\n386\n00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:35.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pretty trippy he almost died there.\n\n387\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.180\nSo just kind of realize, yes, okay,\nso we're getting some information.\n\n388\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.498\nAnd I want to make sure that I stream some\ndata as well, to see if we can capture\n\n389\n00:21:43.498 --> 00:21:46.889\nsome streaming data,\njust a little bit as it comes across.\n\n390\n00:21:49.445 --> 00:21:53.460\nSo we can actually see just this\ninformation here as we now have it.\n\n391\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.830\nHopefully, everything now is getting\nsent over to the destination port and\n\n392\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.490\nthat machine.\n\n393\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:06.860\nNow, if I go back to Wireshark,\nI will go and stop this.\n\n394\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.760\nAnd we're gonna leave this right here for\nright now.\n\n395\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.220\nBring back up the router this time.\n\n396\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.180\nI was taking a look at it, I was like hey,\nthat's not right information.\n\n397\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.649\nDo show ip flow-export.\n\n398\n00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:23.160\nOops.\n\n399\n00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.720\nAll right, do show, it's actually just\ntwo words, I was gonna say, why not?\n\n400\n00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.400\nThere we go, little bit better.\n\n401\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.149\nAs you take a look, notice that it\nactually did find a ton of flows, right?\n\n402\n00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:46.355\nSo you can see 4606 flows exported into\n\n403\n00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:52.290\n381 udp datagrams over\nto this destination.\n\n404\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.550\nThe other thing that I also\nwant to take a look at,\n\n405\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.685\nremember that I told you that it can\neven show you different packet sizes?\n\n406\n00:22:58.685 --> 00:22:59.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n407\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:05.757\n&gt;&gt; Do show ip cache flow.\n\n408\n00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:08.080\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.\n\n409\n00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.010\nThat cache flow.\n\n410\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.680\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n411\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.220\nThat's right.\n\n412\n00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.200\nAnd now if you take a look\nat this unusual, I like it,\n\n413\n00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.740\ncuz it actually does show you,\nIP packet size distributions.\n\n414\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.250\nYou can see by the percentage here,\n\n415\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.140\nwhat size packets actually did\ncome across your interface.\n\n416\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n417\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.920\n&gt;&gt; So right here,\nyou can see that the majority of them.\n\n418\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.470\n&gt;&gt; The average.\n\n419\n00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.990\n&gt;&gt; Were right about,\nyeah, right about here.\n\n420\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.066\n&gt;&gt; Or the most, not average.\n\n421\n00:23:31.066 --> 00:23:36.070\n&gt;&gt; About 15, 36, we did have\nsome that were relatively small.\n\n422\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.740\nSo as you look along,\nI'm trying to see if we can.\n\n423\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.380\nSo right here at 288 through 352.\n\n424\n00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.210\nAnd one up here,\nhad a little bit of package sizes, but\n\n425\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.571\nreally the majority of them, right?\n\n426\n00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:56.039\nAbout 91%, 92% of them we're right here,\nabout the average sized packets.\n\n427\n00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:59.113\nYou can see the active and\ninactive flows You name it,\n\n428\n00:23:59.113 --> 00:24:04.310\nyou can actually see all the Telnet\nconnections and everything that we did.\n\n429\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:09.500\nSo without any other analysis tools,\nnotice all the information.\n\n430\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.830\nAnd you can even see the source address\nand where it actually ended up.\n\n431\n00:24:14.648 --> 00:24:18.366\nSo on the router itself, so\nit's a ton of information.\n\n432\n00:24:18.366 --> 00:24:21.658\nBut it's not easy to make a lot of this,\nokay?\n\n433\n00:24:21.658 --> 00:24:25.128\nSo even though it gives you\na lot in terms of summary.\n\n434\n00:24:25.128 --> 00:24:27.744\nNow if I take a look in Wireshark.\n\n435\n00:24:27.744 --> 00:24:33.368\nOne of the neatest things is now that I've\nalready got it formatted the correct way.\n\n436\n00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:36.234\nI can use what's called C flow,\nwhich is Cisco flow.\n\n437\n00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:42.308\nAnd then this is how it captures\nall of the flow of that data.\n\n438\n00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:47.732\nIt knew that all the source data would\nend up getting destined for that 100.\n\n439\n00:24:47.732 --> 00:24:52.530\nSo everything that is sent across here,\nit now captures\n\n440\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:57.544\nthe Cisco NetFlow, and\nlet me zoom in so that we can see it.\n\n441\n00:24:57.544 --> 00:24:59.740\nSo now you can see you\ncan capture NetFlow data.\n\n442\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.986\nAnd that's version 9, there's 21.\n\n443\n00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:06.818\nAnd you can actually start seeing\nall the flows of the different data.\n\n444\n00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:10.090\nHelp you to do a little bit more\nanalysis in the way that you want to.\n\n445\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:15.035\nSo it really does give you quite\na bit of information that you can now\n\n446\n00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:16.194\ntake a look at.\n\n447\n00:25:16.194 --> 00:25:16.832\nNow in this,\n\n448\n00:25:16.832 --> 00:25:20.548\nyou still have to manually do some\nanalysis of what this stuff really means.\n\n449\n00:25:20.548 --> 00:25:22.210\nBut if you wanted to do that.\n\n450\n00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.679\nIt may be where you'd now go and\ninvest some time and some money,\n\n451\n00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:26.971\nreally the money part.\n\n452\n00:25:26.971 --> 00:25:30.990\n[LAUGH] Into an actual true analysis\ntool that could give you graphs.\n\n453\n00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.332\nThere are different graphs\nthat you can put on here.\n\n454\n00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:36.788\nBut at this point, this is at least\nthe beginning of something that you can\n\n455\n00:25:36.788 --> 00:25:39.450\nactually take advantage of,\nif you need to.\n\n456\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.480\nSo, there's a lot of different\noutput that can come.\n\n457\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.960\nWe do have to at least know\nsome of the fundamentals and\n\n458\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.260\nbasics of being able to capture\nof that data for analysis.\n\n459\n00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.680\nAnd so, we've shown you quite a few\nin just these couple of episodes.\n\n460\n00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.110\nSo, remember, take some time,\nlearn how to actually use them.\n\n461\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.240\nIt is gonna be helpful as we get\ninto that idea of the analysis and\n\n462\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.410\nthe monitoring of our systems.\n\n463\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.342\nThis is one of the ways that we do it, and\n\n464\n00:26:04.342 --> 00:26:08.108\nwe'll probably do a little bit more later\non as we get further into our show.\n\n465\n00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:09.724\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for taking the time,\n\n466\n00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:12.455\nRonnie to show us how to\nutilize Wireshark and NetFlow.\n\n467\n00:26:12.455 --> 00:26:15.949\nAnd in the previous episodes we even\nlooked at additional methods to\n\n468\n00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.925\nextrapolate that information.\n\n469\n00:26:17.925 --> 00:26:21.005\nSo we get a good understanding of\nwhere to begin when we're looking\n\n470\n00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:22.575\nat output analysis.\n\n471\n00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:26.900\nStay tuned, we have additional Cisco\nCybersecurity information headed your way.\n\n472\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.150\nBut for\nthis show I'm gonna sign off as your host.\n\n473\n00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.290\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n474\n00:26:30.290 -->

From a networking standpoint data loss takes on a new meaning, literally loosing or dropping packets across your network. Ronnie visually shows this concept occurring by analyzing TCP retransmits, duplicate ACK and ACKed unseen packets using Wireshark.",

00:00:11.899\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.143\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals Series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:19.503\nI'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:23.830\nwe'll be identifying traffic\nloss with packet analysis.\n\n7\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.789\nWith us today in the studios, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong to go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.761\nshow us how we are going to identify\nthis ever so common packet loss.\n\n9\n00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:36.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, so thank you for\nhaving me back on the show here, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.980\nAs we continue to take a look at more of\nusing some type of packet capturing tool\n\n11\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.570\nlike something like Wireshark.\n\n12\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.606\nAnd this time it's specific to help us,\nof course,\n\n13\n00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:51.630\nfocus in on identifying what lost\ntraffic and that's actually kind of key.\n\n14\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.850\nThe reason why it's key is, it depends\non the context that we talked about\n\n15\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.890\nespecially when we start\nidentifying data loss.\n\n16\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.590\nAnd that is a big problem is\nwhat this term actually means.\n\n17\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.650\nSo we always need to take a look\nat it from two standpoints,\n\n18\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.490\nespecially when dealing with security.\n\n19\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.630\nFrom the network perspective and,\nof course,\n\n20\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.520\nfrom the idea of the security\nworld perspective as well.\n\n21\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.960\nSo Cherokee, when you think\nabout the idea of data loss,\n\n22\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.380\nlet's say from a security\nprofessional standpoint.\n\n23\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930\nWhat do we normally talk about,\nwhat do we think about?\n\n24\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.941\n&gt;&gt; Funny you ask that because I see how\nyou use the word security professional\n\n25\n00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:27.724\nstandpoint.\n\n26\n00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:29.284\nWhen I introduced the show,\n\n27\n00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:32.410\nmy initial thought was from\na network admin standpoint.\n\n28\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.110\nSo from a security administrator or\nprofessional standpoint, I would\n\n29\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.630\nthink of data loss such as some sort of\nbreach of information from my network.\n\n30\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no that is kind of\nthe way that most of the context\n\n31\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.441\nwhenever we read about it on news sites.\n\n32\n00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.721\nI was trying to think about\nwhat they were called.\n\n33\n00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:59.230\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple different blogs,\nAlien Vault compiles data breaches.\n\n34\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.810\nYou can check out any of the major,\nSymantec,\n\n35\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.460\nthey like to keep you up to date,\ndatalossdb.org,\n\n36\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.920\nI think there are a few, but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n37\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.890\njust in regular news cycles,\nthough, right?\n\n38\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.860\nWhenever a company's reported on and\nthey say data loss has occurred.\n\n39\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.980\nThey're normally talking about the idea\nthat some type of information,\n\n40\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.550\nessentially, was copied, or removed or\ntaken off of their network.\n\n41\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.490\nAnd that information is now lost,\n\n42\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.130\nin other words, it's not that they\ndon't have a copy of the data.\n\n43\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.412\nIt means it's now actually exposed in a\nway that they don't mean it to be exposed.\n\n44\n00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:31.370\n&gt;&gt; Could be published on the Internet,\nwe see this happen more and more.\n\n45\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.763\nI'm reading stories, almost on a daily\nbasis, of some type of large breach.\n\n46\n00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:39.087\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you start talking about\nlarge breaches, right, we're normally\n\n47\n00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:42.660\ntalking about of course, things like\nfinancial institutions losing information.\n\n48\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.330\nThe idea of, in the health care industry,\nright, losing patient information.\n\n49\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.000\nAnd retail points of sale stuff when\nyou hear about credit card information.\n\n50\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.610\nUsually when they talk about data loss,\nthat's what we're normally thinking about\n\n51\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.670\nis, in those terms,\nin security terms here.\n\n52\n00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.760\nWe're saying data that has now\nbeen exposed, and so even though\n\n53\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.580\nwe still have a copy of it, somebody else\nmay have a copy of it and they shouldn't.\n\n54\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.480\nSo even if they are exposed out there,\nwell that's bad enough.\n\n55\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.100\nBut the ones that you really worry about,\nright, in security terminology\n\n56\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.990\nis the ones that they don't tell\nyou that that has happened.\n\n57\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.240\nNow I'm not saying that people are holding\nit back, but it's when the hacker or\n\n58\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.080\nthe attacker, whoever it is.\n\n59\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.640\nThey get into the system,\nthey steal the credit card information.\n\n60\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.160\nAnd the only way that you find\nout about is that you end up\n\n61\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.490\nfinding out through some particular means.\n\n62\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.160\nThat now there's a bunch of credit card\ninformation now on the dark web, or\n\n63\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.600\nthe deep web or whatever it's called now,\nI can't even remember.\n\n64\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.450\nBut it's actually out there and\nyou're like, wait a minute,\n\n65\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.050\nthat's the first time I've heard about it.\n\n66\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.920\nAnd now you have a breach on your\nsystem or whatever hosted that system.\n\n67\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.560\nAnd that's where you really don't\nwant to hear about it at that point.\n\n68\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.550\nSo we can talk about it in those terms.\n\n69\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.690\nBut on the exam objectives,\n\n70\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.300\nwhen we start talking about the security\nfundamentals, even though that is gonna be\n\n71\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.480\nimportant to something that we really\nwant to prevent and we need to prevent.\n\n72\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.674\nWe are really talking about it from\nthe standpoint then, of course,\n\n73\n00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:08.779\nof talking about traffic profiles instead.\n\n74\n00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.430\nIn other words, information that\nwe can get from the traffic.\n\n75\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.170\nAnd this is where we turn around as\nthe network admin side, and the network\n\n76\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.640\nsecurity professional or the network\nprofessional here, and say, all right.\n\n77\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.970\nWhen we talk about data loss\nat this point, well, how do we\n\n78\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.950\nidentify that traffic really isn't getting\nthrough to where it needs to go to?\n\n79\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.270\nOr what is holding it up or the idea that\nwe know that that's something we can view.\n\n80\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.500\nThat we know it's just not going to\nend up getting where it needs to go.\n\n81\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.310\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of ironic how we could say\nfrom a network standpoint that that data\n\n82\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.660\nloss may be some sort of indication\nthat a breach, including\n\n83\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.500\na different form of data loss is actually\noccurring if that even makes sense.\n\n84\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.138\nBut it kind of reminds me of a particular\nincident, it's been a while now.\n\n85\n00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:58.550\nBut, I don't know, you're always kind of\nharking on me to use LastPass, right?\n\n86\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.800\nYeah, so I got an email,\nI checked it out, all right?\n\n87\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.130\nI signed up,\nI never actually started using it.\n\n88\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.210\nBut I did receive an email message\nfrom them one time, and basically,\n\n89\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.690\nthey were acknowledging an anomaly\nof their network traffic.\n\n90\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.640\nAnd they basically had no proof\nthat any information was taken.\n\n91\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.390\nBut they felt confident in the fact\nthat a breach did not occur,\n\n92\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.180\nbecause of all the security components\nthat they have in place, and\n\n93\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.960\nthe forms of encryption that they use.\n\n94\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.060\nBut, I thought that was pretty cool\nbecause they at least let the consumer\n\n95\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.717\nknow about it.\n\n96\n00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:36.096\nThey were really upfront about it.\n\n97\n00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:38.404\nSo, I still don't use LastPass,\n\n98\n00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:43.400\nbut, I think it is a pretty cool\ncompany for admitting that.\n\n99\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou can see where stuff like that happens.\n\n100\n00:05:46.148 --> 00:05:50.965\nAnd the same time the very fact is\nit's going to be something that we\n\n101\n00:05:50.965 --> 00:05:53.650\nhave to recognize, right?\n\n102\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.710\nCareful monitoring, constant monitoring,\nthe ability to have\n\n103\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.360\nthe vigilance that we need is gonna be key\nto preventing things like that as well.\n\n104\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.258\nBut you're not gonna stop\neverybody 100% of the time.\n\n105\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:08.949\nEven if you have a company of 1,000\npeople, remember that in the data loss,\n\n106\n00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.440\nand we're talking about from\nthe security standpoint side.\n\n107\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.020\nYou can prevent as much of it as you can,\nbut that's pretty much just about it.\n\n108\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.090\nYou have to kind of realize where what's\ngonna happen here is that you are against\n\n109\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.120\narmies of millions is what\nyou're actually against.\n\n110\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.060\nAnd it means you have to be more vigilant.\n\n111\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.110\nSo we are going to take a look at it\nfrom the standpoint of how in the world\n\n112\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.220\ndo we actually recognize by using analysis\ntools like something like to indicate\n\n113\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.530\nthat we are actually not getting the\ntraffic that we need to get go through?\n\n114\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.370\nAnd that is gonna be key, right,\nis being able to take it to them.\n\n115\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.230\nGo, yes,\nhere's what's beginning to happen.\n\n116\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.600\nSo let's kind of set this up in\nthe way that we need to, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.060\nFirst and foremost,\nwe need to be able to identify and\n\n118\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.255\nunderstand the communication part, right?\n\n119\n00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:59.060\nWe've already talked about it in\nterms of networking protocols.\n\n120\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.730\nBasically we have UDP traffic,\nand we have TCP traffic.\n\n121\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.410\nSo, if we can understand that idea\nof the difference between the two,\n\n122\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.550\nthat really helps us as\na foundation in the very beginning.\n\n123\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.220\nTo understand why we\nmight see data kind of\n\n124\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.440\nnot get through from one end to the other.\n\n125\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.739\nSo for example, Cherokee,\nwe won't talk about TCP, right?\n\n126\n00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:19.150\nWe talked about a three way handshake,\nokay.\n\n127\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.474\nSo the first part of\nthat three way handshake,\n\n128\n00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.090\nwhat do we send if you remember?\n\n129\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.080\n&gt;&gt; A send packet.\n\n130\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.663\n&gt;&gt; A send packet, right, and so\nif Cherokee sends me a send packet,\n\n131\n00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:30.414\nI would then, at that point,\nacknowledge that.\n\n132\n00:07:30.414 --> 00:07:33.997\nAnd also say hey, since you're actually\nwanting to do this let me go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:35.332\nalso synchronize with you.\n\n134\n00:07:35.332 --> 00:07:39.530\nAnd so I would send back a SYN-ACK,\nnow I want to stop right there.\n\n135\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.041\nIf I send back that SYN-ACK,\nthat means that I am waiting for, what,\n\n136\n00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:45.118\nan ACK, right?\n\n137\n00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:47.752\nOkay, and I'm waiting for\na particular acknowledgement here.\n\n138\n00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:50.204\nAnd if I never get that acknowledgement,\n\n139\n00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.224\nwell what happens after that point is key,\nright?\n\n140\n00:07:53.224 --> 00:07:57.644\nIs to actually understand that process of\nwhat in the world that TCP communication\n\n141\n00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.294\nhappens If we open that up and\nwe never close that communication, so\n\n142\n00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:04.220\nthat traffic can continue to flow through.\n\n143\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.120\nWell, it might mean that we\nnever actually send traffic.\n\n144\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.080\nIt makes sense, right?\n\n145\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.030\nIf the three way handshake doesn't occur,\n\n146\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.550\nthen we don't actually get\nany traffic to go through.\n\n147\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.790\n&gt;&gt; Abort mission.\n[LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n149\n00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:18.550\nit's very important that we\nunderstand process like that.\n\n150\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.290\nBecause it can indicate why something\nis not actually connecting and\n\n151\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.650\nat that point, then you go and\ntry and determine.\n\n152\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.563\nIs it the source that's causing it?\n\n153\n00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:29.020\nIs it the destination that's causing it?\n\n154\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.530\nWhy is that happening?\n\n155\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.420\nYou name it,\nthese are things that really help us out.\n\n156\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.500\nBut what I've done here to try and\nhelp us to see this and\n\n157\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.480\nto visualize some of the information.\n\n158\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.172\nIs I did some different captures\nacross a couple of different networks.\n\n159\n00:08:42.172 --> 00:08:44.919\nOne, a network I'm on at home and\nthen two,\n\n160\n00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.370\nwhile I'm here inside\na network that we're on.\n\n161\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.530\nAnd then three, actually inside my little\nlab network as well, I did that as well.\n\n162\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.280\nThree different networks\nis where I did this, so\n\n163\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.850\nwe could do some analysis here and\ntry and indicate\n\n164\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.020\nthe visibility here of acknowledging\nthat packet loss does happen.\n\n165\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.090\nSo we need to see that.\n\n166\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.610\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n167\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.510\nAnd here on this first\nparticular one that I have,\n\n168\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.150\nI wanna make sure that all\nthe filters are off right now.\n\n169\n00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.171\nBut as I start to take a look,\n\n170\n00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:22.290\nI've captured about 2,011 packets in\nthis particular capture that I did.\n\n171\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.090\nAnd all I did is once I\nactually ran that capture,\n\n172\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.030\nI let it go about a couple of thousand.\n\n173\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.310\nI stopped it and then I went up to file\nand I saved it, and I just saved it.\n\n174\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.290\nAnd you can see right here,\nit is says capture one, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.610\nNow in this capture, I've tried not to\nmess around with it or do anything to it.\n\n176\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.690\nBecause very difficult.\n\n177\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.390\nI can try to artificially\ncreate some of these.\n\n178\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.100\nSometimes you have to because\nyou're network is so good.\n\n179\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.336\nIt's not dropping anything.\n\n180\n00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.889\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; For demonstration purposes.\n\n181\n00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for demonstration purposes.\n\n182\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.375\nSo there's a couple of things\nthat I could've tried to do.\n\n183\n00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:56.010\nI could've taken a wire,\na Cat 5 wire that would've actually\n\n184\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.200\nbeen [INAUDIBLE] and\npeeled back the transmission wires.\n\n185\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.486\nThe one and the two and\nthe three and six and\n\n186\n00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:07.541\nthen just kind of rub them together\nas I started sending traffic, right?\n\n187\n00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:11.401\nTo cross the actual transmission patterns\nthat could have cause some different\n\n188\n00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:12.560\ninteresting traffic.\n\n189\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.815\n&gt;&gt; Sure, but you didn't have to do that,\ndid you, right?\n\n190\n00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:16.416\n&gt;&gt; Didn't have to do that yeah, because\n&gt;&gt; That's because you have bad Internet?\n\n191\n00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:20.496\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because my ticker Internet\nconnection does tend to drop traffic\n\n192\n00:10:20.496 --> 00:10:22.700\nsometimes, so we can do stuff.\n\n193\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.830\nSo as I scroll down through,\nI'm actually looking for one right there,\n\n194\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.350\nthat's the first one that\nI want to take a look at.\n\n195\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.710\nWhich is one that says TCP Retransmission,\nokay?\n\n196\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.510\nWell, what is happening\nwith the retransmission,\n\n197\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.610\nthis is exactly like we talked out here,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.230\nThe very fact that hey,\nmaybe I'm acknowledging it but\n\n199\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.060\nI'm not really getting to the end.\n\n200\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.420\nSo after a period of time when I\ndon't get any acknowledgement,\n\n201\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.410\ninstead of holding it open forever.\n\n202\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:54.770\nCausing a security breach perhaps, I just\nsimply drop it off and I try again, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.730\nAnd then this one, not only try it again,\nI try it again immediately\n\n204\n00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.790\nto actually make that type of\nconnection immediately again.\n\n205\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.980\nSo when you start seeing\na lot retransmissions,\n\n206\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.850\nIt's probably because you're actually\nhaving to retransmit data that\n\n207\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.760\ndid get lost at some time or didn't ever\nconnect in the way that we wanted to.\n\n208\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.270\nNotice that that's actually kind of key\nwhen we start taking a look at that.\n\n209\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.040\nSo the loss of the ACK is\nkind of key in what you see.\n\n210\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.520\nNow if you start getting a ton\nof string of that, well,\n\n211\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.490\nit kinda lets you know\nthe other side may not even be\n\n212\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.170\ntrying to respond as much as\nyou're trying to connect.\n\n213\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.015\nThere is another one here.\n\n214\n00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Or just reset the machine.\n\n215\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just on the duplicate\nacknowledgement here, so\n\n216\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.260\nnotice this one is a duplicate ACK.\n\n217\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.480\nNow before I go on, I kind of\nwent a little bit too fast there,\n\n218\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.360\nlet me go back to one of these\nretransmissions for a moment.\n\n219\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.420\nIf you're ever unsure about\nwhat some of this data means,\n\n220\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.240\nmake sure you take a look underneath\nat the details pane here,\n\n221\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.100\nwhich actually shows us\nthe information a little bit more.\n\n222\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.480\nSo instead of just seeing\nthe actual listing or\n\n223\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.730\nthe logging of that traffic, under here\nwe can actually look into each frame.\n\n224\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.540\nAnd notice we have the frame, here's our\nlayer two data, here of course is our\n\n225\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.080\nlayer three data and inside of layer four,\nif I expand that out, I can scroll down.\n\n226\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.121\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis right there under the sequence and\n\n227\n00:12:17.121 --> 00:12:20.968\nthe analysis, or SEQ/ACK analysis.\n\n228\n00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:27.110\nAnd I can scroll down and now you can\nsee exactly why this was retransmitted.\n\n229\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.880\nRTO is a retransmission timeout for\nthis sequence.\n\n230\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.530\nIt says hey look, I never got a response,\nlet me try it again.\n\n231\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.982\nSo it was based on this,\nit says based on the delta from frame 65.\n\n232\n00:12:38.982 --> 00:12:44.690\nThat means every time it retransmits,\nyou double that RTO when you have that.\n\n233\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.730\nSo retransmit one time,\nit doubles whatever the original time was.\n\n234\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.340\nAnd then when it does again, it doubles\nit again, so it's actually saying hey,\n\n235\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.620\nI'm not getting any response at all.\n\n236\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.780\nSo it lets you know something else is\nhappening there on that retransmit.\n\n237\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.290\nSo you can normally see\nthis analysis flag and\n\n238\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.670\nsometimes you can see it tells you where\nthere's that advanced information that\n\n239\n00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.920\nyou need to be able to check out as well.\n\n240\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.860\nSo you wanna make sure you can\ntake a look at that information.\n\n241\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.670\nAs I scroll down to this TCP\nduplicate acknowledgement.\n\n242\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.870\nThis is something that's also\na little bit unusual too.\n\n243\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.560\nIt probably does mean that the other side\ndid get the transmission that they were\n\n244\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.230\nexpecting to see, but it arrived out of\norder is what you're also seeing here too.\n\n245\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.680\nSo it can indicate that somewhere\nalong the line, something was\n\n246\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.780\nlost as far as the order goes, but it can\ntell you again just a little bit of that.\n\n247\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.510\nLet me scroll down here,\nsee if we can see this as well.\n\n248\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.380\nAnd there it is, duplicate acknowledgement\nand it just tell you hey, there it is,\n\n249\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.210\nexpert info, note the sequence\nhere is what is also telling you.\n\n250\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.942\nSo you are starting to see information\nlike that go across your interfaces and\n\n251\n00:13:55.942 --> 00:14:01.153\nyou'll see that a lot more when there's\nactually again, connection problems, too.\n\n252\n00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:06.091\nAll right, so let's take a look at this\nidea of this next one that we see right\n\n253\n00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:09.390\nhere, which is the TCP duplicate ACK.\n\n254\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.790\nAnd when we start seeing\nthe duplicate acknowledgements,\n\n255\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.980\nnormally what this indicates is not so\nmuch that any data was lost.\n\n256\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.310\nBut the very fact that we\nstarted receiving frames a bit\n\n257\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.800\nout of sequence here.\n\n258\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.430\nAnd we're actually getting\nthe acknowledgement for\n\n259\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.420\nsomething that might have\noriginally been set or\n\n260\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.680\nmight be now acknowledging something\nelse is coming through too.\n\n261\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.380\nSo you're getting those different\nduplicate acknowledgements come through.\n\n262\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.290\nIf you start seeing these in a long\nstring of very much so without any gaps,\n\n263\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.720\nlike what this one's showing.\n\n264\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.040\nIt might actually indicate\nthat there's a lot of out\n\n265\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.930\nof sequence packets that\nare coming into your interface.\n\n266\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.730\nAnd you gotta kinda figure out why,\n\n267\n00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.920\nwhat's causing some packets to\nslow down as much as they are.\n\n268\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.560\nAre they not taking the same link,\nwhat's going on?\n\n269\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.540\nWhat is happening?\n\n270\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.530\nWhat other disturbances are going\non in the meantime then between?\n\n271\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.760\nAnd we can see right here in the details\npane section of the information,\n\n272\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:09.810\nI still got that sequence ACK analysis,\nwhich I can't say.\n\n273\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.830\nAnd this one just gives us a little\nbit more information, not a lot.\n\n274\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.139\nAnd there's that expert info.\n\n275\n00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:15.850\nLet me see if I can expand that out.\n\n276\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.250\nDoes it tell me anything?\n\n277\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.340\nSo it shows me a couple of things here.\n\n278\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.660\nOne, it says look, hey, I want to\nacknowledge that this happened, but\n\n279\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.190\nthe great thing is that it\ntells me the severity level.\n\n280\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.150\nIt's something to note, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.300\nJust take a note of it.\n\n282\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.810\nSomething you might want to take a look\nat, but don't worry about it too much.\n\n283\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.910\nSo it is expected that times\n\n284\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.510\nbecause you may have frames\nthat arrives out of sequence.\n\n285\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.880\nBut just to take a look at some line,\n\n286\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.920\nthis is actually kind of key when\nwe start to see especially on\n\n287\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.470\nTCP information is what we are also\ntaking look at right there too.\n\n288\n00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.842\nOkay.\nNow I'm looking for\n\n289\n00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:56.235\none that's very specific that\ntalks about there it is, okay.\n\n290\n00:15:56.235 --> 00:16:01.126\nSo here I actually got a couple\nof them Kind of grouped together.\n\n291\n00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.002\nSo there's that retransmission\nwhich we've already talked about.\n\n292\n00:16:04.002 --> 00:16:11.060\nThis time notice this one,\nACKed unseen segment.\n\n293\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.833\nSo TCP is essentially saying look,\nI'm gonna acknowledge this,\n\n294\n00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:20.618\neven though I can't tell you that,\nif you think about it, right?\n\n295\n00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:22.562\nThe seen, the seen ACKed and\n\n296\n00:16:22.562 --> 00:16:27.810\nthis one saying hey, I'm going out and\nsending an app for what?\n\n297\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.382\nFor unseen segment as\nwe start to see that.\n\n298\n00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:33.087\nNow when you start to take\na look at some of our,\n\n299\n00:16:33.087 --> 00:16:37.187\nit only means that\nthe transmission has happened.\n\n300\n00:16:37.187 --> 00:16:43.120\nBut Wireshark itself cannot find\nthe packet in the capture anywhere.\n\n301\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.328\nSo it says, I saw it,\nI saw it, I know it existed.\n\n302\n00:16:46.328 --> 00:16:48.334\nSo I'm gonna send the ACKed, but\n\n303\n00:16:48.334 --> 00:16:53.760\nI can't tell you that it's actually in\nthe capture anywhere that I actually find.\n\n304\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.922\nSo when you actually see something\nlike this, a lot of times,\n\n305\n00:16:55.922 --> 00:16:58.305\nthis is not an indication that\nsomething is wrong with the traffic.\n\n306\n00:16:58.305 --> 00:17:02.544\nIt's an indication that maybe the\ninterface that you're capturing the data\n\n307\n00:17:02.544 --> 00:17:03.420\non-\n&gt;&gt; A limitation.\n\n308\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.224\n&gt;&gt; Is not fast enough.\n\n309\n00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:08.880\nYeah, is actually limited by what\nwe actually end up seeing here too.\n\n310\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.985\nSo it is important that we can\nat least take the basics and\n\n311\n00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:19.085\nthe look of what we understand that\ncontinues to go on here too, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:19.085 --> 00:17:21.465\nNow what about UDP segments, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:27.005\nWell UDP, as far as capturing that stuff,\nnot very easily because remember,\n\n314\n00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.585\nwe're not seeing the three\nway handshake or anything.\n\n315\n00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Connection lists.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is connection lists.\n\n316\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.541\nThe idea that we don't have to have\nanything like that to help us out.\n\n317\n00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:39.302\nBut in UDP traffic though\nwe are just gonna talk,\n\n318\n00:17:39.302 --> 00:17:44.277\ncuz it's really difficult to spot\nanything like that going on.\n\n319\n00:17:44.277 --> 00:17:50.850\nOne, is the way you start spotting it is,\nif you get a lot of UDP requests, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.383\nIf you get a lot of UDP requests,\nwhich I can't say, [LAUGH] okay?\n\n321\n00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:59.383\nRepeated requests it normally\nindicates that somewhere\n\n322\n00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:03.560\nalong the line UDP simply just\ndropped the traffic, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.040\nSo as requests are coming in,\n\n324\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.810\nbut no traffic's ever being sent back\nit's just gonna continue to repeat that.\n\n325\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.237\nOr if you get unsuccessful requests,\nokayt?\n\n326\n00:18:12.237 --> 00:18:15.991\nIt again probably means that\nsomewhere along the line UDP said,\n\n327\n00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.210\nI'm dropping this and\nit's not coming across.\n\n328\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.830\nSo when you start seeing UDP\nrequests that are a lot,\n\n329\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.010\nif you start seeing or repeated.\n\n330\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.881\nIf you start seeing the idea of UDP\nrequests that are essentially unsuccessful\n\n331\n00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:34.925\nat this point, it lets you know that\nagain, UDP is not functioning well either.\n\n332\n00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:36.856\n&gt;&gt; Your end user might\nlet you know as well.\n\n333\n00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:37.868\n&gt;&gt; So on the TCPs, yeah.\n\n334\n00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's on the TCP side,\n\n335\n00:18:39.495 --> 00:18:41.680\non the UDP side,\nyou do need to pay attention.\n\n336\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.136\nNow, normally there is a question like,\n\n337\n00:18:44.136 --> 00:18:48.149\nwell how do I know if traffic loss\nis happening on my network, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:50.823\nSo on this one right here, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:50.823 --> 00:18:54.700\nWe'll have to kind of full screen this so\nthat we can see it here.\n\n340\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.340\nDown here at the bottom on the traffic\nlet me see if I can zoom in.\n\n341\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.147\nOops, let me get that out of the way.\n\n342\n00:19:01.147 --> 00:19:06.140\n2011 packets were essentially captured,\nand it tells me,\n\n343\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.735\nit says look, I displayed what?\n\n344\n00:19:08.735 --> 00:19:12.853\n2,011, and\nthis means I had 100% capture rate,\n\n345\n00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:17.064\nwhich tells me no data loss\nactually occurred here, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:22.032\nSo when you start to see some of that,\nit really does let you know that hey,\n\n347\n00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:24.131\nthis one has no data loss on it.\n\n348\n00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:25.923\nSo what does data loss look like?\n\n349\n00:19:25.923 --> 00:19:29.433\nWell, this is where I can\nbring up another capture and\n\n350\n00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:33.413\nthis is one we did right before\nin the previous episode here.\n\n351\n00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:39.037\nAnd I now can take a look and this\none's much smaller down at the bottom.\n\n352\n00:19:39.037 --> 00:19:43.117\nYou can see where it says 218,\n218 displayed, but\n\n353\n00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:45.245\nwe were doing one on net flow.\n\n354\n00:19:45.245 --> 00:19:50.403\nNow I type in C flow,\nnow you can see that when\n\n355\n00:19:50.403 --> 00:19:55.425\nI try to capture all the flow information,\n\n356\n00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:59.870\nit captured 218 packets.\n\n357\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.014\nBut even in the C flow, it says look,\nI'm only displaying 17.\n\n358\n00:20:04.014 --> 00:20:06.107\nAnd it's essentially saying,\n\n359\n00:20:06.107 --> 00:20:10.830\nlook 7.8% traffic loss is what\nwe're actually seeing here.\n\n360\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.730\nSo you can see it in that\nparticular instance as well.\n\n361\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.000\nNow there's actually an easier method for\nyou to see this.\n\n362\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.580\nUp here in the display filter,\nsee if I can get over\n\n363\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.282\nthere without making you too sick,\ntcp analysis.\n\n364\n00:20:27.282 --> 00:20:30.663\nAnd we're looking for\nthis third one or this one right here.\n\n365\n00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:35.558\nThe tcp.analysis.ack_lost_segment,\n\n366\n00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:39.418\nand now if I select that one, oops,\n\n367\n00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:43.419\napparently I do not select that one.\n\n368\n00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:48.946\nTCP, And\n\n369\n00:20:48.946 --> 00:20:52.747\nthen you can see right here,\nhere is all of these packets.\n\n370\n00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:56.674\nBut then if I go down to the status\nbar again and scroll in.\n\n371\n00:20:56.674 --> 00:21:01.170\nI don't know if I can move that right\nthere, get that out of the way.\n\n372\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.019\nThere it is.\n4.1% total loss in this capture that I\n\n373\n00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.242\nhave right here.\n\n374\n00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:08.519\nAnd it shows you that yes,\nsome packets are being lost.\n\n375\n00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.969\nSo it is up to you to now find\nsome investigative tool or\n\n376\n00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:13.510\ntechnique to help you.\n\n377\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.147\nSo what does this mean?\n\n378\n00:21:15.147 --> 00:21:19.498\nOn your captures and\nthe analysis you use, you really do.\n\n379\n00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:21.404\nYou wanna use something if\nyou can possibly afford it,\n\n380\n00:21:21.404 --> 00:21:23.234\nmake sure something like the network taps,\nright?\n\n381\n00:21:23.234 --> 00:21:26.520\nThat will give you all the data\nflow that goes through there.\n\n382\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.850\nAnd then you have to verify of course,\nthe machine that you're on.\n\n383\n00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.900\nCan also accept that\namount of traffic as well.\n\n384\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.086\nSo it really does include something\nlike that, if you want to see all of\n\n385\n00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:40.283\nthe traffic, and see whether or\nnot you're getting true loss or not.\n\n386\n00:21:40.283 --> 00:21:43.880\nWell for me, I know something like my\nnetwork adapter right here on my computer\n\n387\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.305\nis a gigabit network adapter.\n\n388\n00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.522\nBut it's plugged into\na 100 megabit switch.\n\n389\n00:21:47.522 --> 00:21:52.391\nSo I know I'm not getting all the traffic\njust through that 100 megabit,\n\n390\n00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:55.908\nif there's a gigabit connection\nbetween me and this.\n\n391\n00:21:55.908 --> 00:22:01.181\nThe router is a gigabit port, but yet the\nswitch it's connected to is 100 megabit.\n\n392\n00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:04.961\nI could actually send a ton more data and\nI might be losing packets and\n\n393\n00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.560\ncausing re transmits to\ngo across that way to.\n\n394\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.749\nThere's a lot f things that you have\nto consider, but here's one ways,\n\n395\n00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:14.508\nyou can think of the output of traffic and\ndata.\n\n396\n00:22:14.508 --> 00:22:19.413\nUse something like Wireshark to help you\nto start identifying where you might see\n\n397\n00:22:19.413 --> 00:22:23.539\nloss of data come across your network\nby using something like this.\n\n398\n00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:29.575\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so you do have any other\nfinal thoughts here or great idea?\n\n399\n00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:31.716\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down\nto the idea here, right?\n\n400\n00:22:31.716 --> 00:22:36.080\nIt means you got to spend time\ntaking a look at the information.\n\n401\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.720\nIs not enough to say, yeah,\nI know how to run Wireshark.\n\n402\n00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.900\nBut you have to take time to look\nat the actual data and then try and\n\n403\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.260\nfigure out what it means.\n\n404\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.370\nAnd it also means you're gonna read a lot.\n\n405\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.320\nThere are so\nmany people out there that are so\n\n406\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.160\ngreat at this, I am not the greatest\nperson that doing this, right?\n\n407\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.360\nBut it means that when I look at\nsomething inside the Wireshark and\n\n408\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.997\nI don't understand what it means,\n&gt;&gt; Go on research-\n\n409\n00:22:57.997 --> 00:22:58.573\n&gt;&gt; Research.\n\n410\n00:22:58.573 --> 00:22:59.588\n&gt;&gt; It.\n\n411\n00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:00.494\nYeah, start to research it,\n\n412\n00:23:00.494 --> 00:23:02.740\nunderstand a little bit more\nabout what it's telling you.\n\n413\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.323\nAnd that way you'll get a better\npicture it was going on.\n\n414\n00:23:05.323 --> 00:23:10.240\nWhen your moving in to the realm of Cyber\nops, you definitely have to do this.\n\n415\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.390\nIt is impossible for\nyou to stay on top of this by saying, no,\n\n416\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.820\nI don't care about using that.\n\n417\n00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.630\nYou've got to be able to take\na look at the analysis and\n\n418\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.120\nunderstand what the meaning\nof some of this stuff is.\n\n419\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.558\nAt least begin right here in and\nunderstanding how it captures,\n\n420\n00:23:24.558 --> 00:23:25.450\nhow it works?\n\n421\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.426\nAnd from that point,\nas you get better at it,\n\n422\n00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:29.871\nthis is one of the most effective\ntools that you can use.\n\n423\n00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:34.029\nThat will really help you to examine\nthe data itself as it comes across and\n\n424\n00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:37.044\nyou're not just making\nassumptions at that point.\n\n425\n00:23:37.044 --> 00:23:40.614\nYou're basing it off of real data\nthat's coming across your screen,\n\n426\n00:23:40.614 --> 00:23:42.570\nwhich is always cool.\n\n427\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's interesting how you\nsaid make sure you understand the meaning\n\n428\n00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.991\nbecause just how we started\nthis episode off, right?\n\n429\n00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:49.637\nWe weren't sure of that term data loss, so\n\n430\n00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.570\nwe wanted to make sure that\nyou guys were covered.\n\n431\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:56.650\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and explain it in\ntwo different ways that you understand it.\n\n432\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.850\nAnd then we're able to look at that\ninformation by utilizing Wireshark\n\n433\n00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.110\nfrom those different networks.\n\n434\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.950\nLike Ronnie said,\nif you're not too familiar with it.\n\n435\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.531\nThis is something that you can\nactually work with, practice.\n\n436\n00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.233\nIt's free, you can get it online.\n\n437\n00:24:08.233 --> 00:24:12.370\nAnd you can also incorporate that into\nyour resume to make yourself a little more\n\n438\n00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.120\nmarketable.\n\n439\n00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.123\nBecause it's such a widely used tool.\n\n440\n00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:17.488\nSo I think that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n441\n00:24:17.488 --> 00:24:19.517\nWe are running out of time, but\n\n442\n00:24:19.517 --> 00:24:24.100\nwe do have more Cisco cybersecurity\ninformation headed your way.\n\n443\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.141\nWe're gonna wrap up for this episode,\nand I'll sign off as your show host.\n\n444\n00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:28.572\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n445\n00:24:28.572 --> 00:24:29.265\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n446\n00:24:29.265 --> 00:24:31.286\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n447\n00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:40.836\n[MUSIC]\n\n448\n00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:42.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.221\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:16.850\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.970\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.090\nwe are continuing all of more on our\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.840\nI know it sounds awesome and\nincredible and an awesome and\n\n9\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.740\nincredible person joining us in the studio\ntoday to teach us those very concepts,\n\n10\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.940\nour good friend Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.040\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.750\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.910\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, thank you for having\nme back in the studio as we continue on\n\n14\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.510\nwith our Cisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals.\n\n15\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.325\nAnd thank you for standing in for\nMiss Cherokee, as she's out.\n\n16\n00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Happy to help.\n\n17\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.890\n&gt;&gt; And you are here helping and\nwe do appreciate it.\n\n18\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.890\nWe are taking look at the concepts\nhere of defense in depth and\n\n19\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.730\nthe principles behind them.\n\n20\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.470\nWhich means we do need to understand\nsomething about the philosophy,\n\n21\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.070\nwhy we would choose to do this,\n\n22\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.980\nas well as the overall principles of how\nwe implement defense in depth as well.\n\n23\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.723\nBut before I get started there, right,\n\n24\n00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:06.970\nbecause of the way that the CCNA\ncybersecurity certification goes, right,\n\n25\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.749\nit doesn't really require you to have\nany background [LAUGH] in CCENT.\n\n26\n00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:14.340\nYou don't have to actually\nhave that as a certification.\n\n27\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.780\nYou don't have to have CCNA routing and\nswitching.\n\n28\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.630\nBut yet they expect you to know it.\n\n29\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.480\nSo it could be that this is your first\nforay into the world of cybersecurity.\n\n30\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.860\nAnd you don't really have any\nbackground in networking and\n\n31\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.220\nsecurity concepts at all.\n\n32\n00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:31.142\n&gt;&gt; That can make this an uphill battle.\n\n33\n00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:32.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It can make this an all uphill battle.\n\n34\n00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:37.345\nAnd so that's why we're kind of slowing\ndown a little bit as we jump into security\n\n35\n00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:41.160\nconcepts where we begin with\nthis idea of defense in depth.\n\n36\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.490\nThe world around us, especially the way\nthat marketing works in the world today,\n\n37\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.970\nand for the consumer market,\nhome users, individuals, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.840\nThey're pretty much told,\n\n39\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.380\nmake sure you have this type of\nsoftware on your computer, right?\n\n40\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.000\nAnd then your computer is protected\nagainst all things bad and\n\n41\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.690\nevil out there on the Internet.\n\n42\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.560\nAnd you are protected and\nyou are safe, and\n\n43\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.080\nyou don't have to worry about\nanything else ever again.\n\n44\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.330\nAnd in some small businesses, they may be\ntold the same thing at a particular level.\n\n45\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.820\nOnce you buy this firewall,\neverything goes away.\n\n46\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.030\nYou don't have to worry\nabout protection anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180\nYou don't have to worry\nabout anything like that.\n\n48\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.280\nAnd what that does is that it makes\nyou have this false sense of security.\n\n49\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.540\nWhere you believe what now that you have\nthe proper software or you have the proper\n\n50\n00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.690\npiece of hardware, yout security\nissues are done and over with.\n\n51\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.367\nBut, Daniel, as we start moving\ninto the larger realm of, well,\n\n52\n00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:41.720\nnetwork security and business security,\ndo we find that to actually be true?\n\n53\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.016\nJust having the right piece of software or\nhaving the right device on our network,\n\n54\n00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:45.694\nis that enough?\n\n55\n00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:49.192\n&gt;&gt; If you want to say one right\npiece of software, then no.\n\n56\n00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's multiple right pieces of\n\n57\n00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.814\nsoftware, multiple right\npieces of hardware.\n\n58\n00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:57.047\nAnd that's kind of what we're\ngetting at today, right, Ronnie,\n\n59\n00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:59.270\nis that it's not just\none single cool device.\n\n60\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.880\nWhich would be awesome if that will be\nthe case but that's not so much reality.\n\n61\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Daniel, that's absolutely right.\n\n62\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.238\nThe very fact is that we're really\ngonna end up finding out something.\n\n63\n00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:12.561\nThat not one piece of software, not one\ndevice is ever gonna be sufficient for\n\n64\n00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:15.510\nall of the security coverage that we need.\n\n65\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.930\nAnd there is a big reason behind this.\n\n66\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.670\nAnd that is because as soon as a company\nends up putting out a new device that says\n\n67\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.880\nwe are kind of the cure to everything.\n\n68\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.470\nThere is already some attacker out there,\nsome hacker,\n\n69\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.310\nsomeone's that saying,\nI'm taking this thing apart.\n\n70\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.790\nAnd I'm gonna look at it\nto the circuit board level.\n\n71\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.730\nAnd so they're already examining details.\n\n72\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.390\nThe same thing with the software.\n\n73\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.960\nOnce they're able to find that software\nout there, there are hundreds,\n\n74\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.610\nmaybe thousands of people\nexamining that software.\n\n75\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.270\nLooking at every line of coding,\nlooking for\n\n76\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.620\nsomething that they use that is not as\nsecure as they believe it's going to be.\n\n77\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.320\nNow if you already have, excuse me,\n\n78\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.870\na background in CCNA security,\nIf you already have a security background,\n\n79\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.120\nyou're saying, Ronnie, this is nothing\nnew, I don't have to worry about it.\n\n80\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.820\nAnd you're right.\n\n81\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.300\nWe're not really telling\nyou anything brand new.\n\n82\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.800\nBut if this is your first foray\ninto the realm of security and\n\n83\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.290\ninto the CCNA realm,\nyou do need to understand that\n\n84\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.410\nit's not gonna be this way\nwhere one device is enough.\n\n85\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.930\nAnd this is where we have to\ncome up with this idea and\n\n86\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.280\nthis concept of what we call defense\nin depth is what we have to call it.\n\n87\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.140\nNow, Cisco does recognize that approach\nthat we call defense in depth.\n\n88\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.530\nSometimes you'll hear in the real world,\n\n89\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.480\nyou'll hear people call it\nthe castle approach to defense.\n\n90\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.300\nAnd I like that analogy,\nDaniel, of the castle approach.\n\n91\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.818\nBecause if you think about in any\nmovie that you've ever seen and\n\n92\n00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:45.792\nthe idea of a castle, it's always\ngrand and giant and looks fortified,\n\n93\n00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:47.635\nnothing that you can penetrate.\n\n94\n00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:50.869\nAnd that's just because it's impressive\nlooking as they come over the hill and\n\n95\n00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:52.640\nthey see that gigantic castle.\n\n96\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.470\nBut once you approach it, just like\nI said in any imagery that you see,\n\n97\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.460\nthere's usually this\nmoat that's out there.\n\n98\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.690\nAnd it's filled with water and then,\nof course, in the kind of really\n\n99\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.810\nfancy ones alligators or sharks or\npiranha, whatever it might be.\n\n100\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.295\nWow that's king of interesting I\nwould not thinking that would-\n\n101\n00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:10.899\n&gt;&gt; Mother in laws [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.785\n&gt;&gt; Mother in law wow.\n\n103\n00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:14.272\nI've never seen one with a-\n&gt;&gt; Demons.\n\n104\n00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:17.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, could be demons, but\nwhatever it might be, right,\n\n105\n00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:19.560\nthere's at least that moat.\n\n106\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.250\nBut then once you actually get\nthrough the moat you're not there yet.\n\n107\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.660\nCuz that means you have to climb the wall\nto even get into the opening entryway.\n\n108\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.104\nAnd that entryway is blocked by\nthis kind of gigantic wall that\n\n109\n00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:33.000\nwe call that drawbridge.\n\n110\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.710\nThat drawbridge is fairly\nhefty in its size, and\n\n111\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.580\nit's only let down by these chains.\n\n112\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.500\nSo if the chain is up, well it\nessentially closes this gigantic door.\n\n113\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.900\nBut even if you were able to now crawl\nthrough the shark-infested waters of\n\n114\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.830\nthe moat, go up the place where you\ncan actually let down the drawbridge,\n\n115\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.370\nright, and then start storming across it.\n\n116\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.610\nNormally when you start seeing this,\n\n117\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.974\nyou also have that gigantic\ngate that looks like a fence.\n\n118\n00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:00.760\n&gt;&gt; A portcullis.\n\n119\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.010\n&gt;&gt; A portcullis, portcullis, yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.800\nWhich is so heavy, it's like 10 or\n20 men couldn't lift it at one time.\n\n121\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.050\nAnd then once you break through there,\nyou still have walls inside,\n\n122\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.540\nyou still have armies inside.\n\n123\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.074\nYou still have the entire walls which\nguards are actually standing on\n\n124\n00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:19.970\nthe top of them with bows and arrows,\nand armies storming down on you.\n\n125\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.530\nAnd now you're actually kind of boxed in,\nright.\n\n126\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.969\nYou're in a kill box is\nwhat you actually are in.\n\n127\n00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.547\nSo there's many different\nlayers of defenses, and\n\n128\n00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:34.290\nwhich you start to see that getting to\nthe inside is pretty much a challenge.\n\n129\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.440\nAnd that's what we wanna see in terms of\nimplementing a strategy for security.\n\n130\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.460\nIt's not all about just saying,\nI know the box that I want to buy.\n\n131\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.040\nI know the software I want to implement.\n\n132\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.770\nIt's about planning out your strategy\nin a way that gives us that approach.\n\n133\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.620\nAnd, Daniel, I have a favorite way\nof actually describing this and\n\n134\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.000\nwhat we really hope that the attacker does\nwith this, and I think you agree with me.\n\n135\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.870\nI call it, we want to bore\nthe attacker to death, right.\n\n136\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally, you're basically\ntrying to demoralize them so\n\n137\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.150\nthat they will just give up and\nsay, you know what?\n\n138\n00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.420\nThis isn't worth my time and effort,\nunless they're getting paid.\n\n139\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.850\nThey would really have to be targeting\nyou for a specific reason to put up with\n\n140\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.778\nall the fences and barriers that you put\ninto place to try to get into your system.\n\n141\n00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.749\nYou want it just to be so\nfrustrating that they go, you know what,\n\n142\n00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:23.484\nI'm just gonna go try somebody else.\n\n143\n00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:26.530\nAnd maybe there's some lower\nhanging fruit out there for myself.\n\n144\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.740\n&gt;&gt; And that is key, right?\n\n145\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.090\nThe lower hanging fruit, you're kinda\npushing them away as much as you can.\n\n146\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.270\nThat is what you want to implement.\n\n147\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.460\nAnd now there's other\nsecurity behind this, right,\n\n148\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.230\nthat makes this important too.\n\n149\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.770\nJust breaking through one layer\nof defense is not enough.\n\n150\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.750\nWe need to have redundant\nstrategies in place as well.\n\n151\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.176\nWhere, like we were talking about\nwith the castle approach, right.\n\n152\n00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:48.029\nOnce you get that drawbridge down,\nthere's what?\n\n153\n00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:51.788\nThere's that portcullis that\nimmediately falls down as well.\n\n154\n00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:57.493\nSo even though the primary defense\nis down, that secondary portcullis,\n\n155\n00:07:57.493 --> 00:08:02.277\nthat can now drop in its place And\nyou're not going to be able to\n\n156\n00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:06.850\nget it to lift back up without\nany easy effort at all.\n\n157\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.430\nThat's what you're trying to see,\nyou're trying to see redundancy\n\n158\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.620\nof different systems really\nhelping to put this in place too.\n\n159\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.000\nNow we start to implement\nthis in network security,\n\n160\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.660\nwe're not really building a castle\nper se and putting in a draw bridge.\n\n161\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.970\nWe are putting in the same types\nof defenses, where we're saying,\n\n162\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.420\nhere's what we could do\nto protect our entry.\n\n163\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.540\nHere's what we can do to protect our data.\n\n164\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.720\nHere's what we can do to protect\nother things that are going on.\n\n165\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.680\nSo it really does come\ndown to those points where\n\n166\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.207\nwe have to think in that particular way.\n\n167\n00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:44.175\nAnd not say, I've got this, I know\nI'm protected, and all it take is for\n\n168\n00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:48.860\nyou to say that, out in public, and then\nsome might goes, watch what happens next.\n\n169\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.336\nAnd then they have course expose in public\nthat something else is happen where\n\n170\n00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:53.891\nthey breached their network too.\n\n171\n00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:58.875\nSo even though I've been using\nthe idea of this castle approach and\n\n172\n00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:04.490\nthe castle analogy, let's talk about\nthe model that they normally show.\n\n173\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.042\nWhich is kind of funny because as much\nas I like about the castle approach,\n\n174\n00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:12.090\nthere's another one that looks more\nlike an onion is what it looks like.\n\n175\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.090\nAnd the castle analogy\nsounds much cooler but\n\n176\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.550\nin reality the onion is probably\nwell where it goes [LAUGH].\n\n177\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the castle approach is really\ngood because it is speaking specifically\n\n178\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.440\nof defense, right?\n\n179\n00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.680\nYou're making layers of defense.\n\n180\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.510\nBut then we're using that term\nlayers which is why people go\n\n181\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.380\nlike an onion, right?\n\n182\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.253\nYou peel back.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n183\n00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:34.061\n&gt;&gt; There's another layer, there's\nanother layer and for illustrative.\n\n184\n00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:36.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Purposes an onion is an easier analogy.\n\n185\n00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:37.612\n&gt;&gt; And are easier to draw.\n\n186\n00:09:37.612 --> 00:09:38.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:38.148 --> 00:09:39.300\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n188\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.148\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes more than anything else.\n\n189\n00:09:40.148 --> 00:09:40.916\nIt's easier to draw.\n\n190\n00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:41.564\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit.\n\n191\n00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:45.685\n&gt;&gt; So, so let's go ahead and take a look\nat my screen as we start to talk about\n\n192\n00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.670\nthis idea of,\nof the approach that we're talking.\n\n193\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.568\nIt still works in the same way\nas the idea of the castle.\n\n194\n00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:54.025\nIf you take this outer wall\nas being the castle, and\n\n195\n00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:57.100\nthen you continue to move\nin toward the asset, right?\n\n196\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.260\nWell, this is the kind of key that we want\nto understand for what we are protecting.\n\n197\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.633\nIs that it shouldn't just be one device,\none piece of software,\n\n198\n00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:11.483\nour asset should be protected by\nmultiple layers of security controls or\n\n199\n00:10:11.483 --> 00:10:13.882\nimplementations that we might do.\n\n200\n00:10:13.882 --> 00:10:17.923\nSo when we start to take a look, it\nmight be from the very outside as people\n\n201\n00:10:17.923 --> 00:10:22.630\nare coming in from our, or off of our\nnetwork, coming inside of our network.\n\n202\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.760\nWe might be implementing,\nof course, firewalls and routers.\n\n203\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.220\nNow, sometimes you might think,\n\n204\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.330\nwhy the heck is a router\nconsidered a security device?\n\n205\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.375\nWell, the way that packets are routed,\nIf I don't actually allow for\n\n206\n00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:38.040\ncertain routes to come in,\nthey're not gonna really ever approach.\n\n207\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.965\nSo even though it's not per se a natural\ntrue security device in itself.\n\n208\n00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:48.344\nIt's a way to deflect, which says look I\ncan actually implement a role very easily.\n\n209\n00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:53.220\nIt comes in form a network I know that's\nbeen constantly attacking everybody else.\n\n210\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.803\nI may just go ahead and enter in that\nparticular IP address range, and go yeah,\n\n211\n00:10:56.803 --> 00:10:59.263\nfrom this network,\nI'm not accepting any traffic.\n\n212\n00:10:59.263 --> 00:11:03.469\n&gt;&gt; I find it interesting that they don't\nconsider a Firewall a security device per\n\n213\n00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:07.249\nse, because you can literally stop\nall traffic from coming into your.\n\n214\n00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:11.877\nAnd it is something as an attacker,\nsomeone who knows about attacking\n\n215\n00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:17.100\nthat you have to put it into your\nmethodology of getting it into the system.\n\n216\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.580\nThe firewalls are going to be in place.\n\n217\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.840\nI might not be able to go through\nthe door I want to go through,\n\n218\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.860\nbecause the only door that's open,\nis this one.\n\n219\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.300\nSo I've got to work with that.\n\n220\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.950\nIt can definitely be a deterrence.\n\n221\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.622\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI think the firewall part is,\n\n222\n00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:29.097\nit's what I said about the routers.\n\n223\n00:11:29.097 --> 00:11:29.780\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sorry.\n\n224\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.830\nMy mistake for doing that.\n\n225\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.510\nBut yeah, usually a router,\nwhen I put that at the outside layer.\n\n226\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.280\nA router, all it does is just route\ntraffic from one network to another one.\n\n227\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.300\nBut I can put an ACL in place,\n\n228\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.170\nI can sit there and go look, if it comes\nfrom this source address, drop it.\n\n229\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.700\nI don't care what it does, just drop\nthat traffic, and let it do that.\n\n230\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.410\nBut a Firewall, Daniel's right.\n\n231\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.071\nThat one usually is going to be the type\nof defense strategy that we want\n\n232\n00:11:56.071 --> 00:12:00.981\nright at the beginning to be able to\ncheck and do a lot of different things.\n\n233\n00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:02.816\nEspecially with today's firewalls,\n\n234\n00:12:02.816 --> 00:12:05.390\nwe're taking about the stateful firewalls,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.880\nWhere it's really about the traffic that\nif I don't initiate it from the inside.\n\n236\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.450\nI'm definitely not accepting any calls\nfrom the outside and that will help\n\n237\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.280\nto drop the majority of them unless\nsomebody is able to spoof the packets and\n\n238\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.230\nbe able to get in too but\nthat's were we started again.\n\n239\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.840\nSo we go ahead and\n\n240\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.640\nwe assume something here in all\nsecurity as you start planning for it.\n\n241\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.670\nYou do not assume that\nyou're going to be safe 100%\n\n242\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.100\nof the time once you implement security.\n\n243\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.840\nYou always assume that somebody\nhas figured out a way around it.\n\n244\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.650\nThat's what you start from and\nthen once you do that,\n\n245\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.310\nyou go all right, if they get around this,\nwhat is gonna be my next particular\n\n246\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.210\nprocedure to protect\nwhatever asset it's on?\n\n247\n00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.871\nAnd here I'm using as an example files\nthat are on a computer, database or\n\n248\n00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:50.900\nsomething.\n\n249\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.470\nSo at that point if they get\npast my network security\n\n250\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.450\nthen I take a look at the idea,\nthe platform itself.\n\n251\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.900\nWhere are the vulnerabilities inside.\n\n252\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.766\nDo I have an operating system?\n\n253\n00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:03.965\nI keep wanna saying iOS.\n\n254\n00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:05.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's not right.\n\n255\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.258\nAn operating system that is unpatched.\n\n256\n00:13:08.258 --> 00:13:11.940\nMan, could you find vulnerabilities\nin something like that?\n\n257\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.310\nYes.\nAre they listed somewhere?\n\n258\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.300\nProbably.\n\n259\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.540\nIt is the very fact that somebody's\ngonna take advantage of it?\n\n260\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.090\nYes.\nIt's gonna happen.\n\n261\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.420\nAre you not updating your anti virus?\n\n262\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.560\nYou name it, if you don't have that\nas part of your security platform,\n\n263\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.671\nwell that is a another area\nthat they can get through.\n\n264\n00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:32.595\nBut even if you do remember you don't\nassume that now that I've got a Firewall,\n\n265\n00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:37.510\nI'm patched my antivirus is working\neverything seems to be good.\n\n266\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.976\nWell you always say all\nright what if they get past\n\n267\n00:13:40.976 --> 00:13:42.388\nthat well what do they\nhave to deal with next.\n\n268\n00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:45.870\nWell they may just go ahead and\nlaunch whatever application to see what\n\n269\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.140\ninformation they can get without having\nto dig through the coding at that point.\n\n270\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.530\nAnd so even at that point right they may\neven go ahead and take a look at some\n\n271\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.830\napplication go I know a vulnerability for\nthat particular application.\n\n272\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.460\nLet me run that right there and\nthere it is.\n\n273\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.760\nAnd so you might go ahead and\nexpect the idea of coding.\n\n274\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.340\nIs so nice in today's world, Daniel, that\na lot of times on the coding that we get,\n\n275\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.470\nespecially from these gigantic projects,\nthat they go ahead and\n\n276\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.830\nthey put the source code up on GitHub.\n\n277\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.950\nSo that way,\nyou can download the source code and\n\n278\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.900\nexamine every line of\ncoding if you wanted to,\n\n279\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.180\nbefore implementing it on your network\nbecause you can buy software from anybody.\n\n280\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.250\nBut if you think about it,\n\n281\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.980\ndo you know anybody that works\nat that software company?\n\n282\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.770\nYou may not know them at all.\n\n283\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.400\nAnd so in that way,\nyou're putting a trust in that software.\n\n284\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.100\nBut if you go look,\naccording to my own security policy,\n\n285\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.895\nif we're going to install this, we need to\ndownload and inspect source coding of it.\n\n286\n00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:45.100\nWell a lot of companies will\ngive you that ability to do so,\n\n287\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.820\nto make sure that there's no weakness\nin it that may be potential or\n\n288\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.260\nmay be something that your network's\nlooking for as well, okay.\n\n289\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.660\nNow even if they get through that,\nokay you still go ahead,\n\n290\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.640\nall right I'm gonna assume that\nthey're gonna get through that.\n\n291\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.660\nEven though they might not, you might go\neverything at this point is 100% safe.\n\n292\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.600\nThen you move on to, well,\nwhat if they do that.\n\n293\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.560\nWell, how do I protect\nthe individual files at this point.\n\n294\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.090\nYou might start with\nsome type of encryption.\n\n295\n00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.090\nAnd encryption is really great.\n\n296\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.810\nIt really works well.\n\n297\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.555\nAnd it jumbles up the data into\na mess that's not easily found.\n\n298\n00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:24.600\nFigured out, unless you have the proper\nkey to be able to decrypt that.\n\n299\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.980\nSo by doing something like that,\n\n300\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.030\nyou may actually implement\nthe idea of file encryption, but\n\n301\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.460\nnow of course in today's world, the idea\nof right's management is key as well.\n\n302\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.140\nSo most of the time, people might\nthink I would just take the data,\n\n303\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.847\nI'll pull it off of Ronnie's system,\nthat's compromised now.\n\n304\n00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:48.293\nAnd I'll bring it to my system, and I'll\njust change all of the permissions to it,\n\n305\n00:15:48.293 --> 00:15:49.511\nand have access to it.\n\n306\n00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:50.800\nAnd no big deal.\n\n307\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.940\nIt's all done.\n\n308\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.851\nAre there ways around it?\n\n309\n00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.521\nProbably.\n\n310\n00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:57.176\nBut not everybody has a way around it yet.\n\n311\n00:15:57.176 --> 00:16:02.688\nSo the idea of Rights Management allows\nus to still have the ability to control,\n\n312\n00:16:02.688 --> 00:16:08.300\neven if it's not on my system, it calls\nbacks and says, this is Ronnie's file.\n\n313\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.400\nI don't care what you say you are.\n\n314\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.250\nI'm not gonna allow you to open it until\nyou have the permissions from Ronnie\n\n315\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.320\nto do so.\n\n316\n00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.550\nSo until you do something like that,\nRights Management is key and\n\n317\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.720\nwe're gonna see that that's really\npart of the protection systems that\n\n318\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.770\nCisco likes to call part of the,\nCisco borderless types of networks, right.\n\n319\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.710\nCuz even though there are true borders to\nour networks, they're sitting there like,\n\n320\n00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.850\nlook files, data and stuff,\nthat's borderless today,\n\n321\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.850\nand if that belongs to you,\nit should belong to you.\n\n322\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.130\nAnd this is how they protect things\nlike music, and some other stuff here.\n\n323\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.540\nThat digital rights manager stuff.\n\n324\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.920\nIt's still the same concept and idea.\n\n325\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.670\nAnd even after that, right,\nyou have to have a response.\n\n326\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.210\nIf they get all the way in,\nwhat is it that you are going to do.\n\n327\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.890\nYou put all these protection\nlayers in place, but\n\n328\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.890\nwhat is it that you're gonna do.\n\n329\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.430\nSo you might actually have another system\nthat tells us there's a response to it.\n\n330\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.770\nThe IPS may stop it directly in its track,\nor\n\n331\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.020\nyou may actually an IDS that\njust simply says, all right,\n\n332\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.440\nI sense that this is going on, let me\ngo ahead and alert the network admin.\n\n333\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.040\nSays send an email to Daniel\nthat an attack has occurred or\n\n334\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.130\nthat suspicious activity's going on.\n\n335\n00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.290\nDaniel gets the email at\n3 o'clock in the morning.\n\n336\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.610\nHe looks at it and just turns over and\ngoes, no big deal.\n\n337\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.815\n&gt;&gt; I'm tired, I'm tired.\n\n338\n00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:23.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but you kinda get the idea, right.\n\n339\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.440\nSo each one of these is\npart of the planning and\n\n340\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.730\nnature of all the security\nthat we have to have in place.\n\n341\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.730\nSo when we start to take a look,\n\n342\n00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.080\nthat's how we take a look at\nthe idea of defense in depth.\n\n343\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.690\nThe philosophy behind it that we have to\nunderstand of course is that when we start\n\n344\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.660\nchoosing the different devices and\nsoftware, okay.\n\n345\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.100\nWell how do we know what to choose,\nwhat is that we should be looking for\n\n346\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.270\nwhen we do this.\n\n347\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.830\nRemember that not every piece of\nhardware is perfect as much as they\n\n348\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.550\nclaim that it is.\n\n349\n00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.540\nWait for it, talk to other people and\nfind out, this is great at spotting this.\n\n350\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.920\nBut we noticed that people were able\nto get through on something else.\n\n351\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.020\nAnd you might find that out.\n\n352\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.870\nWell that's fine.\n\n353\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.300\nThat's when you actually go, all right so\n\n354\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.420\nwhat device can help me\nto kinda compliment that?\n\n355\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.100\nSo the products that we choose in\ndefense in-depth should be complimentary\n\n356\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.480\nto each other.\n\n357\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.290\nHelping out in areas in which one is weak\non, the other may be strong on as well.\n\n358\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.630\nAnd that helps fill the gap in what\nwe need during the implementation\n\n359\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.550\nof some of the equipment that we actually\nput in place, or some of the controls.\n\n360\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.140\nThat's usually what I call them,\nis controls.\n\n361\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.380\nThe other thing that we also want to\nmake sure of in terms of philosophy of\n\n362\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.990\nimplementing these things,\n\n363\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.920\nis to ensure also that they are not\ndependent upon one another.\n\n364\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.300\nYou do not want this house of cards,\n\n365\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.125\nI was trying to think of\nwhat we talk about right?\n\n366\n00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:54.710\nWhere you pull out one thing and\nthe entire house of cards falls down.\n\n367\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.860\nThat's what you don't want happening.\n\n368\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.440\nOne system not turning on and\n\n369\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.580\ntherefore the other security\nsystems don't turn on either.\n\n370\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.430\nSo implementing this kind of thing means\nthat those systems as much as they're\n\n371\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.590\na complementary to one another to help\nthem in their places where they're week,\n\n372\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.650\nthey also should not be\ndependent on one another for\n\n373\n00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.770\ntheir operation on a day\nto day basis either.\n\n374\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.490\nSo this way there should\n\n375\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.160\nbe no interdependence in terms\nof the control that they have.\n\n376\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.290\nAnd also, they should be able\nto not be effected by the, or\n\n377\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.690\nthe factors of another system turning on.\n\n378\n00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.730\nSo, for instance,\nif you have one security system that says,\n\n379\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.580\nI need to output this data,\nand the other one says hey,\n\n380\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.090\nI need to accept input before I\ncan actually do anything about it.\n\n381\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.440\nWell that system is now dependent\nupon the primary system\n\n382\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.580\nbefore it can do anything and\nthat may be bad.\n\n383\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.120\nYou may actually have to go, there's\na little bit of redundancy in these\n\n384\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.200\nproducts, okay, but they need to stand\nalone just in case one system fails.\n\n385\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.620\n&gt;&gt; So really at that point it becomes\none product to be honest with you,\n\n386\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.160\nbecause they're relying on each other.\n\n387\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.850\nThen they are an inter woven system,\nand if one fails the other fails.\n\n388\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.180\nYou've taken them both down, so\nit's really a single point of failure.\n\n389\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.220\n&gt;&gt; And that's what your trying\nto rid of anything else.\n\n390\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.720\nIs that you're taking a look at all\nthe defenses that you have, and\n\n391\n00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.550\ngo all right, now that I've\ngotten this strategy in place,\n\n392\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.420\nnow that I have these devices,\nI think I want to implement.\n\n393\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.690\nWhere is that point that if something like\nwhat Daniel was describing here happens\n\n394\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.300\nand that's what you wanna go back and\nlook at.\n\n395\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.880\nAnd then that's where you would\nimplement redundancy like,\n\n396\n00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.850\nhow can I make sure this one actually\ndoesn't happen that this one does.\n\n397\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.712\nSo like right here at ITPRO.TV,\n\n398\n00:20:30.712 --> 00:20:34.770\nthe way that we set it up is we have\ntwo routers and two firewalls, okay.\n\n399\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.190\nThat's how we do it.\n\n400\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.620\nJust in case what, if one router fails,\nthe other one takes over.\n\n401\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:44.010\nTwo firewalls are still in place, and that\nmeans that even if one firewall fails,\n\n402\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.950\nthe other one still takes over,\nand we can do that.\n\n403\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.170\nSo we,\n&gt;&gt; Hence term fail over?\n\n404\n00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.464\n&gt;&gt; Fail over,\nyeah [CROSSTALK] yeah that's right.\n\n405\n00:20:52.464 --> 00:20:57.850\n&gt;&gt; So that's a part of the the nature of\nwhat we've got to do that in redundancy.\n\n406\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.630\nCuz we thought about it.\n\n407\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.590\nWe were like, hey,\nour PF Sense firewall that we use,\n\n408\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:05.610\neven though we should probably use a Cisco\nASA on the Cisco show, but let's say this.\n\n409\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:11.660\nOur firewall, let me just generically, our\nfirewall that we use, we've used one for\n\n410\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.060\nyears and years now, okay, and\na single one, and it's never failed us.\n\n411\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.740\nIt never has.\n\n412\n00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.600\nAt the beginning of ITPRO.TV, and\neven a couple of years before that is,\n\n413\n00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.600\nthe concept was developing,\nwe started that one firewall and\n\n414\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.590\nit had never had caused problem at all.\n\n415\n00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.655\nBut as we moved in to\nour new studios here,\n\n416\n00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:31.429\nwe said we don't want anything\nto stop our streaming and\n\n417\n00:21:31.429 --> 00:21:35.630\nour production of anything that we're\ndoing that goes out live or anything.\n\n418\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.908\nSo we said where's our single point?\n\n419\n00:21:37.908 --> 00:21:40.910\nWell, if our firewall and\nour routers go down, then we're toast.\n\n420\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.000\nAnd that's what we initially found out.\n\n421\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.880\nSo we said, all right,\nlet's implement redundancy there.\n\n422\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.077\nAnd so we're trying to get rid of all\nthose single points of failure, so\n\n423\n00:21:49.077 --> 00:21:51.634\nthat we can have a good,\nsmooth system for delivery, but\n\n424\n00:21:51.634 --> 00:21:53.360\nit works in the security concept too.\n\n425\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.780\nWe don't want one security system saying,\n\n426\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.300\nI didn't turn on even though all 95 did\nand the other 95 are now saying all right,\n\n427\n00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.990\nI'm on but I can't do anything\nuntil that first system turns on.\n\n428\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.910\nThat would be a bad, bad day.\n\n429\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that wouldn't be fun.\n\n430\n00:22:06.427 --> 00:22:09.743\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, just a couple more\nthings, right, in terms of principle.\n\n431\n00:22:09.743 --> 00:22:11.860\nAll right, so now, here it is.\n\n432\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.860\nWe've got the defense\nin-depth concept down, okay?\n\n433\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.410\nWe understand this idea, the layered\napproach and go all right, that's cool.\n\n434\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.510\nI know these devices have\nto complement each other.\n\n435\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.260\nBut Daniel, when I was first beginning in\nsecurity, I started realizing something.\n\n436\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.610\nAs much as I knew what\nneeded to be implemented,\n\n437\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.890\nI had no clue where to\nimplement something.\n\n438\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.390\nSo let me give Daniel a for instance here.\n\n439\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.870\nSo we have a router and\nwe have a firewall.\n\n440\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:37.670\nAnd usually on the router,\n\n441\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.140\nright, one side faces the Internet,\none side faces your LAN.\n\n442\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.750\nAnd then, there was a firewall and\n\n443\n00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.250\nI was just told simply,\nput the firewall in place.\n\n444\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.260\nSo I started thinking I was like all\nright, firewall can act as a router so\n\n445\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.220\ndo I put that on the outside facing\nthe LAN or I put it on the inside,\n\n446\n00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.160\nfacing my LAN, and like everybody else,\n\n447\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.960\nprobably a little bit prideful-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Not saying, I don't know where it goes.\n\n449\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.660\nI just kinda said, all right, I'll do it,\nand hopefully it's gonna be right.\n\n450\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.741\nSo I of course didn't ask, and [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which led me to some consternation\n\n452\n00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:15.331\na little bit But overall Daniel,\n\n453\n00:23:15.331 --> 00:23:19.254\nfor somebody's that new at it, that\ncould be just a challenge itself, right?\n\n454\n00:23:19.254 --> 00:23:22.261\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nDon't let [INAUDIBLE] come into play here,\n\n455\n00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:23.730\nand do like Ronnie did.\n\n456\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.170\nIf you don't know, you ask somebody.\n\n457\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.050\nThat's always a good thing to do.\n\n458\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.310\nBut I can see where the problem exists.\n\n459\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.350\nRonnie's right, a firewall can route.\n\n460\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.000\nIt can do that.\n\n461\n00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.800\nIt's kinda what it does.\n\n462\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.210\nAnd a router can do some firewallingt.\n\n463\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.330\nSo what does it matter where put one or\nthe other?\n\n464\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.710\nYou gotta remember\nthe purpose of each device.\n\n465\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.770\nWhat's a router's purpose?\n\n466\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.360\nIt's to route traffic,\nnot to be a firewall.\n\n467\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.139\nCan it do that?\nYes, but\n\n468\n00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:47.033\nthat's tertiary to what\nits main function is.\n\n469\n00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:50.091\nA firewall, on the other hand,\nit's main purpose is to firewall,\n\n470\n00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:51.066\nis to block traffic.\n\n471\n00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:52.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can it route?\n\n472\n00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:54.437\nYes, but\nit is tertiary to its main function.\n\n473\n00:23:54.437 --> 00:23:57.990\nSo you always wanna put your router\non the edge of your network.\n\n474\n00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.630\nAnd then the firewall right inside there,\nlet them do their jobs respectively.\n\n475\n00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that would've been great\nif I would've ask that question, right?\n\n476\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.324\nBut the very fact is I was like,\nof course, I could do this.\n\n477\n00:24:07.324 --> 00:24:08.780\nWell, I'll just go ahead and\nput it in place-\n\n478\n00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, it'll work.\n\n479\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.000\n&gt;&gt; And it can.\n\n480\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.956\n&gt;&gt; It's not optimal.\n\n481\n00:24:11.956 --> 00:24:12.753\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n482\n00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:15.880\nit's not the way that you\nwant to do things at times.\n\n483\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.500\nSo this means you do have\nto depend on other people.\n\n484\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.410\nUnderstanding the placement of these\nthings as key in concept, right?\n\n485\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.180\nWhether it's software or whether it's\nactually gonna be some type of device,\n\n486\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.370\nyou have to know where it needs to go\nif you're going to end up doing this.\n\n487\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.110\nSo you gotta think about the idea here.\n\n488\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.740\nAnd the overall principle of it is\nthat we need to defend on every entry\n\n489\n00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.090\npoint that we have into our network.\n\n490\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.145\nHopefully, it's just one.\n\n491\n00:24:38.145 --> 00:24:41.683\nBut if there's multiple ones,\ntwo different ISPs that you have, well,\n\n492\n00:24:41.683 --> 00:24:44.326\nit means that you need to defend on both,\nnot just one.\n\n493\n00:24:44.326 --> 00:24:47.830\nIt'd be silly for you to defend on one,\nbut does it happen?\n\n494\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.270\n&gt;&gt; It does happen, it's funny.\n\n495\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.250\nIf you're sitting there, you're like,\nwe put this big gate, and a draw bridge,\n\n496\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.580\nand the whole thing.\n\n497\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.610\nBut there's a back door, and it's wide\nopen, and there's no guards on it.\n\n498\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.070\nAnd why don't we just walk around\nover there and go inside this castle?\n\n499\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.800\nThat's what you're doing if you've got\nmultiple points of entry and you're not\n\n500\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.490\ndefending, at least some defense on each\npoint, you're just leaving yourself open.\n\n501\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, along with that, right?\n\n502\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.100\nEven if you're inside of your network,\npeople that always think that, well,\n\n503\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.990\nnow that I've got my perimeter protected,\ndo I need to protect the individual host?\n\n504\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.180\nYes, even then, remember,\nsneaker net is still a possibility.\n\n505\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.130\nWhere somebody brings in\nmalicious software on,\n\n506\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.030\nI wanna say on DVD or CD anymore,\nbut today it's USB drives.\n\n507\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.511\nThey bring them in and they infecting\nfrom the inside of your network.\n\n508\n00:25:30.511 --> 00:25:32.674\nNow that they bypassed\nyour perimeter security,\n\n509\n00:25:32.674 --> 00:25:36.090\nyou can still get an infection in your\nnetwork just by something like that.\n\n510\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.910\n&gt;&gt; There's a reason they\ncall them Trojan horses.\n\n511\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.489\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] it really is kinda funny.\n\n512\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.132\nYeah, so\n\n513\n00:25:42.132 --> 00:25:46.304\ndefend every place that you can on your\nnetwork that is needing that defense.\n\n514\n00:25:46.304 --> 00:25:49.581\nAnd then when we start talking\nabout spending the amount of money,\n\n515\n00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:53.280\nit's real easy to sit there and put all\nyour money into this one big device.\n\n516\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.180\nAnd have complete confidence,\nwhich is great.\n\n517\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.190\nBut at the same time, you need to put\nthe value where the valuable asset is.\n\n518\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.330\nSo spend as much money as it takes\nto how are you actually evaluate\n\n519\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.620\nthe asset that you need to protect.\n\n520\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.380\nDon't put the cheapest security that\nyou can on your most valuable items.\n\n521\n00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.483\nDon't put the most expensive\nsecurity that you can on your,\n\n522\n00:26:16.483 --> 00:26:19.548\nI hate to say it,\nmostly inexpensive items.\n\n523\n00:26:19.548 --> 00:26:22.642\nIt is, I won't say cheap, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It has a negative connotation\n\n524\n00:26:22.642 --> 00:26:25.225\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] negative connotation.\n\n525\n00:26:25.225 --> 00:26:30.210\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nhave that same parity, right?\n\n526\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.600\nThe more valuable the asset is,\nthe more value you should put into\n\n527\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.730\nthe defense of that asset\nis also a key to us, too.\n\n528\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.460\nAnd then, of course,\nbuilding multiple layers.\n\n529\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.080\nAnd at the end, making sure you\nhave a good response system.\n\n530\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.950\nImplement some type of IDS or\nIPS that alerts you when things happen.\n\n531\n00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.920\nImplementing all the security in\nthe world and then not monitoring it, or\n\n532\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.850\nnot being able to know\nthat something's happened.\n\n533\n00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.084\nIt's always one of those funny things,\nright?\n\n534\n00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:00.240\nYou go, I know that security's in place.\n\n535\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.720\nAnd then someone like Daniel walks in and\ngoes,\n\n536\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.979\nhow do you know it's working, Ronnie?\n\n537\n00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:05.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I really don't know if it's\n\n538\n00:27:05.444 --> 00:27:06.047\nworking or not.\n\n539\n00:27:06.047 --> 00:27:09.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If your IDS is the fact that,\n\n540\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.535\nhey, my website's gone.\n\n541\n00:27:10.535 --> 00:27:13.670\n[LAUGH] Not the best system on earth,\nright?\n\n542\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:14.476\nYou need something else.\n\n543\n00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:17.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I mean,\nthat is the key, right?\n\n544\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.720\nCuz we've all done it before,\nwhere it's like, I've gone for\n\n545\n00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.360\na whole year without my antivirus\nalarming me to anything.\n\n546\n00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.520\nAnd that's like that's cool, but\nhow do you really know it's working?\n\n547\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.590\nI don't wanna go out there and\ninfect it on purpose.\n\n548\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.780\nBut at the same time,\nyou need to have a system that says, look,\n\n549\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.020\nhere's what's going on, especially when\nyou're monitoring multiple systems.\n\n550\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.890\nCuz if you don't, you really are, you're\nliving by faith, which is great for me.\n\n551\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.085\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I like that idea, but at the same time,\n\n552\n00:27:44.085 --> 00:27:46.822\nit's something that you've\ngotta be able to monitor.\n\n553\n00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:49.190\nYou've gotta be able to have\nreports that come back to you.\n\n554\n00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.910\nOr you're really just saying, all right,\nI know the defense structure is up.\n\n555\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.675\nMaybe somebody isn't taking advantage of\nthat backdoor that I didn't think about.\n\n556\n00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.144\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, as the Gipper used to say,\n\n557\n00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:01.009\ntrust, but verify, right?\n\n558\n00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:05.109\nYes, we trust that our systems are doing\nwhat we've paid them to do, or whatever,\n\n559\n00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:06.560\nset them in place to do.\n\n560\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.613\nBut we also need to be verifying\nthat these thing are happening.\n\n561\n00:28:08.613 --> 00:28:11.280\nIDS, IPS is a great ways to do that.\n\n562\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.020\nMonitoring systems like SIEMs,\nAlienVault, things of that nature\n\n563\n00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.070\nthat do all the log aggregation,\nsyslogs and all that coming to one spot.\n\n564\n00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.369\nYou need to put that in your\ndaily routine as, is everything?\n\n565\n00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:23.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Check those health checks,\n\n566\n00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.130\nas we like to call them.\n\n567\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.020\nEverything looks green, I don't see\na whole lot of red, that's good.\n\n568\n00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.120\nWe'll take a look at where those\nred spots are and fix them,\n\n569\n00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.056\nmake sure they turn green.\n\n570\n00:28:32.056 --> 00:28:35.250\nThat's what you wanna see, and\nit needs to be a part of your daily grind.\n\n571\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.816\nBecause if not,\nsomeone's gonna be doing something.\n\n572\n00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:40.170\nAnd you're not going to find out\nuntil the worst has happened\n\n573\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, and Daniel,\n\n574\n00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.470\nthat's pretty much that concept and\nthe principles behind defense in depth.\n\n575\n00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.298\nSo we've taken a look at the entire\nonion or the entire castle, whatever.\n\n576\n00:28:49.298 --> 00:28:51.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am mixing complete analogies today,\n\n577\n00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:53.600\nno matter what I'm doing.\n\n578\n00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.630\nBut just kind of remember\nthat that's the goal, right?\n\n579\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.883\nIt's not about spending more money.\n\n580\n00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:03.314\nIt's all about the idea of we wanna make\nsure we protect the assets that we have\n\n581\n00:29:03.314 --> 00:29:07.900\nwith the proper amount of protections\nthat are actually available to us.\n\n582\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.898\nAnd to use it most effectively, and\ndefense in depth is the way to do that.\n\n583\n00:29:10.898 --> 00:29:13.124\n&gt;&gt; All right, great concept, great topic.\n\n584\n00:29:13.124 --> 00:29:15.150\nSomething you definitely\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n585\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.132\nI know Ronnie's been chomping\nat the bit to get away so\n\n586\n00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:19.572\nhe can carve a castle out of an onion\nwith a pen knife or something.\n\n587\n00:29:19.572 --> 00:29:20.088\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n588\n00:29:20.088 --> 00:29:21.735\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So looking at our clock,\n\n589\n00:29:21.735 --> 00:29:24.231\nit looks like we're well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n590\n00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:25.658\nRonnie, thanks for stopping by.\n\n591\n00:29:25.658 --> 00:29:28.250\nWe do thank our audience for\njoining us, as well.\n\n592\n00:29:28.250

Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.470\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.480\n&gt;&gt; It's going great today.\n\n12\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.050\nThank you for having me back as we take\na look of course into the realm of\n\n13\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.700\nsecurity terminology\nmore than anything else.\n\n14\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.443\nThere are a lot of different security\nconcepts and some terms that Cisco\n\n15\n00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:48.120\nreally just wants you to be prepared for\nas you get ready for this exam.\n\n16\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.972\nAnd it's very important that we do have\nthis understanding of these terms.\n\n17\n00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:55.660\nYou're gonna see them on the exam, but\nthey're also something that you'll see\n\n18\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.830\ndaily as a basis, as you start entering\nin more and more into the job market.\n\n19\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.380\nAnd you get into that realm of security\nif there are some retail front.\n\n20\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.660\nYou're gonna see this more if you\nactually work for a healthcare company,\n\n21\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.660\nyou're gonna see it.\n\n22\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.200\nInsurance company,\nyou're gonna see all these terms.\n\n23\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.170\nYou name it, they're gonna start\nfloating around your head and\n\n24\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.290\nyou're not gonna know what they mean.\n\n25\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.050\nSo we're at least it will give you an\nintroduction to some of these terms today.\n\n26\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.920\nMake sure you define them and\nunderstand what they're all about.\n\n27\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.430\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie.\n\n28\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.189\nWell, we've talked about this a little\nbit before the show because this is\n\n29\n00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.589\nbasically a vocabulary\nlesson in a lot of ways.\n\n30\n00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.277\nAnd understanding these terms,\nI wanna tee them up for Ronnie, and\n\n31\n00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:32.890\nRonnie's gonna take it away so\nhe can define these things for us.\n\n32\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.400\nSo get your note taking skills ready or\n\n33\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.590\nyour listening ear on and\nthat's how we're gonna run.\n\n34\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.062\nSo we're gonna start off with risk.\n\n35\n00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:41.584\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Risk is a very important thing as\n\n36\n00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.560\na good place to start, should I say.\n\n37\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.390\nWhat is risk?\n\n38\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.640\nHow do we define it\ninstead of cyber security?\n\n39\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, when you start to take\na look at the concept of risk,\n\n40\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.160\nthe hard thing that most people have when\nwe take a look at this idea of risk.\n\n41\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.493\nIs that they start thinking\nabout things like is this\n\n42\n00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:02.650\na weakness like an unpatched system?\n\n43\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.573\nIs this something that we have to worry\nabout in terms of I didn't lock all\n\n44\n00:02:07.573 --> 00:02:09.360\nthe doors in my building.\n\n45\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.520\nIs that what we're\ntalking in terms of risk?\n\n46\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.660\nWell, a lot of the times\nwhen we talk about risk,\n\n47\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.960\nthere's really two factors\nthat are involved.\n\n48\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.740\nOne factor of course is the probability\nthat something happening.\n\n49\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.153\nNow when we start dealing in\nthe realm of probabilities,\n\n50\n00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:27.430\nyou're now talking about the idea\nof a chance of something happening.\n\n51\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.670\nSo we're talking about the chance of a\nlikelihood of some type of risk occurring.\n\n52\n00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.860\nOr some type of incident\noccurring that causes us lost or\n\n53\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.510\ndamage to our organization.\n\n54\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.800\nThe other part about risk that we also\nhave to worry about is the idea of impact.\n\n55\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.810\nHow does this affect our company.\n\n56\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.340\nSo the way that we deal with that if we\ntake a look at my screen there's a couple\n\n57\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.320\nof things here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.180\nSo on my screen I have just a basic\nchart that as we take a look here\n\n59\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.290\nwe're gonna see the idea of probability\nversus impact is where it really begins.\n\n60\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.030\nOn the left hand side I have high to low,\nand then of course low to high here.\n\n61\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.490\nAnd the way that we normally take\nsomething like this is that we start of\n\n62\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.610\nwith whatever concept\nthat we take is risky.\n\n63\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd we say, for my business,\nwhat is it going to be?\n\n64\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.960\nAnd I take a look at and go, what is\nthe impact of what that particular tool or\n\n65\n00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.980\nproduct that I'm offering gonna be, what\nis the probability of that impact as well.\n\n66\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.020\nSo I'm might find out something\nin a market of some sort\n\n67\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.290\nthat the probability of this thing\nimpacting my business is very high.\n\n68\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.650\nSo I would market appear where there\nis actually a high chance of impact and\n\n69\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.630\nhigh chance of probability.\n\n70\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.270\nAnd this particular quadrant breaks down\ninto a four quadrant like this, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.360\nWhere you actually end up having\nhigh probability, high impact.\n\n72\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.900\nAnd then of course down here in low\nprobability, low impact, high probability,\n\n73\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.530\nlow impact.\n\n74\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.100\nAnd of course low probability,\nhigh impact.\n\n75\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.250\nAll these gives us this ability to say,\n\n76\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.800\nhere's the way that we take a look at\nthe risk that we have to our business.\n\n77\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.910\nWhen it comes in to the realm of cyber\nsecurity and security fundamentals.\n\n78\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.310\nWe have to weigh the concept of whether or\nnot to defend something,\n\n79\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.400\nor not because you just\ncan't defend everything.\n\n80\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.913\nEvery time you think that you've got\na handle on every bit of security that you\n\n81\n00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:17.100\ncan get a handle on.\n\n82\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.673\nIt is the attackers that\ncome up with new and\n\n83\n00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:24.510\ninnovative ways that show us that\nwe haven't thought of everything.\n\n84\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.960\nAnd the reason behind that is very simple.\n\n85\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.470\nEven if you have a company of hundreds or\nthousands of people working for you.\n\n86\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.450\nYou're still dealing with a massive\nvolunteer army around the entire world\n\n87\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.060\nthat's up 24 hours a day figuring\nthese things out and trying to go.\n\n88\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.901\nYou know, they didn't think about this and\n\n89\n00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:45.200\nthen they find that\nimplementation into your system.\n\n90\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.530\nSometimes it's fairly easy, and when\nthey do that, and you go all right, so\n\n91\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.870\nyou take a look at say,\nI'm going to take my server 2008 computer,\n\n92\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.910\nand I'm gonna put it on my node\nwith no anti virus running.\n\n93\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.910\nI'm not gonna run updates and\npatches on the thing at all.\n\n94\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.724\nAnd I now go, well there's\na vulnerability out there in which,\n\n95\n00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.616\nI start reading on different\nblogs that say what?\n\n96\n00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.940\nHey those 2008 machines\nare actually vulnerable to this and\n\n97\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.423\nthat probably a high probability\nthat my machine could be you now,\n\n98\n00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:23.120\n[LAUGHTER] impacted by this And\nwhat is the impact.\n\n99\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.780\nAs I read, it says, devastating to\nthe machine or erases all data,\n\n100\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.800\nwell that's a high impact.\n\n101\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280\nWell this gives me the ability to go,\n\n102\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.400\nwell maybe I need to kind of think up on\nmy strategy again on fixing this idea.\n\n103\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.015\nSo it is something that we\nhave to worry about, and\n\n104\n00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:42.070\nthis is what we tend to talk\nabout in terms of risk.\n\n105\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.500\nThe likelihood,\nthe chance of something occurring\n\n106\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.770\nto where we're actually losing\nsomething to the organization.\n\n107\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.120\nNow, the opposite of that is of course,\n\n108\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.980\nopportunity, where it's a positive\nbenefit of something that can happen.\n\n109\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.990\nBut you got to realize that\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n110\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.230\nOrganizations tend to be in one\nof three particular postures\n\n111\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.830\nwhen it comes to risk, right.\n\n112\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.100\nRisk aggressive, let's face it head on.\n\n113\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.510\nYou know, if they attack that machine,\nif they bring it down no big deal.\n\n114\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.220\nWe'll deal with it at the time of the\nattack and you know, that's a possibility.\n\n115\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.660\nIt's probably not the best possibility,\nbut some people are just like that or\n\n116\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.350\nthey're saying, they'll never touch me.\n\n117\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.960\nYeah\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm willing to risk it.\n\n119\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.020\nYeah, they're not coming after me.\n\n120\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.510\nI don't run any business that's\nimportant to the government or anything.\n\n121\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.630\nDaniel is actually kind of\nour hacking expert here now.\n\n122\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.580\nDaniel, do hackers really care?\n\n123\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.670\n&gt;&gt; We care.\nWe care a lot.\n\n124\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.620\n&gt;&gt; We care that you\nthinking that very way.\n\n125\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.137\nThat you are untouchable and no one's\ngoing to I don't worry about updates and\n\n126\n00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:40.620\nall the good stuff.\n\n127\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.550\nThat's a fantastic mindset for\n\n128\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.680\npeople like me that are trying\nto break into your systems.\n\n129\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.790\nBecause you are just\nmaking it too easy for me.\n\n130\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.450\nI can compromise the system,\nhave that at my beck and\n\n131\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.585\ncall whenever I want, just because\nyou took a very low security posture.\n\n132\n00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:58.409\n&gt;&gt; And that's a harsh reality right, that\nsomebody thinks that, that arrogantly that\n\n133\n00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:02.140\nnobody's really after their systems when\nthey have it connected to the internet.\n\n134\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.640\nIt's gonna be a long day.\n&gt;&gt; Regis's long.\n\n135\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.502\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\ngonna be a long day.\n\n136\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.450\nThere's also of course risk adverse.\n\n137\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.201\nAnd this of course is the organization\nthat says, look, I don't really want any\n\n138\n00:07:13.201 --> 00:07:17.330\nrisk happening so I'll try and minimize\nthe amount of risk that we face every day.\n\n139\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.210\nAnd then there's also risk mutual.\n\n140\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.516\nWhen I try to just balance things out and\nso, we begin with that concept of risk.\n\n141\n00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:26.480\nUnderstanding that this is\nthe idea of the probability and\n\n142\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.500\nthe impact of something occurring\nto the point where we have a loss.\n\n143\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.720\nSecurity systems are designed to help us\nto minimize the risk that we tend to face.\n\n144\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.107\nBut, it is this idea,\n\n145\n00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:40.840\nthis is the most etherial of\nthe ones that we talk about here.\n\n146\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.380\nBut risk is something that every\norganization has to begin to deal with.\n\n147\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.810\nThey can't just think that because it's\nnever happened, it's not going to happen.\n\n148\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.781\nThey always have to think in the forefront\nthat the future is a possibility where\n\n149\n00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.510\nattackers can land on their door.\n\n150\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.804\nTwo years ago people would have said,\ncrypto?\n\n151\n00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:01.261\nCryptoware or whatever it's, ransomware-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n152\n00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:02.064\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember.\n\n153\n00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:02.827\nRansomware?\n\n154\n00:08:02.827 --> 00:08:06.545\n[SOUND] That doesn't happen to us and\nnow it's starting to happen.\n\n155\n00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:08.330\nIt starting to get all over to place.\n\n156\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.080\nAnd so we're starting seeing more and\n\n157\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.050\nmore whereas just a couple of years ago\nwould have not been as prevalent and\n\n158\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.710\nespecially not in the scope that\nwe're seeing in today's world.\n\n159\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n160\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie we have a couple of other\n\n161\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.210\nterms to go along with your little risk.\n\n162\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.120\nI know you got probably a little more\nyou want to say there but threats,\n\n163\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.270\nvulnerability, and\nthe other one was, exploits, right?\n\n164\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.400\nAll kind of interrelated, and\nthey kind of build on each other.\n\n165\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the key here is\nseparating them out, right?\n\n166\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's understanding\n\n167\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.350\nthe difference between them.\n\n168\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.472\nRisk for\nus is that possibility that chance.\n\n169\n00:08:37.472 --> 00:08:41.753\nSo it's the furthest removed from\nreality in theory, at least in my mind.\n\n170\n00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the furthest removed from reality\n\n171\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.120\nof a risk happening.\n\n172\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.520\nBut the idea of a threat is not\nactually a reality yet, but\n\n173\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.200\nit is a potential reality.\n\n174\n00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.680\nIt's not the idea of a chance of it but\n\n175\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.060\nit could be that somebody has\nnot actually taken advantage of.\n\n176\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.590\nThere is a vulnerability that maybe out\nthere but is not taken advantage of.\n\n177\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.780\nAnd if it's not taken advantage\nof it's just makes it a potential\n\n178\n00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.310\nvulnerability here.\n\n179\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.830\nSo that idea of a threat\ncould be that like yeah,\n\n180\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.130\nI'm just hoping that nobody notices\nthe back door that's there.\n\n181\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.880\nI'm hoping that nobody really\ntakes advantage of that.\n\n182\n00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.410\nWell, that set that unusual idea of hope.\n\n183\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.350\nBut it's an indication of some sort that\nwe have activity that we're seeing, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.400\nBut the very fact is it's not\nactually indicating any loss yet.\n\n185\n00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.890\nBut we're seeing signs that this could be\nvery easily taken advantage of if we don't\n\n186\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.930\ntake care of it.\n\n187\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.720\nBut we're willing to say, okay, I see that\nas a threat, but nobody's done it yet.\n\n188\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.410\nNobody's found it yet.\n\n189\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.680\nWhat are the chances somebody's\ngoing to find it in the future?\n\n190\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.300\nWell there's a million 14 year old kids\nout there that says I'm gonna find it.\n\n191\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.930\nI guarantee you they're out there in\nMalaysia somewhere on the Asian Pacific\n\n192\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.630\nrim, and\nthey are attacking systems like crazy.\n\n193\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.330\n&gt;&gt; Nothing better to do.\n\n194\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.280\n&gt;&gt; They really have nothing better to\ndo right now with what they're doing.\n\n195\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.730\nSo just realize that\nthat's the threat now,\n\n196\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.040\nanother possibility of\nthe threat Is the active threat.\n\n197\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.840\nSo for example, and not that I\nwould ever do anything this stupid.\n\n198\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.435\nBut I say that, but it might happen.\n\n199\n00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:11.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the other side is\n\n200\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.570\nif I were to just look over at Daniel and\nsay, Daniel,\n\n201\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.860\nI'm gonna punch you right in the face,\nwell, that's a threat, too, right?\n\n202\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.460\n&gt;&gt; That's a threat.\n\n203\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.530\n&gt;&gt; That is an active threat.\n\n204\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.940\nIt is someone that indicates that hey,\na punch is coming.\n\n205\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.153\nThat would be stupid of\nme to indicate that.\n\n206\n00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:28.380\nMy best bet is just to sucker punch him.\n\n207\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.340\nThat's my best bet.\n\n208\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.291\n&gt;&gt; Better make it a good one Rodney,\nthat's what I'm saying.\n\n209\n00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:35.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's two possibilities here\n\n210\n00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:39.069\nwhen we start talking about this\nrealm of security concepts.\n\n211\n00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:43.330\nOne is somebody who's indicating\nI'm knocking at your door.\n\n212\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.382\nI'm knocking at your door, and\nyou're supposed to notice that.\n\n213\n00:10:47.382 --> 00:10:49.760\nAnd you're supposed to say I\nneed to do something about that.\n\n214\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.380\nOr, they're knocking on your door,\nand you go, I'm just gonna be quiet.\n\n215\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.540\nI'm hoping that they're not gonna hear me.\n\n216\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.870\nAnd then they jiggle the handle and\nit's open.\n\n217\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.060\nAnd that's the problem, right?\n\n218\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.460\nIs that you have to have to\nworry about those things.\n\n219\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.360\nSo this is a potential idea of\na vulnerability, it's there, but\n\n220\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.750\nnobody's taking advantage of it.\n\n221\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.640\nAnd that's normally the way\nthat we think about it.\n\n222\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.310\nIn terms of what Daniel was also saying,\nthe idea of vulnerability.\n\n223\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.590\nVulnerability is an existing weakness,\nthat's pretty much what it is.\n\n224\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.710\nIt's a weakness that exists,\nit can be taken advantage of at any time.\n\n225\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.472\nMost people tend to know about them.\n\n226\n00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.224\nNow as particular system has\nthis vulnerability in it and\n\n227\n00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:26.070\nthis is how they take advantage of it.\n\n228\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.780\nSo you think about all the software\nthat's written down there.\n\n229\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.220\nYou think about all\nthe systems that are out there.\n\n230\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.550\nHackers are learning how to\nattack these things every day.\n\n231\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.440\nThey take what they know that already\nhas an existing vulnerability,\n\n232\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.050\nthey figure out how to make\ntheir way inside of that system.\n\n233\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.050\nAnd that's the way they kinda get their\nbones in terms of figuring out how to get\n\n234\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.410\naccess to these systems.\n\n235\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.776\nThey start off with the ones\nthat are vulnerable and\n\n236\n00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.982\nthen they start trying to discover\nwhat weaknesses exist out there.\n\n237\n00:11:52.982 --> 00:11:56.040\nAnd then they can take advantage\nof that as well, okay and\n\n238\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.910\nof course there is the exploit.\n\n239\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.370\nThe exploit is actively of course\n\n240\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.610\ntaking advantage of that\nvulnerability that exists.\n\n241\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:09.830\nWhen you actually exploit the system,\nit has been compromised already.\n\n242\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.320\nAnd this is where it actually\nbecomes a little bit harsher.\n\n243\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.910\nBecause when you start comparing this,\nright, you have to keep in mind\n\n244\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.890\nthat the exploited self, includes the idea\nof the weakness that is actually there, or\n\n245\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.310\nthe potential weakness that we can have.\n\n246\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.950\nWhat's the exposure of that weakness?\n\n247\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.260\nIs it something big, is it something\ngigantic, is it something small?\n\n248\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.230\nSo you hear about the term, like the soft\nunderbelly of your organization.\n\n249\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.500\nOr the idea of somebody having a weak\nchin, right, in the boxing match.\n\n250\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.240\nThey're great on the ground, in the MMA.\n\n251\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.210\nThey can grapple all day long.\n\n252\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.850\nBut you stand them up,\ngo toe to toe with them.\n\n253\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.410\nThey drop once you hit them on the chin\nbecause it's just the way it is and\n\n254\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.290\nthey have a weak chin.\n\n255\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.820\nYou have something like that too.\n\n256\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.600\nAnd of course the overall\ncapabilities of who is attacking you.\n\n257\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.490\nI never say prepare for\nthe weakest attacker you can.\n\n258\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.050\nThat's kind of silly in today's\nworld of cyber security,\n\n259\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.160\nyou got to prepare for the fact that\nthat guy is gonna get into your system.\n\n260\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.790\nIf you go, they can get in but they can't\nget anywhere else, I think you're kind of\n\n261\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.720\nteasing yourself more than anything\nelse when you start dealing with this.\n\n262\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.720\nSo being able to separate out the idea of\nrisk verses of course, the threat, and\n\n263\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.810\nthe vulnerability,\nas well as the exploits.\n\n264\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.720\nUnderstanding that all those are king\nof very related concepts but\n\n265\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.780\nwe do need to differentiate\nthem because people make\n\n266\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.530\npeople make business decisions\nbase of a risk okay?\n\n267\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.460\nWe make technical decision\nbase of a vulnerabilities and\n\n268\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.580\nexploits another security\ncontrol that we implement.\n\n269\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.830\nBut then on the idea of the,\nin between which is that thread.\n\n270\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.880\nWell, you have to make a business\nchoice like is it worth it for?\n\n271\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.020\nBecause no one is taking\nadvantage of it or if it is, now I\n\n272\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.150\nneed to go to a technical side somebody\nis going to implement that though.\n\n273\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.400\nHow do I fix this?\n\n274\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.190\nAnd so\nis kind of in the middle in terms of that\n\n275\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.690\ncontinuum of security that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n276\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.580\nSo in those concepts, you have to be\nable to differentiate to understand what\n\n277\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.420\ndecisions are gonna be made.\n\n278\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.470\nWhether it's control\nthat needs to be made, or\n\n279\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.900\nsome type of administrative decision.\n\n280\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.690\nThese are the concepts that we really\nhave to make sure that we understand.\n\n281\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.603\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAnd if you're wondering whether or\n\n282\n00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:15.682\nnot your software is vulnerable to\nan exploitation, or an exploit,\n\n283\n00:14:15.682 --> 00:14:19.575\nas they call them, there are databases out\nthere that just say here's your software.\n\n284\n00:14:19.575 --> 00:14:24.119\nHere are the known vulnerabilities to this\nsince you can't take that proactive step\n\n285\n00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:26.295\ninto checking your own situation out and\n\n286\n00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:29.400\nseeing if you're vulnerable\nto an exploit or not.\n\n287\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.280\nThat being said now we gotta\ntalk about the people,\n\n288\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.640\nright, those that are out\nthere looking to do us harm.\n\n289\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.260\nAnd in this realm we\ncall them threat actors.\n\n290\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.070\nSometimes you hear it\ncalled bad actors but\n\n291\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.770\ninside of Cisco they're calling\nit threat actor, right?\n\n292\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n293\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.810\nSo if you're used to the term bad actor,\nin Cisco realm, especially for\n\n294\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.510\nthe exam, make sure you equate that to\nthreat actor is what you want to do.\n\n295\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.690\nNow the threat actor,\nwhat is this really about?\n\n296\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.460\nIt is about the person or entity in other\nwords, remember that the idea here is that\n\n297\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.250\nit's not usually just a single\nindividual in today's concept and world.\n\n298\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.940\nEven though it still can be.\n\n299\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.070\nBut we have bad threat actors\nthat are nation states,\n\n300\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:11.250\nthat are terrorist organizations, that are\nsocially or politically motivated groups\n\n301\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.260\nthat are out there that are deciding that\nthey are gonna cause your system harm.\n\n302\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.120\nThey are normally the ones that we can\nassign responsibility for, to actually for\n\n303\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.600\nwhatever malicious act or\n\n304\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.860\nincident that happens to the systems\nthat you are trying to protect.\n\n305\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.100\nBut threat actors can be categorized\nin multiple categories as well.\n\n306\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.030\nYou might have the idea of\nthe unintentional threat actor, okay.\n\n307\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.940\nNow, the unintentional threat factor,\nwe can take a look at this is any realm\n\n308\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:42.660\nof security that want to, but it's the guy\nthat is too nice at the security door.\n\n309\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.570\nHe slides his security door,\nhis card, his identity card,\n\n310\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.990\nunlock the door because the young lady\nis coming with a box full of books.\n\n311\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.882\nAnd now, she's got past the first security\nclearance gate because there it is.\n\n312\n00:15:54.882 --> 00:15:58.839\nInstead of that she's walking by the sign\nthat says \"all visitors must report to\n\n313\n00:15:58.839 --> 00:15:59.778\nthe front desk\".\n\n314\n00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:03.687\nShe walks right in exactly where she's\nnot supposed to be when she gets into\n\n315\n00:16:03.687 --> 00:16:04.504\nthe building.\n\n316\n00:16:04.504 --> 00:16:06.194\nAnd she's already inside.\n\n317\n00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Only as strong as your weakest link,\nright Ronnie?\n\n318\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.333\n&gt;&gt; That is.\n\n319\n00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.150\nAnd that's the key, right?\n\n320\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.520\nThe unintentional one is\nkind of our weakest link.\n\n321\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.010\nBecause all of us do not ever think\nthat we're doing something bad.\n\n322\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.970\nWe think that we're being helpful.\n\n323\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.210\n&gt;&gt; From a bad actor or\n\n324\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.010\nthreat actor standpoint\n&gt;&gt; That's really why a lot of\n\n325\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.230\ncompanies get compromised through\nthat very means, through the people.\n\n326\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.370\nBecause I can more easily manipulate a\nhuman than I can a computer system, right?\n\n327\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.020\nThat's a whole lot more difficult.\n\n328\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.270\nSo if I can just go\nthrough the easier system.\n\n329\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.320\nWhich is, hey, click this link.\n\n330\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.400\nAnd they download malware which\ngives me access to the system\n\n331\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.370\nThen that's the way I'm gonna go.\n\n332\n00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.810\nCuz it's just a whole lot easier.\n\n333\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and also remember, once you\nactually already are in there, right?\n\n334\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.970\nThe unintentional one also is\nnormally an internal one as well.\n\n335\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.970\nEven though that's a separate category.\n\n336\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.500\nBut usually,\nit comes down that way, right?\n\n337\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.110\nThey've already got access to the system.\n\n338\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.910\nThe person know how to socially engineer\nthat person to give them access inside.\n\n339\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.800\nSo they normally go hand in hand,\nthat unintentional.\n\n340\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.300\nBut it can be an intentional one, too.\n\n341\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.450\n&gt;&gt; It could.\nIt could be the the guy out there running\n\n342\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.705\na backhoe that digs\nthrough your fiber cable.\n\n343\n00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:08.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n344\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.520\nnow you've been effectively DDOS or DOS.\n\n345\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.380\nWhatever you want to call it.\n\n346\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.040\nCuz you have no access to your system.\n\n347\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.110\nPeople are cut off.\n\n348\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.310\nSo that would be under unintentional.\n\n349\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.238\n&gt;&gt; It would be unintentional, hopefully.\n\n350\n00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Dig this!\n\n351\n00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Not all of us have enough friends\nto do that Ocean's Thirteen attack.\n\n352\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.470\nWe can rent the entire\ntunnel chunnel machine.\n\n353\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.740\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n354\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.250\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n355\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.040\n[LAUGH] Didn't seem to happen enough.\n\n356\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:33.750\nBut yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.930\nThose are the things that you do see.\n\n358\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.090\nOf course,\nexternal ones are from the outside.\n\n359\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.360\nAnd then internal ones, of course, inside.\n\n360\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.270\nBut then the intentional is the key,\nright?\n\n361\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.070\nThey can be intentional and insiders.\n\n362\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.710\nOkay?\nA guy doesn't like\n\n363\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.790\nthe fact that he has to sit\nnext to Daniel every, wait.\n\n364\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.290\nThat's me.\n[LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:50.950\n&gt;&gt; So that's where\n\n366\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:51.970\nthat's been coming from.\n\n367\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.750\n&gt;&gt; And\nhe decided he was gonna compromise, yeah.\n\n368\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.910\nHe can compromise the system that way.\n\n369\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.050\nOr it can again be from the outside.\n\n370\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.028\nSo all these are kinda the key.\n\n371\n00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:06.060\nBut bad actors essentially cover the\nentire gamut of what we have to watch for.\n\n372\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.370\nWe can not just assume.\n\n373\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.460\nAnd I hate to say this.\n\n374\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.580\nWe can't assume everybody on a network\nhas the same ethics that you might have.\n\n375\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.030\nYou might actually find out\nthat most of them don't.\n\n376\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.600\nAfter you actually go and\nstart searching logs.\n\n377\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.210\nAnd then you start realizing it.\n\n378\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.600\nBut, at the same time.\n\n379\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.840\nYou have to always put your security\nmeasures in place that you need to.\n\n380\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.810\nDo not consider the idea of that person\nbeing a good person to be the key.\n\n381\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.200\nPut the security in place.\n\n382\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.550\nAnd then worry about the goodness\nof the person after that.\n\n383\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.700\nAnd you don't have to worry about it.\n\n384\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.130\n&gt;&gt; What did we used to say?\n\n385\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.190\nOr Ronnie Reagan, right?\n\n386\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.080\nTrust, but verify.\n\n387\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which was a Russian proverb back\n\n388\n00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.525\nthen\n&gt;&gt; Was it?\n\n389\n00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:44.203\nThere you go.\n\n390\n00:18:44.203 --> 00:18:47.164\nI like Teddy Roosevelt's speak softly but\ncarry a big stick.\n\n391\n00:18:47.164 --> 00:18:48.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n392\n00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:52.590\nthe other one that we also have here\nis what we call run book automation.\n\n393\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.070\nThat's also a great term.\n\n394\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.030\nYou're starting to see more and\nmore of this.\n\n395\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.520\nAnd that is because the complexity of\ntrying to keep track of everything.\n\n396\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.310\nSo right here when we do our shows.\n\n397\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.610\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat has to be done.\n\n398\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.460\nJust for this show,\nI mean just to begin this show.\n\n399\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.340\nOur producing team is just awesome.\n\n400\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.902\nBecause they get all of that stuff done,\nand there it is.\n\n401\n00:19:11.902 --> 00:19:14.130\nAnd I don't have to do any of this\nthat you're actually watching and\n\n402\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.530\nyou switch to cameras.\n\n403\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.390\nLower thirds are happening.\n\n404\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.310\nAudio is happening.\n\n405\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.520\nEverything is showing,\nmy diagrams are showing up.\n\n406\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.770\nAll that stuff that goes on, and\nyou have to keep track of all that stuff.\n\n407\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.340\nWell, security systems as complex as\nthat is, depending on your organization,\n\n408\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.900\nthe size,\nthe scope in what you have to do.\n\n409\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.219\nRemembering everything that has\nto be done on a daily basis.\n\n410\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.330\nIt becomes kind of overwhelming,\nat least for one person.\n\n411\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.600\n&gt;&gt; And the more complex it gets.\n\n412\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.800\nThe even more difficult it is\nto remember all those steps.\n\n413\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.700\n&gt;&gt; And\nonce those steps don't get remembered.\n\n414\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.450\nThat's the time that you go, crud!\n\n415\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.580\nI should have remembered that.\n\n416\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.100\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n417\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.790\nRun book automation is about implementing\na system, a software a lot of times.\n\n418\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.670\nThat says,\nhere is the checks that needed to be done.\n\n419\n00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.390\nHere is how we can actually\nmake sure that it gets done.\n\n420\n00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.630\nIt might be where they actually\nrun scripts on their own.\n\n421\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.540\nIt might be where they\nactually produce a workflow.\n\n422\n00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.940\nSo that it says, have you done this yet?\n\n423\n00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.210\nIf you haven't, go ahead and do this.\n\n424\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.385\n&gt;&gt; And basically a checklist as it were.\n\n425\n00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:14.540\nThat okay, step one has been completed.\n\n426\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.500\nI can check that off Now I'm\nrunning the step two until.\n\n427\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.610\nAnd that way, someone has a log.\n\n428\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.030\nYou can go back and see.\n\n429\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.800\nOn the 3rd of February on 1999.\n\n430\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.070\nYou performed this activity.\n\n431\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.920\nAnd there's the checklist right there.\n\n432\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you have everything\nunder automation that you want.\n\n433\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.340\nIt would be kind of neat to have\nall these systems tied together by\n\n434\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.990\na single run point automation or\nrun book automation system.\n\n435\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.290\nSo for example inside of our\nportion of this gigantic building.\n\n436\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.840\nI think Tim told me there's like 88 or\n89 light switches, okay?\n\n437\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So at the end of the day we\n\n438\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.550\nall leave right?\n\n439\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.760\nIn theory, in theory right?\n\n440\n00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.420\n88 or 89 light switches should\nbe turned off everyday.\n\n441\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.635\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of switch flipping.\n\n442\n00:20:56.635 --> 00:20:58.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of switch flipping.\n\n443\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.810\nAnd at the same time, I know something.\n\n444\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.130\nBecause usually I'm one of first\ntwo people who's here in the day.\n\n445\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.920\nNot all of them always get turned off.\n\n446\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.480\nSo as good of intentions as we have.\n\n447\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.560\nBut we could put on something\nlike this on our system.\n\n448\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.225\nIf everything was controlled that way.\n\n449\n00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:14.948\nWhere we could say, all right we can\nhave this on our run book automation.\n\n450\n00:21:14.948 --> 00:21:17.390\nWhere at 5:30 it says go through,\n\n451\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.530\nstart systematically turning\noff lights in our building.\n\n452\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.990\nAnd that way, we can do that.\n\n453\n00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.180\nWe can also start it up where\nat the beginning of the day.\n\n454\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.960\nWhere something like that happens.\n\n455\n00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.480\nBut in terms of security,\nit's the same thing.\n\n456\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.770\nYou go through and you make sure\nthat every system has the logs read.\n\n457\n00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.390\nYou make sure that it gets emailed out.\n\n458\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.530\nContacted to whoever it needs to be.\n\n459\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.110\nYou make sure, of course,\nthat they go through.\n\n460\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.480\nAnd that all the system checks are up and\non.\n\n461\n00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.870\nBut if you have it all automated.\n\n462\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.530\nIt means that it can be done consistently,\nevery single day, repetitively.\n\n463\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.900\nSo in the realm of doing\nsomething like this.\n\n464\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.380\nIf you've only been\nworking with applications.\n\n465\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.850\nIt'd be the same as what we call macros.\n\n466\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.470\nEssentially is what it is, right.\n\n467\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.650\nIt gives us the ability to\ndo those repetitious things.\n\n468\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.060\nIn the exact same manner.\n\n469\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.320\nSo we know there's consistency involved.\n\n470\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.570\nThere's the ability to log it.\n\n471\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.060\nWe can actually say,\nwhen things are out of order.\n\n472\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.840\nWe can spot very easily when\nsystems didn't get turned on when\n\n473\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.300\nthey should have been turned on.\n\n474\n00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.700\nWhen they are turned on,\nwhen they shouldn't be turned on.\n\n475\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.140\nSo, this is really a helpful\npart of implementing security.\n\n476\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.930\nAnd making sure it's\nrunning the right way too.\n\n477\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n478\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.620\nWell the next term we need to go through\nis a little thing we like to call chain of\n\n479\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.440\ncustody.\n\n480\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.140\nAnd I enjoy chain of custody as\nfar as like thinking about it.\n\n481\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.910\nHow it works and\nwhat you're supposed to do.\n\n482\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.797\nBecause it's basically\na checkpoint system.\n\n483\n00:22:33.797 --> 00:22:37.650\nTo make sure that everybody has done\nthe right thing at the right time.\n\n484\n00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.950\nRonnie, can you please\nexpand on chain of custody.\n\n485\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.620\nWell especially the way that\nCisco describes it, right?\n\n486\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.400\nThey say chain of custody.\n\n487\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.260\nAnd then parenthesis on\nthe exam objectives they say,\n\n488\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.950\nevidentiary chain of custody.\n\n489\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.810\nI don't know if that really makes\nan insane amount of difference\n\n490\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.030\nfrom what we have.\n\n491\n00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.240\nBut when it comes down to it.\n\n492\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.140\nIt allows us to be able to keep\nthe chronology of things happening.\n\n493\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.550\nAnd be able to put them in\nthe order that they need to.\n\n494\n00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.820\nAnd show who's actually\nresponsible at every point.\n\n495\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.956\nWhen some type of,\nespecially on digital forensics, right?\n\n496\n00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:13.990\nWhen some type of computer\ncrime has happened.\n\n497\n00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.880\nIt really helps us to establish\nan unbroken chronology.\n\n498\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.520\nOr timeline of the evidence.\n\n499\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.710\nFrom the very time that\nit's actually collected.\n\n500\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.910\nAll the way to the time\nit's presented in court.\n\n501\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.330\nSo that there's no unbroken\ntime that we can't account for\n\n502\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.340\nits whereabouts or custody, right?\n\n503\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.550\nWho's actually responsible for\nthat information.\n\n504\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.570\nAnd this is key, right?\n\n505\n00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.060\nAt any point, what they want to\nshow is that no one has tampered\n\n506\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.490\nwith what we see from that point.\n\n507\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.780\nAnd the tampering of evidence is something\nthat can really get a case thrown out.\n\n508\n00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.860\nEspecially in the digital forensics world.\n\n509\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.191\nIf they can prove that somebody has\nbeen messing around with the machine, or\n\n510\n00:23:58.191 --> 00:23:59.188\nwhatever it might be.\n\n511\n00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:00.171\nThat they have that.\n\n512\n00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:02.769\nSo what they wanna be able to\nis somewhere along the line.\n\n513\n00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:04.913\nIf we have already got it gathered,\n\n514\n00:24:04.913 --> 00:24:08.558\nWe need to know where we can go\nback into the documentation and\n\n515\n00:24:08.558 --> 00:24:13.080\nsay here it was on this date and\nsomebody can testify to that point.\n\n516\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.540\nAnd it is very important\nbecause all of this stuff,\n\n517\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.580\nespecially dealing within the realm of\ncyber security, is also to help us to\n\n518\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.670\nbecome better understanding that\nit's not enough just to stop them.\n\n519\n00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.310\nWe have to be able to take\nthe bad actors if we can and\n\n520\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.318\nalso begin a prosecution of\nthem in court if we need to.\n\n521\n00:24:32.318 --> 00:24:35.787\nAnd normally we do because if not\nthe criminal offense goes on and\n\n522\n00:24:35.787 --> 00:24:37.391\nthere's no penalty to it, so\n\n523\n00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:41.631\nhere is making sure that we follow all the\nrules that we can to make ensure that we\n\n524\n00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:46.060\nhave everything in place that we've done\nthings right is pretty much the key.\n\n525\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.328\n&gt;&gt; You would hate to get\ninto that court case and\n\n526\n00:24:48.328 --> 00:24:52.576\nhave all a mountain of evidence against\nsomeone who has actually done something.\n\n527\n00:24:52.576 --> 00:24:57.199\nThe proof is right there and because of\nimproper handling, bad chain of custody,\n\n528\n00:24:57.199 --> 00:25:00.750\nyou have to throw all that evidence\nout and it's unusable, and\n\n529\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.940\nthat person walks away scott free,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Doing exactly what it is they do with\n\n531\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.480\na big smile on their face because we\ndidn't follow proper procedure so,\n\n532\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.450\nvery important thing to understand.\n\n533\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.480\nThe next we need to understand is that\nlittle thing we like to call reverse\n\n534\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.410\nengineering.\n\n535\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.560\nThis is a fun one because, the hacker in\nme just loves this kind of thing, right?\n\n536\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.890\nBecause we're taking something\nthat's supposed to be hidden and\n\n537\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.610\nbehind the scenes and\nfiguring out what that is, right?\n\n538\n00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of weird, right?\n\n539\n00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.770\nIt's like going to the scene\nof an accident and\n\n540\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.770\nlooking at the results of it and\nthen, trying to do what?\n\n541\n00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.930\nFigure out what actually\noccurred that made that result,\n\n542\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.650\nis what we're taking a look.\n\n543\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:42.020\nAnd today, if you really want to get\ninto the realm of insane job security in\n\n544\n00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.400\nthe security world,\nlearn how to reverse engineer malware.\n\n545\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.450\nI guarantee you reverse engineer malware\nor reverse engineering malware engineer or\n\n546\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.860\nsomething like that, or developer\nwhatever they call it, I can't remember.\n\n547\n00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.360\nYou look that up,\nthere's a ton of companies doing it.\n\n548\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Name your price on that one?\n\n549\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.430\n&gt;&gt; You can pretty much name\nyour price on that one and\n\n550\n00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.540\nif you're really good at it,\nthat's what's gonna end up happening here.\n\n551\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.445\nBut that's the key,\nright, today most people,\n\n552\n00:26:08.445 --> 00:26:13.070\nthey're not only looking at the very\nfact that, hey, I can stop an attack but\n\n553\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.230\nthey want to actually figure out what\nthey can do to prevent the next attack.\n\n554\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.840\nSo, they take whatever malware that\nthey end up in their system and\n\n555\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.670\nthey go, here is the damage and\nthe result of it.\n\n556\n00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.330\nHere is the coding of it.\n\n557\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.290\nTake a look and tell me how this thing\ngot onto my network, maybe even find out,\n\n558\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.120\nlike, what actually led to\nthis beginning and everything.\n\n559\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.790\nUnderstanding the individual components\n\n560\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.940\nthat brought it all together to\ngive the effect that we have.\n\n561\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.150\nAnd this is probably where you're actually\ngonna see this in the cybersecurity room\n\n562\n00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.080\nmore often.\n\n563\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.170\nThis is a fairly highly technical\naspect of cybersecurity but\n\n564\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.760\nit is one that will lead you down\na rabbit, if you love coding,\n\n565\n00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.510\nif you love stuff like this,\nthis is the realm for you.\n\n566\n00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.820\nIt's actually a great little field that is\nstarting to expand out and out and out.\n\n567\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.620\nSo, as far as another job market inside\nof cybersecurity, this one right\n\n568\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.770\nhere is probably the one that's fairly\nlimited right now, which is why your\n\n569\n00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.300\nparticular talent if you're really good\nat is gonna bring you the big bucks.\n\n570\n00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can speak a little to reverse\nengineering because I can do some buffer\n\n571\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.710\noverflow stuff where you take a program\nand you run it through a decompiler,\n\n572\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.530\nsee the actual base code that\nis running through there,\n\n573\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.930\nthe CPU and registers and all the memory,\nand all that other good stuff.\n\n574\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.430\nThis is a very complex and\ndetailed thing, it's not easy at all.\n\n575\n00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.050\nSo, like Ronnie said, if you have skills\nand acumen for this, definitely a good\n\n576\n00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.220\narea of security to get into because they\nneed skilled people for that very thing.\n\n577\n00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.967\nNow Ronnie,\nI'm looking at our list of terms here.\n\n578\n00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:44.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n579\n00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:46.847\n&gt;&gt; We've got like a bunch more.\n\n580\n00:27:46.847 --> 00:27:51.700\nMore than like two or three and\nour clock is very, very short on time.\n\n581\n00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.920\nI think it's probably a good spot for\nus to take a pause and\n\n582\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.080\nwe'll come back with a part two and\nfinish out these definitions.\n\n583\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.580\nBut, thank you so much for explaining each\ndefinition as Cisco wants us to know them\n\n584\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.600\nso that we can take that cybersecurity\nexam and pass it with flying colors.\n\n585\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.446\nThat being said, it looks like it's\ntime for us to sign off, for ITProTV.\n\n586\n00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:12.759\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n587\n00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:13.873\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n588\n00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:15.394\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:28:15.394 --> 00:28:22.302\n[MUSIC]\n\n590\n00:28:22.302 --> 00:28:27.099\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:13.784\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n8\n00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:15.703\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.827\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:23.105\nwe are continuing on with our\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamental series.\n\n11\n00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.140\nComing back with a part two\non kind of some vocabulary,\n\n12\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.940\nterminology, things that you\nneed to know just so that\n\n13\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.390\nwe can all be speaking the same language\nas we progress through the series.\n\n14\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.720\nAnd of course joining us back in\nthe studio for that very endeavor,\n\n15\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.260\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n16\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.190\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n17\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.760\n&gt;&gt; It is going great today as we continue\non to take a look at this part two\n\n18\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.260\nwhere we're really finishing up\nsome of the different terms.\n\n19\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.410\nMost of the terms that we have been\ntalking about in a previous episode\n\n20\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.180\nwere really foundational terms that\nwe all are fairly familiar with.\n\n21\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.540\nBut as we go further into\nour list of different terms,\n\n22\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.560\nwe start running into the ones\nthat may be a little bit more\n\n23\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.590\non the side that's beyond just\ngoing I know those security terms.\n\n24\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.097\nAnd now we're actually getting into\nsome of the security management, and\n\n25\n00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:07.425\nwe'll actually see a lot more of that.\n\n26\n00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:10.708\nBut really, having to have a fundamental\nunderstanding of just a few more terms\n\n27\n00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:12.129\nthat you may not have heard about,\n\n28\n00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:14.239\nespecially in this episode\nthat we're gonna see.\n\n29\n00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nspeaking of terms I've never heard of,\n\n30\n00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:21.230\nthe first one is sliding\nwindow anomaly detection.\n\n31\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.180\nYeah, I had to cheat on\nthat one because I've\n\n32\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.891\nliterally never heard\nthis term whatsoever.\n\n33\n00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.686\nI've been in security for a while,\nRonnie, I can't wait to be filled in.\n\n34\n00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:30.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is this?\n\n35\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.220\n&gt;&gt; This is not as bad as it seems but\nit is Cisco terminology,\n\n36\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.820\nand that's what it really comes down to,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.940\nWhen you're getting ready for this\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals exam you,\n\n38\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.070\nof course, have to use their terminology.\n\n39\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.675\nBut the great thing is if you've ever had\nexperience in the industry you're gonna\n\n40\n00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:47.970\nsay, that's what they mean by this.\n\n41\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.890\nAnd you just have to do what?\n\n42\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.770\nMake that connection happen,\nsometimes it's difficult because we're so\n\n43\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.350\ningrained at calling things our way and\nwe're used to doing what we want and\n\n44\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.750\neverybody actually learns\nit some way different.\n\n45\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.685\nBut here, when we start to talk about\nthis idea of the sliding window anomaly\n\n46\n00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:09.004\ndetection, I wanna get all of that entire\nphrase in there, cuz most of us go?\n\n47\n00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.082\nThat's pretty much what it comes down to.\n\n48\n00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:17.070\nBut Daniel, have you ever heard\nof a security baseline before?\n\n49\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n50\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.420\nEverybody that's ever even looked at\nsecurity, that's one of the first things\n\n51\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.030\nyou learn about staking a baseline,\nwhere do you stand?\n\n52\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when it comes down to it,\nthe idea of that security window\n\n53\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.660\nanomaly detection, it begins with\nwhat we call a baseline here.\n\n54\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.490\nNow when we start talking about\nthis idea of the baseline,\n\n55\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.530\na lot of times when we start\nlooking in terms of security,\n\n56\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.080\nreally kind of gives us a sense\nof where we are in our security.\n\n57\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.290\nBut it doesn't do it over a span of time.\n\n58\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.070\nWe normally think about\nit as a snapshot in time.\n\n59\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.700\nThe sliding window aspect of this\nis that they're saying, look,\n\n60\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.450\nlet's let your security and your network\nrun for a particular periodic time period.\n\n61\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.890\nWhether it's a week, or a day, or an hour,\nor 30 minutes, or whatever it is.\n\n62\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.360\nAnd you essentially take\na baseline of that time period,\n\n63\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.710\nwhat you believe is normal traffic.\n\n64\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.906\nNow this is the key, right?\n\n65\n00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:14.433\nIf I take a baseline when\nI get in here at work,\n\n66\n00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:17.450\nthere's like two people\nhere on the network.\n\n67\n00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.484\nSo if there's an intrusion or\nif there's some type of malicious,\n\n68\n00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:21.741\nmore than likely it's me.\n\n69\n00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:22.287\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n70\n00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, but that's not good, but\n\n71\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.130\nwe need to do it during what?\n\n72\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.810\nDuring a regular time of our business\nwhen everything is functioning as normal.\n\n73\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.573\nIn other words, when we expect that hey,\nhere may be the time,\n\n74\n00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:36.699\nwhich is an average day,\nan average load of people,\n\n75\n00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.843\nthis is when we're gonna\nbe affected by it the most.\n\n76\n00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:45.330\nSo we might take that for the whole day or\nactually, over five days or\n\n77\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.670\nwhatever it might be and we now have\na normal picture of our network.\n\n78\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.070\nThe goal behind this, of course, is as\nyou're monitoring that, especially for\n\n79\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.620\nthe security aspect of it.\n\n80\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.090\nNow, what you can do later on,\n\n81\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.655\nespecially if some type of security event,\nI was about to say evidence.\n\n82\n00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:06.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Security event or instant happens,\n\n83\n00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:09.841\nwell, how do you know that\nit's actually occurred?\n\n84\n00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:13.233\nOne of those primary things of course,\nis somebody says hey,\n\n85\n00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:17.370\nsomething is wrong with my machine,\nbut that could just be their machine.\n\n86\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.640\nHow do you know it's actually\na security event or security instance?\n\n87\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.190\nWell, you now have what,\na baseline to compare it to.\n\n88\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.000\nWell, this idea of the sliding window\nanomaly detection is really saying,\n\n89\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.860\nhere is how your network\nis functioning perfectly\n\n90\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.620\nwith everything that's normally going\non during this particular time period.\n\n91\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.110\nAnd now you compare to what\nyou actually know later on.\n\n92\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.070\nAnd now you have that comparison.\n\n93\n00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.878\nThis sliding window part is it depends\non how much you're needing to measure.\n\n94\n00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:48.242\nYou can do a day an hour or\n\n95\n00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:52.500\na minute if you want to,\nwhatever it might be, 30 minutes.\n\n96\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.830\nBut that's the sliding window part.\n\n97\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.440\nNow that you have that, then you\ncan actually say hey, when I go and\n\n98\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.970\ndo the same measurements again later on,\nI can compare it against that\n\n99\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.270\nsame time period, same amount of time and\nmake sure that all the security functions.\n\n100\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.266\nAnd now I see that I've now got\nsomething else that's popping up\n\n101\n00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:15.076\non the intrusion prevention system,\nor intrusion detection is going nuts,\n\n102\n00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:19.411\nor some other type of security system\nis now sending logs like crazy.\n\n103\n00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.730\nThen I can actually say hey,\ncompared to what we know is normal,\n\n104\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.630\ngood operating, we are experiencing\nsome difficulties over here.\n\n105\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.822\nSo that's what it begins as.\n\n106\n00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:31.377\nWhen it comes down to it, you and I would\nthink about this idea of this sliding\n\n107\n00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:35.710\nwindow anomaly detection as being, we're\ngonna compare it against the baseline.\n\n108\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.076\nSo go figure who would guess that\nterminology would cause us so much-\n\n109\n00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:40.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Consternation?\n\n110\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, angst.\n\n111\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.510\nAs you're going,\nhere's these four different terms, right,\n\n112\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.980\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n113\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.840\nAnd here's what they're not talking\nabout and they have to use them.\n\n114\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.490\nBut that's the exam, that's something\nthat we've got to get used to.\n\n115\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.661\n&gt;&gt; It's just one of those things, right?\nYou're gonna learn a language,\n\n116\n00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.150\nyou gotta pick up the lingo.\n\n117\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.300\nThat's how it works.\n\n118\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.770\nSpeaking of lingo,\nwe're going on to our next topic here,\n\n119\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.570\nwhich is PII,\nPersonally Identifiable Information.\n\n120\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.480\nThis is something we all know and love.\n\n121\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.612\nWell, you might not have known it as PII,\nbut\n\n122\n00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:10.100\nthis is basically you out\nthere on the Internet, right?\n\n123\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you think about it.\n\n124\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.768\nIt's kind of weird all of us have\na regular fingerprint, or at least most of\n\n125\n00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:17.998\nus should have, if we have not been\ngenetically grown on an X-Files,\n\n126\n00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:20.986\nwe'll probably have our own\nunique fingerprint at some point.\n\n127\n00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:26.515\nBut overall though, how do we have that\nwhen we're connected in this realm\n\n128\n00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:32.333\nof the cyber networks that are out there\nand the networking that's out there?\n\n129\n00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.777\nAnd even in our own networks,\nthe way that we are and\n\n130\n00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:39.235\nthe information that we\nhave attached to us is key.\n\n131\n00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:43.805\nThe idea of PII or Personally Identifiable\nInformation is that data that is\n\n132\n00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:48.245\nconnecting you is, you can hear the fancy\nterm and I love the fancy term.\n\n133\n00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:51.900\nIt's metadata that's all attached to you.\n\n134\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.350\nBut all that metadata essentially makes\nup your fingerprint that you are.\n\n135\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.046\nAnd the problem with that is that\nthe more interaction that you have\n\n136\n00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:03.478\nbetween networks,\nacross the Internet doing e-commerce,\n\n137\n00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:07.048\nthe more that you leave a trace\nof that fingerprint everywhere.\n\n138\n00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:09.940\nIt's just like every room that you\nwalk into, you touch something.\n\n139\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.371\nYou don't think that you're actually\nleaving marks that you're behind, but\n\n140\n00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.767\nevery time you go and fill out something\nthat you go and buy on a retail website.\n\n141\n00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:20.051\nThen you go to a little book seller\nover here on some it's like,\n\n142\n00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.690\nthat's a better deal, you go and do that.\n\n143\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.880\nYou leave pieces of your identity and\nthe problem is fairly simple,\n\n144\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.960\nis if any one of those gets\nout there in the public,\n\n145\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.570\nright, it could be traced back to\nreally identifying who you are.\n\n146\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.560\nAnd that information normally is\nconsidered private, and it can\n\n147\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.640\nactually lead to some damage if it's\nexposed in ways that it's not supposed to.\n\n148\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.524\nSo if you've seen that commercial,\nI think the famous one is from the company\n\n149\n00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:51.221\nthat's supposed to do\nthe security protection, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.545\nI think it's called LifeLock,\nis what I believe it's called.\n\n151\n00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:58.224\nWhere they're saying here's what we do,\ncuz your information's out there.\n\n152\n00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:01.475\nThat they're monitoring for\nthat stuff and figuring out what happens.\n\n153\n00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:05.803\nWell, imagine that you could get just\na little bit of information, such as your\n\n154\n00:08:05.803 --> 00:08:10.890\nbirth date, maybe here in the United\nStates, your social security number.\n\n155\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.040\nAnd that actually leads to somebody\nopening up a credit card in your name.\n\n156\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.180\nI mean, who would have guessed that\nsomething like that could actually be very\n\n157\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.400\neasily done at some point?\n\n158\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.250\nBut that's what you have to worry about.\n\n159\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.690\nIn the realm of cyber security,\npersonally identifiable information,\n\n160\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.090\nof course, is usually the asset\nthat we are trying to protect.\n\n161\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.760\nAnd that is something that we really have\nto worry about specially with a company\n\n162\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.200\nthat, if you house any\ntype of data like that.\n\n163\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.230\nIt should be first and\nforemost on your mind to go right.\n\n164\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.910\nThis is where I need to defense in up.\n\n165\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.110\nThis is where I need to make sure\nthat nothing like this can happen\n\n166\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.740\nfrom the outside.\n\n167\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.010\nYou need to keep up on how people getting\nin and getting access to that information.\n\n168\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.760\nKnow where to store,\n\n169\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.860\nknow the vulnerabilities are because it is\nvery easy to get lost in that information.\n\n170\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.030\nAnd somebody can take advantages,\n\n171\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.160\nsteal your entire identity\nif you are not careful.\n\n172\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.060\nSo when you see that term PII,\neven though it's PII,\n\n173\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.030\ndon't think about the pie, [LAUGH] think\nabout Personal Identifiable Information\n\n174\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.030\nand that will also be key for us to.\n\n175\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.010\nSo anything that you leave out there\nthere's a trace that could personally back\n\n176\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.140\nto you, an actual individual person,\nthat is what we're normally talking about.\n\n177\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.230\nSo anything like that, and is so\n\n178\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.840\nweird on what people can use\nnow to get that back to you.\n\n179\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.520\nIt used to be just last name but\n\n180\n00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.688\nnow there's a ton of people\nwith last name Smith or Wong.\n\n181\n00:09:33.688 --> 00:09:35.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In which it's very hard to\n\n182\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.850\ntrace anymore.\n\n183\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.480\nBut once they get a little bit of that and\nthen a little bit more information,\n\n184\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.060\nthat now becomes personally\nidentifiable and may lead back to you.\n\n185\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.730\nBe very careful with that information\nif you have to handle it as\n\n186\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.160\na security professional.\n\n187\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.260\nBut also,\nif part of your job is protecting it,\n\n188\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.690\nyou have to follow whatever regulatory\nguides that there are out there.\n\n189\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.570\nYou also have to understand the import of,\nof course, that type of information and\n\n190\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.750\nwhat actually happens to your\ncompany if that gets exposed.\n\n191\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.280\nIt can leave some very damaging, if not\neven the idea of that company going look,\n\n192\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.920\nwe can't really even function\nas a business any more.\n\n193\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.420\nAnd it might just be cuz of\ncollateral damage, right.\n\n194\n00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.330\nYour company leaked the information,\nnobody wants to deal with you any more, so\n\n195\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.210\nvery careful with this\ntype of information.\n\n196\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nclosely related to PII is PHI,\n\n197\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.304\nwhich is personal health information,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:25.304 --> 00:10:26.086\nIsn't it health?\n\n199\n00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:26.755\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n200\n00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:29.254\nPersonal health information,\nI wasn't sure if it was health care.\n\n201\n00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:29.946\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n202\n00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Or it was just health.\n\n203\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.370\nAnd that's the, your medical records,\nthings of this nature.\n\n204\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.770\nAnd we all know that this stuff.\n\n205\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.390\nIs under lock and key or should be.\n\n206\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.180\n&gt;&gt; It definitely needs to be, right?\n\n207\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:43.290\nBecause this time, instead of somebody\njust taking advantage of you and\n\n208\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.090\nmaybe stealing your identity,\nsomebody can take advantage of that and\n\n209\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.080\nreally leverage a lot\nof things against you.\n\n210\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.980\nIf they know that your health\ncondition is bad, they know how to be\n\n211\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.140\nable to say I can release this\ninformation out to the public.\n\n212\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.620\nAnd maybe a job that was a little\nbit physically demanding,\n\n213\n00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.220\nthey might go look we can't do it now that\nwe know that you have this condition.\n\n214\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.510\nOr might be that you're applying for\na life insurance policy.\n\n215\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.085\nIf you have this condition,\nyeah, there's no way.\n\n216\n00:11:13.085 --> 00:11:15.220\n[LAUGH] We're not gonna do that.\n\n217\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.000\nSo personal health information is key.\n\n218\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.050\nAll of this is actually kind of something\nthat we have to really worry about.\n\n219\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.010\nYou never know what else this leads to,\nright?\n\n220\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.130\nSo in the realm of personal\nhealth information, when you make\n\n221\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:36.220\na payment then,\nto any healthcare industry out there.\n\n222\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.460\nWell that now becomes part of that system\nin the personal health information.\n\n223\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.680\nSo now you're not only linking\nyour personal identification, but\n\n224\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.400\nnow into your financial,\ninto everything else that goes on.\n\n225\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.240\nSo even though somebody might not\nbe got their still right then cuz\n\n226\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.530\nthat's protected as far as\nthe systems that you know about.\n\n227\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.040\nBut then they can get in to the health\ncare system and then at that\n\n228\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.850\npoint we have still just enough for\nthat to get connected to an account.\n\n229\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.310\nAnd then from that point get connected\nto how you paying that account.\n\n230\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.030\nI mean, that opens up tons of doors.\n\n231\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.970\nSo in this one it becomes\na wider scope than\n\n232\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.110\njust the idea of the personal\nidentifiable information.\n\n233\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.310\nAnd now becomes at where all of a sudden,\nit's like look,\n\n234\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.530\nif I can get into Ronnie's, and Daniel and\nRonnie share the same information or\n\n235\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.450\nthe same, we use the same hospital or\nwhatever.\n\n236\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.160\nA health provider that's out there,\n\n237\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.020\nit may actually lead to\nexposure more than we realize.\n\n238\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.000\nSo we have to be very careful, again.\n\n239\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.820\nMore information,\nmore assets that need protecting.\n\n240\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.520\nWhereas all the other terms we really\ntalked about were pretty much some type of\n\n241\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.220\ncontrol or some type of system\nto help us to identify.\n\n242\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.080\nSome type of security incident or\nevent, but this is all about an asset,\n\n243\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.760\nmore than anything else.\n\n244\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.730\nSo, as to personal identifiable\ninformation, personal health information.\n\n245\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.300\nAll about some asset that we,\n\n246\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.490\nas security professionals,\ndefinitely need to keep sharply in focus.\n\n247\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, well now we're gonna\ntake a little left turn here,\n\n248\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.600\nstill in the security realm, obviously.\n\n249\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.820\nBut moving right along\nonto our next feature,\n\n250\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.720\nwhich is the principle of least privilege.\n\n251\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.110\nNow that seems very self-explanatory,\nto be honest with you.\n\n252\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.890\nBut there's some nuance to it, and Ronnie,\nyou're gonna take us through that.\n\n253\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.780\n&gt;&gt; It's real,\nthis is more of the administration side,\n\n254\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:22.730\nonce again of the security that we worry\nabout as we start work in companies.\n\n255\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.650\nWhere there's responsibility\nthat you have to deal with\n\n256\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.560\nin a couple of sense here, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.490\nWhen getting or\nallowing people to access your assets,\n\n258\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.390\nI know that's kind of\na weird phrase there.\n\n259\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.000\nWhen allowing people to access your files,\nwhen allowing people to access your\n\n260\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.240\nmachines, when allowing people to\naccess anything inside your network.\n\n261\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.160\nWhat you want to implement is\na principle of least privilege.\n\n262\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.890\nNow what it boils down to is\nsomething very simple right?\n\n263\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.970\nWe only want to give them\nthe privileges that they need for\n\n264\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.970\ntheir job duties so\nthat they can perform that.\n\n265\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.740\nNo more than that, but\nat the same time no less than that right?\n\n266\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.980\nIf you give them too little of\nprivilege to build access things.\n\n267\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.900\nWell now,\nthey have to constantly go Daniel,\n\n268\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.630\nI can't go into this and Daniel needs\nto constantly type in his password for\n\n269\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.830\nsomething or\nlet me get into this and do that.\n\n270\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.530\nYou pry seem the point of this right.\n\n271\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.790\nIf you retell like twenty years ago,\n\n272\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.490\nthere was always a cashier that\ngo I entered this in wrong.\n\n273\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.490\nI've got to wait for the floor manager\nto come out and they put the key in and\n\n274\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.250\nthen do the void on that transaction and\nthen pull it out.\n\n275\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.780\nWell, if there was only one and\nthere were 43 registers open,\n\n276\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.320\nit took a long time before\nyour transaction got done.\n\n277\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.310\nBut you can see where\nthat was probably saying,\n\n278\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.230\nhere's what we want our point\nof sales cashiers to have.\n\n279\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.970\nBut we want every transaction\nthat they've doubled or\n\n280\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.110\nthat they've gotten wrong,\nto immediately be corrected.\n\n281\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.600\nBut it has to be done through\nthis person who's only one\n\n282\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.010\nthat slowed down\nthe process of everything.\n\n283\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.850\nAnd once they did the bean\ncounting over years, right.\n\n284\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.372\nThey probably realized that the loss of\nthe number of hours that they could have\n\n285\n00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:15.130\nactually been, ringing people through,\nwe need to let that person go.\n\n286\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.560\nLook it was a duplicate,\nlet me take one off, and\n\n287\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.550\njust kind of delete that particular\ntransaction right there.\n\n288\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.040\nSo it really does help when\nyou give them privileges so\n\n289\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:31.210\nthat they can do their job but\nyou don't want to give them too much.\n\n290\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.920\nNow they learn a way around systems or\ncontrols that were put in place.\n\n291\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.780\nSo they weren't supposed\nto get a hold of them, so\n\n292\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.620\nthat's a problem that you have too.\n\n293\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.240\nIs that once you give them too much,\n\n294\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.870\nthey start figuring out,\nI can do this, I can do this.\n\n295\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.150\n&gt;&gt; People abuse their powers, Ronnie?\n\n296\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes they do.\n\n297\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.910\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe it.\n\n298\n00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.989\n&gt;&gt; And who would have guessed that\nabuse of things like that could happen,\n\n299\n00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:51.562\nbut it does.\n\n300\n00:15:51.562 --> 00:15:56.246\nAnd here's what it comes into kind\nof the rubber hitting the road here,\n\n301\n00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:58.679\nin a couple of different instances.\n\n302\n00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:01.593\nOne is the matter of training, right.\n\n303\n00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:05.534\nYou start some often and look, I don't\nhave time to do all the trainings, so\n\n304\n00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:08.820\nI'm gonna get more prodigious and\nnecessary.\n\n305\n00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.880\nAnd you do that, and they will have to do\ntheir job their way which is normally with\n\n306\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.760\nthe highest privileges\nthat they know how to do.\n\n307\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.950\nThe easiest way that they can do it and\n\n308\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.710\nthen when it comes out to some type\nof audit that comes back behind them.\n\n309\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.750\nIt says, who Ronnie has way too\nmany privileges doing this.\n\n310\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.240\nAnd now you have to put them\nback at the level that he does.\n\n311\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.970\nHe doesn't know how to do his\njob anymore cuz now he's like,\n\n312\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.500\nI gotta do that according to how?\n\n313\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.070\nWhat?\nI've never had these rules before.\n\n314\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.680\nNow you're having to do, what?\n\n315\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.690\nTrain them, so the first time you\ncould've been training them and\n\n316\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.580\nletting them get through\nthe whole process.\n\n317\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.190\nThis time you're going,\nwell he already knows how to do the job.\n\n318\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.855\nNo, he doesn't.\n\n319\n00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:43.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now you're essentially paying for\n\n320\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.220\nhis training twice is what you're doing.\n\n321\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.890\nOne, because first you\ndecided not to train him and\n\n322\n00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.640\njust give him the privileges\nthat he needed.\n\n323\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.460\nSecond time, you actually have\nto train him how to do the job.\n\n324\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.150\nSo on just a financial level and\nan ethical level that's pretty harsh.\n\n325\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.127\nBut then on the security level, right.\n\n326\n00:17:01.127 --> 00:17:06.220\nYou can't blame the guy for taking\nadvantage of privileges that he has.\n\n327\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.770\nYou mean I can look at this stuff, I can\nget access to this stuff, I can do that.\n\n328\n00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.730\nBut yeah, Ronnie, you weren't supposed to.\n\n329\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.610\nBut I have the privilege to do so.\n\n330\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.250\nSo now you have to worry about that too.\n\n331\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:22.320\nSo what we want to do instead is restrict\nthese privileges to only what they need.\n\n332\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.710\nAnd you can do that.\n\n333\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.820\nNow sometimes you do need people to\ntake on privileges temporarily, so\n\n334\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.040\nlet's say for example right that,\nDaniel is the manager for whatever\n\n335\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.540\ndepartment that he's in but he goes\naway for vacation for two weeks, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.570\nAnd Daniel has all the highest privileges,\nnobody else does.\n\n337\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.750\nHe goes off to Hawaii and\n\n338\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.070\nnow something happens that needs\nadministrative privileges.\n\n339\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.400\nDaniel is on a plane to Hawaii.\n\n340\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.660\nI don't even know how long to,\nI'm gonna say six, eight hours.\n\n341\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.790\n&gt;&gt; It's probably quite a flight.\n\n342\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.330\n&gt;&gt; It's quite a flight, okay?\n\n343\n00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.910\nAnd now I call Daniel on the airphone\nthat costs him $15 minute or whatever.\n\n344\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.740\nI don't even know what it costs anymore.\n\n345\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.680\nAnd I'm going, Daniel,\nwe need you to come back, and\n\n346\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.290\nDaniel's like, I'm on a one way\nflight to Hawaii right now.\n\n347\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.000\nI'll have to turnaround before.\n\n348\n00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.130\nNo but\nDaniel I really need you to come back.\n\n349\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.730\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n350\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.980\nBut what Daniel could do is what we call\nprivilege bracketing, which allows Daniel\n\n351\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.250\nto say, hi, Ronnie for the next two weeks,\nhere's the privileges that you have.\n\n352\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.330\nAnd then we can automatically after\nthose two weeks rescind those so\n\n353\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.810\nthat Ronnie no longer has those\nprivileges once Daniel gets back.\n\n354\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.180\nSo this is where that principle\nof giving privilege or\n\n355\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.810\napplying privileges is really kind of\nkey as a security principle here, okay.\n\n356\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.440\nWhen we are especially in\ndealing with humans and\n\n357\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.280\nthat's pretty much a key on\nthe privilege aspect of it.\n\n358\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.135\nWhen we assign them the right privileges,\nI hope I can say that word.\n\n359\n00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:47.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We give people the proper\n\n360\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.400\ntraining\n&gt;&gt; We give people the rights to do what\n\n361\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.050\nthey need to do without needing\nto overly ask for permission.\n\n362\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.220\nAnd they do their jobs right then.\n\n363\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.880\nBut when we don't,\nthey assume too many privileges, and\n\n364\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.640\nthey do things maybe wrongly even\nthough it's a unintentionally doing it.\n\n365\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.930\nBut at the same time, it's something\nthat you now have to retrain for.\n\n366\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.620\nSo this is not a security condition\nthat we really want to kind of bypass,\n\n367\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.750\njust because we have the ability to do so.\n\n368\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.310\nThis is why good policy is set in place,\nso that we don't bypass these types\n\n369\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.570\nof situations that we may go,\nhmm it's a conundrum,\n\n370\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.690\nI'm really good friends with Daniel,\nI'm gonna give him all the privileges.\n\n371\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.680\nWell his position says,\nhe only needs these privileges.\n\n372\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.060\nWell that shouldn't be a decision that\nI make just based on a friendship.\n\n373\n00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.590\nIt should be based on\nthe policy that's set.\n\n374\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.090\nSo we have to worry about principle\nof least privilege all the time,\n\n375\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.800\nespecially when we accidentally go,\nhow did Daniel get access to that?\n\n376\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.230\nThat's what we have to worry about.\n\n377\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.800\nSo that's another aspect\n\n378\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.720\nI've also taken a look at security\nthat we really need to understand.\n\n379\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.420\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nhe's totally right about that.\n\n380\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.500\nAnd speaking in that same vein\nabout things that we have to really\n\n381\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.200\ntake a look at, and you cannot get away\nwith any time you talk about security,\n\n382\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.855\nyou have to kind of dive\nin to risk management.\n\n383\n00:20:01.855 --> 00:20:02.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yes,\n\n384\n00:20:02.606 --> 00:20:05.656\nit is one of the most drive symbols and\nboring topics in God's green Earth.\n\n385\n00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is something,\n\n386\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.700\njust deal with it, right?\n\n387\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.775\nI've had to learn to deal with it.\n\n388\n00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You'll have to learn to deal with it.\n\n389\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.790\nOur last three topics\nare gonna be on that.\n\n390\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.800\nWe're gonna start with risk scoring,\nor risk waiting.\n\n391\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.204\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about this idea\nof risk scoring or risk waiting.\n\n392\n00:20:19.204 --> 00:20:19.820\n&gt;&gt; No, no [LAUGH].\n\n393\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.240\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen,\n\n394\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.860\nand hopefully this will help us out.\n\n395\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.470\nThere is a matrix you can come up with.\n\n396\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.260\nIf you're dealing in risk\nmanagement a lot of times.\n\n397\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.270\nThis idea of risk scoring and\nrisk waiting,\n\n398\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:43.230\nis really the way of assigning\na particular value to a risk.\n\n399\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.545\nBut not just because Daniel says,\nooh, that's risky.\n\n400\n00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:46.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n401\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.920\nAnd I just go, yeah,\nnow that's less risky.\n\n402\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.030\nWe're not depending on upon a,\nan all-seeing and all.\n\n403\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.970\nIntuitive nature of how\nwe are saying that.\n\n404\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.020\nWhat we do is we select criteria, okay.\n\n405\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.680\nAnd that's what we do.\n\n406\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.070\nAnd in those criteria,\nwe give it a particular weight.\n\n407\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.100\nNow here, I have just randomly\nchosen probability and\n\n408\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.840\nimpact as, as far as what I\nbelieve here on this idea.\n\n409\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.400\nNow, if I scroll over here.\n\n410\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.260\nLet me kind of show you how I did this.\n\n411\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.110\nOkay, we're really only paying attention\nto the left-hand side of this.\n\n412\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:19.960\nThe probability here I've judged on\na scale of .2 all the way up to one.\n\n413\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.530\nAnd then of course on\nthe threat impact of it,\n\n414\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.280\nagain the same scale\ngoing from left to right.\n\n415\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.230\nSo this is where you take whatever\nrisk that you're talking about.\n\n416\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.460\nAnd you go,\nI think that it's gonna happen.\n\n417\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.970\nSo you might weight it up here, and\nthen you go, well what's the impact then?\n\n418\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.446\nAnd well it might be medium in my\norganization, and I weigh that out.\n\n419\n00:21:42.446 --> 00:21:46.174\nAnd then I come over here,\nand I mark that down.\n\n420\n00:21:46.174 --> 00:21:48.940\nSo I say hey, here's the probability\nthat I guessed on this score.\n\n421\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.790\nHere's the impact, and then I can come\nup with a score to have that there.\n\n422\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.190\nThen you can add them all up and that way,\nyou can plot that on that chart,\n\n423\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.340\nand figure out whether or\n\n424\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.050\nnot, it's something that you've\ngot to actually deal with as well.\n\n425\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.470\nIt really helps to decide whether or\nnot, or\n\n426\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.590\nhow much you're gonna spend on\na particular risk, as far as\n\n427\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:18.750\nmonetary value that you have, and\nunsecured that asset against risk as well.\n\n428\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.240\nSo that's really the idea.\n\n429\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.300\nAnd you might see a scorecards\nmight also be in line.\n\n430\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.230\nWhere they say, they give you multiple\nquestions on a scale of one to five,\n\n431\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.290\nhow would you say that this does?\n\n432\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.020\nAnd then you add up all the scorecards and\n\n433\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.660\nthat may give you the risk rating instead,\nor the risk score that you want.\n\n434\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.960\nSo it just all depends\non what you need to do.\n\n435\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.540\nBut very important when you have ton of\nassets that you have to deal with, yet\n\n436\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.680\nagain is based on criteria\nmore than anything else not,\n\n437\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.390\nwhat Ronnie says is risky, well that\ndoesn't always mean it's risky, right?\n\n438\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.490\nA yes,\nit's just means Ronnie think it's risky.\n\n439\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.030\nHow do you actually evaluate\nthat to where everybody is fair.\n\n440\n00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.630\nWhat if you get two scorecards, you get\none from Daniel and his says low risk.\n\n441\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.930\nYou get one from Ronnie and\nRonnie says high risk.\n\n442\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.330\nWhose score is actually more\nvaluable at that point?\n\n443\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.150\nOne said, you give an equal way here.\n\n444\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.670\nYou put it on that chart.\n\n445\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.840\nYou can plot that chart if you want to or\nyou can actually average it out\n\n446\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.140\nbetween everybody and\nfigure out what probably is gonna happen.\n\n447\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.020\nSo being able to actually add in a little\nbit of scoring here does help you\n\n448\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.960\nto essentially assess how much, and\nwhen, and where, and whether or not.\n\n449\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.050\nYou're actually going to\nprotect a particular asset with\n\n450\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.790\nenough of your security controls.\n\n451\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right, once you figured out\nwhere the risk might be coming from,\n\n452\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.210\nnow we can start taking\nsteps to reduce that risk,\n\n453\n00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.710\nor risk reduction, which is our next term.\n\n454\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.662\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly like it sounds.\n\n455\n00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:53.674\nOur goal is simple, in any organization,\njust about is they don't want\n\n456\n00:23:53.674 --> 00:23:59.031\nto do anything beyond risky, even risk\naggressive types of organizations.\n\n457\n00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:01.504\nNo, I'm gonna say this, okay?\n\n458\n00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:03.304\nDo not, but let me say,\n\n459\n00:24:03.304 --> 00:24:08.074\ndo not normally decide I'm gonna\ntake every bit of our profit,\n\n460\n00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:13.235\nride out to Vegas and put it on one\nhand of Texas Holdem poker, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:13.235 --> 00:24:15.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you can do that.\n\n462\n00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:15.983\n&gt;&gt; You can do that.\n\n463\n00:24:15.983 --> 00:24:18.247\n&gt;&gt; It's not smart [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But that's not reducing the risk, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:18.919\n&gt;&gt; No, that's creating risk.\n\n465\n00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:22.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's creating a risk instead.\n\n466\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.580\nBut in this instance, right, is something\nthat we've got to really take a look and\n\n467\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.817\ngo, all right, so here is our exposure.\n\n468\n00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:31.537\nThat means that you've actually\ntaken the time to assess all\n\n469\n00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.900\nthe possible risks that you know about.\n\n470\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.040\nYou're never gonna assess every\nsingle possibility of risk, right?\n\n471\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.944\nIf you do, that includes a comet\nhitting the planet and destroying,\n\n472\n00:24:41.944 --> 00:24:43.560\nI mean,\nyou'd have to take into that account.\n\n473\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.366\n&gt;&gt; There is a risk of that happening.\n&gt;&gt; And there is a risk of that happening.\n\n474\n00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:49.590\nBut you can take into account\nas much your organization thinks\n\n475\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.639\nit's of value to take into account of.\n\n476\n00:24:51.639 --> 00:24:56.546\nAnd then at that point, try,\nof course, working all of the risks\n\n477\n00:24:56.546 --> 00:25:01.545\nthat you can out of that equation,\nthen your organization's only\n\n478\n00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:07.450\nreally dealing with the risks that\nyou have to absolutely take care of.\n\n479\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.350\nAnd that means that you're really\ntrying to focus in on those that you\n\n480\n00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.042\nabsolutely believe are gonna impact\nthe way that your business is gonna go.\n\n481\n00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:17.340\nSo risk reduction is\nexactly like it sounds,\n\n482\n00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.130\nwe're trying to reduce the amount of\nrisk that we face as an organization.\n\n483\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then kind of taking\na step back, it's a risk assessment.\n\n484\n00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.220\nWhat are my risks?\n\n485\n00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.430\nWhere are they coming from?\n\n486\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.710\nAnd what is actually coming\nat my company per se?\n\n487\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.644\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unlike the idea of weighting the\nrisk, right, where we might have six or\n\n488\n00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:37.480\nseven different risks, and now you have\nto kinda put them in a ranking order.\n\n489\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.350\nAnd that way you go,\nall right, this is riskier.\n\n490\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.160\nLet me spend more money up here.\n\n491\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.350\nAnd this one is not as risky,\nlet me spend less money down here.\n\n492\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.330\nAnd risk weighting or\nranking really helps us to do that.\n\n493\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.470\nThe assessment again is really,\n\n494\n00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.980\nI keep saying ranking, weighting really\nhelps us to determine where that is.\n\n495\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.020\nRanking helps us to say,\n\n496\n00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.570\nhey, let's put this in order of\nprioritization, is really the key.\n\n497\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.850\nSo when we get into\nthe idea of assessment,\n\n498\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:08.210\nwe take every individual one and we assess\nthe ability for us to get rid of it,\n\n499\n00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.080\nor we assess the ability for\nus to need to protect against that risk.\n\n500\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.770\nAnd then we have to actually\ndecide at that point, right,\n\n501\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.390\nthat idea of the volume of\nprotections we're gonna add to that.\n\n502\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.970\nSo at the end here,\nthe assessment is more about, hey,\n\n503\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.940\nwhat does each one bring to us?\n\n504\n00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.170\nWhereas the idea of the weighting gives\nus, how do we actually prioritize?\n\n505\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.620\nI think I'm saying all those backwards.\n\n506\n00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.120\nIn my mind it made sense.\n\n507\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.805\nSo let me make sure.\n\n508\n00:26:33.805 --> 00:26:39.480\nWeighting allows us to, yeah, to kind of\ngive an assessment of every single one and\n\n509\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.630\nthen put that into the priority.\n\n510\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.980\nAnd then the assessment gives us\nthat ability to evaluate each one.\n\n511\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.060\nAnd then, say all right,\nhere's what each one actually means.\n\n512\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.820\nAnd then we put it into the weight\nsystem and do what we need to.\n\n513\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.030\nSo it's kind of funky.\n\n514\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.717\nThey both mean very similar.\n\n515\n00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:57.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But they are just slightly different,\n\n516\n00:26:57.244 --> 00:26:58.440\nnot much though.\n\n517\n00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.383\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Ronnie, we have\ngone down a laundry list of terms and\n\n518\n00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:06.820\nvocabulary and ideas and concepts that\nour good viewers out there need to know.\n\n519\n00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.390\nBut we've finally come to the end,\nand it was perfect timing, too.\n\n520\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.500\nOur clock is ticking down to\nthe last tock for this episode.\n\n521\n00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.040\nSo Ronnie, thank you so much for dropping\nby, explaining these terms for us so\n\n522\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.120\nthat we'll know them.\n\n523\n00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120\nAnd thank you for watching.\n\n524\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.170\nBut like I said,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n525\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.490\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.605\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV, I'm your host\n\n4\n00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:21.360\nMike Rodrick and today we're doing\nour Cisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.113\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at security models and\n\n6\n00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:28.243\nmaking sure we understand more\nof access control models.\n\n7\n00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:31.302\nAnd here to explain this to us is\nthe master of all things Cisco,\n\n8\n00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:33.742\nMister Ronnie Wong,\nhow you doing today Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\nhaving me back on the show Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.520\nAnd thank you for standing in for Cherokee\nas we continue through our series here.\n\n11\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.680\nWhat we're taking a look at today is of\ncourse different access control models and\n\n12\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.540\nthis is an important part of technical\ncontrol that we have to make sure that we\n\n13\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.210\nunderstand and we implement as we start\nto learn more and more about security.\n\n14\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.840\nIt's always neat to think about\nsome of the different tools and\n\n15\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.380\ndevices that are out there.\n\n16\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.160\nSome of the security concepts\nthat we can talk about.\n\n17\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.010\nBut when it comes down to it, meat and\n\n18\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.010\npotatoes security it really boils down to\naccess control a lot of times, right Mike?\n\n19\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.630\n&gt;&gt; It really does, yeah that is one of the\nthings that I think as admins if anything\n\n20\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.890\nwe've really spent a lot of time on.\n\n21\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460\nIs making sure that the right people\nhave access to what they need and\n\n22\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.610\nthe wrong people don't have access.\n\n23\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.160\nNow when we talk access control here,\nRonnie we're really not talking about\n\n24\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.860\nPhysical security,\nmore about security of information.\n\n25\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.360\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times, yes.\n\n26\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.910\nThe very fact that we have to be\nable to protect our information, but\n\n27\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.610\nthat as well as even access into\nour physical location, I guess.\n\n28\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.010\nWe could even talk about physical access\nin that way but a lot of times when it\n\n29\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.020\ncomes down to it, there's really three\nmodels that we have to be familiar with,\n\n30\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.240\nwhen it comes down to data protection,\nis what we're really facing.\n\n31\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what's the first\nmodel we wanna look at today?\n\n32\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first one of course actually,\nis kinda neat and descriptive right?\n\n33\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.430\nIs the idea of what we call\nthe Discretionary Access Control model.\n\n34\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.300\nSo as we break that down,\nas far as those terms go.\n\n35\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.070\nThe term discretionary is probably\nthe only term that we may not\n\n36\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.140\nbe as familiar with.\n\n37\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.630\nAccess control makes sense.\n\n38\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.191\nYou can get access, or\nwe're limiting your access.\n\n39\n00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:14.169\nBut the term discretionary is probably\nwhere most people tend to fall apart\n\n40\n00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.198\non this and when like what does\nthat mean when we start talking\n\n41\n00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:21.531\nabout the idea of\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n42\n00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:25.600\nAnd the first time that I start hear about\nlike if I'm going to be discreet about\n\n43\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.116\nsomething, hidden access is that\nwhat I'm really talking about or\n\n44\n00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.466\ntrying to slide underneath the radar\nin terms of my control but.\n\n45\n00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:33.910\n&gt;&gt; That's not really it, is it?\n\n46\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.077\n&gt;&gt; That's really not it, and I always try\nto find analogies to things that I would\n\n47\n00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:40.111\nhave understood a little bit better.\n\n48\n00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:44.387\nAnd the one that always kind of got\nme is that when I started reading and\n\n49\n00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:48.812\nlearning about this is, I always\nthink about some movie scene, Mike,\n\n50\n00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:52.502\nwhere there's the bouncer's\nstanding at the front door of\n\n51\n00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:56.168\nthe cool nightclub that\neverybody's trying to get into.\n\n52\n00:02:56.168 --> 00:02:59.912\nAnd he's standing there and he's allowing\nfor certain people to come in and,\n\n53\n00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:04.390\nof course, somebody always walked up the\nfront door and they get in but you can't.\n\n54\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.000\nAnd so the more that I started thinking\nabout that, the more I said, that sounds\n\n55\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.510\nmore like the discretionary access control\nas I read about it in terms of security.\n\n56\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.990\nThat a single individual or\nadministrator can pretty much create\n\n57\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.400\na list of who can get in,\nand who can't get in but\n\n58\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.760\nas well as what privileges\nare also allowed to do so as well.\n\n59\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.790\nSo usually that's the kind of\nassociations I think about.\n\n60\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.680\nSo Mike is that pretty good or is that.\n\n61\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.750\n&gt;&gt; I like that, I like that analogy.\n\n62\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.630\nIn my mind I always think of\ndiscretionary access control well it's at\n\n63\n00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.280\nthe owners of\nthe information's discretion.\n\n64\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.030\nAnd when we say it's discretion,\nwe're talking about,\n\n65\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.830\nit's your decision who does or\ndoesn't have access.\n\n66\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.190\nSo, discretionary access control,\nit's at the discretion of the owner of\n\n67\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.890\nthe information who should or\nshould not have access.\n\n68\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.380\nAnd like you said, it's simply a list.\n\n69\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.500\nNow Ronnie, I know so\nif you put me on that list you\n\n70\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.960\ncan assign me the different permissions\nas to what level of access i have.\n\n71\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, so with not only\ndeciding who can gain access in,\n\n72\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.290\nespecially with the technical controls\nthat we're normally talking about.\n\n73\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.540\nWe can even limit amount of access even\nthough we might have two different people\n\n74\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.010\naccess on the same of\na place if we talk about.\n\n75\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.980\nSo let's go and take a look at my screen.\n\n76\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.970\nHopefully this will\nhelp us to demonstrate.\n\n77\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.170\nNow what I'm really just talking about, of\ncourse, is just using file permissions as\n\n78\n00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.810\na good description or a good example\nof discretionary access control.\n\n79\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.520\nIf this exists on my machine,\n\n80\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.880\nI'm the one that really kind of\nsays who gets access to what.\n\n81\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.100\nSo at the very top here, level that\nI may have I may say I've created\n\n82\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.230\na network folder and inside of that folder\nI've created two sub folder inside of it.\n\n83\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.160\nOne for my configs and the other one\nof course for list of devices or\n\n84\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.460\nwhatever it might be that I have.\n\n85\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.050\nNow at this point I can assign my self or\nan individual called Ronnie and\n\n86\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.530\nactually give them the amount\nof access that they need.\n\n87\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.064\nSo for Ronnie I may say look\nhe has read permissions.\n\n88\n00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:09.980\nAllows him to be able to look inside\nit but really not do anything else to\n\n89\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.430\nchange anything within that folder but\nit really just allows him to do so.\n\n90\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.489\nBut Mike I give read and execute.\n\n91\n00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.090\nSo if there's any executable files\nin there he can run those too.\n\n92\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.600\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right, and\n\n93\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.028\nthat may not be the best thing\nin the world for me to do, so\n\n94\n00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:26.061\nI may actually wanna\nchange that a little bit.\n\n95\n00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:26.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n96\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.740\n&gt;&gt; But if I do that that's perfectly fine.\n\n97\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.310\nIt allows us to say that now anybody else\nwho is not on this list Mike though,\n\n98\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.250\nwhat happens here?\n\n99\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was my next question Ronnie.\n\n100\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.967\nYou're talking about that analogy with\nthe bouncer at a nightclub for example.\n\n101\n00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:46.386\nIf I go up to that bouncer and I'm on\nthe list he can allow me to come in.\n\n102\n00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:48.740\nBut what happens when I'm not on the list?\n\n103\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.655\nThen what does the bouncer do?\n\n104\n00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:52.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're not on the list,\nyou're not gonna get in.\n\n105\n00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:56.025\nSo normally,\nwe talk about an implicit type of deny, so\n\n106\n00:05:56.025 --> 00:06:01.410\nthat if you're not there, that's what\nshould normally end up happening.\n\n107\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.150\nNow, along with this, of course,\n\n108\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150\nthis would be impossible\non a real regular basis,\n\n109\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.500\nif we had to set up these permissions for\nevery single substructure that's in there.\n\n110\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.600\nSo here I just have folders, but\nMike if there's 1,000 files inside,\n\n111\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.450\nand I have to do this for\nevery single one of those.\n\n112\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.259\n&gt;&gt; Times hundreds or\nthousands of employees.\n\n113\n00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:23.348\n&gt;&gt; It becomes a little bit harder to\nthink about and to even want to do.\n\n115\n00:06:23.348 --> 00:06:27.190\nSo the great thing is most of this,\nonce we apply at it at the upper level,\n\n116\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.250\nit tends to trickle down or\nwe get what we call of course inheritance.\n\n117\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.970\nAnd so here when I go into\nthe Configs folder, I can see and\n\n118\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.660\nI've kinda grayed it out, and this is the\nway that you normally see about Microsoft\n\n119\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.920\nsystems where it's kinda grayed out\na little bit, you don't tend to change it.\n\n120\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.570\nBut like Mike here, he ended up having the\npermissions allow Read &amp; Execute up here.\n\n121\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.950\nBut in the config,\nhe has the same permissions.\n\n122\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.310\nThis is without having to go in there and\nactually make a new list for\n\n123\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.510\nthe configs folder to do so.\n\n124\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.227\nBut I can go ahead and reassign\nRonnie's permissions if we wanted to,\n\n125\n00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:03.259\nto explicitly give him new permission,\nI didn't do that at this point, but\n\n126\n00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:04.655\nI could do that right now.\n\n127\n00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:08.873\nSo let's say that here, we'll go deny.\n\n128\n00:07:08.873 --> 00:07:12.310\nOkay, and now we might find nothing.\n\n129\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.780\nRonnie can look at the network folder.\n\n130\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.610\nBut when it comes down\nto the config folder,\n\n131\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.660\nhe's not gonna be able to\nread into that folder either.\n\n132\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.060\nSo now, we can control that on\na granular basis if we need to.\n\n133\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.400\nBut if we don't I've just inherit\nall those other permissions.\n\n134\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.930\nAnd here I just showed the same\nthing down here at the bottom.\n\n135\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.600\nBeing able to change those\npermissions as well.\n\n136\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.090\nSo it gives us, like what Mike was\ntalking about, the owner's discretion.\n\n137\n00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.580\nWho he chooses.\n\n138\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.095\nSo when it comes down to it's based\non what the administrator choose or\n\n139\n00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:43.956\nwho the administrator chooses and\nwhat level of access or\n\n140\n00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:46.056\nwhat level of control that we want to set.\n\n141\n00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:49.270\nSo it's really good,\nbecause we don't wanna have to create,\n\n142\n00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.091\nif we didn't do this, right Mike, and\nI still need these different ones,\n\n143\n00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.451\nI need a different folder for, so\nthere might be Ronnie configs.\n\n144\n00:07:56.451 --> 00:08:00.365\nAnd then Mike configs, and then one for\nRonnie devices and Mike devices and\n\n145\n00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:02.609\nIt would get out of hand really quickly.\n\n146\n00:08:02.609 --> 00:08:05.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, administrative overhead\nwould just drive you crazy and\n\n147\n00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:09.548\nthat's why we love taking advantage of\ninheritance that most systems that do\n\n148\n00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:11.754\ndiscretionary access control will allow.\n\n149\n00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:15.859\nYou set it once at the highest level that\nyou can and let those formations inherit\n\n150\n00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:20.340\ndown to the objects inside, that makes\nit really easy to manage as an admin.\n\n151\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.540\n&gt;&gt; Now why does this\nmatter to cyber security,\n\n152\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.540\nthat's what we really\nhave to think about here.\n\n153\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.050\nIt's fairly simple.\n\n154\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.960\nI know that for me,\nwhen I first started studying and\n\n155\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.860\ntrying to say, I think security's kind of\na focus that I'd really like to understand\n\n156\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.530\na little bit more, it was really\nhaving to understand this model first.\n\n157\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.250\nAnd if there's anything that's really\nconfusing, once you start getting into\n\n158\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.380\nthe permissions, and\nwhat happens when they apply here, and\n\n159\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.040\nthey don't apply here, and\ntrying to figure that out.\n\n160\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.570\nSo you need to have a good\nsolid understanding of that,\n\n161\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.080\non existing structures that you\nare going to have to monitor, if you\n\n162\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.718\nwant to actually understand the overall\neffective permissions that somebody has.\n\n163\n00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:01.520\nOr you might be wondering\nat the end of the day,\n\n164\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.830\nwhy is it that Mike has access\nto something but Ronnie doesn't?\n\n165\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.940\nAnd you really need to able\nto trace that thing out.\n\n166\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.990\nSo discretion access control, one of the\ntopics that you really need to make sure\n\n167\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.550\nthat you have a solid, at least\nfundamental overall understanding of.\n\n168\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.100\nBut in reality, especially as a network\nadmin, you need to make sure.\n\n169\n00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.470\nBecause availability,\npart of the CIA triangle,\n\n170\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.470\nthis is where the rubber hits the road\nagain is that idea of availability, and\n\n171\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.080\nthat's really a key function\nthat we have to make sure of.\n\n172\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.050\nWe can't restrict it too much but at\nthe same time they need to be available to\n\n173\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.730\nthe authorized resources without being\navailable to unauthorized resources.\n\n174\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.090\nDiscretionary is one of\nthe ways to do this.\n\n175\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely it's definitely something\nthat we're troubleshooting all the time\n\n176\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.930\nbecause people call up and\nsay hey I don't have access to this and\n\n177\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.720\nI think I should have access.\n\n178\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.400\nAnd then we go in and we have to look at\nthe permissions that have been signed,\n\n179\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.010\nhow they're inheriting,\nwhether they've been blocked,\n\n180\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.460\nwhether there's opposite permissions\nthat have been signed at some point.\n\n181\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.660\nAnd then worrying about\nthe implicit deny and\n\n182\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.600\nexplicit denies,\nalways a challenge as well.\n\n183\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.410\nNow Ronnie,\nwe said there were three models, so\n\n184\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.710\ndiscretionary access control\nbeing model number one.\n\n185\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.830\nWhat's the next one we\nneed to be familiar with?\n\n186\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:13.410\n&gt;&gt; The next one is probably the one that\nmore people in general are familiar with.\n\n187\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.450\nAnd that's due to the popularization of\nmovies, again, more that anything else.\n\n188\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.330\nIf you watched Mission Impossible movies\nor any type of spy movie, inevitably,\n\n189\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.870\nthere shows up a folder and\non that folder, there's a big gigantic,\n\n190\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.400\nred imprint on it.\n\n191\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.080\nAnd it says, top secret or\neyes only or whatever it is, right?\n\n192\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.058\nAnd what is that actually saying and\nmeaning there?\n\n193\n00:10:36.058 --> 00:10:41.000\nWell they're pretty much saying that hey,\nhere is a particular level of clearance\n\n194\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.240\nthat you need to have before you\ncan even look into this folder.\n\n195\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.810\nAnd that is what we call some type\nof mandatory access control instead.\n\n196\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.020\nWhen it comes down to the idea\nof mandatory access controls,\n\n197\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.210\ntwo things are absolutely 100% clear,\nokay.\n\n198\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.580\nWe have to actually figure out what\nthose levels actually mean, but\n\n199\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.620\nthe other one is\nthe classification of the data.\n\n200\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.620\nNow, at a technical side in cyber\nsecurity, if you're the one\n\n201\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.860\nresponsible for implementing these\ncontrols, you're not the one deciding on\n\n202\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.190\nwhat actually is top secret, and\nwhat's confidential, and what's not, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.140\nSo there has to be a classification\nsystem that exists first.\n\n204\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.860\nAnd security writers,\nas you start reading more and\n\n205\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.800\nmore about them in the Cisco world.\n\n206\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.370\nIf you haven't, pick up\nthe Cisco Book by Catherine Pecket.\n\n207\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.830\nShe does a wonderful job in talking\nabout how important the classification\n\n208\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.880\nsystem is.\n\n209\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.960\nIf you want to actually know\nan organization's seriousness to the idea\n\n210\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.910\nof security, take a look at\nhow they classify their data.\n\n211\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.210\nAnd whether or not there's\na system that's already set up.\n\n212\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.050\nAnd whether or\nnot people are following it.\n\n213\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.650\nSo, you actually find out, the people\nthat really consider security seriously,\n\n214\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.240\nthey already have a system in place, and\nthey're not actually leaving it up to,\n\n215\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.220\nwell, someone like me to decide\nwhether it's classified or not.\n\n216\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.040\nSo, that's actually kind of a key.\n\n217\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that is one of\nthe big differences between, say,\n\n218\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.810\ndiscretionary access control\nmodels versus mandatory access.\n\n219\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.670\nIt's not the owner of the information\nthat's deciding what category or\n\n220\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.220\nwhat classification this goes under.\n\n221\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.140\nIf I write up a document, a paper,\na spreadsheet or what have you,\n\n222\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.870\ntypically that has to go to a group or\nan individual that's responsible for\n\n223\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.490\nsetting that classification\non the document.\n\n224\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.420\nSo whereas discretionary,\n\n225\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.950\nit's the owner of the object that\nkind of decides who can or can't.\n\n226\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:37.090\nMandatory it typically goes to\nsomebody else for that decision.\n\n227\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.360\nI might say I'd like this to be classified\nthis way but if they look in there and\n\n228\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.930\nthere's some rule that says,\n\n229\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:46.240\nhey look you mention this in here that\nautomatically makes it top secret.\n\n230\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.120\nThat's what it gets branded.\n\n231\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.370\nAnd it's also different too Ronnie\nin the way it works because where is\n\n232\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.090\ndiscretionary, we're just using\na person's identity to decide whether or\n\n233\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.000\nnot they should or should not have access.\n\n234\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.790\nWith mandatory,\nwe talk about classifying the data\n\n235\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.835\nas well as assigning\nclassifications to the identities.\n\n236\n00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:04.700\nSo the entities that wanna\naccess the information.\n\n237\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\na lot of times we call this tags, right?\n\n238\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.380\nThe idea security tags that we\nhave especially on the data.\n\n239\n00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.050\nAnd then, even at individuals profile,\n\n240\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.770\nif you want to,\nto make sure that that happens that way.\n\n241\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.950\nSo it's not a matter of\nthe individual himself, or whether or\n\n242\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.370\nnot he can access it.\n\n243\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.260\nIt's a matter of whether or\nnot he has that particular security tag or\n\n244\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.390\nthat association,\nthat he can do so as well.\n\n245\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.000\nAnd this is really a key fundamental\ndifference that Mike has told us about,\n\n246\n00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.700\nis making sure that that\nwe that understanding.\n\n247\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.020\nSo without a classification system,\nthis doesn't work.\n\n248\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.900\nSo you can say something\nit's top secret but\n\n249\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.750\nMike, if I hand you a document that's\ntop secret and you're not classified for\n\n250\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.090\nthat and there's nothing else\nsecuring that, can you read it?\n\n251\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.870\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you can easily read it.\n\n252\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.380\nSo, but without that classification then\nwithout the controls there with the tags\n\n253\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.020\nand everything, especially if it's\nelectronic document, then he couldn't.\n\n254\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.170\nEven if he got on in this computer and\n\n255\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.620\nsays hey,\nMike's profile is not tagged with that.\n\n256\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.600\nYeah, he don't have the clearance for\nit, so\n\n257\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.990\nhe's not gonna be able to get access in.\n\n258\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, another big difference\nbetween discretionary and\n\n259\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.713\nmandatory is that we don't\nhave the ability to change it.\n\n260\n00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:09.390\nIf we were doing a discretionary model,\nand I go to Ronnie and\n\n261\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.160\nsay hey, Ronnie I can't access\nthis document you created.\n\n262\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.600\nAnd Ronnie decides that I need it,\n\n263\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.550\nhe can make that adjustment on access\ncontrol list and allow me access.\n\n264\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.890\nWhereas the case of the top secret,\nif I'm not top secret,\n\n265\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.690\nif I don't have top secret clearance, I\ncannot access that top secret information.\n\n266\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.210\nEven if Ronnie thinks I should have,\nI have to go through some procedure to\n\n267\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.890\nget that top level, top secret clearance\nbefore I can access the information.\n\n268\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's no doubt that it can be confusing.\n\n269\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.100\nBut let's go ahead and\nkind of show you a difference here,\n\n270\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.800\ntoo, there's a couple of different ones.\n\n271\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.710\nSo the spy movies I mentioned,\n\n272\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.130\nnormally who declares stuff like top\nsecret is gonna be governments, right?\n\n273\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.010\nAnd when we start seeing that, and then,\nof course, it works a little bit different\n\n274\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.560\nin the private sector as well,\nas far as companies go.\n\n275\n00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.040\nBut they still need a classification\nsystem depending on what happens.\n\n276\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.980\nNow when it comes down to those,\n\n277\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.070\nyou actually see several\ndifferent classifications.\n\n278\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.820\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n279\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.600\nI hope this kind of model helps you out.\n\n280\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.090\nThe ultimate goal behind mandatory access\ncontrol I think is relatively simple here.\n\n281\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.200\nThe more or the higher the level of course\nof the tagging system that you have,\n\n282\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.000\nthe less number of people should be\nable to see that information, okay.\n\n283\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.990\nSo as you start moving here,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n284\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.940\nIn the yellow, I have,\nwhere you tend to see this.\n\n285\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.510\nNow, this is just generic here,\nokay, where you see unclassified\n\n286\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.290\nSBU is sensitive but unclassified\nConfidential, secret and top secret.\n\n287\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:38.640\nThese top three over here on the right\nhand side, these are kind of the generic\n\n288\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.710\nwalls in which they have always\nbeen in existence there.\n\n289\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.992\nAnd when you start seeing this,\nespecially at the government level,\n\n290\n00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:50.980\neach government entity has their way\nof actually doing what they want to.\n\n291\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.639\nBut they can add in additional\nlevels if they choose to as well.\n\n292\n00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:58.870\nNow the funny thing was I thought this\nwas always just set in stone, Mike,\n\n293\n00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.282\nbut the more that I read about\nthis The more I found out, that\n\n294\n00:16:02.282 --> 00:16:06.805\nthis is actually done by executive order\nof the president more often than not.\n\n295\n00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:11.653\nSo every different administration they\ncan say hey look we want to stick with\n\n296\n00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:14.239\njust these three levels and that's it.\n\n297\n00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:17.053\nBut it may be that new administration\nthat comes up and says look.\n\n298\n00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:20.301\nWe need to add in an additional\nlevel of classification here.\n\n299\n00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:24.358\nAnd they can even make additional\nlevels of classification that last as\n\n300\n00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.996\nlong as their particular administration,\nor\n\n301\n00:16:26.996 --> 00:16:30.880\neven past that if they don't\nrescind that executive order.\n\n302\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.770\nSo I always thought it was just\nset in stone but it's not.\n\n303\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.190\nIt really is dependent\nupon the administration.\n\n304\n00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.260\nAnd then government entities\ntend to follow along with that\n\n305\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.990\nunderneath their administration,\nat least here in the United States.\n\n306\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.970\nNow, I can't tell you anywhere else, but\n\n307\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.100\nat least here in the United States\nthat's the way that this system works.\n\n308\n00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.890\nNow, when you start to take a look here,\nthe way that it is right now is that you\n\n309\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.820\ntend to have these classifications\nat the government level, okay.\n\n310\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.240\nSo top secret, of course,\nis exactly like it sounds like.\n\n311\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.230\nNormally the way that\nthey classify this idea\n\n312\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.160\non top secret is that\nthe information is so sensitive,\n\n313\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.730\nthat if it were to be released,\nit could cause somebody grave damage.\n\n314\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.360\nAnd that term, grave damage,\nmeans that they could end up in the grave,\n\n315\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.790\nis what it really means.\n\n316\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:19.680\nAnd that's kind of, it lets you know.\n\n317\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.380\nThis type of information can cost\nsomebody's life if it gets exposed.\n\n318\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.520\nSo when you take a look and\nnotice that not a lot of people.\n\n319\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.264\nSo on left to right here, the number of\npeople that can gain access to it as you\n\n320\n00:17:31.264 --> 00:17:33.802\nstart seeing this, is really low okay.\n\n321\n00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:39.470\nSo the higher that we move along this\nchart of the mandatory access we see that.\n\n322\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:45.036\nSecret of course means it can be damaging\nbut it doesn't rise that level of grave.\n\n323\n00:17:45.036 --> 00:17:46.189\nBut it's still very secret.\n\n324\n00:17:46.189 --> 00:17:49.549\nSo you might see a little bit\nmore access but you won't.\n\n325\n00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:54.640\nAnd then confidential of course means it's\nmeant to not ever get exposed out there.\n\n326\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.090\nBut then you have sensitive but\nunclassified.\n\n327\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.747\nThis particular one inside of\nthe government document says it can be\n\n328\n00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:01.652\nembarrassing.\n\n329\n00:18:01.652 --> 00:18:04.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's not classified.\n\n330\n00:18:04.308 --> 00:18:07.100\nThey're saying look you\ncan let it out there but\n\n331\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.180\nit's embarrassing is what\nthey're really saying.\n\n332\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.956\nThey're not classified,\nit says look, it's anything else.\n\n333\n00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.196\n&gt;&gt; That's a picture of me\ngorging myself at Taco Bell.\n\n334\n00:18:13.196 --> 00:18:14.052\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n335\n00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:14.663\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] want that to get out there.\n\n336\n00:18:14.663 --> 00:18:15.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's out there.\n\n337\n00:18:15.654 --> 00:18:18.038\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna cause any harm if it\ndoes other than embarrassment to me.\n\n338\n00:18:18.038 --> 00:18:19.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n339\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.580\nSo those are the systems and\n\n340\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.270\nas you take a look at this line the way\nthat I drew it is fairly simple, right?\n\n341\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.458\nIt kinda flat lines up here at the top\nbetween unclassified and the sensitive but\n\n342\n00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:29.341\nunclassified.\n\n343\n00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:32.187\nBut once you hit the confidential\nit drops steeply,\n\n344\n00:18:32.187 --> 00:18:35.291\nokay and then you start seeing\nwhere it curves back out and\n\n345\n00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:39.210\nthen you start seeing where top\nsecret is pretty much the high.\n\n346\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.170\nSo you have a lot of where the majority\nof private government documents kinda\n\n347\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.490\nreside right in here,\nall the way to that point.\n\n348\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.723\nBut then once it hits confidential,\nprobably outside of government service,\n\n349\n00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:50.892\nyou're not gonna see that.\n\n350\n00:18:50.892 --> 00:18:54.202\nThis is pretty much what we're seeing,\nand then as it goes up, you'll see that.\n\n351\n00:18:54.202 --> 00:18:57.994\nNow in private sector, same thing, but\ninstead, the highest level normally is\n\n352\n00:18:57.994 --> 00:19:01.420\nconfidential and then private\nsensitive and then unclassified.\n\n353\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.660\nNow all this is not\nsaying it's set in stone.\n\n354\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.630\nCorporations can change\nhowever they want to.\n\n355\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.640\nBut these are general patterns that you\ndo see falling in line with either the US\n\n356\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.380\ngovernment administration or the way that\nthe private sector chooses to do this.\n\n357\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.480\nTomorrow they could implement something\ntotally different if they want to.\n\n358\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.030\nBut here on the private level, let me\nshow you how much harsher this one is\n\n359\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.730\neven though people go on no\ntop secrets pretty much it.\n\n360\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.467\nBut notice as you do this just\nis just a straight decline.\n\n361\n00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:31.041\nIt doesn't matter so\nyou go from unclassified.\n\n362\n00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:35.347\nOnce it gets to sensitive look at how\nmany less people really get access to\n\n363\n00:19:35.347 --> 00:19:36.428\nthat data.\n\n364\n00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:39.200\nYou go to private, I mean,\nit becomes less and\n\n365\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.840\nthen you get to confidential\nwhich is our highest one.\n\n366\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.526\nAlmost little to none and\n\n367\n00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:48.438\nso this is, as much as people go\nit's just private stuff, who cares?\n\n368\n00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.700\nIt looks like it.\n\n369\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.060\nIf you take a look at this approach that\nI have here, it's actually more strict.\n\n370\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.230\nThan what the government actually\ntakes a look at, so pretty harsh.\n\n371\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n372\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.820\nAnd Ronnie,\nlet me make sure I got that correct.\n\n373\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.584\nAnd so these confidential,\nprivate, sensitive and classified,\n\n374\n00:20:04.584 --> 00:20:09.273\ngeneral guidelines but I could in my\norganization call it super-secret, secret,\n\n375\n00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:10.610\nand not-so-secret.\n\n376\n00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can call it triple-secret\nYahtzee, if you wanted to.\n\n377\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the underlying\n\n378\n00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.530\nprinciple remains the same.\n\n379\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.310\nYou've got data that's\nclassified at a certain level.\n\n380\n00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.280\nYou've got users that are given\na certain level, and if your level and\n\n381\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.590\nthe data's level match, you get access.\n\n382\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.130\nIf they don't, you don't get access.\n\n383\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's a great summary right there, Mike.\n\n384\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.350\nI can't have put it better, so.\n\n385\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.562\n&gt;&gt; What about anything that,\nlet's say I have secret.\n\n386\n00:20:35.562 --> 00:20:37.230\nLet's use your US government up there.\n\n387\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.210\nSo I have secret clearance.\n\n388\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.333\nSo I can access secret but not top secret.\n\n389\n00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:46.130\nCan I access confidential or\nsensitive but unclassified?\n\n390\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.964\nCan I go down?\n\n391\n00:20:46.964 --> 00:20:49.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It depends on\nthe formula they're using.\n\n392\n00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.659\nSo that Bell-Lapadula formula of things.\n\n393\n00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:53.163\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n394\n00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:54.115\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n395\n00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:56.301\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] depends\non how it's implemented.\n\n396\n00:20:56.301 --> 00:21:00.098\nSo there's different formulas to that,\nand I wish I could tell you,\n\n397\n00:21:00.098 --> 00:21:04.091\nI knew all those different protocols\nthat would allow you to do that, but\n\n398\n00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:07.780\nthere is sometimes where it is top\nsecret where it only reads down.\n\n399\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.395\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So that's not set in stone, though.\n\n400\n00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:13.605\nBecause I know, watching movies, I always\nthought, well if I have this clearance,\n\n401\n00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.845\nI'd automatically get access\nto everything below it.\n\n402\n00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:18.075\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n403\n00:21:18.075 --> 00:21:19.437\n&gt;&gt; Not as far as I know.\n\n404\n00:21:19.437 --> 00:21:23.522\nSo, you'll actually see that\ncompartmentalization is kind of the key\n\n405\n00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:24.515\nhere, right?\n\n406\n00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:26.870\nTo making sure that you\nhave mandatory access.\n\n407\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.370\nCompartmentalization has to be the key.\n\n408\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.130\nThey do not want somebody to go well\nthis is kind of on the fringe of\n\n409\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.060\nsecret to classified.\n\n410\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.490\nAnd the way that they decide\nthat can be really weird right.\n\n411\n00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:43.680\nSomebody could go well it's 90%\nclassified and only 10% secret.\n\n412\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.600\nSo why did you classify that\nas being a secret document.\n\n413\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.139\nSo that's why you have to implement that,\nlike I said I think it's bell [INAUDIBLE].\n\n414\n00:21:50.139 --> 00:21:50.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n415\n00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:52.131\n&gt;&gt; Which I love.\n\n416\n00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:52.759\n&gt;&gt; I always mispronounce that.\n\n417\n00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:53.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah me too.\n\n418\n00:21:53.749 --> 00:21:55.144\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n419\n00:21:55.144 --> 00:21:56.861\na lot of different aspects of that.\n\n420\n00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:57.581\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n421\n00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:58.530\nAll right very good.\n\n422\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.340\nSo we've got our discretionary\naccess control that we can use.\n\n423\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.342\nThat model we also have the model for\nour mandatory access control.\n\n424\n00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:07.000\nWhat does that leave us, Ronnie?\n\n425\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.820\nI know there's one more.\n\n426\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is one more,\nwhich is strange.\n\n427\n00:22:09.118 --> 00:22:13.430\nIt's the opposite of discretionary,\nnon-discretionary access control.\n\n428\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:18.250\nNow this one always threw me,\nbecause it really took me just a moment,\n\n429\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.990\nat the beginning when I started\nunderstanding permissions, right?\n\n430\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.890\nI said okay, so that's discretionary.\n\n431\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.170\nBut then when it comes down to\nnon-discretion access control, this is\n\n432\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.400\nwhere we use a system in place that's\nactually gonna be the same for everyone.\n\n433\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.200\nRegardless of their\nparticular permissions,\n\n434\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.480\nthey're still using the same system.\n\n435\n00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.100\nSo it's generic or\nwhat we call global in its scope.\n\n436\n00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.589\nNormally, it's based on a system of\neither rules that are in place or\n\n437\n00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:45.547\nthe idea of course,\nof different roles that are in place.\n\n438\n00:22:45.547 --> 00:22:49.020\nSo for\nexample let's take a look at my diagram.\n\n439\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.853\nI'm was gonna say let me\ngive you two examples but\n\n440\n00:22:50.853 --> 00:22:52.744\nshowing you the diagram\nis probably easier okay.\n\n441\n00:22:52.744 --> 00:22:55.050\nIf we take an example of a Firewall.\n\n442\n00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:00.560\nThis is a non-discretionary access control\ntype of system that we can have in place.\n\n443\n00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.470\nEvery package that passes through that\nFirewall, it has to go through that\n\n444\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.930\nfirewall and it has to go through\nthe rules that are in place.\n\n445\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.760\nIt doesn't matter if this is\nMike's data or Ronnie's data.\n\n446\n00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.380\nIt has to go through.\n\n447\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.930\nMike's data doesn't say hey, this is me,\nI'm gonna go around the firewall and\n\n448\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.530\njust do that instead.\n\n449\n00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.390\nIt has to be there, it has to go through.\n\n450\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.080\nSo that's what makes it mandatory,\nor non-discretionary.\n\n451\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.660\nIt's the same set of rules\nthat our data goes through.\n\n452\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.560\nSo, not based on individuals' wish or\ndesires, or\n\n453\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.560\neven of clearance level,\nit still has to go through there.\n\n454\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.120\nThe other part is if Mike and\n\n455\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.050\nI do have machines on the same\nActive Directory Network.\n\n456\n00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:45.075\nEven if Mike is president of the company\nand I'm just the janitor of the company.\n\n457\n00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:48.420\nWell when it comes down to logging\non to an Active Directory joined\n\n458\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.520\nmachine, guess what?\n\n459\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.050\nWe're still logging on, guess what?\n\n460\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.778\nOne Active Directory.\n\n461\n00:23:53.778 --> 00:23:57.834\nSo, Mike gives him a ton more of\nprivileges than what Ronnie the janitor\n\n462\n00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:00.471\nhas Same time it's still\nnot discretionary,\n\n463\n00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:04.740\nit's saying everybody's using\nthe active directory system.\n\n464\n00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:10.460\nSo one is based on roles,\nthe firewall here is based on rules.\n\n465\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.250\nSo that way it does make it\nnon-discretionary, where were saying hey,\n\n466\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.040\nthere's rules and the roles here.\n\n467\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.760\nDiscretionary says hey, Mike says I don't\nlike running so much, read or deny.\n\n468\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.240\nAnd that's the system that we have.\n\n469\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.120\nBut each of these is very\nimportant because one,\n\n470\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.280\nif you take a look at them, right.\n\n471\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.270\nThe idea of this non-discretionary,\nright, is really implementing\n\n472\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.200\nthe hard set type of controls that we\nwant to make sure everybody goes through.\n\n473\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.390\nThe discretionary gives us\nthat ability to be granular at\n\n474\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.270\nhow much do we want\nsomebody to get access to.\n\n475\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.280\nThe mandatory allows us to set\nclassification levels of what do\n\n476\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.230\nwe really want them to\nget access to as well.\n\n477\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.040\nAnd that way we can control\nit in that way too.\n\n478\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.700\nSo all these kind of really give\nus an overall security function\n\n479\n00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.930\nthat really helps us to protect in\nthat CIA triangle everything but\n\n480\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.950\nreally focusing in on the availability.\n\n481\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.631\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and when we first started\nthis we said there were three models and\n\n482\n00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:08.360\nI know some of us might\nhave been thinking,\n\n483\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.660\nwell, I wonder which one\nwe use in our organization.\n\n484\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.090\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nthere's a good chance that you're using\n\n485\n00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.440\nmore than one, if not all of these,\ndepending on where you're looking.\n\n486\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.940\nYou're probably using mandatory access\ncontrol, maybe, on certain documents.\n\n487\n00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.790\nOr you're using discretionary\naccess control for\n\n488\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.392\nyour file system, but non-discretionary\non your routers and on your firewalls.\n\n489\n00:25:31.392 --> 00:25:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so placement is also\nkey in defending network, and\n\n490\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.540\nwe talked about defense in\ndepth in an earlier episode,\n\n491\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.840\nin this particular section as\nwe covered it, is that idea.\n\n492\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.920\nIs that you'll probably see that that's\nwhat's happening, even if there's not some\n\n493\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.910\nformal security system there may be\ncertain documents where we go, yeah,\n\n494\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.450\nwe don't let that out to everybody.\n\n495\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.080\nAnd then, you're essentially kind of, even\nin your mind, saying that's top secret.\n\n496\n00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.650\n&gt;&gt; You're basically classifying it,\neven if you don't have a formal system,\n\n497\n00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.260\nyou are still going through some type\nof classification of that information.\n\n498\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's helps too.\n\n499\n00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:04.996\nAnd then making sure of just basic\nprotection, like what you're saying,\n\n500\n00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:05.687\nthat the firewall.\n\n501\n00:26:05.687 --> 00:26:10.316\nAnd then, for access into our systems,\nwe generally have the ability to have all\n\n502\n00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:14.538\nthat, as far as an active directory\nnetwork or some type of login system,\n\n503\n00:26:14.538 --> 00:26:17.245\nwhere it may be centralized in that way,\ntoo.\n\n504\n00:26:17.245 --> 00:26:21.920\nSo all these are great models and we've\ngiven you a couple of different examples\n\n505\n00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.740\nand talked about them quite a bit.\n\n506\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.850\nBut you really have to be familiar with\nall of them as you continue going.\n\n507\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.220\nAnd so you're going towards more advanced\ncertifications, learning these models and\n\n508\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:37.520\nthe depth that they can go into is\nreally going to be the key here.\n\n509\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.230\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nRonnie great look there at those different\n\n510\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.480\naccess control models that\nwe need to be familiar with,\n\n511\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.560\ndiscretionary, mandatory as\nwell as non-discretionary.\n\n512\n00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.730\nSo we appreciate that Ronnie.\n\n513\n00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.700\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n514\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.800\nSigning of for ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n515\n00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:16.370\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.640\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.020\ntoday we're doing our\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.820\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be comparing and\n\n8\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.450\ncontrasting some security\nrelated administration terms.\n\n9\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.280\nAnd who better to help us with\nthat than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.090\nWelcome back Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.560\nas we continue on to take a look\nat different terminology, right?\n\n13\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800\nWe've already spent,\nwell a couple of different episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.150\nreally talking about just some\nbasic security terminology.\n\n15\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.560\nAnd now we have to move into well kind\nof the administrative side of things.\n\n16\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.510\nMost of us when we first enter\ninto the realm of security,\n\n17\n00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.180\nwe never think about\nthe administrative side of things.\n\n18\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.690\nIt's always about, cool!\n\n19\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.935\nI'm learning about this new thing and\nthis new attack and\n\n20\n00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.630\nhow to block that new attack.\n\n21\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.394\nBut when it comes down to it Mike,\n\n22\n00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:04.554\nthe more that I get into the realm of\nsecurity, and the longer I've been in it,\n\n23\n00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:09.340\nthe more that I realize it's really more\nabout administration, that anything else.\n\n24\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.380\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and if your administration\nor your administrators and\n\n25\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.820\nthe people that are in the field, or doing\nthe actual work and on the front line,\n\n26\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.850\nif you're not talking the same language,\nif you're not using the same terms.\n\n27\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.610\nIt becomes really difficult to discuss\nproblems that you're having, or things or\n\n28\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.690\nplans you want to implement, and\nwhat we need to do to better protect our\n\n29\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.375\nenvironment, our data and\nour organization and our networks.\n\n30\n00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.205\nIt is very important that even on the\nadmin side of things, we are familiar with\n\n31\n00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:42.120\nthe terms and we understand the lingo,\nif you will, of security.\n\n32\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a great place for\nus to actually take a look at this, then,\n\n33\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.820\nis to contrast a couple\nof different terms.\n\n34\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.600\nAnd we're gonna kind of do six\ndifferent terms we're gonna contrast,\n\n35\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.744\njust two at a time, against each other.\n\n36\n00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:57.728\nAnd it's so that we understand what we're\nreally talking about and that we have,\n\n37\n00:01:57.728 --> 00:02:00.670\ncuz If not, you may be talking\nabout something to someone and\n\n38\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.753\nthey may not understand what\nyou're actually talking about.\n\n39\n00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:06.150\nAnd they may be thinking\nanother concept and\n\n40\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.488\none of the first concepts we really wanted\nto make sure that we address is gonna be\n\n41\n00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:13.520\nin the realm of anti virus\nmore than anything else.\n\n42\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.055\nNow, Mike,\nwhen you think about anti virus,\n\n43\n00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.305\nlet's not even put in our\nnetwork administration hat yet.\n\n44\n00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.555\nWhen you think about anti virus, what do\nyou normally think about when you say\n\n45\n00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:24.670\nsomebody needs antivirus\non their computer?\n\n46\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Well I think about just going and\ngetting the media and installing it\n\n47\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.650\nlocally on that machine so that'll protect\nthat one machine hopefully from Malware.\n\n48\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what I think\nabout anytime somebody says, hey,\n\n49\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.445\nwhat do I need to do to\nprotect my computer at home?\n\n50\n00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:41.150\nI'm like, hey, you need to download\nan antivirus program at home.\n\n51\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.680\nJust go out to the iInternet and\nmake sure you download a free one, and\n\n52\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.430\nI might make a recommendation or two\nabout which ones that I really like and\n\n53\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830\nhave used in the past.\n\n54\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.170\nAnd that's normally what we think about.\n\n55\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.230\nBut now when we get into\nthe realm of managing a network,\n\n56\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.360\nwe're really not talking about that a lot\nof times, as far as just making sure that\n\n57\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.890\nuser has antivirus on his computer and\nmaking sure they do that.\n\n58\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.540\nWe're really talking about making sure,\nwhat, that we have good coverage\n\n59\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.780\nof antivirus protection throughout\nour entire network as well.\n\n60\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.560\nSo there comes a contrast when\nyou start hearing two terms here.\n\n61\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.564\nThe network antivirus and\nof course the host antivirus.\n\n62\n00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:26.236\nAnd the one that we just described of\ncourse is the host antivirus where it's\n\n63\n00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:28.574\nreally on every individual machine.\n\n64\n00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:33.377\nAnd that's kind of where we like to see\nthe end result being, but now we also need\n\n65\n00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:37.860\nto just compare it against the idea\nof the network antivirus as well.\n\n66\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.440\nThey both do the same thing, right?\n\n67\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.010\nThe same thing that\nan antivirus really does.\n\n68\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.910\nIt allows you to be able to take files and\nexamine those files, and find it for\n\n69\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.410\nsome type of malicious software or\na pattern that it's looking for\n\n70\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.020\nto match up against as far\nas signature definitions.\n\n71\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.530\nBut in terms of both of them,\nthey do that.\n\n72\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.768\nAnd this is kinda the key.\n\n73\n00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:01.220\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n74\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.700\nI know for a long time, we've run,\n\n75\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.190\nwe've understood the importance of running\nantivirus on every single machine.\n\n76\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.102\nThat host-based antivirus,\nmost organizations implement that.\n\n77\n00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:15.560\nBut we have to keep in mind,\nit does protect just that one machine.\n\n78\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.443\nAnd what was happening is, let's say we\nget a worm or something on our system.\n\n79\n00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:24.777\nThere's nothing stopping that from\ntraveling around the network and\n\n80\n00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:28.402\nlooking for that one host that maybe\nsomebody has turned the antivirus off.\n\n81\n00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.390\nYou know or\nhasn't updated their latest definitions.\n\n82\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.600\nThere's nothing stopping that.\n\n83\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.469\nEach host is protected that's running the\nantivirus, but the network itself is not.\n\n84\n00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.980\nAnd that was kind of silly.\n\n85\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.810\nWhy let it run around on the network\nlooking for a vulnerable host?\n\n86\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.260\nLet's do it at both, let's look for\n\n87\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.100\nlet's run antivirus on the host,\nas well as at the network level.\n\n88\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.080\n&gt;&gt; And this is where most of us as we're\nentering into this cyber security world,\n\n89\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.920\nwhere we might get the confusion right.\n\n90\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.730\nThe very fact somebody may be\naddressing the idea of the host, but\n\n91\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.330\nthen you might have a security\nadministrator that's really talking about\n\n92\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.300\nthat idea of network based\ntypes of antivirus as well.\n\n93\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.291\nAnd there's really a couple of different\nones even at this network level that you\n\n94\n00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:10.239\ncan talk about to.\n\n95\n00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:14.798\nOne is the idea that the management of\nthe anti virus, the deployment of it,\n\n96\n00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:19.501\nmaking sure that every machine has it,\nbut also of course constantly scanning\n\n97\n00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:24.060\nthe entire network for\nsomething that is traveling like that.\n\n98\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.944\nAlso at that particular end of\nthe network antivirus is that ability to\n\n99\n00:05:28.944 --> 00:05:33.354\nmonitor data or traffic that is\ngoing in and out of our network.\n\n100\n00:05:33.354 --> 00:05:38.377\nAnd being able to spot the same type of\nanti or the same type of virus activity\n\n101\n00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:42.790\nas it enters into the network and\nas it leaves the network as well.\n\n102\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.130\nSo it can track it even at the perimeter.\n\n103\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.850\nSo both of them are good solutions that\nwe should have a good, firm grasp on.\n\n104\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.610\nAnd most of the time,\nespecially as your network gets bigger,\n\n105\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.395\nit should be implemented at that level.\n\n106\n00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.291\nEven though you could say, well I'm\nnot worried about it so much Mike,\n\n107\n00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.770\nbecause I know on every server,\nI'm running an antivirus.\n\n108\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.140\nI know on every single desktop,\nI'm running this.\n\n109\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.220\nBut the very fact that it's actually\ntravelling around in your network just\n\n110\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.450\nwaiting means there is a potential\naspect of this where it\n\n111\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.070\ncould infect a host before the antivirus\nhas a chance to turn on and do anything.\n\n112\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n113\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.210\nAn analogy you might\nuse to describe this is\n\n114\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.350\nis think about an office building right?\n\n115\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.450\nEach one of the offices in my\nbuilding has a door, has a lock.\n\n116\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.280\nSo I can lock my office,\nRonnie can lock his office.\n\n117\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.990\nBut we don't leave the front door to\nthe building itself wide open, right?\n\n118\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.630\nWe lock that as well.\n\n119\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.500\nSo you can look at the locks\non the individual offices\n\n120\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.820\nas the host-based type antivirus,\nprotecting the individual office.\n\n121\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.400\nBut then the building as a whole is\nalso protected with that front door and\n\n122\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.570\nthe lock and\nthe guard that I've placed there.\n\n123\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.950\nThen that's kind of like\nmy network based antivirus.\n\n124\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.720\nLet's not only protect each office but\n\n125\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.500\nlet's protect the corridors that\ntravel between the offices.\n\n126\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.060\n&gt;&gt; And it really is about that right.\n\n127\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.730\nThe more pathways that we allow for\n\n128\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.320\nthis malicious software to have we\ndon't know what else it's doing.\n\n129\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.750\nIs it gathering information?\n\n130\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.080\nIs it doing whatever\nit's sending back home?\n\n131\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.830\nSo what we want to do is make sure\nthat we have protection on both.\n\n132\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.300\nSometimes you will have where one company\nwill say I'm not gonna implement that.\n\n133\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.180\nI'm not gonna implement that.\n\n134\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.190\nWhich is fine.\n\n135\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.280\nThat's up to them and\ntheir security policy.\n\n136\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.940\nBut overall though, the use and\n\n137\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.770\ncombination of both really\ndoes need to exist.\n\n138\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.200\nI just remember that\nat the very beginning,\n\n139\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.860\nthat I would always, we actually had a\nfriend that worked with us in the company.\n\n140\n00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.509\nAnd he kind of raised a question,\nwhy don't we just get a network-based\n\n141\n00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.430\nanti-virus and not worry about putting\nthem on each individual machine?\n\n142\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.120\nAnd it was something that I\ndidn't think about at the time,\n\n143\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.270\ncuz I was really fairly\nnew to what we were doing.\n\n144\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.220\nAnd they said, well,\n\n145\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.189\nwhat if somebody brings in a thumb drive\nand plugs it right into that machine?\n\n146\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.627\nNow it's already affecting\nthat one machine,\n\n147\n00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:49.982\neven though the entire\nnetwork was protected.\n\n148\n00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:53.246\nAnd then, you take that machine and\nyou take it home,now it's infected.\n\n149\n00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:55.449\nAnd then you take that machine,\nyou put it back, or\n\n150\n00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.834\nyou transfer something to another machine\nusing USB You're infecting it that\n\n151\n00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.005\nway too, so\nwe have to think about all that stuff.\n\n152\n00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.882\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so we typically do, then,\n\n153\n00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:08.240\nsee a combination of these\nimplemented in our networks.\n\n154\n00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.422\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've got network-based\nversus host-based antivirus.\n\n156\n00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:16.460\nWhat other terms do we need to kinda\ncompare and contrast here, Ronnie?\n\n157\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.312\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to\nthe idea of security, right?\n\n158\n00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:23.734\nMost of it, like we said, is not really\nkind of the exciting James Bond-type of\n\n159\n00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:26.750\nstuff, where we're protecting the world.\n\n160\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:32.660\nBut the protection of our networks comes\ndown to something that, I am guilty of\n\n161\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:38.140\nthis, I find it completely boring, which\nis the idea of monitoring the network.\n\n162\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.230\nAnd there are people I know out there,\nprobably even watching right now,\n\n163\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.490\nthat love looking at logs.\n\n164\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.070\nMike, the idea here of looking at\nsecurity logs, what would you think?\n\n165\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.270\nIs that something exciting?\n\n166\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.780\nIs that appealing,\nlike Sports Illustrated?\n\n167\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.411\n&gt;&gt; It depends on my mood.\n\n168\n00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.166\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what my workload is.\n\n169\n00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:56.728\nIf somebody would pay me just to monitor\nlogs, maybe I'd get a little, but-\n\n170\n00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:57.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.870\n&gt;&gt; It's not the most exciting thing to do.\n\n172\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.280\nBut it is a very important\npart of security.\n\n173\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.988\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, watching this idea of the logs\nis really where we're gonna get\n\n174\n00:09:07.988 --> 00:09:13.193\nthe most beneficial information that\nwe can get from our security devices.\n\n175\n00:09:13.193 --> 00:09:18.200\nIs making sure that we have that\ninformation available to us.\n\n176\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.103\nThe key, of course,\nis not only monitoring those logs for\n\n177\n00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:24.905\nlive-time activity, but keeping\nhistorical track of those logs as well.\n\n178\n00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:28.850\nThat way,\nwe have a comparison basis that we can do.\n\n179\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.030\nNow, in this particular day and age,\nthere's a couple of different models.\n\n180\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.710\nAnd this is where the terminology\ngets a little bit skewy, here.\n\n181\n00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.320\nOne is what they call an agentless\ntype of monitoring system, or\n\n182\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.200\nprotection, if you want\nto call it that way.\n\n183\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.870\nAnd then there's an agent-based\ntype of monitoring system.\n\n184\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.030\nAnd it sounds simple enough to say,\nall right, one's agentless and\n\n185\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.170\none has an agent.\n\n186\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.860\nWell, that means that the one that's\nagentless doesn't have an agent.\n\n187\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.550\nThat's kinda circular reasoning.\n\n188\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.124\n&gt;&gt; And done,\nwe'll just check that one off our list.\n\n189\n00:10:01.124 --> 00:10:01.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n190\n00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:03.441\nwhat else do we have to know about it?\n\n191\n00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:05.890\nWhy should we even care?\n\n192\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.210\nAnd there are a couple of reasons that\nwe need to make sure that we understand.\n\n193\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.110\nIs there a difference between these two?\n\n194\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.461\nAnd there really is,\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n195\n00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:17.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we talk about those\nagentless systems, a lot of times, because\n\n196\n00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:22.493\nthere is no software to install, maybe\nthat the cost might be a little bit less.\n\n197\n00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:25.325\nAdministration, if there's\nnothing to install, so\n\n198\n00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:28.750\nas far as the administrator\ngoes it's a little bit easier.\n\n199\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.652\nBut it typically also means that I have\nto reach out and get that information,\n\n200\n00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:34.466\nbecause again, it's agentless.\n\n201\n00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.501\nThere is nothing on the other end\nthat's gonna be saying, hey, Mike,\n\n202\n00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:39.880\nyou need this information, here you go.\n\n203\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.760\nI have to reach out and touch it, and\ntalk to it, and retrieve the information.\n\n204\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.700\n&gt;&gt; And that's the key, is that you\nhave to be able to go out there.\n\n205\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.420\nAnd that means you have to have\na very good understanding of\n\n206\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.880\nhow those systems reach out and\nget that information back.\n\n207\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.450\nIf you've ever heard\nof anybody using SNMP,\n\n208\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.900\nthat's an agentless type of\nsystem that we're talking about.\n\n209\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.820\nOr even in the Windows world, that WMI.\n\n210\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.622\nAll that gives you is\nincredibly good information,\n\n211\n00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:09.520\ninformation that you need to know,\nbut you have to get it.\n\n212\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.804\nSo in other words, if you retrieve\neverything but what you want,\n\n213\n00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.665\nthat's not the agentless' fault.\n\n214\n00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's keeping it,\n\n215\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.068\nthey're saying,\nof course I have that information.\n\n216\n00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:21.580\nAnd you're sort of going, well,\nwhy didn't you give it to me?\n\n217\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.300\nHe's like, you didn't ask.\n\n218\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.623\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you didn't ask, right?\n\n219\n00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:24.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you didn't ask.\n\n220\n00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:24.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n221\n00:11:24.823 --> 00:11:28.318\nthis must be a funny story about my dad,\nbut that's a different story.\n\n222\n00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:29.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But overall, though,\n\n223\n00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.840\nthis is one of those situations\nwhere you have to realize that,\n\n224\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.750\nis that agentless type of\nmonitoring system is insanely good.\n\n225\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.995\nIt does take less overhead.\n\n226\n00:11:39.995 --> 00:11:42.870\nYou don't have to worry about these\ndevices constantly reporting.\n\n227\n00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.030\nAnd you go out and you retrieve\nthe information that you want.\n\n228\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.720\nBut also,\n\n229\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.650\nin the agentless aspect of this, you\nmay not get every detail that you need.\n\n230\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.128\nBut if you move into the agent-based type\nof world, though, you have that, and\n\n231\n00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:58.755\nyou have kind of the opposite\nof what Mike was talking about.\n\n232\n00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:02.293\nNow you have an agent that's really\nwatching out and saying, yeah,\n\n233\n00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:03.460\nI'm noticing stuff.\n\n234\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.370\nMaybe y'all should check this out.\n\n235\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.850\nAnd now you might have more functionality,\nyou might have more capabilities\n\n236\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.400\non that agent-based system, because it's\nin constant communication and contact.\n\n237\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\na lot of times more configurable as well,\n\n238\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.500\nas far as what we're retrieving and\nwhat information it's gathering.\n\n239\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.809\nSometimes with the agentless\nsystems it's the hardware vendor\n\n240\n00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:26.568\nthat placed that SNMP agent on there,\nor was it the MIB.\n\n241\n00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:30.708\nThey've decided what information\ntheir device is gonna collect, and\n\n242\n00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.856\nthen you have to just go retrieve it.\n\n243\n00:12:32.856 --> 00:12:36.591\nWhereas an agent-based system,\nI install software on there.\n\n244\n00:12:36.591 --> 00:12:39.574\nAnd I might be able to go in and\nconfigure and tweak what it's collecting,\n\n245\n00:12:39.574 --> 00:12:42.089\nwhat it's not collecting,\nhow often it's sending it back.\n\n246\n00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:45.607\nAnd things like this, so a lot of times,\nas you say, a more powerful,\n\n247\n00:12:45.607 --> 00:12:47.140\nmore robust system.\n\n248\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once you get all that information\nand you send it to some type of monitoring\n\n249\n00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:55.058\nanalysis, you really will\nget more robust information.\n\n250\n00:12:55.058 --> 00:13:00.420\nYou'll get more details behind it, because\nthat agent is really watching for you.\n\n251\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.497\nYou're essentially saying, I want you to\nmake sure you're actively monitoring this.\n\n252\n00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:05.210\nWhereas a agentless is saying,\n\n253\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.020\nI'm gathering all the information, you\njust have to know exactly what to ask me.\n\n254\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.968\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and another good thing with\ndifference between agentless versus agent\n\n255\n00:13:12.968 --> 00:13:15.370\nis that ability to dynamically react,\nright?\n\n256\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.055\nLike in an agent-based system,\n\n257\n00:13:17.055 --> 00:13:19.722\nI was just trying to give\na good example we could use.\n\n258\n00:13:19.722 --> 00:13:22.780\nIt might be something like\nin the Windows environment,\n\n259\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.750\nwe have our System Center, right?\n\n260\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.003\nOperations Manager, and\na few other that they have,\n\n261\n00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:33.498\nwhere we install software on those nodes,\non the end-user's devices.\n\n262\n00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:38.529\nAnd let's say they install some software\nthat's not approved, it can let us know.\n\n263\n00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:41.819\nOr we can retrieve lists of installed\nproducts and what they're doing.\n\n264\n00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:45.643\nAnd it's because that agent is constantly\nrunning, constantly monitoring, and\n\n265\n00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:49.550\nhas a central collection point that\nthey can send that information back to.\n\n266\n00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is kind\nof the understanding here\n\n267\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.470\nthat your policy is gonna\ndictate which one that you get.\n\n268\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.300\nBut a lot of times,\npeople are very confused about whether or\n\n269\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.630\nnot they should run this versus that.\n\n270\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.540\nIt really depends on how you want\nto retrieve the information,\n\n271\n00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.910\nhow much information you really need.\n\n272\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.320\nCan you be overwhelmed by\ninformation from an agent?\n\n273\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.420\nYeah, you'd better believe it.\n\n274\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.380\nIt's very easy to sit there and go,\nwow, it dumped a lot of information.\n\n275\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.750\nAnd trying to weed through it and\n\n276\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.860\nfind exactly what you want can\nbe an overwhelming challenge.\n\n277\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.020\nBut at the same time, it's either that or\n\n278\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.840\nsaying, I know exactly what information\nI need, so I'm gonna go in there and\n\n279\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.900\nmake sure I grab just that\npiece of information.\n\n280\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.800\nBut it has to be due diligence that\nreally helps us to do that as well.\n\n281\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.920\nBut these are some of the things,\nand monitoring,\n\n282\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.410\nlike I said, is not my strong suit.\n\n283\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.390\nBecause I might look at it once and\ngo, wow, that's interesting.\n\n284\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.970\nBut then tomorrow I'm going, I'm looking\nat the same thing, and the numbers and\n\n285\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.310\nthe letters start blurring\ntogether the lines.\n\n286\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.290\nBut that's the way that that happens.\n\n287\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.475\nBut with those new types\nof analysis tools,\n\n288\n00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:55.120\nthey can really make it more graphical,\nand try and put it more in context.\n\n289\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you hit\nthe nail on the head there,\n\n290\n00:14:57.671 --> 00:15:01.990\nwith some of that where you talked\nabout overwhelmed with information.\n\n291\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.600\nLog files get generated by\njust about everything now.\n\n292\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.460\nWhich is very good, but\nit's a lot of information,\n\n293\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.370\nand a lot of it is just that,\nit's just information.\n\n294\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.285\nThis service started, this service\nshut down, so it's success messages.\n\n295\n00:15:15.285 --> 00:15:19.276\nWeeding through it, finding the important\ninformation, the anomalies,\n\n296\n00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:20.656\nthat can be challenging.\n\n297\n00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:24.939\nAnd that's really where our next terms,\nI think, come into play, when we look at\n\n298\n00:15:24.939 --> 00:15:29.520\ndealing with that vast amounts, or\nthose massive amounts of information.\n\n299\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking about the idea\nof SEI on the security information and\n\n300\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.030\nevent monitoring system, is what we're\ntalking about, as well as log collection.\n\n301\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.650\nSo let's deal with the idea of log\ncollection at the very beginning.\n\n302\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.590\nWe were talking about the idea\nof being overwhelmed by logs,\n\n303\n00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.980\nand I really hate looking at them.\n\n304\n00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.323\nBut when you have that information,\nyou have to, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:52.908\nAs a security professional, as\nan administrator, being able to spot this\n\n306\n00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:57.348\ninformation and getting the most\ninformation that you want to, is gonna\n\n307\n00:15:57.348 --> 00:16:01.932\ncome from that idea of making sure you\ncollect them from all your systems But\n\n308\n00:16:01.932 --> 00:16:06.418\nonce you do that, it now takes diligence\nagain to go through those logs.\n\n309\n00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:10.975\nI was talking to Don about it one time, he\nsaid that, he knew that at the bank that\n\n310\n00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:15.400\nhe ended up working at in Seattle several\nyears ago that on Tuesday mornings,\n\n311\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.560\nthat's all he was gonna do that morning\nuntil lunch time, which was examine logs.\n\n312\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.426\nAnd I was like,\n\n313\n00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:25.294\nI would have cried if I knew that my\nTuesday morning was penciled in and\n\n314\n00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:29.918\nall that I was doing was log examination\nof the machines that you're monitoring.\n\n315\n00:16:29.918 --> 00:16:35.400\nSo, you can get overwhelmed very\neasily but it has to happen.\n\n316\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.550\nAnd there are many\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n317\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.222\nYou can manually go to\nevery single system,\n\n318\n00:16:39.222 --> 00:16:41.450\nall right, let me retrieve that log.\n\n319\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.390\nLet me retrieve that log.\n\n320\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.040\nOr, you can use some type\nof log collection system\n\n321\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.760\nwhich gives you the ability to gather\nfrom every single system that you have.\n\n322\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.330\nBut then again, you now have a bunch\nof these different log files\n\n323\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.250\nthat also must be examined as well.\n\n324\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.600\nThe problem with having individual\ndisparate files is simple, is that\n\n325\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.090\none system may indicate, let's just\nsay take two redundant systems, right?\n\n326\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.850\nWhat if you have a redundancy and\nwhatever security lies?\n\n327\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.330\nOne system says, there's a problem,\nthe other one says, no.\n\n328\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.480\nEverything's good.\n\n329\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.970\nWhich one do you trust, Mike?\n\n330\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, flip a coin.\n\n331\n00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:14.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Throw a dart at them and\n\n332\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.320\nsee which one sticks, I don't know.\n\n333\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so at that point,\nyou're saying, the logs,\n\n334\n00:17:18.615 --> 00:17:20.353\nthey're saying two different things.\n\n335\n00:17:20.353 --> 00:17:23.234\nIs that an anomaly on the machine or\ndid something really happen and\n\n336\n00:17:23.234 --> 00:17:25.190\nthis guys not paying attention?\n\n337\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.760\nWell, it doesn't give you the context and\nthat's the problem of what you have.\n\n338\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.820\nSo, now you've examined those two and\nthen you go on, and\n\n339\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.690\nlet's say it's four hours later and\nthen you find now another anomaly but\n\n340\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.210\nit took you four hours before\nyou were able to discover that.\n\n341\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.080\nBecause the context wasn't there.\n\n342\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.890\nDiscover one thing and\nyou kinda set it aside and then,\n\n343\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.360\nyou went to look at something else and\nfinally after four hours you get that.\n\n344\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:46.969\nSo what helps you out?\n\n345\n00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, if we only had a way to bring\nall these logs together and kinda analyze\n\n346\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.360\nthem as a whole, is there, can we come up\nwith something that will do that for us?\n\n347\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's called SIEM, right?\n\n348\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:03.860\nThe security information and event\nmonitoring system that are out there.\n\n349\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.710\nAnd there are plenty of great\nones that are out there.\n\n350\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.460\nAnd even free ones are becoming\nmuch better at doing this.\n\n351\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.870\nAnd this is what sets everything in\ncontext of what Mike is talking about.\n\n352\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.435\nNot just looking at an individual device\nlog and like we said, it was redundant.\n\n353\n00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:21.580\nIt goes, this is bad, this one's good,\nwhich one do you trust?\n\n354\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.620\nAnd then, realizing later on, crap,\nI need to go back and reexamine that.\n\n355\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.730\nBut now you can have the full picture and\nSEIM really helps us do that.\n\n356\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.640\n&gt;&gt; It does and then today's when we're\ntalking about security in today's\n\n357\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.770\nnetworks, it's rare than an attack,\n\n358\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.010\na breach, or anything like\nthat takes place on one nerve.\n\n359\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or only affects that one device, right?\n\n360\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.010\nThe attack started somewhere\nstarted out there in your DMC or\n\n361\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.930\non your outside facing interfaces.\n\n362\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.444\nThey're coming through your firewalls,\n\n363\n00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:50.700\nthey're compromising\na machine on your DMC.\n\n364\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.178\nThey're leapfrogging or\npivoting from there and\n\n365\n00:18:53.178 --> 00:18:55.810\nthey're getting into the internal network.\n\n366\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.300\nAnd now they're hitting servers there and\n\n367\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.890\nthen they're doing FTP bounces\noff that to other machines.\n\n368\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.630\nAnd so,\nin order to understand the attack and\n\n369\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.230\nprotect my network from that attack,\nI need to see all that information.\n\n370\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.940\nBut if I'm just looking at that\none file server's log files,\n\n371\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.060\nI don't see the rest of it.\n\n372\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.977\nSo, being able to correlate those logs and\ntying events together and\n\n373\n00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:19.151\nseeing that, hey,\n30 seconds after this happened,\n\n374\n00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:23.898\nthis happened on a completely separate\nsystem and a completely separate log file.\n\n375\n00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:27.067\nBut using these seam systems,\nbringing it all together,\n\n376\n00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:29.395\nI can start putting\nthe pieces together and\n\n377\n00:19:29.395 --> 00:19:33.900\nseeing the big picture rather than that\npinhole view of one system at a time.\n\n378\n00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.970\n&gt;&gt; And that, that is kind of the, for\nus, where we differentiate between that\n\n379\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.480\nlog collection and\nthen of course, the idea of SCIM.\n\n380\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.560\nSCIM really does give us\nthe context of what's happening or\n\n381\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.320\nas the log collection, it gives\neverybody together which is great but\n\n382\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.210\nthen, we get them talking\nthrough using some like SCIM.\n\n383\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.370\nSo, being an administrator in terms of\nsecurity requires us to understand that,\n\n384\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.890\nthat do we have a system that\nanalyzes the logs that we have?\n\n385\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.220\nIf not, thinking about SCIM is gonna\nbe an important concept and step.\n\n386\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.800\nUnderstanding how we get the information,\nright?\n\n387\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.520\nWhether or not it's agentless or\nagent-based?\n\n388\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.330\nAnd if it's agentless,\nmaking sure we ask the right questions.\n\n389\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.160\nDo we get everything that we need or\nwe still waiting on information?\n\n390\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.260\nAre you sure you got everything?\n\n391\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.610\nIf not, go back and\nlet's query that system again.\n\n392\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.050\nAnd, of course, understanding just the\nprotections that we have on hand, of how\n\n393\n00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.950\nthat's going to be administrated, as well\nas what it protects is also a key idea.\n\n394\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:32.420\nAnd those are, at least at the beginning\nhere, right, of understanding\n\n395\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.560\nthe idea of security administrations\nthat we have to be familiar with.\n\n396\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\nanother great look there.\n\n397\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.500\nWe appreciate that, your insight and\nto some other terminology\n\n398\n00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.640\nagain that we need to be familiar\nwith as a security admin.\n\n399\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.870\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n400\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.480\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n401\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.670\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n402\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.700\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n403\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.440\n&gt;&gt; And, we'll see you next time.\n\n404\n00:20:55.391 --> 00:21:01.392\n[MUSIC]\n\n405\n00:21:01.392 --> 00:21:04.271\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.005\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.187\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:17.200\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.150\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are moving on with more\n\n7\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.760\non our Cisco cyber security\nfundamental series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.080\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.125\nwho else would it be than\nnone other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.180\nRonnie, welcome back my man.\n\n11\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.000\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.650\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.650\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue on talking about some\n\n14\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.895\nof the different security concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.415\nAnd today we're really focussing\non the realm of, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.845\nsecurity management concepts.\n\n17\n00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:46.975\nNow, if you're taking a look at\nthe entire list of different concepts,\n\n18\n00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:51.385\nwe've defined and described a lot\nof different security concepts.\n\n19\n00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.025\nAt the very beginning of this particular\nsection on the exam as far as\n\n20\n00:00:56.025 --> 00:01:00.980\ndomain objectives go, we really\ndescribed just basic security concepts.\n\n21\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.450\nThen in another episode we also took\na look of course about administrative or\n\n22\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.250\nsecurity administrative concepts as well.\n\n23\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640\nAnd today we're taking a look\nat management concepts.\n\n24\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.150\nRemember that when we start implementing\ndifferent types of controls and\n\n25\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.670\nwhen we start to do different things.\n\n26\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.020\nThey occur at different\nlevels in this way, right,\n\n27\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.220\nas far as a hierarchy goes, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.840\nWhen you talk about administrative,\nor security administration,\n\n29\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.990\nnormally this is where decisions are made\nof what's actually gonna be done,\n\n30\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.190\nand how much of this do\nwe have to get done?\n\n31\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.650\nAnd then once it actually\nmake that decision,\n\n32\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.320\nit then passes through\nmanagement at some point.\n\n33\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.130\nManagers now say, all right, Daniel,\nyou are gonna end up doing this.\n\n34\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.745\nAnd then Daniel actually implements those\ntechnical controls himself unless Daniel's\n\n35\n00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:46.908\nactually at a higher level.\n\n36\n00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:49.200\nAnd he says, Ronnie,\nyou're gonna do this instead.\n\n37\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.176\nBut that's essentially what you have is\nyou have kind of an unusual hierarchy of\n\n38\n00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.982\nthe chain of command, or\na chain of operations that goes on.\n\n39\n00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:01.450\nAnd today we're kinda talking about that\nmiddle layer, and the idea of managing.\n\n40\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.885\nThe administration, right,\nwhen we took a look at those terms,\n\n41\n00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:05.224\nwe're really talking about logs.\n\n42\n00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.319\nAnd certain things that you\nhave to be able to understand,\n\n43\n00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.810\nwhen you start implementing, and whether\nyou're gonna choose to do this or that.\n\n44\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.550\nVersus host or\nnetwork types of anti-virus solutions.\n\n45\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.984\nBut management is essentially the one that\nsays all right, it needs to get done,\n\n46\n00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:21.356\nwho am I going to get to assign it and\nthen they monitor and\n\n47\n00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.242\nverify the things that\nare going to happen.\n\n48\n00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:27.444\nAnd what needs to happen to make that you\nknow, a reality as what we start seeing.\n\n49\n00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:32.550\nSo today, we're gonna focus in on those\nconcepts and describing them for us.\n\n50\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.543\nAnd it is part of a very important\nprocess so that everyone throughout our\n\n51\n00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:40.678\norganization especially on the security\ninfrastructure side of things.\n\n52\n00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:44.210\nAnd in cyber security,\nthat they're all on the same page.\n\n53\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.130\nNobody is out of step with anybody else.\n\n54\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.828\nAnd that's what we're really focusing in\non, making sure that we understand all\n\n55\n00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:53.035\nthree of those concepts\nwhen we start to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.535\nAt a technical error where\nthe implementation happens,\n\n57\n00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:59.022\nDaniel is actually going to be the one\nthat configures, and puts it into place,\n\n58\n00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:02.062\nverify it's working, and\nthen he will reports back to the manager.\n\n59\n00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:04.957\nIt's done, manager says prove\nto me that it's done, and\n\n60\n00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:08.326\nDaniel goes and no says all right\nbring up the management console and\n\n61\n00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:11.730\nnow he starts to see the information\ncome across his desk.\n\n62\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.980\nAdministration then goes back\nto management and says what?\n\n63\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.230\nAll right, so is it done?\n\n64\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.590\nIt's done,\nthis is what report I need to see.\n\n65\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.160\nManager says, all right, let me go and\n\n66\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.840\nmake sure that I can\nactually pull those up.\n\n67\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.610\nAnd then we start sending\nreports that way as well.\n\n68\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.123\nSo there's a whole chain of events\nthat go on in the realm of cyber\n\n69\n00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:33.680\nsecurity that's not just about\nbeing the guy that does the stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.330\nIt's about making sure that\nthe entire organization fits and\n\n71\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.840\nunderstands what's going on.\n\n72\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.290\nAnd for us today we're focusing\nin of course on this idea\n\n73\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.230\nof these management concepts.\n\n74\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.446\nSo, when it comes down to management,\n\n75\n00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:49.074\nsome of the things that\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n76\n00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:53.447\nAnd one of the things that I've emphasized\nreally even from the very beginning of\n\n77\n00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:57.754\nthis course, is talking about the nature\nof security is that you can only really\n\n78\n00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:01.310\nsecure what you know about and\nwhat you see in your organization.\n\n79\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.230\nSo is there a possibility at times, and\nI'm going to pick on Daniel here for\n\n80\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.870\na moment because he worked for\na large organization.\n\n81\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.273\nDaniel, is there a possibility that you\nmight think that you've done every thing\n\n82\n00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:15.625\npossible, and then you find out that\nthere's a system that's just been sitting\n\n83\n00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.952\nout there that you might not know about\nbecause there's thousands of devices.\n\n84\n00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:22.030\n&gt;&gt; What's funny is,\nRonny asked, is it possible?\n\n85\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.260\nNot only is it possible, but\nit's likely that this is happening.\n\n86\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.900\nIn larger organizations,\nlarger entities, things get overlooked,\n\n87\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.000\nnot everything is checked,\nnot everything is known about.\n\n88\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.560\nNew people come in,\nolder people leave, and with them,\n\n89\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.010\nthe knowledge that those systems exists or\nare in place, or something like that, so.\n\n90\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.925\nThis is something that\nhappens all the time.\n\n91\n00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:44.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah with it happening all the time,\nand you're realizing that right?\n\n92\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.860\nNow here it is two months later and\n\n93\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.360\nnow you're told,\nyeah did you check on this system?\n\n94\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.950\nI know it's been around for a long\ntime but I didn't even think about it.\n\n95\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.070\nAnd you go wait, that system's\nbeen unsecured this whole time and\n\n96\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.440\nwe didn't even know it existed and you're\ntelling me it's operational right now?\n\n97\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.280\nYes [LAUGH], that's exactly what we mean.\n\n98\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.060\nSo how do you defend against that?\n\n99\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.155\nHow do you secure something like that?\n\n100\n00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:07.700\nWell, you can't.\n\n101\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.570\nAnd this is where management steps in,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.520\nAs far as management concepts go,\n\n103\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.420\nwe need to have the ability now to talk\nabout that idea of asset management.\n\n104\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.750\nIt really is key and fundamental.\n\n105\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.501\nIf we are responsible for\nthe security devices and\n\n106\n00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:29.056\nthe security implementations\ncontrols that are out there,\n\n107\n00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:32.996\nthat we have to know what\nassets that we have in hand.\n\n108\n00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:37.080\nAnd we also have to be able to\nmanage those assets very well.\n\n109\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.490\nAnd this comes into the realm\nthen of inventory tracking or\n\n110\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.620\nasset tracking if we wanna call it that.\n\n111\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.790\nMaking sure that we\nunderstand this concept.\n\n112\n00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.410\nAnd Cisco,\nas well as other security vendors.\n\n113\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.020\nThey say, we need to understand\nthe idea of 100% visibility, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.930\nThat we know all the devices\nthat we are in charge of.\n\n115\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.610\nSo that we can make sure that every\nsingle one of them is protected.\n\n116\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.933\nIt is those hidden kind of devices that\nare out there that we really worry about,\n\n117\n00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:07.911\nbecause we don't know what\nthe vulnerabilities are.\n\n118\n00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.968\nAnd so we need to have a method of\ndiscovering all those different things.\n\n119\n00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:13.330\nAnd when it comes out to it,\n\n120\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.560\nasset management is one of the first\nthings that you have to bring into play.\n\n121\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.102\nNow there's a lot of different\nsoftware that helps us to be able to\n\n122\n00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:25.470\ntrack inventory as we need to do.\n\n123\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.090\nBut sometimes its a manual process, right?\n\n124\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.710\nHopefully its not when the organization\nis big as what Daniel work for\n\n125\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.190\nbefore it take weeks if not months for\nthem to track down every single device.\n\n126\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.741\nThat was even in just the one\nbuilding he was in better yet\n\n127\n00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:41.249\nall the branch offices that\nyou had to kinda go across.\n\n128\n00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.950\nIn the state of Florida there.\n\n129\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.431\nIt would just be just about impossible.\n\n130\n00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:49.170\nBut it could take months before all\nthat information is gathered together.\n\n131\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.170\nAnd then there's some type of\nassessment that we can do that.\n\n132\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.630\nSo instead, a lot of the software that's\nout there today gives us this ability to\n\n133\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.420\nmaybe be able to put some type of agent\non there so that we can start tracking.\n\n134\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.540\nWe send that out and go, hey all this\nneeds to be put on every device that we\n\n135\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.970\ncan and\nthen to start sending back information.\n\n136\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.700\nAnd now we can tag that device and\n\n137\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.270\nbe able to find out\nthe information that we need to.\n\n138\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.550\nHaving that complete visibility\nis one of the first steps and\n\n139\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.650\nthat we can actually make sure that\nwe have the ability to control.\n\n140\n00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.090\nNow even though that's a possibility,\n\n141\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.950\nwe could do it with an Excel\nspreadsheet if we wanted to,\n\n142\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.290\nthe manual process is now going back and\nreviewing all that sounds insane.\n\n143\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.720\nI wouldn't want to do it but\nwould I do it if I had to?\n\n144\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.100\nYes, absolutely would.\n\n145\n00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.523\nBut the other thing you need to do with\nthat asset manager now is go back through\n\n146\n00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.830\nand do that type of analysis\nthat we're talking about.\n\n147\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.570\nSo we can have the ability to have\nsome type of analytical insight.\n\n148\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.810\nThat's kind of like key terms here,\nthat you also want.\n\n149\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.878\nAsset management not only provides\ncomplete 100% visibility.\n\n150\n00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:56.012\nBut also some insights into the\nutilization of the asset a lot of times.\n\n151\n00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:59.174\nWhy is that one device is\nstill functioning when\n\n152\n00:07:59.174 --> 00:08:01.950\nit is only being use once every ten weeks.\n\n153\n00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.048\nWhy do we need to worry about?\n\n154\n00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:06.627\nWhy can't we just turn that thing off\nif we know that's not being used but\n\n155\n00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:07.280\nonce a year?\n\n156\n00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.270\nAnd also, it gives us the ability\nto think about the idea here of\n\n157\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.810\ncapacity as far as managing in\nthe security that we have to worry about.\n\n158\n00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.590\nSometimes you end up finding out that\ncertain devices are just left on,\n\n159\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.540\nbecause nobody has\nthe will to turn it off.\n\n160\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.070\nAnd even if one person is\nthe only person that's using it,\n\n161\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.480\ninstead of turning it off,\nwe just kinda leave it.\n\n162\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.640\nBecause we know the last\ntime somebody turned it off,\n\n163\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.430\nthere was a big fuss that went on.\n\n164\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.720\nAnd I remember doing this actually\nat a site I was sent to, to go and\n\n165\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.115\nkind of help build the infrastructure.\n\n166\n00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:40.935\nThere was a server that was left on and\n\n167\n00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.476\nI finally went around to\nevery single individual.\n\n168\n00:08:43.476 --> 00:08:45.928\nAnd I said, who is using this server?\n\n169\n00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:48.790\nAnd this is what was on it and\nI told them what was on it.\n\n170\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.750\nAnd then one guy piped up, he said,\nyeah, I'm still using that system.\n\n171\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.360\nI was like, what is the system from?\n\n172\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.290\nAnd he told me, and\nit was like this and that.\n\n173\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.010\nI said, how often do you use it?\n\n174\n00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.680\nHe's like,\nI haven't used it in about a year.\n\n175\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.880\nI said, do you still need it?\n\n176\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.275\nAnd he said, well, I can potentially\npull things off of it if I wanted to.\n\n177\n00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:09.520\nSo, I was like, all right, so,\nwhen do you, and he kept explaining.\n\n178\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.400\nSo finally, I just, this is not\nsomething you should do, Daniel, or\n\n179\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.210\nanybody should do, but I did it.\n\n180\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.480\nI just turned it off, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.930\nFor the whole week I was there,\nI just went, turned it off.\n\n182\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.930\nAnd I said, he didn't even notice it\nwas off, so I kind of left it off.\n\n183\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.350\nAnd I told somebody, I said, if he wants\nit back on, turn it back on for him,\n\n184\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.140\nbut turn it off afterwards.\n\n185\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.870\nIt was running some insanely\nold piece of software.\n\n186\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.950\nAnd then, of course,\nthe operating system hadn't been updated.\n\n187\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.650\nI was like, we shouldn't let\nthat thing on the network.\n\n188\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.350\nBut yeah, you [LAUGH] can do\nstuff like that, not good.\n\n189\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.431\n&gt;&gt; I could see a group\npolicy on that computer-\n\n190\n00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:40.625\n&gt;&gt; You can [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:44.764\n&gt;&gt; Saying, if no one clicks this, do not\nturn off button within x amount of time,\n\n192\n00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:46.155\nshut this computer down.\n\n193\n00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:49.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it is, it's kind of a big thing.\n\n194\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.319\nBut asset management is\nreally that important, okay?\n\n195\n00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:54.330\nSo for us, that's kind of the key.\n\n196\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.390\nThe other thing, especially about asset\nmanagement that really helps out big\n\n197\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.130\norganizations is the idea of the end of\nlife policies that we might have in place.\n\n198\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.970\nIt's easy, when I first started, to think,\n\n199\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.488\nyou don't replace computers until you\njust can't make them run anymore.\n\n200\n00:10:07.488 --> 00:10:11.210\nBut organizations that have\nthis replacement policy, right?\n\n201\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.630\nWhere they go ahead and\nthey life cycle through things and\n\n202\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.420\nthey make sure that everybody\nhas the fairly decent equipment.\n\n203\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.160\nThey do, but\nhow do you keep track of that?\n\n204\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.386\nWhen stuff was replaced,\nwhen it wasn't replaced,\n\n205\n00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:24.660\nwhat needs to be coming up to be replaced?\n\n206\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.420\nWell, the idea of asset management\nhelps us to do that as well.\n\n207\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.580\nSo you pick out a good piece of software\nthat allows you to do all of that and\n\n208\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.070\nthen gives you that control.\n\n209\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.240\nCisco, of course, has their particular\none that they love for you to look at.\n\n210\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.070\nAnd they call it\nthe Cisco Asset Management.\n\n211\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.300\nIt's a gigantic tool, but the limitation\nthere, right, is Cisco's, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.700\nAnd that means, as long as they're\nCisco devices, it works very great,\n\n213\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.860\nvery much so.\n\n214\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.890\nBut at the same time, what about all\nyour other devices that are non-Cisco.\n\n215\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.740\nSo, you may go out and think about\nthat aspect of a management concept.\n\n216\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.740\nBecause without the 100% visibility,\nyou really don't\n\n217\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.402\nknow how much of the network that\nyou are really protecting, right?\n\n218\n00:11:07.402 --> 00:11:11.110\nBecause you don't have a clue how\nbig your network really might be.\n\n219\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.660\nAnd it's just one of those shocking\ndays that you come in and there it is,\n\n220\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.750\nDaniel, somebody brings you a computer,\nand you turn it on, and it's Windows 98.\n\n221\n00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.940\nAnd you go, where was this computer from?\n\n222\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.420\nDownstairs.\n\n223\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.202\nWas it plugged to a network?\n\n224\n00:11:23.202 --> 00:11:24.420\nYeah.\n\n225\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.048\nGreat.\n\n226\n00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:29.750\n&gt;&gt; I'd start looking for rootkits.\n\n227\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's the day that you kind of shiver\n\n228\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.899\na little bit on your networking lot.\n\n229\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.980\nWhere did it come from and you're like is\nnot on anything that I have listed here,\n\n230\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.680\nit kind of gives you a little\nbit of a chill, it really does.\n\n231\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.760\nSo it very important for\nus to think about this concept and\n\n232\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.610\nthis idea of understanding why it's\nan important aspect that we have.\n\n233\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.770\nOkay?\n\n234\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.343\nSo there's one [INAUDIBLE] making sure\nthat we understand all the inventory and\n\n235\n00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:59.970\nthe devices that we have on there.\n\n236\n00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.790\nThe second one, of course, especially when\nwe head into the realm of routers and\n\n237\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.960\nswitches and firewalls and\nthese network security devices,\n\n238\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.770\nis the configurations on\nthose devices as well, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:18.075\nSome of them are incredibly complex and\nthere are some router configurations.\n\n240\n00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:23.145\nI kid you not, that if your printout is\npage after page after page after page and\n\n241\n00:12:23.145 --> 00:12:24.315\nto look through all of them and\n\n242\n00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:28.425\nrealize that maybe changing something in\none of those pages could absolutely throw\n\n243\n00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:32.965\nyou off, losing that config\ncould be incredibly devastating.\n\n244\n00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:34.595\nIt has to be recreated at some point.\n\n245\n00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:37.370\nAt least time element is another one.\n\n246\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.430\nBut being able to keep track of them and\nknowing where they go is a key.\n\n247\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.300\nFor us it's simple.\n\n248\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.330\nWe have a shared folder where when we\nmake network change configurations,\n\n249\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.580\nwe all dump it into that\none network folder.\n\n250\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.500\nAnd we clearly label it,\nlike here is the device that was changed.\n\n251\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.060\nWe try and keep a small log and in our\nsystem, because it is relatively small,\n\n252\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.245\nwe really only send it out to the people\nthat worked on the network itself.\n\n253\n00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:05.280\nLike, Nate made a firewall change today.\n\n254\n00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.130\nAnd that's really only sent to me and\nto a couple of other people.\n\n255\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.390\nJust to make sure that somebody\nknows in the background.\n\n256\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.320\nIf there are changes that are made again\nat the router or at the switch, or\n\n257\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.690\nwhatever it might be, we make sure\nthat all that's kind of noted and\n\n258\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.125\ndocumented as well,\nas far as the configuration changes go.\n\n259\n00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.660\nBack-ups of course,\n\n260\n00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.880\nare also key to tracking all\nthose back-ups, where are they.\n\n261\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.920\nAnd that's just in case any\nof us are actually out,\n\n262\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.800\nor all of us happen to be out,\nthat we can point someone to as well.\n\n263\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.320\nSo, it's a great thing when we have some\ntype of device that helps us out too, or\n\n264\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.930\nsome type of software.\n\n265\n00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.490\nCisco has one, they're called\nthe Cisco Prime Network Change and\n\n266\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.850\nConfiguration Manager.\n\n267\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.990\nQuite a mouthful.\n\n268\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.720\nYou don't tend to find the product page\nfor it too, cuz I was just looking for\n\n269\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.210\nit right before the show here.\n\n270\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.900\nBut they do, you might just hear it\ncalled Cisco Prime a lot of times, say.\n\n271\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.705\nWhere it gives you\nthe ability to control and\n\n272\n00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:58.580\ntrack changes made to\nthe configuration itself.\n\n273\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.250\nIt can discover devices and tell you\nthat it may need to automate the backup.\n\n274\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.010\nIt can even start going ahead and\ngiving you the ability to of course\n\n275\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.340\nbackup your startup config as\nwell as your running config.\n\n276\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.460\nBut one of the neat things about\nthis thing with Cisco Prime\n\n277\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.210\nis if you have two router configurations\nup that it can help you out with,\n\n278\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.700\nit can show you what the actual\nstartup config was and\n\n279\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.020\nshow you what the current\nrunning config is side by side.\n\n280\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.800\nIn that way if you know\nsomething has changed,\n\n281\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.750\nyou can actually verify it line by line.\n\n282\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.670\nWhat it is you choose to do that.\n\n283\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.080\nSo you can compare an altered\ntype of configuration\n\n284\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.190\nversus the original\nbaseline configuration.\n\n285\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.570\nAnd this idea of managing\nconfigurations is also a key.\n\n286\n00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.140\nMaking sure of course people are good\nat being able to restore that or\n\n287\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.010\nactually understand the backup\nprocess is also part of the training\n\n288\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.380\nthat has to come under management as well,\nokay?\n\n289\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.210\nAll right, so those are kind of two\nof the big gigantic processes that we\n\n290\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.830\nall have to think about if we have any\ntype of networking infrastructure at all.\n\n291\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.800\nAnd that we're responsible for\nthe security of those.\n\n292\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.170\nIs making sure we know how to have good\nconfigs backed up and how to restore them,\n\n293\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.950\nhave essentially managed.\n\n294\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.880\nSame thing with every asset.\n\n295\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.250\nBut in today's world.\n\n296\n00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.310\nAnd here we are in 2017.\n\n297\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.410\nWe also need to consider\nthe realm of BYOD, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.560\nBring your own device into the network.\n\n299\n00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.830\nAnd of course, the internet of things.\n\n300\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.530\nYou name it, there are so many other\ndevices that are out there today.\n\n301\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:37.160\nAnd as people try to integrate that in,\nrealize that this means that\n\n302\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.020\ncompany products or company information\nends up on someone's smartphone,\n\n303\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.030\nends up on someone's tablet, and\nnow they take that off of the network.\n\n304\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.926\nThat means, company information may now\nbe on a device that's not designed for\n\n305\n00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:56.680\ntrue security, could be able to\nbe taken advantage of at times.\n\n306\n00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.894\nSo it's very important that we too start\nto move towards the idea, especially\n\n307\n00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:07.746\nin networking today and security, towards\nwhat we call mobile device management too.\n\n308\n00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:12.256\nSo MDM is a short acronym that you\ngenerally hear And Cisco recently,\n\n309\n00:16:12.256 --> 00:16:16.238\nI say recently, it's probably been two or\nthree years now.\n\n310\n00:16:16.238 --> 00:16:18.713\nThey bought a company, and\nI will always mispronounce it,\n\n311\n00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:20.050\nI think it's called Meraki.\n\n312\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.720\nI always say Meraki, or Meraki.\n\n313\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's it.\n\n314\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Meraki, and\nthey are a phenomenal company.\n\n315\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.610\nThey just make things.\n\n316\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.880\nAnd surprising,\nthe first time I saw one of their devices,\n\n317\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.870\nI thought it was an Apple product.\n\n318\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.500\nEven the boxing and everything else\nlooked very much like Apple products.\n\n319\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.970\nSo I look and when you actually open it up\nI'm like, that's gotta come from Apple and\n\n320\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.100\nit wasn't, it was Meraki, but\nthey've integrated in now.\n\n321\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.280\nCisco has now kind of did that and they\nwere good at wireless kind of was the big\n\n322\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.970\nthing, but they've moved into this realm\nof the actual mobile device management.\n\n323\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.960\nThat is phenomenal in what they do.\n\n324\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.550\nSo they have a product of course,\nthat's the CISCO or\n\n325\n00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.050\nMeraki Mobile Device Management Solution\nthat\n\n326\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.010\ndoes everything that everybody else does\nand kind of the new things in security.\n\n327\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.700\nIt's simple, they're gonna bring\ntheir device on to our network.\n\n328\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.690\nWe're gonna install some\ntype of client on them and\n\n329\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.920\nthat gives us the ability to\ncontrol that client to a point\n\n330\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.270\nwhere we can do things like the remote\nwipe that we talk about or even\n\n331\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.430\nrestricting access to network resources\neven as they come on the network.\n\n332\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.020\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen faces turn so\nsour as when people,\n\n333\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.840\nas this started to become a thing, byod,\n\n334\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.830\npeople are getting smart phones and\nbecause our company didn't provide them.\n\n335\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.242\nThey wanted to connect their email and\n\n336\n00:17:33.242 --> 00:17:34.969\nthings of that nature\nto our company network.\n\n337\n00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:37.982\nAnd I would help them walk\nthrough the prompts and\n\n338\n00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:42.613\nit gets to that one prompt says, the\nability to remotely wipe this device by\n\n339\n00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:45.352\nthe administrators, do you agree with it?\n\n340\n00:17:45.352 --> 00:17:50.390\nAnd they're like hold up, up, what do you\nmean you're gonna remote wipe my device?\n\n341\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.310\nWell, you are potentially putting\ncompany information on this device.\n\n342\n00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.450\nAnd if you ever leave, or the device is\nstolen, we need the ability to make sure\n\n343\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.030\nthat that information does not fall\ninto the hands of some bad actor.\n\n344\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.440\nSo therefore,\nif you wanna be a part of this show,\n\n345\n00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.950\nyou have to give that permission to us so\nthat we can remote-wipe this device.\n\n346\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:14.255\nAnd a lot of people held their breath for\na second and said just press OK.\n\n347\n00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:16.298\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Its amazing, but yeah,\n\n348\n00:18:16.298 --> 00:18:19.827\nthose warnings they should be read so\nthat you do understand that,\n\n349\n00:18:19.827 --> 00:18:21.980\nhey this is something that's serious.\n\n350\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.820\nIts not a play thing and this is not\nsomething that you should just have on\n\n351\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.750\nyour phone just because you're\noing it'd be easier in my life.\n\n352\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.550\nThis is something that if your phone\naccidentally drops out because you're\n\n353\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.000\nstanding in line at Starbucks,\nsomebody picks it up and\n\n354\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.010\nstarts going through your stuff, well\na company wants the ability to say hey,\n\n355\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.180\nI need to get my company\ninformation off of that device so\n\n356\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.030\nit doesn't actually spread\nout to anybody else.\n\n357\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.108\nSo there are products out\nthere to help us do this.\n\n358\n00:18:48.108 --> 00:18:51.827\nNow remember Cisco is not the only one of\ncourse, but since this is a Cisco Centric\n\n359\n00:18:51.827 --> 00:18:54.358\nshow, I mentioned all of\ntheir particular products.\n\n360\n00:18:54.358 --> 00:18:57.721\nBut just kind of realize it's a big\npart of what you're gonna see and\n\n361\n00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:02.038\nyou're gonna continue to see that because\nthis market is only growing, it really is.\n\n362\n00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:06.911\nAnd today the idea of actually providing\nsomebody just a tablet to work\n\n363\n00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:12.440\nis not unheard of anymore instead of\na laptop or a full desktop anymore.\n\n364\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.860\nSo you do have the ability to do this and\nthe nice thing about it is well,\n\n365\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.250\nof course, there is this type of device\nmanager it pushes out the patches.\n\n366\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.970\nAllows you to update those phones so\n\n367\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.710\nthat the person that says,\nI'm not gonna update my phone.\n\n368\n00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.600\nThat doesn't bother me.\n\n369\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.910\nIt doesn't worry me.\n\n370\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.240\nYou go, yes.\n\n371\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.191\n&gt;&gt; Yes, here it goes.\n\n372\n00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:32.277\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are.\n\n373\n00:19:32.277 --> 00:19:35.117\nYou're definitely gonna have\nan update to your phone.\n\n374\n00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:39.140\nAnd you can push an anti-virus software,\nyou can do all that stuff.\n\n375\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.450\nYou can go ahead and\n\n376\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.430\ndo that remote which is to me kind of\nthe neat thing more than anything else.\n\n377\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.340\nBut you can see that control\nfrom one centralized place and\n\n378\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.020\njust about anywhere in the world as well.\n\n379\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.850\nSo a lot of products out there for\nyou, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.778\nNow that's kind of the real big three\nkey features in terms of just the type\n\n381\n00:19:57.778 --> 00:20:01.596\nof device managements that\nwe been talking about right,\n\n382\n00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:05.987\nconfiguration, assets here,\nand of course, mobile devices.\n\n383\n00:20:05.987 --> 00:20:09.200\nBut now we get a little bit more\ninto the side of things where it\n\n384\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.180\nbecomes a little bit more\nmuddled on what to do.\n\n385\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.090\nAnd this is where we talk about patch and\nvulnerability management as well, okay.\n\n386\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.830\nSo when we start taking a look\ninto the realm of patch and\n\n387\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:25.500\nvulnerability managements,this is why it\nbecomes a little bit more challenging.\n\n388\n00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.106\nOn patch management\nside of your operating,\n\n389\n00:20:28.106 --> 00:20:32.110\nlet's just take the idea of\nan operating system here.\n\n390\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.280\nMost people at home,\n\n391\n00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.911\nyou just push it out when updates come out\nfrom Microsoft if you are running Windows.\n\n392\n00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:41.240\nIt says hey, there's an update,\ngo ahead and install it,\n\n393\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.170\nyou kind of go, update, install it.\n\n394\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.610\nYou go to work, come back, machine's\nupdated, exactly what you feel like.\n\n395\n00:20:47.765 --> 00:20:52.610\nDanial, since having worked in the larger\norganizations, that may not be\n\n396\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.820\nthe best way [LAUGH] to actually apply\npatches, is just to say, an update.\n\n397\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.760\nLet me go ahead and just do that.\n\n398\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.880\nWhat are some of the unusual\nthings that may end up happening?\n\n399\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I do like ruling my\nIT shop with an iron fist, right?\n\n400\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.750\nBut unfortunately, there are people that\nwrite my check and they didn't like that,\n\n401\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.790\nso you have to come up with a strategy for\npatch management.\n\n402\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.320\nOne of them is usually creating a test\nbed, a group of machines, they might even\n\n403\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.920\nbe production machines, people that are in\ncertain departments, different areas,\n\n404\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.110\nyou wanna spread it out as far as possible\nso you get a good, what's the word\n\n405\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.230\nI'm looking for, a grouping-\n&gt;&gt; A representation.\n\n406\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.700\n&gt;&gt; A representation of what's going on.\n\n407\n00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.640\nYou get something from everywhere,\nright, so that you can see, okay,\n\n408\n00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.680\nI pushed patches out they came out.\n\n409\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.010\nI pushed into my test group.\n\n410\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.690\nDid they have any problems?\n\n411\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.020\nBecause if they have problems\nchances are the rest of my,\n\n412\n00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.530\ncuz unfortunately not every patch fixes\nan issue, sometimes just cause issues.\n\n413\n00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.480\nAnd that's basically\nwhat we're getting to.\n\n414\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.570\nSo you start with a test group, once the\ntest group has verified that everything is\n\n415\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.160\nworking fine, then you push it out.\n\n416\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.090\nAnd then you can't just say, hey,\nmiddle of the day, here comes patches, and\n\n417\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.810\nyou're gonna reboot, because that happens.\n\n418\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.290\nYou have to wait until it's a more\nconvenient time for most people so\n\n419\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.170\nthat you can actually patch.\n\n420\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:12.370\nThen you've got to send out an e-mail, the\nmachines are going to reboot at such and\n\n421\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.980\nsuch a time, patches are being installed.\n\n422\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.150\nAnd then invariably,\n\n423\n00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.690\nthe help desk is gonna receive calls\nthe next day complaining that your patches\n\n424\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.340\nbroke everything that they do,\nwhich they didn't.\n\n425\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.110\nThey're just using that as an excuse but\nsometimes that does happen and\n\n426\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.990\nyou have to deal with that.\n\n427\n00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in that large organization,\nright, what they're looking for\n\n428\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.990\nis what we call standardization.\n\n429\n00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.070\nAcross whoever they're supporting, before\nthey push that out, they wanna make sure\n\n430\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.320\nthat as they roll this out to, let's say,\nthis department, they don't want\n\n431\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.820\nwhere they're having to trouble shoot\none machine that's not patched.\n\n432\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.410\nAnd then, another machine is patched and\n\n433\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.830\nanother machine is partially,\nwhat in the world's going on?\n\n434\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.640\nAnd you don't know what's\nactually fixing that idea.\n\n435\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.790\nWell patch management is so\nmuch an important part of\n\n436\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.960\nthe way that security is run that it\nhas it's own special publication.\n\n437\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.440\nIt's been out there for\na while to give good guidance.\n\n438\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.740\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat my next screen here as we start.\n\n439\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.140\nGuide to\nEnterprise Patch Management Technologies.\n\n440\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:15.010\nAnd this is the third revision\nin the SP 800 series under NIST.\n\n441\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.940\nAnd it just gives general\nguidelines on the idea of falling.\n\n442\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.000\nAnd the reason why is what\nDaniel was talking about.\n\n443\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.380\nThe very fact is that people don't\nknow exactly when to push patches out.\n\n444\n00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.000\nAnd in enterprise that can cause all the\nheartache that Daniel was talking about.\n\n445\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.035\nSomebody swearing that it caused an issue,\n\n446\n00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:32.860\nand somebody else saying\nit does not cause an issue.\n\n447\n00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.530\nOther people are no longer able to print.\n\n448\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.120\nOther people are no\nlonger able to get files.\n\n449\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.010\nYou don't know.\n\n450\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.720\n&gt;&gt; I could tell you horror stories.\n\n451\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.140\nIts not fun.\n&gt;&gt; I believe you.\n\n452\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.110\nI absolutely believe you.\n\n453\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.287\nSo there is a ton of information here and\nit's really good information.\n\n454\n00:23:46.287 --> 00:23:49.103\nWe're not gonna read to you\nthe entire guideline but\n\n455\n00:23:49.103 --> 00:23:52.943\nI wanted you to actually know that is so\nmuch so that there's an official\n\n456\n00:23:52.943 --> 00:23:57.103\ndefinition says patch management is\nprocess for identifying, acquiring,\n\n457\n00:23:57.103 --> 00:24:00.431\ninstalling and verifying patches for\nproducts and systems.\n\n458\n00:24:00.431 --> 00:24:03.254\nSo much so that they really kind to said,\nall right,\n\n459\n00:24:03.254 --> 00:24:06.735\nhere's kind of the general best\npractices that you can follow.\n\n460\n00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:08.040\nAnd you do need the implement patches.\n\n461\n00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.891\nThat's kind of one the clear\nthings that they say.\n\n462\n00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:11.248\nBecause what do patches really do?\n\n463\n00:24:11.248 --> 00:24:16.819\nThey help us to correct security flaws\nthat are existing right now, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:21.170\nAnd problems as they find them inside\nof the software and even firmware and\n\n465\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.664\neven mitigate most of the vulnerabilities\nthat you'll end up encountering\n\n466\n00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:27.224\nright then at that point.\n\n467\n00:24:27.224 --> 00:24:31.436\nBut the idea of when to push them out,\nwhen to deploy them do you do\n\n468\n00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:35.190\nit after testing or\ndo you do it as soon as possible?\n\n469\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.210\nWell, we need to know when it's best for\nour organization to do that.\n\n470\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:44.400\nAlso, you actually have to be able to do\na couple of different things here too.\n\n471\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.040\nSo now in terms of the management side,\n\n472\n00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.470\nit means you have to\nkeep track of that stuff.\n\n473\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.450\nWhen are organizations\npushing out patches?\n\n474\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.028\nAre you monitoring these things and the\nnice thing is Microsoft is every second or\n\n475\n00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:56.977\nthird Tuesday.\n\n476\n00:24:56.977 --> 00:24:58.823\n&gt;&gt; Second Tuesday.\n&gt;&gt; Second Tuesday.\n\n477\n00:24:58.823 --> 00:25:00.740\nThey used to call it\nSuper Tuesday where you'd make-\n\n478\n00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Patch Tuesday.\n\n479\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.852\n&gt;&gt; Patch Tuesday, where you'd make sure\nthat you got those latest patches and\n\n480\n00:25:05.852 --> 00:25:07.312\nyou'd go through them.\n\n481\n00:25:07.312 --> 00:25:10.242\nAnd then you'd see if they\nneeded to be pushed out.\n\n482\n00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:13.662\nAnd of course you might find some\napplied to you, some didn't and so\n\n483\n00:25:13.662 --> 00:25:15.534\nyou only push out selected patches.\n\n484\n00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:18.971\nBut the other thing about it is\nbecause of the world today and\n\n485\n00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:20.630\nhow fast things are moving.\n\n486\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.170\nEven the idea of patch management\non a schedule may not be\n\n487\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.530\nas good as we want it to be.\n\n488\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.300\nAnd that is because and\nyou go way back to 1999,\n\n489\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.840\n2000 and\nthe idea of the SQL Slammer, right?\n\n490\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.800\nIt'd be nice to sit there and go,\nall right, we know SQL Slammer's out here.\n\n491\n00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.770\nLet's wait for a patch and\nyou wait for a patch but\n\n492\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.320\nthe problem is SQL Slammer took about nine\nminutes to go cross the entire globe.\n\n493\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.383\nSo, you really didn't\nhave time to patch it.\n\n494\n00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:53.276\nBut then when you patch it later,\nit's closing the barn door after\n\n495\n00:25:53.276 --> 00:25:56.930\neverything that's happened, and\nthat's kind of troubling, right?\n\n496\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.530\nSo, it means that you have to\nhave a better response time\n\n497\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.300\nat what needs to be done.\n\n498\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.380\nSo, there does need to be testing, it\ndoes need to be set up on the system and\n\n499\n00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.512\nconsistent,\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n500\n00:26:07.512 --> 00:26:11.362\nall this comes underneath that idea of\npatch management, is where it comes in,\n\n501\n00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:13.790\nand is something that we\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n502\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.440\nThe last little issue that we\nwanna talk about, of course,\n\n503\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.510\nis the idea of vulnerability\nmanagement as well, okay?\n\n504\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.180\nPatch management and vulnerability\nmanagement tend to go hand in hand, okay?\n\n505\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.440\nAnd that means you're not gonna\nactually have one without the other.\n\n506\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.070\nThe reason why patches exist,\nvulnerabilities exist.\n\n507\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.890\nIt makes sense, okay?\n\n508\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.153\nSo, the way of actually discovering\nvulnerabilities and patching systems and\n\n509\n00:26:34.153 --> 00:26:36.950\nthe process of doing\nit is fairly the same.\n\n510\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.230\nWe need to discover what they are, right?\n\n511\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.010\nSo vulnerabilities and\npatches, we need to do that.\n\n512\n00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.380\nAfter discovering we confirm that,\nhey, this is something that we need,\n\n513\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.670\nwe classify it if we need to.\n\n514\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.518\nIn other words this is critical,\nwhat is it, critical, helpful or\n\n515\n00:26:52.518 --> 00:26:54.144\nwhatever it might be.\n\n516\n00:26:54.144 --> 00:26:56.890\nOr optional, whatever, important.\n\n517\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.800\nI was trying to think of\nthat middle category.\n\n518\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.910\nCuz sometimes you'll see like Microsoft\nsays Critical, I think is what they say,\n\n519\n00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.310\nor urgent, or needed, and\nthen recommended is another one.\n\n520\n00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.492\nAnd then of course optional which means,\nyeah, try it, why not?\n\n521\n00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:12.760\n[LAUGH] So, you might have that.\n\n522\n00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.395\nPrioritizing, assigning.\n\n523\n00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:18.138\nAll these things, you'll find this\ninside the publication there,\n\n524\n00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:20.083\nif you want to go back and find them.\n\n525\n00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:24.740\nNow, whenever this is done and you start\ntalking about the idea of vulnerabilities,\n\n526\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.585\nit also means you need to keep up on your\nsystems, what systems are vulnerable.\n\n527\n00:27:29.585 --> 00:27:32.990\nAnd that gives us this time to\nactually go ahead and say, hey,\n\n528\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.580\nwhere do we find this\nidea of vulnerabilities?\n\n529\n00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.156\nWell, you can find them\ninside of products here.\n\n530\n00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:43.181\nAnd there is this website from Mitre,\n\n531\n00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:45.857\ncve.mitre.org.\n\n532\n00:27:45.857 --> 00:27:50.578\nAnd the one that I go to is right\nhere where it's by product type is\n\n533\n00:27:50.578 --> 00:27:54.080\nthe one that says product type here.\n\n534\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.630\nFrom this point, you can now do\na search for your particular\n\n535\n00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.100\nproducts that you're running to see if\nthere's any vulnerabilities that exist.\n\n536\n00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.626\nAnd that can help you out once you\nactually select what you're looking for.\n\n537\n00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:09.725\nAnd you can see whether it's searchable or\nwhether it's not searchable or\n\n538\n00:28:09.725 --> 00:28:11.114\nwhether it's compatible here.\n\n539\n00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:15.446\nAnd from that point,\nto identify that particular vulnerability,\n\n540\n00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:18.490\nthere is what is called the CVE ID.\n\n541\n00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.744\nThat leads you to what is called\nthe Common Vulnerability Scoring System.\n\n542\n00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:25.853\nWhich essentially ranks this\nvulnerability of whether or\n\n543\n00:28:25.853 --> 00:28:30.105\nnot this is something you really need to\npay attention to or, is this is just some\n\n544\n00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:34.290\ntype of notation that you've got\nto be aware of that's happening?\n\n545\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.320\nSo all this is part of that big system\nof vulnerability management but\n\n546\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.550\nit requires diligence.\n\n547\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.900\nThis is not something you can go,\nI'm not gonna pay attention this week.\n\n548\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.840\nSomebody always need to\nkeep up to date on this.\n\n549\n00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.950\nEspecially in this realm of having to\nmanage all of the different components\n\n550\n00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.970\ninside of our network.\n\n551\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:58.820\nSo lot of management terms [LAUGH] that\nwe actually just had to go over but\n\n552\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.440\nclear keys, right, of realizing\nthat vulnerabilities and patches.\n\n553\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.268\nWe've definitely gotta\nkeep on top of that.\n\n554\n00:29:04.268 --> 00:29:05.527\nBeing able to understand,\n\n555\n00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:09.990\nof course, what we're actually protecting\nin the idea of asset management.\n\n556\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.270\nThe, of course, idea also of taking\na look at configurations and whether or\n\n557\n00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.510\nnot we can restore those configurations\nvery quickly or whether or\n\n558\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.090\nnot they change is another part of it.\n\n559\n00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.970\nAnd then the idea here, of course,\n\n560\n00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.950\nof continuing to manage all\nof these products together.\n\n561\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.680\nIt really is gonna be helpful for\nus as we start to move through this.\n\n562\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.728\nNow if we're only starting at\nthe technical level, where we're helping\n\n563\n00:29:32.728 --> 00:29:36.160\nsomebody implement something,\nit doesn't really matter to us so much.\n\n564\n00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.060\nBut in the overall grand scheme of things,\n\n565\n00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.200\nas you start moving up these are some\nof the different things that will begin\n\n566\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.210\nhappening that you'll\nhave to manage yourself.\n\n567\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.760\nBut for the exam, important that you\ncan identify all these concepts.\n\n568\n00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.268\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n569\n00:29:47.268 --> 00:29:51.773\nNot the most exciting business in\nthe world but it is definitely crucial.\n\n570\n00:29:51.773 --> 00:29:52.710\nIt's something that you need to do.\n\n571\n00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.660\nYou need to be engaging in these different\nmanagement techniques that Ronnie's\n\n572\n00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.550\nbeen discussing this entire episode.\n\n573\n00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.720\nMaking sure that you are following\nthem as he has laid this out for you.\n\n574\n00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.118\nRonnie, thank you so much for\nhelping us out today.\n\n575\n00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:07.990\nAnd explaining these cool concepts and\nmanagement terms that we need to know.\n\n576\n00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.990\nBut the clock has ticked its last tock for\nus today.\n\n577\n00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.960\nThat being said, time to sign off.\n\n578\n00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.238\nFor IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n579\n00:30:15.238 --> 00:30:16.265\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n580\n00:30:16.265 --> 00:30:19.207\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n581\n00:30:19.207 --> 00:30:25.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n582\n00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.318\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT ProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.470\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.030\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.971\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with more on\n\n7\n00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.258\nour Cisco cybersecurity\nfundamentals series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:27.083\nAnd of course joining us in the studio, a\nman that's going to lend his expertise to\n\n9\n00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:29.780\nthat very topic is our good friend Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.480\nRonnie welcome back, sir,\nso glad to have you today.\n\n11\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.970\nAs we continue to move forward and\nthis time we are diving into our\n\n13\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.060\nnext domain objective where we're taking\na look at the idea of cryptography here.\n\n14\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.928\nSo we wanna talk about of course some of\nthe basic types of cryptography concepts\n\n15\n00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:50.794\nand algorithm usage specifically\nthat we need to understand.\n\n16\n00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:54.556\nSo we're gonna kind of dive in to that a\nlittle bit making sure that we have a good\n\n17\n00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:57.694\nunderstanding of when we actually\ntend to use these algorithms.\n\n18\n00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:01.915\nAnd what type of algorithms that we're\ngonna be using when we start approaching\n\n19\n00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:04.200\nthe idea of some type of cryptography.\n\n20\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.320\nSo we're gonna kinda dive into that today,\nand hopefully have a good time.\n\n21\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.440\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, when most people\nhear the term cryptography,\n\n22\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.760\nthey hear hard math, hard,\nhard math, and just tune it out.\n\n23\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.321\nUnfortunately we're not gonna be diving in\nto algorithms, we're not gonna show you\n\n24\n00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.943\nokay the coefficient of this that and the\nother, it's not gonna be like that, right?\n\n25\n00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:26.714\nIt's gonna be, these are the types of\nencryption that we might encounter,\n\n26\n00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:27.840\nis that correct?\n\n27\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're really going over the kind\nof the 10,000 foot overview here as far as\n\n28\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.060\ntrying to figure out when\nwe actually use them and\n\n29\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.610\nwhat the real context\nis that we use them in.\n\n30\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.000\nLater on, we'll talk about some of\nthose algorithms like what [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.760\nDaniel was talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.180\nBut in all truth, it's kind of the\nfunniest thing, that idea of algorithms\n\n33\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.470\nthat we use I don't know why we talk about\nthem in terms of the term, algorithm.\n\n34\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.209\nBut it's essentially a math\nproblem that we really say, look,\n\n35\n00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.063\nit's not going to be figured out easily or\nat least in my life time.\n\n36\n00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.320\nThat's what it really comes down to.\n\n37\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.735\nBut for us though, we do need to\ntake a look at how this begins,\n\n38\n00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:06.391\nas far as a cryptographic\nfunction [INAUDIBLE].\n\n39\n00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:10.633\nAnd when we use them in the context that\nwe are going to see them in the majority\n\n40\n00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:11.378\nof the time.\n\n41\n00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:13.170\nNow, we're not in the military.\n\n42\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.240\nWe're not talking about hiding secrets and\nstuff.\n\n43\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.650\nBut we are talking about hiding\nour data a lot of times.\n\n44\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.407\nWe're also talking about the ability for\nusing these types\n\n45\n00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:27.151\nof algorithms to help us to verify and\ncheck the integrity of files as well.\n\n46\n00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.812\nAnd even to, again,\nhide some information but\n\n47\n00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:33.071\nnot completely in a way that we\nwant to that we think about,\n\n48\n00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:37.520\nas far as we're hiding this so that\nsomebody else can open it in the future.\n\n49\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.240\nBut it might just be from just prying\neyes, more than anything else,\n\n50\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.990\nthat we can hide them and store them in\nthat function and then that value actually\n\n51\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.710\ncomes back and we can verify that it\nactually is the right information as well.\n\n52\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.620\nSo, the first thing that we\nreally want to jump into,\n\n53\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.830\nthen Is to take a look at the use of\nwhat we call a hashing algorithm.\n\n54\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.330\nNow, when it comes down to\nthe idea of a hashing algorithm,\n\n55\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.600\nthis is the strangest type\nof algorithm that we use\n\n56\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.250\nin the realm of cryptography and\nencryption processes.\n\n57\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.219\nBecause even though its actually doing\nan encryption, its doing what we\n\n58\n00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.548\ncall a one way encryption,\neverything else that we tend to do.\n\n59\n00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.831\nWe talk about the idea of actually\nencrypting something so I\n\n60\n00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.373\ncan send it over to Daniel and Daniel can\ndecrypt it and read the information here.\n\n61\n00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:36.478\nBut when I actually get a value of some\ntype of data that I want to give to\n\n62\n00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:43.100\nDaniel, normally we also do something that\nwe call a hash on whatever that data is.\n\n63\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.424\nAnd I send Daniel a copy of that\ndata as well as the hash value.\n\n64\n00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:53.191\nAnd then Daniel can run the same\nprocess that I did on that data and\n\n65\n00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.920\nhe can verify whether\nthe data has changed or not.\n\n66\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.070\nSo, we can see a process\nlike that as well.\n\n67\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.638\nWe can also see where it's actually\nbeneficial to do something like this for\n\n68\n00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:07.560\nvery simple data as well.\n\n69\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.915\nTo help obfuscate, to make it harder for\nsomebody to be able to guess things,\n\n70\n00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:16.350\nlike passwords that are out there,\ntoo, that are stored on machines.\n\n71\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.865\nSo, we're going to show you kind of\nan example of both, hoping that that helps\n\n72\n00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:23.570\nyou to get the concept down and\nunderstand what we're taking a look at.\n\n73\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.290\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at my\nmachine and we're going to talk about it\n\n74\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.420\nas far as the way that we use\nvalues here on the actual router.\n\n75\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.710\nNow I'm plugged into our lab\nmachines here at practice labs,\n\n76\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.830\nour lab provider, partner.\n\n77\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.189\nAnd I simply got one of their routers\nturned on which is going to be\n\n78\n00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.333\nNYEDGE1 here.\n\n79\n00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.611\nAnd I know that that's going to be\na little bit hard for us to see.\n\n80\n00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.411\nBut let's see if I can get all the way\ndown to that point where you can see me\n\n81\n00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.101\ntype as well as see the commands\nthat going on here.\n\n82\n00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:56.590\nSo I've set this up, to, so that we can\nreally see a couple of things okay.\n\n83\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.860\nFirst and foremost I want us to be able\nto see that at the very beginning right.\n\n84\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.490\nRouters and switches when we\ncreate passwords to these things.\n\n85\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.810\nIt stores them in just plain and\nsimple clear text okay.\n\n86\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.840\nSo let me give you an example here.\n\n87\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.610\nI'm going to global configuration mode for\nthis router and\n\n88\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.110\nlet me see if I can zoom in a little\nbit more so that we can see it.\n\n89\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.790\nThere we go,\nthat's a little bit better, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.170\nOnce I'm here I am going to set\nwhat we call the enable password,\n\n91\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.360\nwhich is a very simple password for us.\n\n92\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.733\nSo if I type in,\nhopefully I can spell enable.\n\n93\n00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:32.560\nIf I type in enable, the password here.\n\n94\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.300\nAnd I'm just gonna use a very\ngeneric one that's fairly simple.\n\n95\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.630\nAnybody could guess this right\noff the bat, no big deal.\n\n96\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.690\nAnd I go ahead and\ntype that in, very good.\n\n97\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.850\nI know something when I get to that prompt\nwhere I need to type in the word enable.\n\n98\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.080\nHere's a password is gonna expect,\ngreat okay?\n\n99\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.050\nNow this is gonna get stored into\nthe configuration of this router.\n\n100\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.408\nAnd if I go ahead and\ndo a do copy run start and\n\n101\n00:05:57.408 --> 00:06:00.931\nlet it save, the configuration.\n\n102\n00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:06.271\nI'm going to show you it's actually\nsaved in there, and once it's saved,\n\n103\n00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:10.930\nI can type in a do show running\ndash config and let me zoom out.\n\n104\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.151\nGood.\n[CROSSTALK] So there it is, Daniel.\n\n105\n00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.390\nYou can see it in plain, clear text.\n\n106\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.270\nAnd if I'm sitting on\na terminal doing this,\n\n107\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.070\nsomebody can easily walk by and\ndo some shoulder surfing.\n\n108\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.150\nRight there,\nthere's the enable password set up.\n\n109\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.630\nVery easy, very much so in plain text.\n\n110\n00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.950\nBut Cisco also has the ability to hide\nthis particular type of password,\n\n111\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.010\nby using a hashing algorithm as well.\n\n112\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.540\nSo instead, if I go ahead and,\nlet's see and get out of this.\n\n113\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.980\nI'm gonna kinda hit the Enter\nkey a couple of times.\n\n114\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.790\nAnd now I type in enable, Secret.\n\n115\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.540\nI'm going to do one\nwith a question mark so\n\n116\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.160\nthat we can see some of\nthe values that we have in place.\n\n117\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.510\nNow here on this one, and\nthis is running kind of,\n\n118\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.900\nI'm not gonna say it's the latest software\nbut it is running version 15 at least,\n\n119\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.380\nwhich is at least what you want to\npractice on if you're gonna do anything.\n\n120\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.540\nThere are older ones out there,\nstill in existence, but\n\n121\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.420\nyou see a couple of different ones.\n\n122\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.830\nThere's MD5 hashed, instead.\n\n123\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.960\nSo even if I type in a password,\nI can do an MD5 hash and\n\n124\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.290\nthat doesn't really do a lot.\n\n125\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.453\nI think Daniel was telling me he can\nprobably break through MD5 fairly easily.\n\n126\n00:07:27.453 --> 00:07:33.563\nBut then there's other ones that are of\ncourse more secure like these PK PB,\n\n127\n00:07:33.563 --> 00:07:35.289\npeanut butter, no.\n\n128\n00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.860\nPBKDF2, am I hungry or what?\n\n129\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.408\nAnd then SCRYPT here.\n\n130\n00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:42.950\n&gt;&gt; How about kosher dill fritadas?\n\n131\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no that sounds good.\n\n132\n00:07:44.388 --> 00:07:46.691\nLike, good gosh.\n\n133\n00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.250\nBut yeah, you can see that there's\nother ones that are out here now.\n\n134\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.430\nI don't know which one's\nactually done by default anymore.\n\n135\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.263\nIt used to be on the older versions it\nwas the md5 hash, it was by default.\n\n136\n00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:56.912\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n137\n00:07:56.912 --> 00:08:02.418\ntry this again as I enable secret\ninstead of actually enable password.\n\n138\n00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:06.524\nAnd then I'm gonna just use the same\nexact password here, which is cisco123,\n\n139\n00:08:06.524 --> 00:08:07.128\nall right?\n\n140\n00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:11.073\nIt says it doesn't like\nme using the same name.\n\n141\n00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:16.014\nSo it said hey, this is the exact same\none, so let me do it backward here,\n\n142\n00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:17.068\ncisco321.\n\n143\n00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:22.426\nSo it just doesn't like you using\nthe same one if you don't have to,\n\n144\n00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:24.620\ndo show running-config.\n\n145\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.580\nAnd now you can take\na look at the difference.\n\n146\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.490\nNow, this one still by default,\nwe saw where it said look, it's a md5hash.\n\n147\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.610\nSo when you take a look at this value,\n\n148\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.840\nand ran it through an encryption\nalgorithm, and here's what it spit out.\n\n149\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.110\nDaniel, that looks nothing like\nthe cisco321 that I typed in.\n\n150\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.310\nIt looks pretty long and\n\n151\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.610\nwhat it's supposed to do as\nfar as the hashing value goes,\n\n152\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.120\nit is supposed to make it very difficult\nfor someone to guess first of all, right.\n\n153\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.170\nAnd to make it impossible\nas much as possible here,\n\n154\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.340\nwhat we're calling\nthe idea of impossibility.\n\n155\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.720\nTo be able to reverse this by\ntrying to take anything in here and\n\n156\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.210\nreverse it to cisco321, right?\n\n157\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.160\n&gt;&gt; It's technically directly unreversible.\n\n158\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.620\nYou cannot directly\nreverse this algorithm.\n\n159\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.630\nWhat you can do is take a bunch\nof different strings and\n\n160\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.440\napply the algorithm to it.\n\n161\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.360\nAnd when you come up with\nthe string that matches,\n\n162\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.460\nwell now you know what that string was\nthe created that from that hash value.\n\n163\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.050\nAnd then you can guess what it is.\n\n164\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.000\nMD5 has long been figured out so\nyou can go, there's websites out there.\n\n165\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.975\nYou just drop an MD5 string into there and\ndecrypt and\n\n166\n00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:37.070\nit'll show you the,\nthere's just tables after table.\n\n167\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it really does work well\nas fast as the machines are today.\n\n168\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.838\nThey break through these\nfairly quickly here.\n\n169\n00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:46.280\nCisco kinda did a little bit of\na tricky situation here though Daniel.\n\n170\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.550\nOnce you see this $1,\nthere is some particular\n\n171\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.910\nportion of the rest of this here\nbeginning with this other $ in between.\n\n172\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.880\nAnd something where it gives you a salted\nvalue, they add in some extra bits.\n\n173\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.410\nThey don't tell you how many bits that\nthey added, they just go, we've added in\n\n174\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.820\nsome extra bits in there to kinda make\nit more difficult for you to figure out.\n\n175\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.550\nIt knows what to figure out,\nbut you do not, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:15.640\nAnd so that is the key to making this\na little bit safer, for what we're doing.\n\n177\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.695\nBut overall though, this particular\nvalue itself is actually not going,\n\n178\n00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:25.840\nis one that we really want to pay\nattention to because its output\n\n179\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.250\nreally cannot be reversed or it should\nnot be reversed very easily, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.940\nSo it makes it very difficult to crack,\nbut at the same time Daniel also told you\n\n181\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.160\nthat if you can flush it against some\nof those tables that are out there, and\n\n182\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.190\nyou find somebody else has already cracked\nthis before, it'll be listed there.\n\n183\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.430\nAnd then they just show you,\nhey here is what the password could be.\n\n184\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.770\nSometimes you can even find them\non an older encryption that says,\n\n185\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.900\nI'll just enter this in and\nlet it run through, and you're fine, and\n\n186\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.130\nyou're good and dandy, and ready to go.\n\n187\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.550\nBut at this point, right, it shows you\nthat hey, if we didn't have this enabled\n\n188\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.350\nsecret password here, you wouldn't be able\nto guess what my password was at all.\n\n189\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.260\nIt's pretty challenging\nto just get eight letters\n\n190\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.960\nout of all the stuff\nthat you see right now.\n\n191\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.090\n&gt;&gt; Even if you saw this and\nyou thought, there's the password, and\n\n192\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.450\nall I had to do was type that string in.\n\n193\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If that literally was the password.\n\n194\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.562\nYou're not gonna shoulder surf\nthat unless you're some sort of\n\n195\n00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:14.321\nweird-\n&gt;&gt; Rain Main.\n\n196\n00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:14.907\n&gt;&gt; Savant, yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Able to get a perfect picture of\n\n198\n00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:21.070\neverything and then recreate it,\nthat would be very difficult.\n\n199\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.690\n&gt;&gt; It is incredibly difficult and\nthat's what they want you to realize,\n\n200\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.650\nnow the other thing that we also do\nwith this idea of a hashing value\n\n201\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.680\nis to confirm the integrity of things.\n\n202\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.260\nSo, the way that I use this on\nthe Internet is fairly simple.\n\n203\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.820\nWhen I go and download an ISO,\nto install, and it could be a Linux ISO.\n\n204\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.430\nAnd I download that ISO and\nI wanna put it into a virtual machine or\n\n205\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.120\nI wanna install it onto a machine,\nwell to tell you the truth Daniel,\n\n206\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.550\nI really don't know the website that\nis coming from where it stored.\n\n207\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.330\nIt could be somebody has spoofed\nthat entire website, and\n\n208\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:12:00.210\nI could be downloading a file that's full\nof infected, whatever is in that file, and\n\n209\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.690\nI could bring that on my machine and then\nI would have some problems of some issues.\n\n210\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.230\nBecause we're connecting\nacross the Internet,\n\n211\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.670\nI'm not verifying that I'm actually\nconnecting that one machine.\n\n212\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.330\nThey're not sending me back anything that\nsays, yeah Ronnie, I noticed your request.\n\n213\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.030\nYes, we are directly\nsending this back to you.\n\n214\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.710\nBut what they do put up is a system\nof what we call hash values\n\n215\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.240\nthat we can check against to what they\nalso call the idea of check sums.\n\n216\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.700\nCheck sums allow us to be able to say,\n\n217\n00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.410\nall right, here's the file\nin the existence that it is.\n\n218\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:36.870\nAnd when we ran this file\nagainst our hashing software,\n\n219\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.850\nit generated this string\nof characters that we see.\n\n220\n00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.810\nThey then send that both, or they give me\nthat ability to download that check sum.\n\n221\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.200\nThey also send me the file.\n\n222\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.850\nAnd I can now use the same hashing\nalgorithm against that very same file,\n\n223\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.970\nand it should return\nthe value that we need, okay.\n\n224\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.450\nIf it doesn't it means something has\nchanged and we'll talk about that idea\n\n225\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.470\nof the change and\nwhat could have happened in between, okay.\n\n226\n00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:11.360\nSo I have made up a, wonder if I can\nactually get this to show up here.\n\n227\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.900\nThere it is, okay.\n\n228\n00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.220\nSo right here,\nI show you again in the black,\n\n229\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.520\nbecause it's actually a little\nbit easier for us to see here.\n\n230\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.440\nSo let's say for\nan example Daniel sent me this, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.400\nHere is the MD5 for\nthe file called ShowFile here.\n\n232\n00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.780\nSo, I just made this one up.\n\n233\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:37.010\nAnd here is this hash value for\nthe contents of that file.\n\n234\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.430\nSo I now have this particular file here,\nand\n\n235\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.800\nI need to generate something\nagainst that file.\n\n236\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.310\nI can simply bring up\nthe terminal window right here.\n\n237\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.950\nI can go to my documents folder\nwhere I believe I have this.\n\n238\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:04.310\nAnd then I can run md5\nagainst ShowFile.rtf.\n\n239\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.770\nAnd if I do that, it should run it\nagainst it, and if the values match,\n\n240\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.475\nnow it may take longer if this\nfile's really big, right,\n\n241\n00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:17.032\nit should match up to where you can\nactually see this particular value.\n\n242\n00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:21.705\nLet me see if I can zoom in here,\nthis value right here and\n\n243\n00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:25.890\nthe one that came out of\nthat should be identical.\n\n244\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:33.549\nAny change in the file should have also\nchanged what the output of my hashing.\n\n245\n00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:37.677\nWhich tells me somewhere in between when\nI got the file and when it landed on my\n\n246\n00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:41.420\ncomputer, it could have changed or\nchanged at the origination.\n\n247\n00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.390\n&gt;&gt; And it's not just like a minor change,\nif Ronnie made it a ShowFile2.rtf and\n\n248\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.780\nthat was the change, he renamed\nthe file and then hashed that, or\n\n249\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.035\njust one character inside that file and\nthen rehashed it.\n\n250\n00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:57.340\nIt's not gonna be one character\ndifference in that MD5 hash,\n\n251\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.000\nits gonna be completely\ndifferent string of characters.\n\n252\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.260\nIt's not gonna look at all similar.\n\n253\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.750\n&gt;&gt; And I appreciate you saying that,\ncuz we're gonna do exactly that and\n\n254\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.030\nsee what happens here.\n\n255\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:12.570\nAnd what that effect is called, Daniel,\nis what we call the avalanche effect.\n\n256\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.190\nThe idea of the avalanche effect\nis exactly like you think about in\n\n257\n00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.280\nthe movies and everything else.\n\n258\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.700\nBut it's a snowball effect\nis what happens right?\n\n259\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.100\nAt the very beginning right, as you kick\ndown a little bit of snow, it rolls and\n\n260\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.120\nmakes a little bit of a snowball.\n\n261\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.480\nBut a single change though,\n\n262\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.040\nthe snowball doesn't stop and\ngravity continues roll it.\n\n263\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.960\nBy the time it gets down to the bottom\nhill the change is gigantic.\n\n264\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.740\nSo here you can see I typed in our\nshow that we're actually doing here\n\n265\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.090\ntoday with our names in it.\n\n266\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.890\nSo now Daniel I'm just gonna change\nsomething very minor here okay.\n\n267\n00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.470\nSo let's do this.\n\n268\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.620\nDo you think that it's gonna\nhave a snowball effect\n\n269\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.770\nif I do something like that.\n\n270\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.497\n&gt;&gt; I guarantee it.\n\n271\n00:15:51.497 --> 00:15:52.197\n&gt;&gt; Guarantee it.\n\n272\n00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:55.375\nOkay so Daniel says just because\nI change it to a lower case,\n\n273\n00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:58.743\njust because I change it to a lower\ncase So let me save this file,\n\n274\n00:15:58.743 --> 00:16:00.672\nif I can remember how to save a file.\n\n275\n00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:01.775\n&gt;&gt; Watch it totally bite me in the.\n\n276\n00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:05.243\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the exact same hash.\n\n277\n00:16:05.243 --> 00:16:06.449\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly the same hash.\n\n278\n00:16:06.449 --> 00:16:10.920\n[LAUGH] All right, so here we are,\nwe're testing Daniel's hashing abilities.\n\n279\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.680\nNo, not really,\nit should be a big change here.\n\n280\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.170\nAll right, so\nnow if I just hit that again.\n\n281\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.680\nSo I think I saved it.\n\n282\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.970\nBut remember I'm saving it.\n\n283\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.210\nAnd there it is.\n\n284\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.950\nAnd you can now see where the second one,\n\n285\n00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.520\nit looks nothing like that and\nthe only change was what?\n\n286\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.890\nFrom an upper case to a lower case.\n\n287\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.620\nFor me if I were to think of that change,\n\n288\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.610\nI would have changed\nthat to a five [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.450\nThat's they making\nchanges of four to five.\n\n290\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.900\nWe would do something like that.\n\n291\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:48.330\nBut here just one minor change leads to\nthe difference that you see right here.\n\n292\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.968\nThe original value that came\nfrom that file is here.\n\n293\n00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.170\nIt's still the same comment but\njust a minor change.\n\n294\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.830\nIf I added a period,\nit would have done the same thing.\n\n295\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.523\nEven spaces would have\ndone the same thing.\n\n296\n00:16:57.523 --> 00:17:02.430\nAnd that is the value of it verifying\nthe integrity of that file.\n\n297\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.930\nWe know that when we download\nsomething now from the Internet,\n\n298\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.610\nif you get that file, you have the ability\nto have this check sum from it, and\n\n299\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.380\nthen you can verify.\n\n300\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.485\nYes, this is exactly what we\nbelieve exists on our servers, and\n\n301\n00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:15.759\nthis is what we have to do.\n\n302\n00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.807\nIf you're doing that verification,\n\n303\n00:17:17.807 --> 00:17:22.159\nespecially from something across the\nInternet, make sure you get that checksum\n\n304\n00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:26.430\nfile from a different location than\nwhere you download the file from.\n\n305\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.290\nIt's very important that you do that\nbecause somebody could change the hashing\n\n306\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.230\ntable on their own server\nif they choose to.\n\n307\n00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.560\nSo make sure you go to another site and\ngo.\n\n308\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.437\nHere's what it is and that way you can\nverify that you got the right files.\n\n309\n00:17:39.437 --> 00:17:43.610\nIt can happen for many reasons, in terms\nof corruption and stuff like that.\n\n310\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.308\nBut over all though,\nthis is what you definitely have to do.\n\n311\n00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:51.718\nSo hashing algorithms at least in two\ninstances here are used like this here.\n\n312\n00:17:51.718 --> 00:17:56.457\nWhere we show you the way that you might\nsee it stored on something like a router,\n\n313\n00:17:56.457 --> 00:17:59.874\nand also of course the idea\nof using it for verification.\n\n314\n00:17:59.874 --> 00:18:02.834\nIt's kind of usage here\nis fairly common and\n\n315\n00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:07.396\nsomething that we've got to make\nsure that we understand as well but\n\n316\n00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:11.610\nthat's where hashing algorithms\ncome into all right.\n\n317\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.070\nSo from that point once we actually get\npast this idea of the hashing algorithms\n\n318\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.040\nand Daniel, we have to move on next\nto what are we taking look at here?\n\n319\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.170\nWe're gonna talk about, of course,\ndifferent encryption algorithms and\n\n320\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.940\nwhere they are actually used as well,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:34.110\nSo now we're gonna switch up just a little\nbit so that we can see the difference here\n\n322\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.160\nof what we actually do end\nup using the encryption for.\n\n323\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.380\nSo the big difference here is\nI'm gonna go to the switch.\n\n324\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.709\nWhich I believe I already set up, yep.\n\n325\n00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.590\nYeah it looks like I all\nready set it up right here.\n\n326\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.650\nI just named the switch.\n\n327\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.310\nI was able to also grant SSH access\nwhich is an encryption algorithm for\n\n328\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.980\nus that we're gonna be using.\n\n329\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.380\nAnd I want us to be able to connect\nto the switch from the client.\n\n330\n00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.480\nWhich is right here all right.\n\n331\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.240\nNow, we're going to launch, Telnet is what\nwe're going to do, but before I do so,\n\n332\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.860\nI'm going to bring up Wireshark.\n\n333\n00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.150\nThis will help us to capture\nthe data that we need.\n\n334\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.890\nAnd I'm going to select the interface.\n\n335\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.648\nI need to make sure I select the right\ninterface, which is going to be the 16.10.\n\n336\n00:19:18.648 --> 00:19:20.820\nAnd I'm gonna click on start here.\n\n337\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.560\nAnd now it's waiting.\n\n338\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.007\nNo packets are actually\ngoing across which is fine.\n\n339\n00:19:26.007 --> 00:19:28.070\nThen let's use PuTTY.\n\n340\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.716\nGreat tool here, I love to use some PuTTY.\n\n341\n00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:34.276\n&gt;&gt; It's in every network admin's toolkit.\n\n342\n00:19:34.276 --> 00:19:35.161\n&gt;&gt; It pretty much is.\n\n343\n00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:36.474\n&gt;&gt; If it's not, it needs to be.\n\n344\n00:19:36.474 --> 00:19:37.387\n&gt;&gt; Yep, sure enough,\n\n345\n00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:41.110\none of the greatest little utilities that\nyou really don't have to worry about.\n\n346\n00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.277\nIt works, not a lot of configuration\nmessage you have to deal with.\n\n347\n00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:52.222\nSo here I am, I'm connecting in,\nI'm just gonna type in Ronnie.\n\n348\n00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:53.929\nLet's just go 123.\n\n349\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.473\nAnd you could see I can gain\naccess into this If I can type in.\n\n350\n00:20:00.473 --> 00:20:04.726\nWe'll do the show run and\nI just wanna build the configuration and\n\n351\n00:20:04.726 --> 00:20:06.340\nwe can take a look at it.\n\n352\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.530\nNow if everything has worked correctly,\n\n353\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.282\nI should be able to find my Windows key\nhere and I'm gonna stop the capture.\n\n354\n00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:19.730\nAnd what I'm looking for\nof course is gonna be that telnet data.\n\n355\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.970\nSo as I scroll in here,\nyou can see where it says telnet data.\n\n356\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:31.860\nAnd if I right-click and I go to follow\nthe TCP stream, look right here, Daniel.\n\n357\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.370\nYou can see everything that goes across,\nokay.\n\n358\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.725\nSo, notice, nothing up here at the top.\n\n359\n00:20:36.725 --> 00:20:40.499\nWhere you're actually seeing these\nduplicates here is when it's sending and\n\n360\n00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:41.414\nit's receiving,\n\n361\n00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:45.430\nbut as I scroll down, here's\nthe information that I wanted to get to.\n\n362\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.330\nIt's being really sensitive.\n\n363\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.680\nNotice this right here, Daniel.\n\n364\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.248\nSo, I can't highlight it, but you can see.\n\n365\n00:20:51.248 --> 00:20:52.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's all your passwords.\n\n366\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.888\n&gt;&gt; There's all your passwords.\n\n367\n00:20:52.888 --> 00:20:57.230\nSo,, that's something we definitely don't\nwant to happen across the network at all,\n\n368\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.370\never, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.885\nSo, that is really, really bad.\n\n370\n00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:03.894\nThat is something we really\nwant to make sure that we\n\n371\n00:21:03.894 --> 00:21:06.840\nare not going to see happening at.\n\n372\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.590\n&gt;&gt; So, enter encryption, right?\n\n373\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.010\nThis is where we want to,\n\n374\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.740\nwant to obfuscate this using\nan encryption algorithm.\n\n375\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.190\n&gt;&gt; We really want to make sure\nthat we do that right now.\n\n376\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.020\nSo instead we're going to use SSH.\n\n377\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.433\nSSH is going to allow us if\nwe do the exact same thing.\n\n378\n00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:26.619\n16.2 and this time it's gonna warn me,\n\n379\n00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:31.330\nit's gonna say we're gonna setup some\nencryption for you, send any data over.\n\n380\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.230\nFrom this point on everything\nis gonna be encrypted.\n\n381\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.581\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis time I'm gonna sign in as Daniel,\n\n382\n00:21:37.581 --> 00:21:40.616\nwho knows better than to use Telnet,\nunlike Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:21:45.212 --> 00:21:48.574\nHopefully Daniel didn't tell me his\npassword, so I'm just guessing here.\n\n384\n00:21:48.574 --> 00:21:49.428\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking, it's the same password.\n\n385\n00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:50.108\n&gt;&gt; You can guess it Ronnie.\n\n386\n00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:50.787\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n387\n00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.324\nthere is no way that would ever be true.\n\n388\n00:21:52.324 --> 00:21:53.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n389\n00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.830\n&gt;&gt; But here it is, it looks like\nI'm doing the same thing, right?\n\n390\n00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.040\nShow run.\n\n391\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.728\nSo the exact same thing that\nwhat we did previously,\n\n392\n00:21:59.728 --> 00:22:03.042\nbut now if we take a look at this stream,\nlet me close out of this.\n\n393\n00:22:07.104 --> 00:22:09.000\nAs we scroll back over here.\n\n394\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.450\nThere we go, we are looking for\nthe encrypted packets.\n\n395\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.450\nI'm trying to stop this.\n\n396\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.996\nSo I don't go anymore.\n\n397\n00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:22.090\nSo notice now, encrypted response packets\nthat we see here SSH version two.\n\n398\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.164\nIf we right click on that and\nfollow the TCP string,\n\n399\n00:22:25.164 --> 00:22:27.819\nthis time, though, Daniel as I scroll in.\n\n400\n00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:32.755\nWe can now see,\n\n401\n00:22:32.755 --> 00:22:37.302\nDaniel it doesn't look like you can read\nvery much at all as far as the data goes.\n\n402\n00:22:37.302 --> 00:22:38.153\n&gt;&gt; Well maybe you can't.\n\n403\n00:22:38.153 --> 00:22:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Yea maybe I can't.\n\n404\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.400\n&gt;&gt; Well no one else can,\nthat's just a jumbled mess.\n\n405\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.203\nI like how the first thing it shows you\nis all the encryption types are the same.\n\n406\n00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.100\n&gt;&gt; Which one of these\nguys do you want to use?\n\n408\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.280\nCuz this is what I support right here.\n\n409\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.887\nLet's make a connection here and\nthen encrypt the mess out of this so\n\n410\n00:22:50.887 --> 00:22:52.226\nknow onw can see what's going on.\n\n411\n00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:54.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what you wanna see not there's\n\n412\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.350\nRonnie's password, it says 123.\n\n413\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.983\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of the opposite of what we're\n\n414\n00:22:58.983 --> 00:22:59.780\nlooking for here.\n\n415\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.580\n&gt;&gt; It really is the opposite of\nwhat we're really looking for.\n\n416\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.597\nSo this is why we tend to use the\nencryption algorithms that we use, right.\n\n417\n00:23:06.597 --> 00:23:10.980\n&gt;&gt; And there was no speed issues or\nperformance problems.\n\n418\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.950\nJust because we went to encryption.\n\n419\n00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.695\nIt was just as fine, did the exact\nsame thing, and like Ronnie said,\n\n420\n00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.126\nthere's no good reason.\n\n421\n00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:21.042\nThere are a few good reasons out\nthere to continue to use Telnet,\n\n422\n00:23:21.042 --> 00:23:24.260\nbackward compatibility,\nlegacy systems, that kind of thing.\n\n423\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.010\nYou can always build\nup an IP-sec tunnel or\n\n424\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.670\nsomething like that to encrypt that data\nas well, if you have to go that route.\n\n425\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.983\nBut, If you can use an encrypted protocol,\nuse an encrypted protocol,\n\n426\n00:23:32.983 --> 00:23:36.752\nthat's really what it comes down to,\nthat's the security guy talking, right?\n\n427\n00:23:36.752 --> 00:23:37.720\nYou're hitting my hot button.\n\n428\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.423\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying,\n\n429\n00:23:40.423 --> 00:23:43.866\nif you can do it the more secure way,\ndo that.\n\n430\n00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:46.226\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt\nthat this is kinda the key for\n\n431\n00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:49.570\nanything that we do that we share\nthat sensitive information.\n\n432\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.720\nEven across our own networks is to try and\n\n433\n00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.000\nmake sure that they're\nencrypted in some way.\n\n434\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.431\nThe idea of actually doing something\nlike using unencrypted technology,\n\n435\n00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:02.087\nespecially on something as sensitive as\nwhat we showed you is never a good idea.\n\n436\n00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:06.888\nIf you're gonna transmit somebody's\npassword, PII, PHI stuff,\n\n437\n00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:08.910\nnot ever a good thing.\n\n438\n00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.480\nEncryption is pretty much the way to go.\n\n439\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.440\nAnd these are kind of the most common\nusages of encryption that we have.\n\n440\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.020\nThe idea of the hashing value is key,\nthe idea of actually being able to\n\n441\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.510\nunderstand that it helps us\nto hide data as we have it.\n\n442\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.310\nAnd there's a couple of forms of it too,\n\n443\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.860\nso the one that I showed you with SSH,\nright?\n\n444\n00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.640\nIt allows the data to actually be hidden\nas it goes across the actual connection.\n\n445\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.170\nBut there are other data which you have.\n\n446\n00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.220\nLike, when you encrypt a file,\n\n447\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.900\nit's encrypted as long as it\nactually remains as a file.\n\n448\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.850\nAs you transmit the data,\nit has to decrypt it.\n\n449\n00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.390\nAnd then it re-encrypts it on\nthe other side of those LANs.\n\n450\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.720\nBut we're gonna talk about that some\nmore in future episodes, a little bit.\n\n451\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.790\nBut overall though, those are kinda\nthe basic functions, right?\n\n452\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.687\nEither verifying the data or\n\n453\n00:24:53.687 --> 00:24:57.488\nhiding the data of what we end\nup seeing is kind of the key.\n\n454\n00:24:57.488 --> 00:25:02.233\nConfidentiality really part of that CIA\ntriad that we are really emphasizing\n\n455\n00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:05.410\nhere by using the methods of encryption.\n\n456\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.456\nDaniel we do have a little\nbit more to go but\n\n457\n00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:09.990\nthe very fact is I think\nI am running out of time.\n\n458\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n459\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.830\nWell if that might be the case\nthen that is the case.\n\n460\n00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.674\nWe are famous for\nour part twos around here.\n\n461\n00:25:15.674 --> 00:25:20.390\nSo Ronnie I know the good folks out there\nwill be waiting with bated breath to see\n\n462\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.350\nthe conclusion of using\nCrypto Algorithms in their systems.\n\n463\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.860\nThat being said,\nthank you for stopping by.\n\n464\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.510\nWe thank our good audience there for\njoining us and\n\n465\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.530\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n466\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.090\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n467\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.903\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n468\n00:25:32.903 --> 00:25:35.774\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n469\n00:25:35.774 -->

00:00:12.004\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.707\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:18.400\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.627\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nknow that this is actually a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:23.204\nI missed the last episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:26.142\nBut in the previous episode,\nyou had Ronnie and Dan,\n\n9\n00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:29.536\nand they were explaining, well,\nhow to use cryptography and\n\n10\n00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:33.278\nalgorithms associated with\nthe different forms of cryptography.\n\n11\n00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:36.702\nSpecifically, you were looking\nat hashing algorithms, how and\n\n12\n00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.640\nwhen it would be applicable to go ahead\nand use that particular algorithm.\n\n13\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.916\nWith us today, we have Mr.\n\n14\n00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.871\nRonnie Wong in the studios to go ahead and\nexpand on this topic.\n\n15\n00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:46.184\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:48.411\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show, Cherokee.\n\n17\n00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.884\nAnd glad that you're back, as we\ncontinue on through the arena of, well,\n\n18\n00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:57.075\ncryptography inside of our\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals show.\n\n19\n00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.367\nAnd what we're taking a look at today,\nof course, is the idea of understanding\n\n20\n00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.519\ncryptography right at the very\nbeginning and the basics.\n\n21\n00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.622\nRemember that when we start off with\nsaying that we're gonna try and\n\n22\n00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:10.855\nachieve the CCNA in cybersecurity,\n\n23\n00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:15.318\neven though most of us are going to end\nup having either the CCENT already or\n\n24\n00:01:15.318 --> 00:01:19.770\nyou probably already went through\nthe CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n25\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.055\nAnd that may be your certification\nbackground to give you all the networking\n\n26\n00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.942\nbackground, and you've kinda\ngone over these concepts before.\n\n27\n00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:29.772\nBut for the CCNA CyberOps,\nit really is just two exams, and\n\n28\n00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:33.310\nthey don't require you\nto have a prerequisite.\n\n29\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.998\nSo it is kind of a little bit\nmore baby steps at this point,\n\n30\n00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:38.575\nbut we're just trying to make\nsure you understand some\n\n31\n00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:42.461\nof those concepts that we have to get\nthrough, especially in the security realm.\n\n32\n00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.573\nSo here, in this instance,\nthat's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n33\n00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:48.411\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\nif you've already been looking at hashing,\n\n34\n00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:50.250\nwhat do we have in store for us today?\n\n35\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.342\nSymmetric, asymmetric,\n\n36\n00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:54.526\nI have a feeling those two are gonna be\npretty key words coming up for this topic.\n\n37\n00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:58.747\n&gt;&gt; They really are, and that's really\nwhat we're gonna take a look at in this\n\n38\n00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:03.571\nparticular episode is trying to make sure\nthat we understand the differences between\n\n39\n00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:08.330\nthe use of symmetric algorithms as well\nas asymmetric algorithms in cryptography.\n\n40\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.927\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthe importance of them as well, and\n\n41\n00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:13.432\nhow we actually compare them and\ncontrast them a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:16.973\nAnd make sure that we understand when\nwe use them, which is also key and\n\n43\n00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:20.400\nimportant for\neverything that we actually have to do.\n\n44\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.520\nSo, when it comes down to the idea of just\nencryption itself, we've already said\n\n45\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.760\nthat normally, when we use encryption,\nit's usually for a couple of purposes.\n\n46\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.440\nOne of course, like a hashing algorithm,\n\n47\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.590\ncan help us to verify who\nsent the message itself.\n\n48\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.010\nIt can also verify the ID of\nthe integrity of the message.\n\n49\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.900\nAnd that is because the algorithm that\nit generates allows us to take data,\n\n50\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.380\nrun it through that hashing algorithm and\nwhatever the output is that we call\n\n51\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.300\na hash value, that output will\nbe unique to that combination.\n\n52\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.473\nSo unique that the change of one character\nitself, inside of the data itself, and\n\n53\n00:02:57.473 --> 00:02:59.891\nyou run through that\nhashing algorithm again,\n\n54\n00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.325\nit will give you a completely\ndifferent value.\n\n55\n00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:06.370\nAnd that is because when the hashing\nalgorithm is based off of some type of\n\n56\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.413\nmathematics, that allows you to be able\nto see the changes in what we call\n\n57\n00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:12.120\nan avalanche effect.\n\n58\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.065\nSo the changes are so monumental just from\nthe change of one particular digit or\n\n59\n00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.395\ncharacter or space or\nwhatever you want to do,\n\n60\n00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:20.750\nthat the numbers look\ncompletely different.\n\n61\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.537\nThere's no derivative that\nyou can find from that, and\n\n62\n00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.212\nthat's what makes it so unique.\n\n63\n00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Now, of course there are little caveats\nto all these different instances, and\n\n64\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.939\nhashing really isn't any different.\n\n65\n00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.200\nSo, like Ronnie was mentioning,\nthat one-way hash function,\n\n66\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.060\njust remember there is\nan exploit associated with that.\n\n67\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.060\nAnd like he said,\n\n68\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.400\nit needs to be unique, for the output for\neach individual sting of binary.\n\n69\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.690\nBut if it's not, and it happens to be the\nsame, and that's what attackers sometimes\n\n70\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.010\nare looking for, remember,\nthat's called a hash collision.\n\n71\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.810\nI don't know if that's on the objectives,\nbut still a good one to know.\n\n72\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually one of those neat\nterms that you will end up finding out,\n\n73\n00:03:58.313 --> 00:04:02.478\nand this is how attackers really do\nend up attacking hash values more than\n\n74\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:03.449\nanything else.\n\n75\n00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.953\nIs that somewhere along the line, you're\nnot the first one to use whatever your\n\n76\n00:04:06.953 --> 00:04:09.213\npassword is,\neven though you might think you are.\n\n77\n00:04:09.213 --> 00:04:11.812\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you're probably not, right?\n\n78\n00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:17.027\nSo what has probably happened is somewhere\nin this time, somebody has taken,\n\n79\n00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:22.953\nlet's say, MD5 hashing, and they've taken\nthe entire Oxford English Dictionary and\n\n80\n00:04:22.953 --> 00:04:26.449\nthey've created hash values\nto go along with that.\n\n81\n00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.628\nWell, now, all they're doing is they're\ntaking your hash value that they were able\n\n82\n00:04:30.628 --> 00:04:34.530\nto capture, even though it might\nnot reveal the password right away.\n\n83\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.176\nIs that they just run that against\ntheir list of hash values, and\n\n84\n00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.597\nthere is a possibility of a match.\n\n85\n00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:43.090\nWhen there is a match, that's that hashing\ncollision that Cherokee's talking about.\n\n86\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.512\nFrom that point, there's a couple of\ndifferent things that they can do with\n\n87\n00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:49.186\nthat to actually gain maybe\neither the password itself, or\n\n88\n00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.530\nto actually use a hash value.\n\n89\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.970\nAnd depending on the techniques that's\nused on the login, that's all they might\n\n90\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.050\nhave to provide is that same hashing value\nagain, and they're able to get back in.\n\n91\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.545\nSo it really is, very much so,\nsomething that helps us, like I said,\n\n92\n00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:09.350\nto verify the identity or to really check\nthe ID of the contents itself as far\n\n93\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.278\nas the integrity of the data.\n\n94\n00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.286\nBut what about the data itself?\n\n95\n00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:16.450\nIt's not really protecting\nthe data itself.\n\n96\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.478\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n97\n00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:20.924\n&gt;&gt; So when we start sending\nmessages across networks, and\n\n98\n00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:24.737\nit's supposed to go from my\nmachine to Cherokee's machine,\n\n99\n00:05:24.737 --> 00:05:28.281\neven in our small network\nright here at ITProTV studios.\n\n100\n00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:33.286\nReally, Cherokee may not exactly\nknow how it actually got from my\n\n101\n00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:38.658\nlaptop right here over to hers two\nfeet away, maybe 18 inches away.\n\n102\n00:05:38.658 --> 00:05:42.065\nBecause if we go across, whether we're\ntalking about a wired connection,\n\n103\n00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:45.686\nwhether we're talking about a wireless\nconnection, it goes through a series of\n\n104\n00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:49.008\ndifferent components before it\nactually gets to Cherokee's computer.\n\n105\n00:05:49.008 --> 00:05:52.797\nAnd the return path back also goes\nthrough those components as well.\n\n106\n00:05:52.797 --> 00:05:56.990\nSo, along that path,\nsomeone could intercept that message.\n\n107\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.236\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; They could read it, and\n\n108\n00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:02.146\nthen at that point, if there's anything\nthat's actually valuable in it,\n\n109\n00:06:02.146 --> 00:06:04.210\nthey now have access to that.\n\n110\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.460\nCherokee may end up\ngetting the same result.\n\n111\n00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.830\nBut then, at the same time,\nsomebody else got it as well, and\n\n112\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.960\nthat's something we want to prevent.\n\n113\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.640\nSo the idea of using encryption is\nreally a big part of today's networks\n\n114\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.910\nbecause we really don't wanna expose\nany more information than we need to\n\n115\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.260\nwhen we start sending data to each other.\n\n116\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.060\nSo that is why encryption is a very\nimportant part of what we end up using\n\n117\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.180\nin today's world.\n\n118\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.140\nAnd so, when we start talking about that,\n\n119\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.530\nthere's really two forms of encryption\nthat we use to help us out.\n\n120\n00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.330\nAnd one of course is what we\ncall symmetric key encryption.\n\n121\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.730\nAnd the other one is what we call\nasymmetric key encryption as well.\n\n122\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.100\nNow, you'll hear different terms for\nit everywhere.\n\n123\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.508\nAnd you gotta know some of these different\nterms a lot of the time when you're\n\n124\n00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:47.849\nactually dealing with this.\n\n125\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.080\nIn generic sense,\nif you don't hear somebody say,\n\n126\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.908\nthat's symmetric key encryption,\nyou may hear them calling it the same-key\n\n127\n00:06:56.908 --> 00:07:00.480\nencryption or single-key encryption.\n\n128\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.060\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n129\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.828\nWell that is when we start talking about\nthat there's one key, one particular\n\n130\n00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:11.669\ntype of encryption key, that we use along\nwith the encryption algorithm that we\n\n131\n00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.315\nnot only encrypt the data with, but\nwe also decrypt the data with it as well.\n\n132\n00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:18.315\nYou're saying, hey,\nthat sounds a little bit confusing.\n\n133\n00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:19.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't.\n\n134\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Don't let it be, I mean,\n\n135\n00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.700\nreally it's just as simple,\nlike Ronnie just explained.\n\n136\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.135\nTake it for face value here,\nthere's not any kind of hidden meaning.\n\n137\n00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:30.924\nBecause if you think about the word\nsymmetry, where it's equal on both sides,\n\n138\n00:07:30.924 --> 00:07:32.800\nwell, just kinda think of it that way.\n\n139\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.972\nLike Ronnie said, you have the same\nkey that’s being utilized on both\n\n140\n00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:37.388\nsides of that communication.\n\n141\n00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:39.558\nSo think of it that way,\nit’s pretty straightforward.\n\n142\n00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds pretty straightforward,\nbut let’s go ahead and\n\n143\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.188\nalso see what it can look like, too,\njust to make sure that we do this.\n\n144\n00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:48.864\nSo, let’s take a look at my computer and\nthat will also help us out, at least,\n\n145\n00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.111\nI hope it will help us out.\n\n146\n00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:52.452\nNormally, when we start\ntalking about encryption,\n\n147\n00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:55.323\nit's because we need to send\nsomething to a receiver on one side.\n\n148\n00:07:55.323 --> 00:08:00.096\nEvery time we actually use some type of\nencryption We are taking something that\n\n149\n00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:00.686\nwe know.\n\n150\n00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:04.700\nTechnically, we call it creator text or\nplain text a lot of the times.\n\n151\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.740\nAnd when we run it through some encryption\nalgorithm with an encryption key,\n\n152\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.530\nwe are creating what we call a cipher\ntext value instead or a cipher text.\n\n153\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.360\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n154\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.060\nWe're changing something that we know\ninto something that we don't know and\n\n155\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.630\nthat's essentially what it is.\n\n156\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.340\nAnd that's all based off of the key value.\n\n157\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.210\nSo, over here on the left-hand side,\n\n158\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.830\nI try to draw in a fairly mathematical\nequation that should help us out.\n\n159\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.280\nI don't know if it always does.\n\n160\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.950\nBut, we take our plain text data,\nright up here and\n\n161\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.600\nwe run it through an encryption algorithm.\n\n162\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.320\nNow, remember that this is where\nit becomes a little bit tricky in\n\n163\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.110\nmost people's minds as you\nbegin with the encryption here.\n\n164\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.950\nRight.\n\n165\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.425\nThe encryption algorithm most people go,\nit's got to be top secret,\n\n166\n00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.050\nnobody should know this stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.120\nEverybody knows what these\nencryption algorithms are, so\n\n168\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.310\nhow does that make it secret?\n\n169\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.650\nHow does that make it anything and\nthe reason is,\n\n170\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.640\nit doesn't make it secret, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.590\nAn encryption algorithm in all intents and\npurposes Is really\n\n172\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.550\nsome type of mathematical problem\nthat can not be easily solved.\n\n173\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.310\nThere are such complex mathematical\nproblems that you and I,\n\n174\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.050\neven with a calculator,\nwe're not gonna solve it very easily.\n\n175\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.821\nEven with with a computer,\nit's not going to be solved very easily.\n\n176\n00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:18.737\nI'm not gonna say it's impossible, But\n\n177\n00:09:18.737 --> 00:09:20.879\nit comes as close to\nimpossible if it comes up.\n\n178\n00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:24.023\n&gt;&gt; No, just looking at books like\nBruce Schneier, or the ones,\n\n179\n00:09:24.023 --> 00:09:26.820\nApplied Cryptography, the ones he writes.\n\n180\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.392\nYou look at some of those symbols and\nyou're looking at these equations.\n\n181\n00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:30.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n182\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.568\nyou're just like what does\nthat symbol even mean.\n\n183\n00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:35.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what is it that makes this unique\n\n184\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.420\nthen, to ensure that it actually\nis going to remain unique.\n\n185\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.660\nIs really this idea of\nthis encryption key.\n\n186\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.510\nNow, like I said, analogies\nare kind of what makes it for me.\n\n187\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.240\nSo, it's just like anybody else does,\n\n188\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.840\nif you have a favorite dish that's cooked,\nyou go to a favorite restaurant.\n\n189\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.320\nWhatever dish it is that you love.\n\n190\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.000\nAnd then you go to another restaurant and\nyou order that same dish and\n\n191\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.900\nit's like, why isn't it as good\nas the other restaurant there,\n\n192\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.180\nit's the same exact dish,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n193\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.710\nSo, one of my favorite dishes is Chicken\nParmesan, I don't know why, but I love it.\n\n194\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.040\nSo I have that,\nI love to order that particular dish, but\n\n195\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.900\nI've gone to restaurants where it's good,\nsome of it's bad.\n\n196\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.210\nThere's one restaurant where I'm like,\n\n197\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.780\nthis is the way that\nChicken Parmesan should taste.\n\n198\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.280\nAnd that's it.\n\n199\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.000\nWell, what is it about that one thing?\n\n200\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.920\nWell, I call it the idea\nof the secret sauce.\n\n201\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.930\nSo, everybody has their sauce.\n\n202\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.040\nEverybody does whatever they do.\n\n203\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.670\nBut an encryption key is the secret\nsauce to an encryption algorithm.\n\n204\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.380\nOkay?\n\n205\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.300\nIt is that unique value.\n\n206\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.650\nIt is that unique flavor.\n\n207\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.010\nIt's that unique whatever it is\nthat you want to put it into\n\n208\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.410\nthat they are not gonna give up.\n\n209\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.810\nSo, think about Kentucky Fried Chicken,\nright.\n\n210\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.870\nIt's the Colonel's original recipe.\n\n211\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:54.030\nIt's the 12 spices and ingredients that\nhe's not supposed to reveal to you.\n\n212\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.530\nAnd that is actually what we have here.\n\n213\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.020\nSo you add all that together and\n\n214\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.870\nthat gives us the idea of\nwhat we call CipherText.\n\n215\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.400\nNow, when we have that\nCipherText data then,\n\n216\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.210\nwe can now transfer that CipherText\ndata over to the receiver.\n\n217\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.190\nAnd even if we do so, we're still in\ntrouble at this point for the receiver.\n\n218\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:20.130\nIf the receiver does not have\na copy of that encryption key.\n\n219\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.750\nIf they have a copy of\nthat encryption key,\n\n220\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.140\nthey can begin this idea\nof the CipherText and\n\n221\n00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.860\nthis time running it through\nthis encryption algorithm.\n\n222\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.800\nBut when they do it again it\nwill decrypt the data instead.\n\n223\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.030\nSo, at this point,\ninstead of calling it an encryption key,\n\n224\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.990\nyou can call it the decryption\nkey if you want to.\n\n225\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Deciphering.\n\n226\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.060\n&gt;&gt; Yep, deciphering,\nwhich is changing it, right.\n\n227\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.370\nSo, you know what\nthe secret ingredient is.\n\n228\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.940\nEverybody knows what the Encryption\nAlgorithm is, but off of your instance\n\n229\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.140\nright, nobody should actually know what\nthis CipherText data is, and you won't\n\n230\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.250\nknow unless you also have that secret key\nwhich is the same as the encryption key.\n\n231\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.150\nAnd once you to do, it can change it\nback into plain text data for us.\n\n232\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.390\nAnd that is when your machine and\n\n233\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.970\nyou then can take advantage of reading\nwhatever data that it is sent to you.\n\n234\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.880\nNow, Cherokee,\nin looking at just this simple drawing,\n\n235\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.160\nat least I think it's\na relatively simple drawing here.\n\n236\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.690\nWhere is the weakness\nin a system like this?\n\n237\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.640\n&gt;&gt; So, looking at this diagram, I can\nvisually determine that I don't have any\n\n238\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.430\ninstruction on really how to distribute\n&gt;&gt; That encryption key,\n\n239\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.520\nhow do I get it to you?\n\n240\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.470\nAm I walking over to you and\nhanding it to you?\n\n241\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.010\n&gt;&gt; If you did, that would probably be\none of the safest things in the world\n\n242\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.310\nfor us to do.\n\n243\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.990\nBut what if you decide to send that\nencryption key via email, or via an email.\n\n244\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.610\nWell, now, it's sent across and\nit's just an email attachment.\n\n245\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.490\nSomebody could go hey,\nthat's an email with an attachment on it.\n\n246\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.615\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what that attachment actually\n\n247\n00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:56.235\nis and they pull it out and\nit's part of that encryption key.\n\n248\n00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:58.340\n&gt;&gt; Compromised.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and now it's compromised.\n\n249\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.780\nSo, if we are to do this successfully\nbetween the sender and receiver,\n\n250\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.780\nto keep the data secret and\nhidden between those two machines,we\n\n251\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.460\nhave to have a secure way\nto be able to do this.\n\n252\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.820\nSo, Cherokee mentioned one way.\n\n253\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.960\nShe could just simply say all right\nRonnie, here is the encryption key.\n\n254\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.360\nDo not show it to anybody else but here\nit is to unlock the data that I sent you,\n\n255\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.490\nand that is one way that we can do that.\n\n256\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.940\nSo, that is probably one of\nthe most secure ways to do it.\n\n257\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.760\nThe other one is of course,\n\n258\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.680\nis to actually encrypt this or\nto actually hide this in something else.\n\n259\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.080\nSo, for example, Cherokee may not do that\nbut may instead actually go, look I'm\n\n260\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.648\nnot going to stick around until you know\nRonnie is busy in a meeting or whatever.\n\n261\n00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:41.790\nI'm not gonna wait to hand\nit to him to know, but\n\n262\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.700\nwhat I'm gonna do is put it into a drop\nbox here that Ronnie can pick it up.\n\n263\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.770\nSo it might be a locked drop box and then\nI know at the end of the day I just go\n\n264\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.070\nthere, I unlock it and I pull that\nencryption key out and there it is.\n\n265\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.670\nI have the data and\n\n266\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.800\nnobody else should be able to tamper\nwith that in that particular sense.\n\n267\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.980\nWhen you start to take a look at the idea\nof using some type of encryption here,\n\n268\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.140\nespecially a symmetric key encryption.\n\n269\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.160\nI have to say that very carefully because\nthe other one that we're gonna talk about\n\n270\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.100\nis asymmetric, but this one is when you\ntalk about the same key on both sides.\n\n271\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.760\nOne used to encrypt, and\n\n272\n00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.700\none key used to decrypt, this is\nkind of the value that we have here.\n\n273\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.850\nAnd this is really very strong in\nthe process of what it's using,\n\n274\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.510\nbecause these encryption algorithms\nare actually getting stronger, day by day\n\n275\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.490\nas they realize the weaker encryptions are\nnow being cracked a little bit more often,\n\n276\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.430\nthey continue to get stronger and new ones\nare actually being developed as well.\n\n277\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.660\nBut, it is very common that you are gonna\nsee a type of encryption like this\n\n278\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.420\nused every day.\n\n279\n00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.590\nIn anything that you actually transfer,\n\n280\n00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:50.172\nthis is part of that process\nthat you'll see, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:51.160\nAll right, so\n\n282\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.280\nthat is kind of a good basic understanding\nof symmetric key encryption then, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.850\nSo, let's talk about the other one here,\nwhich is a bit more complex, Cherokee.\n\n284\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.830\nAnd this one may actually confuse\npeople a little bit more.\n\n285\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.330\nSo, Cherokee,\n\n286\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:11.340\nwhen you hear the term asymmetric key\nencryption, what are we talking about?\n\n287\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.443\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like a Picasso-looking portrait.\n\n288\n00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:15.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something that's not completely\n\n289\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.180\nsymmetric, so it's not gonna be identical,\nor the same, on both sides.\n\n290\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's kinda the idea here.\n\n291\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.710\nNow this is, where, again,\n\n292\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.800\nif you're new, this is going to be\na little bit more confusing right.\n\n293\n00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.420\nIf you've already seen this,\nthis is old hat to you we understand, but\n\n294\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.380\nat the same time,\nwe still need to go back and review this.\n\n295\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.600\nAsymmetric key encryption says this,\n\n296\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.980\nokay, we still need to do a change\nplain text data and decipher text data.\n\n297\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.590\nOkay, that’s still a given\nwe still need to do that.\n\n298\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.180\nBut asymmetric encryption says,\nto make this safer.\n\n299\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.882\nWe are actually gonna have a key pair,\nokay.\n\n300\n00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:55.185\nOne key of that key pair they're gonna be\nlinked together to where one key is used\n\n301\n00:15:55.185 --> 00:16:00.505\nfor encrypting, and another key is used\nfor decrypting the same information.\n\n302\n00:16:00.505 --> 00:16:04.262\nNow, how does that actually work though.\n\n303\n00:16:04.262 --> 00:16:08.355\nWhat in the world do you do to make\nthis work, especially in a sending and\n\n304\n00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:10.470\nreceiving situation?\n\n305\n00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.850\nWell the way that this\nends up working out,\n\n306\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.760\nis that you actually give\naway one of those keys.\n\n307\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.304\nYou share that key with others who\nneed to send you encrypted data,\n\n308\n00:16:22.304 --> 00:16:24.779\nis the way that this one goes.\n\n309\n00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:27.788\nAnd then, once you actually\nget that encrypted data back,\n\n310\n00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:31.270\nthen you're the only one\nthat has a key to unlock it.\n\n311\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.240\nSo, it is very important that we\nunderstand this process as well.\n\n312\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.380\nIt is a little bit harder to understand,\n\n313\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.080\nbut hopefully, I think that after seeing\nmy diagram, It will help a little bit, but\n\n314\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.710\nwe'll see here,\nif this confuses you or not.\n\n315\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.990\nOkay so\nlet's take a look at my machine, and\n\n316\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.668\nhopefully this will also help us out too.\n\n317\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.914\nWhen it begins when we start talking\nabout asymmetric encryption,\n\n318\n00:16:54.914 --> 00:16:59.831\nokay, your machine can generate\na private and a public key okay?\n\n319\n00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:01.970\nIt can actually end up doing that.\n\n320\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.060\nNow, that private and\n\n321\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.100\npublic key is that your machine says,\nI need the encrypt data.\n\n322\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.020\nI need decrypt data as well.\n\n323\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.000\nThe private key is never going\nto be exposed to anybody.\n\n324\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.860\nYou don't show that to anybody else.\n\n325\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.580\nThat stays on your machine,\nit stays with you.\n\n326\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.460\nYou protect it for\n\n327\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.471\neverything that it's worth, because it\nreally does identify your own machine.\n\n328\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.130\nThe public key though, is something\nthat we can share to other people,\n\n329\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.310\nany machine that we want to on the planet,\nanybody that we want to.\n\n330\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.870\nNow when we send that public key.\n\n331\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.920\nLet's say that I send this over to\nCherokee, and she's in some other country.\n\n332\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.010\nWell, Cherokee might actually be\nreceiving multiple public keys.\n\n333\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.380\nSo she looks at it.\n\n334\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.810\nHow does she know that that key belongs\nto, well, me and my machine, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.660\nWell, the way that it's done, is that\nwe're gonna talk about this in a separate\n\n336\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:57.260\nprocess here, but they actually talk\nabout a digital signed public key.\n\n337\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.870\nAnd that means that there is\na verification on it that this key\n\n338\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.060\ncould only have come from me.\n\n339\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.690\nThat's the way it works.\n\n340\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.660\nYour machine then does a process\nwhere it can prove that happened.\n\n341\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.692\nOnce it does,\nit stores this key on the sending machine.\n\n342\n00:18:14.692 --> 00:18:19.652\nNow, once it actually stores the key\non the sending machine It just stays\n\n343\n00:18:19.652 --> 00:18:21.660\nthere, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.930\nNow, Cherokee, now that it's actually\nthere, what do we use that key for?\n\n345\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, with that key, the sending key,\n\n346\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.240\nthe public key,\nit's used to encrypt information.\n\n347\n00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually sends it encrypted\nback to me, but only to me, right?\n\n348\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.253\nSo if Cherokee begins to type out\na message and she knows she's sending it\n\n349\n00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:45.413\nback to me, she doesn't use Bob's\npublic key to send it back to Ronnie.\n\n350\n00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:48.830\nShe doesn't use Stan's public\nkey to send it back to Ronnie.\n\n351\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.290\nShe uses Ronnie's public key, I'm talking\nabout myself in the third person,\n\n352\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.730\ngo figure.\n\n353\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.300\nSo, she uses my public\nkey to actually do that.\n\n354\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.600\nSo if she has data, and we'll represent\nthat right here to send back to me.\n\n355\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.590\nWell then, she goes through, and,\nshe finds my own Public Key and,\n\n356\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.549\nshe encrypts that data,\nbecause the Public Key is only\n\n357\n00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:17.391\nreally in this particular instance\nused for encrypting the data.\n\n358\n00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:22.860\nNow once she does that, it's like this,\nwhere you're essentially locking that up.\n\n359\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.833\nAnd that lock has only one\nkey that will open it, okay.\n\n360\n00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:33.750\nAnd that one key is represented on\nthis side by the green key here.\n\n361\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:39.560\nShe takes that piece of data and she\ntransmits it back to Ronnie, back to me.\n\n362\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.170\nAnd then on my side I know\nthat there's only one key\n\n363\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.490\nthat will open anything that\nis encrypted with what?\n\n364\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.920\nMy public key.\n\n365\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.680\nThose are the only pairs\nthat you have locked in.\n\n366\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.830\nSo I've changed a public key into making\nit look like a pad lock of some sort.\n\n367\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.590\nBecause I think that makes more sense is\nthat that public key is really more of\n\n368\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.790\na lock than it is a key.\n\n369\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.780\nSo we do what?\n\n370\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.150\nWe take the private key,\nwhich then unlocks the data and\n\n371\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:13.040\nnow you have the unlocking and\nnow you have the data existing itself.\n\n372\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.707\nAnd then at this point,\nlook at that I've drawn myself as a women.\n\n373\n00:20:15.707 --> 00:20:17.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n374\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.250\nNow, the person can actually read\nthe data itself and be able to see that.\n\n375\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.740\nSo it's a very important\nprocess that we have here.\n\n376\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.417\n&gt;&gt; And you're not gonna get too\nupset if that email transmission is\n\n377\n00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:32.449\ncompromised because it's encrypted and\n\n378\n00:20:32.449 --> 00:20:36.615\nyou don't really care who has\naccess to your public key.\n\n379\n00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:40.924\nI mean, in certain situations you would\nbut it's not the end of the word because,\n\n380\n00:20:40.924 --> 00:20:45.290\nlike you said, only your private key\ncan decipher, decrypt that message.\n\n381\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:51.190\nSo you see that it is a bit more\nsecure in that sense than symmetric.\n\n382\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.460\n&gt;&gt; That actually is a very good point,\nCherokee.\n\n383\n00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.380\nThat if somebody were to,\nlet's say in the middle right here,\n\n384\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.440\nintercept this particular lock key.\n\n385\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.070\nAnd they also had a copy of my\npublic key on their machine,\n\n386\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.830\nthey might think that they can just\ninsert the public key in here, and\n\n387\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.760\nthen they would be good and ready to go.\n\n388\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.270\nBut the public key does\nnot unlock a public key.\n\n389\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.700\nIt just doesn't do that.\n\n390\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.980\nOnly a private key unlocks\na public key type of encryption.\n\n391\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.210\nSo even if they had that,\nthey still had that matching value,\n\n392\n00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.930\nit just really actually encrypts\nit again is what it does Instead.\n\n393\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.720\nWhereas the Private Key, which we don't\never want exposed out to anybody else,\n\n394\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.560\nis the only one that decrypts the\ninformation so that it can be read again.\n\n395\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.010\nAnd this is why you see it, let me see\nif I can zoom out here a little bit.\n\n396\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.163\nSee how asymmetric it actually\nreally looks here on this side?\n\n397\n00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:46.542\nThe only thing that you have on this\nside is of course that Public Key and\n\n398\n00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:50.270\nover here on this side, notice\nthe opening or the decryption of it.\n\n399\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.530\nSo the sending and receiving side, if you\nvisualize it, they're actually backward.\n\n400\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.050\nWe always give somebody who\nwants to encrypt the data\n\n401\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.440\nthe key to encrypt the data.\n\n402\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.500\nAnd then bring it back to my side.\n\n403\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, we've got all\nthese different options available to us.\n\n404\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.680\nHow do I know which one to choose?\n\n405\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.390\nSymmetric, asymmetric.\n\n406\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.330\n&gt;&gt; That actually is a very good point and\nquestion here, and\n\n407\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.690\nit's kind of a list of different things\nthat you have to realize as well okay?\n\n408\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.630\nSo, when it comes down to the difference\nhere and what has be done and\n\n409\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.700\nthe way it's done,\n\n410\n00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.910\nis actually done by a couple of different\nfactors that we can take a look at.\n\n411\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.140\nNow, of course,\njust like any other exam that you'll have,\n\n412\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.690\nyou want to make sure that you can name\nsome of these symmetric key algorithms.\n\n413\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.595\nI did not list every single\none of them out there so\n\n414\n00:22:33.595 --> 00:22:36.580\ndo your favorite search engine.\n\n415\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.550\nMake sure you look up some\nmetric key algorithms and\n\n416\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.020\ntake a look at a list of them.\n\n417\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.270\nAnd you'll actually see\nthe ones that are most popular.\n\n418\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.620\nThose are probably gonna be the ones\nthat are supported by Cisco.\n\n419\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.230\nDon't get me wrong, they probably support\nall of them but kinda make sure you know\n\n420\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:54.100\nwhich ones are actually very much used,\nand very much popular at this point.\n\n421\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.630\nAnd the same thing with asymmetric.\n\n422\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.260\nThere's a handful of them to,\nyou gotta make sure you know some of them.\n\n423\n00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.030\nNow, one of the key values here is,\nis it slower, or is it faster here, okay.\n\n424\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.550\nSymmetric key algorithms\nare always faster.\n\n425\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.540\nWell, why, well, think about it.\n\n426\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.310\nI'm only using one key to encrypt and\n\n427\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.550\ndecrypt, it's much faster than\nthe math that it takes to go, we're\n\n428\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.415\ngonna take two different keys that are\nrelated but only related to each other.\n\n429\n00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:23.380\nThat if we do this one has\nto be able to decrypt and\n\n430\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.700\none has to be able to encrypt here.\n\n431\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.060\nThat's a gigantic mathematical process.\n\n432\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.020\nThat's a lot of math here okay?\n\n433\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.040\nSo asymmetric is slower.\n\n434\n00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.610\nWhen it comes down to this idea.\n\n435\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.787\nThis is where it comes down because a lot\nof this also has to do with the fact that\n\n436\n00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:44.606\nas far as encryption goes,\nperformance is a big factor of this right?\n\n437\n00:23:44.606 --> 00:23:48.685\nIf it didn't matter how long it took for\nsomething to get from my machine over\n\n438\n00:23:48.685 --> 00:23:53.211\nto Cherokee's machine, then we would use\nthe strongest encryption in the world and\n\n439\n00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:57.250\nit get's over to Cherokee's machine and\nit says decrypting in 15 days.\n\n440\n00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.531\nAnd Cherokee's okay that seems to be neat.\n\n441\n00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:04.652\nBut Fairly useless cuz in 15 days I'm not\neven gonna be concerned about what this\n\n442\n00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:05.315\nmessage is.\n\n443\n00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:10.660\nSo there always has to be this idea of\nspeed or performance that's included in.\n\n444\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.820\n&gt;&gt; A bit of give and take there.\n\n445\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.420\n&gt;&gt; It is, so what do you do?\n\n446\n00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.460\nYou take, well, a lot of data.\n\n447\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.410\nOkay, so notice this one,\nI talked about used for\n\n448\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.580\nencrypting the data payload itself.\n\n449\n00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.770\nAnd you have a lot of data to encrypt you\nmight hear the term bulk key encryption,\n\n450\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.330\nyou have a lot of data to encrypt you use\na symmetric key to actually encrypt that\n\n451\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:35.380\ndata, but if you have relatively small\ndata a small amount of data to encrypt,\n\n452\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.250\nwe actually use what we call well\nthe idea here of the asymmetric, so\n\n453\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.560\nasymmetric is good for things like this.\n\n454\n00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.120\nRemember that what Cherokee told us was a\nweakness behind symmetric key encryption,\n\n455\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.410\nso remember that it's actually\nthe way that we exchanged this key.\n\n456\n00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.480\n&gt;&gt; How I'm getting it to you.\n\n457\n00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep, how you're getting the key to me.\n\n458\n00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:58.450\nWell what I can do instead is, hey, this\nis what I'll do with the key data itself,\n\n459\n00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:05.160\nthe encryption key is I'll send that\nto Cherokee using her public key and\n\n460\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.740\nthat way nobody can really intercept\nthat value very easily and decrypt it.\n\n461\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.540\nSo a small amount of data especially for\n\n462\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.080\nthings like key values, then we use\nsomething like asymmetric key encryption\n\n463\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.180\nwhere there's a gigantic amount of data,\nwe use the idea of symmetric key too.\n\n464\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.850\nThese algorithms are constantly improving.\n\n465\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.250\nThey really are and that's because again,\n\n466\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.190\ntoday in the realm of cyber\nsecurity you've got to.\n\n467\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:36.640\nThere's just no room to say we can\nhang onto this for a long, long time.\n\n468\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.830\nIt's just growing by leaps and bounds.\n\n469\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.050\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of them, we don't even\nknow about because they might be\n\n470\n00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.090\nmilitary initiatives that just\nhaven't been released yet.\n\n471\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true, they're kind of\na not actually put out there yet but\n\n472\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.020\nremember that for\nus symmetric key algorithms,\n\n473\n00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.840\nthey're actually improved by\nincreasing the key length.\n\n474\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:01.953\nSo for example if you were using AES\n256 when there's versions that are 512,\n\n475\n00:26:01.953 --> 00:26:07.980\n1,024, 4,096, 2,048,\nthere's much longer key lengths.\n\n476\n00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.360\nWhich means the secret sauce\nis very much more complex.\n\n477\n00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.190\nBut this one, it improves it by\nadding complexity to the model.\n\n478\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.060\nAnd this is where you stop depending\non the idea of like the public key and\n\n479\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.610\nhow you get it get it to\nthem in that sense and\n\n480\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.970\nthere's actually one that really goes very\nconvoluted but makes it much more secure\n\n481\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.410\nwhere you're not really actually\nexchanging the public keys at all.\n\n482\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.580\nWhat you're actually doing in, you're\nactually doing a two way exchange where\n\n483\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.430\nyou go ahead and lock that data and\nI send it to Cherokee.\n\n484\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.100\nCherokee just actually puts her\nown lock on that data as well.\n\n485\n00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.660\nSends it back to me, so\nI can unlock my key and\n\n486\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.410\nthen I can send it back to Cherokee\nwith her own key locking the data.\n\n487\n00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.220\nSo, it's a very convoluted process.\n\n488\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Obfuscation\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n489\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.680\n&gt;&gt; And diffusion.\n\n490\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.060\nSome very common terms when you're\nreading about these topics.\n\n491\n00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.690\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it really is, but\n\n492\n00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:05.180\nits complexity is what makes this one more\n&gt;&gt; As far as improving it's strength and\n\n493\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.630\nit's character of things.\n\n494\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.020\nBut that's when you'd actually use one\nversus the other, when you start taking\n\n495\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.690\na look at this idea of which one to use,\nand which one you're actually gonna see.\n\n496\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.420\nLater on, we're actually gonna see\nwhere this all combines together\n\n497\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.110\ninto a couple of different things.\n\n498\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.900\nAnd a term that we call\na cypher suite as well.\n\n499\n00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.570\nBut that's for another show,\nyeah, that's right.\n\n500\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:29.970\nAnd that is gonna be for another show, but\nhopefully this gives you a good basis for\n\n501\n00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.500\nunderstanding the use of symmetric\nversus asymmetric key encryptions.\n\n502\n00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.060\n&gt;&gt; I think so, we were able to really just\nlook at those two differences there and\n\n503\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.250\nto have a good understanding so\n\n504\n00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.150\nthat we're not completely\nblindsided when we enter the exam.\n\n505\n00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.510\nUnderstanding symmetric,\nhaving that same key.\n\n506\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.420\nAnd then looking at asymmetric,\nhaving our private key and our public key.\n\n507\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.790\nSo thank you for joining us today and\n\n508\n00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.060\nexplaining the differences between\nthose and when we would be using them.\n\n509\n00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.280\nAnd thank you guys for\ntuning in, but stay tuned,\n\n510\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.080\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n511\n00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.710\nI think we're out of time for this\nepisode, so we'll go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n512\n00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.190\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose\n\n513\n00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n514\n00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.978\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n515\n00:28:08.978 -->

00:00:08.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.740\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.110\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your showhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.300\nIn the past couple of episodes,\nwe've been talking about cryptography and\n\n8\n00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600\ndifferent algorithms that we can use.\n\n9\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220\nSpecifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be really focusing\n\n10\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.220\non digital certificate and\ndigital certificate creation.\n\n11\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.793\nWith us to explain this topic today\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong in studio.\n\n12\n00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:38.150\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.092\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back in\nthe studio, Cherokee, as we continue on\n\n14\n00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:46.140\nlearning a little bit more about of\ncourse the different types of encryption.\n\n15\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.035\nAs well as talking about some of\nthis can be very important to us.\n\n16\n00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.140\nIt's a little bit later\non in the process of it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.900\nWhich is gonna be the public\nkey infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.810\nAnd we're talking about\na little part of that.\n\n19\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.594\nThat we really need to make\nsure that we understand,\n\n20\n00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:04.532\nwhich is the idea of being able to create\na digital signature and what goes in that.\n\n21\n00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:07.767\nThere's a lot of people that have\na miss understanding about this,\n\n22\n00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.221\nCherokee, when it comes\ndown to those documents.\n\n23\n00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.738\nCuz I remember seeing this happen\nall the time at some point.\n\n24\n00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:22.262\nFor example, what most people that\nare not gonna be in the security field.\n\n25\n00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:25.982\nThink about or\neven in the realm of this networking,\n\n26\n00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:30.293\nthink about a digital signature\nreally is that, Ronnie,\n\n27\n00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:35.310\nhere's a letter that wrote and\nI was able to copy your signature.\n\n28\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820\nAnd put it at the bottom left\nhand side of the screen.\n\n29\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.590\nAnd they think that that's\na digital signature, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.702\nBut Cherokee, you and\nI know a little bit better,\n\n31\n00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.130\nthat's not what a digital\nsignature really is, right?\n\n32\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, sometimes people do\nthink of it as an actual signature.\n\n33\n00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:52.051\nBut I almost think of it like a key,\nnot to be confused with\n\n34\n00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.760\nthe different keys that you were\ntalking about in the previous episode.\n\n35\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.340\nBut in a sense that it's a binary\nvalue that is very special and,\n\n36\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.790\nwell, if you don't wanna\nmisplace it like your keys.\n\n37\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.787\nBecause without that signature, you might\nnot have access to certain components.\n\n38\n00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:11.093\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that a digital\nsignature is much more importance than\n\n39\n00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:12.745\nthe idea of what, traditionally,\n\n40\n00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:15.297\nis actually called\nan electronic signature, right?\n\n41\n00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:18.286\nAn electronic signature is\nwhen somebody says, Ronnie,\n\n42\n00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:21.570\nsign your name to this piece of paper and\nlet me scan it.\n\n43\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.692\nAnd then they can actually copy it and\nput it on the document, still pretty bad,\n\n44\n00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:25.537\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n45\n00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:30.427\nBut at the same time, it doesn't hold\nthe same weight, nor does it do the same\n\n46\n00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:35.034\nthings as what a digital signature does,\nnor is it created the same way.\n\n47\n00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:39.680\nIn that e-electronic type of signature,\nit really is just a scan\n\n48\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.100\nof what I actually kind of\nscribbled on the paper itself.\n\n49\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.660\nThey change it into a PNG format,\nor whatever it is, and\n\n50\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.300\nthen they can attach it to\nany document they want to.\n\n51\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.570\nAnd that somewhat does a little\nbit of what we're normally talking\n\n52\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.900\nabout in terms of a digital signature.\n\n53\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.885\nIt is about signing information but\nit signs it differently.\n\n54\n00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.830\nWe're not really talking about\nactually like a celebrity photograph.\n\n55\n00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.880\nI can't remember what they were called.\n\n56\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.870\nThe one's that they hand out headshots.\n\n57\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.680\nIt's not like a headshot where somebody is\nlike, oo, let me scroll my name across it.\n\n58\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.920\nIt really means something.\n\n59\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.470\nThe idea of the digital signature though\nif you want to compare it to anything\n\n60\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.500\nis more like when you see\nit in the movies, right?\n\n61\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.800\nWhere a king rolls up his scroll and\nthen he takes the wax and\n\n62\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.070\nyou see him holding it over a candle and\nhe melts it.\n\n63\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.820\nAnd then he puts his seal over\nthe opening of that scroll.\n\n64\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.133\nAnd when we think about that Cherokee,\n\n65\n00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:37.228\nwhat is that wax seal supposed\nto be helping us to do.\n\n66\n00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:42.685\n&gt;&gt; To verify that that information is\ntrue, it's in its original format and\n\n67\n00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:47.979\nthat it comes from whoever is supposed\nto be sending that information.\n\n68\n00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.196\nSo someone's not spoofing\nthat information.\n\n69\n00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's actually why\nit's a great analogy, right?\n\n70\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.790\nThe very fact is the king signet\nring that bears his own seal and\n\n71\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.700\nnobody else should have that seal.\n\n72\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.745\nSo if that seal is not on it, then they\nknow it's not from the king, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:10.229\nSecondly if that scroll or whatever it\nis now arrives from the king to you,\n\n74\n00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:17.775\nbut is broken, it verifies that somebody\nelse may have tampered with that document.\n\n75\n00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:22.995\nAnd you can no longer trust that\nthe contents of the document itself,\n\n76\n00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.605\nwhatever it is is actually true and\n\n77\n00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:29.930\nexactly unaltered from the time\nthat it was originated.\n\n78\n00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.780\nSo digital signatures work more like that,\nwhere it really does tell us whether or\n\n79\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.950\nnot it's actually from that\nindividual just like the signet-ring.\n\n80\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.803\nAnd it is the wax seal\nthat also verifies for\n\n81\n00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:46.638\nus that no one has actually messed around\nwith the data from the time it was\n\n82\n00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:50.640\noriginated to the time it\ngot onto your computer.\n\n83\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.700\nThe reason why this is important\nbecause it is a key fundamental aspect.\n\n84\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.050\nAnything that we do when it comes\ndown to asymmetric encryption.\n\n85\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.040\nIt really is key behind everything.\n\n86\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.280\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nwhy on the Internet is that so important.\n\n87\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.523\nIt is because when we're\nsending data between machines I\n\n88\n00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:14.713\nreally don't have a clue if it actually\narrives on Cherokee's machine or\n\n89\n00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:17.703\nif Cherokee actually knows\nit came from my machine.\n\n90\n00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:19.515\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you don't trust\neveryone out on the Internet?\n\n91\n00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:21.940\n&gt;&gt; I really don't trust\nanyone out on the Internet.\n\n92\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.570\nThat's exactly what it comes down to.\n\n93\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.784\nI'm joking, but the very fact is,\n\n94\n00:05:24.784 --> 00:05:26.733\nI trust them if they have\na digital certificate, right?\n\n95\n00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:29.038\nSo when you go to ITProTV's website,\n\n96\n00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:32.575\nthat's what you're actually\nseeing on the site itself.\n\n97\n00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.591\nWhen you get that little green\nnotification that tells you trusted,\n\n98\n00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.402\nit's saying look,\nI've digitally signed this certificate.\n\n99\n00:05:38.402 --> 00:05:41.419\nYou know that if you trust me,\nyou know that it's validated,\n\n100\n00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.670\neverything is good and true, and\nthis is exactly the site that you went to.\n\n101\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.170\nBut if you get to a site that\nlooks exactly like ITProTV's and\n\n102\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.690\nit doesn't have that mark on it, then you\nknow that, hey, that may not actually be\n\n103\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.230\nthe site even though it looks\nidentical to the site itself.\n\n104\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.040\nSo that's why it's important, all right?\n\n105\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.890\nSo let's go back and take a look at a\ndiagram that we used in a previous episode\n\n106\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.410\nthat will kind of help us out.\n\n107\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.940\nI circled the part I'm\nreally interested in here,\n\n108\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.880\nwhich is when we started talking about the\nidea of the asymmetric key process, right?\n\n109\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.580\nThat I said in a previous episode we're\ngonna skip over that cuz we're gonna have\n\n110\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.640\na whole show on it, or whole episode.\n\n111\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.150\nAnd this is the episode, right?\n\n112\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.880\nSo this is really the instance\nthat we want to talk about,\n\n113\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.090\nwhich is right here, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.150\nWhen we start sending our public key\nover to whoever we want that public\n\n115\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.040\nkey to get to,\nwe want that sender whoever that's gonna\n\n116\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.390\nbe we want them to be able to verify\nthey came from me or you, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.980\nAnd two, whatever the content\nare inside of it that nobody has\n\n118\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.630\nmessed around with it and this is where\nit begins with the idea what we call.\n\n119\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.410\nSharing a digitally signed public key,\nokay?\n\n120\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.356\nSo that way when I send you my public\nkey you know it came from me and\n\n121\n00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:00.774\nyou know it's my public key and\nmy public key alone.\n\n122\n00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:04.939\nAnd this really does begin with us\nactually having the certification\n\n123\n00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.123\nauthority up here which I kind of\nexcluded for one reason or another.\n\n124\n00:07:09.123 --> 00:07:13.953\nAnd he is actually gonna be the one\nthat helps us to sign this information\n\n125\n00:07:13.953 --> 00:07:15.810\nright here, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.880\nSo, when we send that as part\nof the signature right here, or\n\n127\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.420\nthe signet ring that says, hey.\n\n128\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.190\nHere is what you actually know, and\n\n129\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.670\nhere is what's gonna happen in this\nprocess that we were gonna take a look at.\n\n130\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.410\nSo that way regardless of\nwhere they are in the world,\n\n131\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.360\nthey actually have it verified\nthat it came from me, and\n\n132\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.710\nthat the public key itself has not\nbeen messed around with at all.\n\n133\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.530\nAnd that is really kind of the goal\nof what we want to talk about.\n\n134\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.529\nNow, in this particular process though,\nit's a little bit convoluted.\n\n135\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.070\nNot because of that there some step and\nthat's unnecessary.\n\n136\n00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.310\nThat's what I wanna make sure of, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.317\nBut it is a little bit complex.\n\n138\n00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:57.436\nNow if you've really\nbeen working again and\n\n139\n00:07:57.436 --> 00:08:01.397\nyou understand this process completely,\nthat's great and that's wonderful.\n\n140\n00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.989\nBut if this is your first foray into it.\n\n141\n00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:06.826\nThen we need to understand it\na little bit better, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:06.826 --> 00:08:10.490\nSo here's how you generally\nend up seeing this.\n\n143\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.227\nAnd there's two components when we talk\nabout a Digital Signature Creation.\n\n144\n00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:18.010\nAnd I used a public key because that's\nprobably the most shared data that we end\n\n145\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.698\nup signing, just about every time that\nyou think about something, right?\n\n146\n00:08:21.698 --> 00:08:24.382\nSo if I need to share\nthe public key with anybody,\n\n147\n00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:26.355\ncouple of things are gonna happen.\n\n148\n00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.740\nOne, I have to send the public key, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.758\nI have to be able to transmit that.\n\n150\n00:08:30.758 --> 00:08:35.611\nBut the way that we do this to verify\nthat public key is that I also\n\n151\n00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:40.282\nmake a hash of that public key\nby sending the public key into,\n\n152\n00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:46.171\nlet's say something like SHA 256,\nwhich is a hashing algorithm for us.\n\n153\n00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:49.778\nAnd for us then,\nonce we send it through, that SHA 256,\n\n154\n00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:51.957\nit would generate that hash value.\n\n155\n00:08:51.957 --> 00:08:53.233\nNow that's not a true hash value.\n\n156\n00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:58.325\nPlease don't, that can't be a hash value,\nI know, it's just a representation there.\n\n157\n00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:03.161\nBut just kinda realize that that\nwe have to come up with this.\n\n158\n00:09:03.161 --> 00:09:08.423\nThe key behind this, though,\nis now that we also sent a copy\n\n159\n00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:13.479\nof this public key over to\nthe end sending machine that's\n\n160\n00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:18.532\ngonna be sending me back data,\nI take this hash value that\n\n161\n00:09:18.532 --> 00:09:23.624\nI have generated and\nI encrypt it with my own private key.\n\n162\n00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:27.080\nOkay, so it's that private\nkey that I encrypted with.\n\n163\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.910\nThat now becomes what we\ncall the digital signature,\n\n164\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:39.160\nthe combination of the message as well as\nthis encrypted hash value that we have.\n\n165\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.631\nWith this digital signature,\nwe verify the data integrity,\n\n166\n00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:44.777\nthat no one has messed around with it.\n\n167\n00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:49.625\nWe verify its data origin where it\ncame from, and very two important\n\n168\n00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:54.743\nconcepts that we have in place to help\nus out in what we need to do, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:59.023\nSo in this instance, it's very important\nthat we get this process here,\n\n170\n00:09:59.023 --> 00:10:00.689\nthat we have one public key.\n\n171\n00:10:00.689 --> 00:10:03.457\nWe create a hash value out of that key.\n\n172\n00:10:03.457 --> 00:10:07.005\nWe also send the key itself along with it.\n\n173\n00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:13.150\nSo two pieces of information make up what\nwe call that digital signature itself.\n\n174\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.660\nAnd this is what signs that.\n\n175\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.520\nSo everything that we actually\nget is actually gonna be signed,\n\n176\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.510\nand we now have this and\nwe're ready to go, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.840\nOnce we get that information over\non the sending computer side,\n\n178\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.860\nthey end up, of course, getting that\ndigital signature along with the key.\n\n179\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.420\nIt's actually got the key and it's got the\nhashed information that is now encrypted\n\n180\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.550\nwith the private key data, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:45.290\nAnd this particular private key\ndata now has two functions for\n\n182\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.570\nit, or\nactually both of them have a function.\n\n183\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.260\nSo on the receiving machine,\nright, you'll do the same process\n\n184\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.180\nwhere you'll take the public key and\nyou'll come up with a hash value for that.\n\n185\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.810\nAnd here's what the result of that\nhash value will end up being,\n\n186\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.340\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n187\n00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.570\nThat is what we want to happen.\n\n188\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.930\nThe other thing that we will also\nhave is that you will also need to\n\n189\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:14.790\ndecrypt this particular\nencrypted hash value\n\n190\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.300\nwith the public key that is\nnow existing on your computer.\n\n191\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.440\nAnd if everything works right here, okay,\n\n192\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.350\nlet me see if I can make that\nshift over a little bit more.\n\n193\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.270\nThere we go, okay.\n\n194\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.170\nIf it turns out that these two\nbeing exactly the same, well,\n\n195\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:41.020\nyou know that this public key came from,\nexcuse me, this public key came from me.\n\n196\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.910\nAnd you're able to verify\nby decrypting the hash\n\n197\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.610\nvalue that it matched what hash\nvalue you came up with originally.\n\n198\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.650\nSo it's a check in both sides, right?\n\n199\n00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.800\nYou did the mathematics, and\nyou came up with a value.\n\n200\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.900\nI did the mathematics on my side,\nand I came up with the same value.\n\n201\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.800\nSo that way you know that it\nhad to have come from me.\n\n202\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.290\nThere's no other person\nit could have come from.\n\n203\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:10.350\nSo that's where a digital signature\ncreation really does help.\n\n204\n00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.150\nIt makes sure that as we send the data,\n\n205\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.690\nwe can prove that it did come from one\nparticular location and one source.\n\n206\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.478\nAnd this is really an important part\nof the concept of understanding\n\n207\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:25.511\nwhat is gonna be coming up next for\neverything that we do.\n\n208\n00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:31.036\nSo this is why in the entire process\nof the asymmetric encryption that\n\n209\n00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:36.466\nit doesn't matter who we send this\nparticular public key to because\n\n210\n00:12:36.466 --> 00:12:42.078\nthat digital signature's only gonna\nmatch up to my machine, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:45.120\nAnd we don't have to\nbe contacted about it.\n\n212\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.580\nIt all has that information.\n\n213\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.870\nAnd once we do that, we know everything\nelse in our asymmetric process is gonna be\n\n214\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.539\nfine and good and\nit really helps us out, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.230\nSo let's just take a look at just a couple\nof things where we tend to see that.\n\n216\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.270\nOops, that's our chat here.\n\n217\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.814\nLet me go ahead and\nopen up an incognito window.\n\n218\n00:13:03.814 --> 00:13:05.749\nAnd we'll just do itpro.tv.\n\n219\n00:13:06.893 --> 00:13:09.535\nAnd in a moment here we'll\ntake a look at this idea and\n\n220\n00:13:09.535 --> 00:13:11.710\nwhere we also see this information, too.\n\n221\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.384\nSo it's right up here normally that\nyou end up seeing that, where's the?\n\n222\n00:13:16.384 --> 00:13:19.128\nI'm looking for\nthe certificate, there it is.\n\n223\n00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:22.050\nSo Secure Connection, and\nthen I select Details.\n\n224\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.710\nAnd you end up seeing this certificate and\nthe information that's in here.\n\n225\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:33.498\nWell, that actually got sent to my machine\nusing that signed digital process.\n\n226\n00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:34.749\nIt got into the browser, and\n\n227\n00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:37.690\nmy browser was able to verify\nthat everything is good.\n\n228\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.790\nAnd if it didn't,\nit would show up right here, too, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.725\nSo that's where you tend to see that.\n\n230\n00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:46.655\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what you're saying here is\nthat a digital signature is just a form of\n\n231\n00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:47.897\na digital certificate.\n\n232\n00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:52.867\nI mean, we see other types of\ndigital certificates to verify SSL,\n\n233\n00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:54.656\nto verify a web server.\n\n234\n00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:58.590\nOr we could see a digital certificate for\nsoftware.\n\n235\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.460\nOr we could see, what you just explained\nto us, a digital certificate for\n\n236\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.730\nthat signature.\n\n237\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.460\nCan these certificates be changed\nlater on and interchanged, or?\n\n238\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, certificates,\nwhich we'll end up talking about again,\n\n239\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.920\ntoo, a little bit later on here, is that\nthey're normally done for a purpose.\n\n240\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.694\nA web server is usually about\nverifying their particular identity,\n\n241\n00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:23.022\nwhereas email may be verifying\nthat one individual sender.\n\n242\n00:14:23.022 --> 00:14:27.206\nBut it's always about those two things,\nmaking sure that the message itself is\n\n243\n00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:31.160\nuncompromised, making sure that\nthe sender is who he says he is.\n\n244\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.700\nAnybody that violates this,\nright, that says look,\n\n245\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.090\nI'm gonna actually just\nsend it in my place.\n\n246\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.212\nWell, what happens to digital signature\nwhen they actually violate it?\n\n247\n00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.850\nThis is like when they crack\nopen that seal on that scroll,\n\n248\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.030\nis that it proves that someone\nhas messed around with it.\n\n249\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.412\nNow when they try and go and say well,\ninstead I'll just put my signature on it,\n\n250\n00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:53.320\nwell, we can do the hashing value.\n\n251\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.650\nAnd if that comes out to\nbe different instead,\n\n252\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:01.000\nand I wish I had the exact opposite shape,\nbut I don't here.\n\n253\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they shouldn't be the same value.\n\n254\n00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they should not end\nup being the same value here.\n\n255\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.945\nSo if these didn't end up matching, well,\nthen we know that that could not have\n\n256\n00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:16.535\ncome from, of course, it won't let me\nselect the other one, why would it?\n\n257\n00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:17.599\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's fine.\n\n258\n00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:19.676\nIt's because I did it exactly over it,\nwhy would it?\n\n259\n00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:21.020\nSo there we go.\n\n260\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.356\nNow I have a t, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:26.231\nSo if those values didn't match up,\nthen we know that, hey,\n\n262\n00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:28.764\nsomeone has messed around with this, or\n\n263\n00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:34.220\nthis could not have come from the original\nsender, it's just that nature of things.\n\n264\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.930\nEven if they were able to\nchange just one letter,\n\n265\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:41.450\nit really makes a big difference in\nwhat the value would end up being here.\n\n266\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.440\nIt wouldn't even look anything like this.\n\n267\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.743\nSo it is an important part\nof that entire process\n\n268\n00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:51.884\nthat begins by doing the verification\nthat we really need.\n\n269\n00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:56.563\nSo the signature itself, like I said, when\nyou take a look, does it have to do it?\n\n270\n00:15:56.563 --> 00:15:58.611\nWhy can't we just encrypt the whole thing?\n\n271\n00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:00.435\nBecause we need to verify the whole thing.\n\n272\n00:16:00.435 --> 00:16:02.323\nYou still need the data on your end.\n\n273\n00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:05.998\nSo it has to be this way and then,\nthat way you get this check and\n\n274\n00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:09.540\nbalance on your end,\nwhere you can do this on your own.\n\n275\n00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.340\nAnd once everything matches up,\neverything is good.\n\n276\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.010\nIt really is kind of neat that somebody\nthought about this process as a,\n\n277\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.010\nhere's how you can verify that and\nmake sure that everything's good.\n\n278\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.900\nAnd then, of course,\nnow we have brought it to this stage.\n\n279\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.440\nAnd this is just becoming\na little bit more and\n\n280\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.880\nmore complex but\nit's getting better all the time.\n\n281\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were looking into\nsecurity and, of course,\n\n282\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.070\nhaving these extra checks and\nbalances in place or\n\n283\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.830\nchecksums in place is because\nwe're talking about security and\n\n284\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.170\nyou wanna have those additional layers and\nthose extra stops there.\n\n285\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.700\nBut I think it's cool too Ronnie\nlike you had mentioned how\n\n286\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.290\nthey came up with this process.\n\n287\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:48.270\nBut even taking this notion and\nhaving it available to us publically like\n\n288\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.430\nover the internet, with those public CAs\nor Certificate of Authoritys to issue out\n\n289\n00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.990\nthese certificates, we can also take\nthat same concept and bring it home.\n\n290\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.290\nBring it into our local area networks and\n\n291\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.220\nas long as we take the time to\nlearn how to do it and set it up.\n\n292\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.300\nWhich you guys have all that\naccess here at ITproTV.\n\n293\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.070\nYou can set up your own infrastructure\nwhich we're gonna talk about in a little\n\n294\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.380\nbit here, but you can take all of that and\nset it up internally, it's so cool,\n\n295\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.880\nyou don't even have to pay someone\nelse to go ahead and do that for you.\n\n296\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is kind of an amazing\nsituation that someone has\n\n297\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.820\ntried to think about the best\npossibility for us and\n\n298\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.300\nthis is where it is at this\ncurrent state in time.\n\n299\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.510\nWe'll probably see in the future that\nthis may end up being replaced but\n\n300\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.700\nthe future is heading to this, is really\nwhat it's heading to, to actually\n\n301\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.480\nreplace a lot of things in your life such\nas authentications with passwords, and\n\n302\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.140\neverything else too, so just realized\nthat this is where we are going.\n\n303\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.320\nSo signatures again, important to\nunderstand what they're used for,\n\n304\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.850\nimportant to understand the concept of\nwhat is behind it and you'll be ready for\n\n305\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.590\nthe exam at that point when you do so.\n\n306\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.280\nDo not ever mistake that this is a process\nthat you just can kind of overlook and\n\n307\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.220\nbypass, you really can't.\n\n308\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.680\nAnd from this day forward you need to\ntake this a little bit more seriously\n\n309\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.410\nbecause you are, you're gonna see more and\nmore of everything around security.\n\n310\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.670\nReally evolving around this idea\nof digital certificates and\n\n311\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.560\nsignatures, making sure\nthat you can verify them.\n\n312\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.820\nSo, make sure you go over this show\nagain and learn those concepts.\n\n313\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\nI do have one other question, though.\n\n314\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.605\nWith these certificate authorities\nout there on the Internet and\n\n315\n00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:23.600\nthen issuing out and\ngranting these certificates,\n\n316\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.290\nwhat would happen if one of these\ncompanies were to be compromised?\n\n317\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.000\n&gt;&gt; Well that's actually one of those\nquestions that you have to worry about.\n\n318\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.680\nIf there is a compromise, then that means\nyour entire certificate chain itself,\n\n319\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.280\nis also compromised.\n\n320\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.930\nNormally, you have to\nkind of deal with that.\n\n321\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.060\nAnd you have to kind of go,\nwhat do I have to do with the next step,\n\n322\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.410\nwhich is to probably to find another\ncertificate authority, to get you a new\n\n323\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.800\ncertificate and to go ahead and\nrevoke the certificate that you have.\n\n324\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n325\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.930\nThat process there,\ncertificate revocation,\n\n326\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.390\nI'm sure you guys will be\nhearing about it soon.\n\n327\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.780\nAnd in fact, these companies in\nthe past have been compromised, so\n\n328\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.245\nit's something that we\ndo have to be aware of.\n\n329\n00:18:59.245 --> 00:19:03.315\nThere's always that risk out there but\njust keep in mind that\n\n330\n00:19:03.315 --> 00:19:05.875\nit's a little difficult when\nyou have to pick and choose.\n\n331\n00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:08.875\nThey might just say hey we're gonna go\nahead and revoke all the certificates that\n\n332\n00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:12.535\nhave been issued from this time frame to\nthis time frame or whatever that may be.\n\n333\n00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:13.715\nBut I think that's it.\n\n334\n00:19:13.715 --> 00:19:15.835\nDo you have any other final\nthoughts here Ronnie?\n\n335\n00:19:15.835 --> 00:19:19.685\n&gt;&gt; Not really, just remember that this is\nall part of the entire process which we're\n\n336\n00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:22.170\ngonna see in the PKI and\nthe later episode.\n\n337\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.860\nBut as far as they've specifically\ncalled this process out\n\n338\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.980\nas something that they want you to know.\n\n339\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.220\nSo it pretty much means,\n\n340\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.920\nyes you should understand what\na signed digital message is.\n\n341\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.020\nWhich we showed you, which was that\ndigital signature on the package itself,\n\n342\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.270\nand what it actually does for you.\n\n343\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.650\nBut that's really what you wanna\nmake sure that you have down\n\n344\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.280\npat before you go and do the exam.\n\n345\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Cool, well thank you.\n\n346\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.165\nAnd I know that we're gonna be looking at\nour public key infrastructure coming next.\n\n347\n00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:55.705\nSo stayed tuned because you're really\ngonna see how this all ties together, and\n\n348\n00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:57.495\nit'll really make sense for you.\n\n349\n00:19:57.495 --> 00:20:00.275\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this particular episode.\n\n350\n00:20:00.275 --> 00:20:02.495\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n351\n00:20:02.495 --> 00:20:03.435\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n352\n00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:07.422\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n353\n00:20:07.422 --> 00:20:13.396\n[MUSIC]\n\n354\n00:20:13.396 --> 00:20:16.658\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.445\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:09.216\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:16.080\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Cisco cyber\nsecurity fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.110\nIn this episode we will be looking\nat public key infrastructure.\n\n8\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.260\nWe're gonna be describing PKI operations.\n\n9\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.660\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.200\nThank you for joining today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back in\nthe studios as we continue on with our\n\n12\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.590\nCisco cybersecurity here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.600\nWe are specifically gonna be taking\na look of course then at the idea of\n\n14\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.820\nusing what we call PKI.\n\n15\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170\nThe public key infrastructure and\n\n16\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.450\nthis is a topic that we all\nneed to become familiar with.\n\n17\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.620\nIf you've been in security for\nany point of time, you've ran a process.\n\n18\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.450\nBut most of us might have at least\na cursory understanding of it, and\n\n19\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.020\nyou need at least that, okay?\n\n20\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you've been\nwatching along in the shows,\n\n21\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.110\nin the last episode we even kind of\nbaby steps we were getting there,\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.040\nwe were talking about\ndigital certificates.\n\n23\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.830\nSo this is just gonna build\nupon that information.\n\n24\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of the idea behind\nusing something like the public key\n\n25\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.160\ninfrastructure here is because\nthere are inherit weaknesses in\n\n26\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.340\njust about all the other types\nof security measures that we do,\n\n27\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.720\nput in place without some verification or\nsome authority.\n\n28\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.730\nSo when it comes down to using some\nlike a PKI, we can actually look at in,\n\n29\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.800\nin a couple of different instances and\nanalogies that will help us out as well.\n\n30\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.920\nSo right here in the United States,\nwith the all 50 states that we have.\n\n31\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.100\nEvery single state runs\na government service\n\n32\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.630\nthat allows us to have driver's licenses,\nessentially is what we have.\n\n33\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.740\nNow, the idea of a state issued\ndriver's license gives us this ability\n\n34\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.070\nto be able to use roads\nas a licensed driver.\n\n35\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.150\nAnd I know you're saying, well that\nmakes sense, but what's is that about?\n\n36\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.070\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about it here,\nI'm gonna pick on Cherokee a little bit.\n\n37\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.590\nNot say that Cherokee and some driving\ndown the road, had an incredibly\n\n38\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.100\nhigh rate of speed, and\nnow we have one of our state troopers,\n\n39\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.700\nwho loves pulling people over for\ndriving fast, post Cherokee over.\n\n40\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.860\nNow it's funny here in this instance\nright, if Cherokee were to do\n\n41\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.680\nsomething like that, the officer that\npulls over doesn't sit there are go,\n\n42\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.840\ncan you please show me your library card,\ndoes he?\n\n43\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't had that happen.\n\n44\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n[LAUGH] Or\n\n45\n00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.615\nhe says,\nshow me your membership to Blockbusters.\n\n46\n00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:35.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do people\nstill go to Blockbuster?\n\n47\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.560\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n48\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.210\nShow me your grocery coupon,\nwhatever that tag card is called.\n\n49\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.760\nNo, what do they normally ask for\nif that happens?\n\n50\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640\n&gt;&gt; License and\nregistration please [LAUGH].\n\n51\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.110\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like you've done\nthat a time or two before Cherokee.\n\n52\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're not gonna talk about that [LAUGH].\n\n53\n00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well it's the same thing, right.\n\n54\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.940\nWhat we're getting at here is that the\nofficer himself is really not looking for\n\n55\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.040\nCherokee to say, hi, I'm Cherokee Boose,\nhe is looking for what?\n\n56\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.150\nA verification of her identity and it\ncan't just be any old verification, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.440\nIt has to be one that the officer\nrecognizes as being valid.\n\n58\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.600\nNow, you can pull over from any state\nthat you want to as long as it's a valid\n\n59\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.118\ndriver's license from that state.\n\n60\n00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:25.580\nSo even Cherokee that live right here\nin the good old Florida right here in\n\n61\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.500\nthe United States and she had lived\nsomewhere else in another state,\n\n62\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.990\nshe will present to one of our\ntroopers here in the forum,\n\n63\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.050\nit would still be\nconsidered a valid license.\n\n64\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.170\nAnd the reason behind that is\nthat there is a trust of that\n\n65\n00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.960\nparticular issuing authority.\n\n66\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.130\nAnd that is the key behind us\nhaving at least an understanding\n\n67\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.770\nof what the public key\ninfrastructure is about.\n\n68\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.720\nSo that when we say, hey, I want to do\nbusiness out on the internet, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.620\nI can set up a web server but then when\nyou come and connect to my web server.\n\n70\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.450\nHow do you know that it's mine?\n\n71\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.070\nWhat is it out there that\nproves that it is mine?\n\n72\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.120\nI could scream at you all day long saying,\nno, this is my web server.\n\n73\n00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.800\nI don't care what he says,\nor what she says, but\n\n74\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.645\nit's not mine, it's my web server\nthat's not gonna validate it.\n\n75\n00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:21.435\nBut there could be a third\nparty trusted site that says,\n\n76\n00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:25.675\nlook, I can verify that this site\nactually belongs to Ronnie, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:27.085\nAnd that's what we want,\n\n78\n00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:31.195\nis that there is some verification\nsystem that's out there to help us out.\n\n79\n00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:34.105\nThe reason why this is important\nis because there are so\n\n80\n00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.645\nmany different things that we\nhave to worry about in security.\n\n81\n00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:40.680\nThings like authentication and\nnon-repudiation.\n\n82\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.010\nI won't have to worry about encryption,\nidentification.\n\n83\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.330\nThere are so\nmany different things that go on, and\n\n84\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.650\nall of us can think of different\nways to prove that, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.915\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of\na non-event from IT perspective,\n\n86\n00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:55.450\nbut true story we joke around about\nshoes sometimes, Ronnie those.\n\n87\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.285\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You know, really expensive ones.\n\n88\n00:04:57.285 --> 00:05:00.085\nAnd I got a phone call from a girlfriend\none time and she said, hey,\n\n89\n00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:02.165\nI don't know if this website is legit or\nnot.\n\n90\n00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:06.000\nAnd she has absolutely\nno background in IT but\n\n91\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.450\none of those things if it's too\ncheap it seems too good to be true,\n\n92\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.680\nusually it is, and this is kind of where\nthat whole certificate comes into play.\n\n93\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.787\nIf I don't know if you know this but\nif you buy knock off or\n\n94\n00:05:16.787 --> 00:05:19.186\nspoofed items like that, it's illegal.\n\n95\n00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:20.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So they don't.\n\n96\n00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:22.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That person didn't wanna get wrapped up\n\n97\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.870\nin anything like that, right?\n\n98\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.280\nAnd so for an attacker to create,\nnot even an attacker at this point,\n\n99\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.125\njust someone who's trying to sell\nknock-off items, you know what I mean?\n\n100\n00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:31.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n101\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.940\n&gt;&gt; And to not have that certificate, and\nyou're like, I don't know if I'm buying\n\n102\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.070\nfrom the manufacturer directly,\nor if this is a knock-off.\n\n103\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.180\nSo even just in regular day-to-day\nlife it's not even always\n\n104\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.720\nas serious of a problem just\nnormal online browsing.\n\n105\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.070\nIt's become such a big part of our lives.\n\n106\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really has to that point where\nwe need that idea of something that can\n\n107\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.140\nverify for us whether or not this is\na true site, whether it's a good site,\n\n108\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.350\nwhether anything's actually going or\ndoing what we needed to do, right.\n\n109\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.000\nSo the problem is there are so\nmany disparate ways that we can do things,\n\n110\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.550\nlike authentication,\nlike we were talking about,\n\n111\n00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.170\nidentification, non-repudiation,\nand encryption.\n\n112\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.270\nYou name it, there are so\nmany different things that we can do.\n\n113\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.730\nBut a PKI infrastructure really helps\nus out in all of those concepts.\n\n114\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.700\nSo for example, when we want to say look,\nwhat I want to do inside of my\n\n115\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.890\norganization and for my organization\nis use 802.1x authentication, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.060\nWell that means I'm not setting up\nsome type of user name or password.\n\n117\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.760\nI'm looking for\na digital certificate to do this and\n\n118\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.510\nto make sure that everybody has one of\nthose certificates that's unique, and\n\n119\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.260\nthat can be validated that's\nwhat I wanted to happen.\n\n120\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.040\nSo this actually gives us stat\nability to use technology that is much\n\n121\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.060\nmore secure than something like\nthe username and password.\n\n122\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.310\nSo the PKI infrastructure really\nhelps us to do that as well.\n\n123\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.338\nThe same thing even if you\nare actually a coder, a developer for\n\n124\n00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:59.670\napplications as well, is that,\nif you're actually doing this and\n\n125\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.002\nyou wanna make sure that nobody is\nmessing around with your coding,\n\n126\n00:07:04.002 --> 00:07:09.094\nyou can also of course use that public key\ninfrastructure to sign your own coding\n\n127\n00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:14.650\nto it, so someone doesn't mess around\nwith your own structure that you have.\n\n128\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.120\nAnd somebody else pulls it\noff a different website and\n\n129\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.050\nsays, I got Ronnie's\napplication from here.\n\n130\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.060\n&gt;&gt; It's given me malware.\n\n131\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's given me malware.\n\n132\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.960\nWhat should I do?\n\n133\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.390\nAnd I say, well you should have\nactually gotten it from Ronnie,\n\n134\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.200\nmore than anything else.\n\n135\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.020\n&gt;&gt; A trusted source, yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.485\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie makes you pay for it.\n\n137\n00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:30.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a part of it, right.\n\n138\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.380\nSo it really helps you out in that sense.\n\n139\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.028\nAnd the other thing is that it also helps\nyou out in the sense of what we call\n\n140\n00:07:36.028 --> 00:07:37.790\nnon-repudiation as well.\n\n141\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.500\nIf it's got my own digital certificate\nto it, it's only attached to me and\n\n142\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.260\nthat means if you have it on your machine\nI can't say that you didn't have it.\n\n143\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.869\nSo it helps out in that idea\nof non-repudiation too.\n\n144\n00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.735\nWe can also use it to\nindividually identify things for\n\n145\n00:07:53.735 --> 00:07:57.630\nencryption that really help us out like\nIP set tunnels that we want to do.\n\n146\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.590\nImplementing two factor authentication\nwith things like smart cars is a big one.\n\n147\n00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.930\nThat requires a PKI infrastructure.\n\n148\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.110\nBeing able to do the idea of\ntraffic protection with SSL.\n\n149\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.560\nThat requires, again,\na public key infrastructure.\n\n150\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.470\nImplementing some type of secure email,\nyou name it,\n\n151\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.655\nthere are tons of reasons why we should\nthink about the idea of using PKI as\n\n152\n00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:28.520\npart of security structures inside of our\nown organization as we start to move on.\n\n153\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.950\nBut those are just kind of some of\nthe things that we really need to pay\n\n154\n00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.450\nattention to when we start to do this.\n\n155\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.760\nNow most of the time when we start,\n\n156\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.190\nright, there's really a couple of\ndifferent ways that this can start off.\n\n157\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.980\nIf you're dealing inside of\nyour own internal network,\n\n158\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.190\nyou do not necessarily have to\nactually deal on the Internet, itself.\n\n159\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.423\nYou can create your own public key\ninfrastructure inside of your own network,\n\n160\n00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:54.395\nif you choose to.\n\n161\n00:08:54.395 --> 00:08:58.324\nAnd that way, you validate individual\nusers, as well as computers,\n\n162\n00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:01.830\nbased on your own public\nkey infrastructure.\n\n163\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.120\nOr if you are going to deal\nwith the public, commerce or\n\n164\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.900\nanything else, you are actually going\nto deal with what we call third-party\n\n165\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.260\ncertificate authorities, instead.\n\n166\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.700\nThey'll also have their\nown PKI infrastructure up.\n\n167\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.050\nAnd you'll also be able to deal\nwith them and they can validate and\n\n168\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.860\nverify things for\nyou out there on the Internet.\n\n169\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.720\nSo there are two different structures that\nyou might have to actually deal with.\n\n170\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.766\nBut they function pretty\nmuch in the same way.\n\n171\n00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:31.390\nAnd that's kind of a key\nthat we'll take a look at.\n\n172\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.890\nSo when it begins, when we start talking\nabout a public key infrastructure,\n\n173\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.062\neverything really begins with one machine.\n\n174\n00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:43.120\nLet's go and take a look at my diagram\nhere, and this will kind of help us out.\n\n175\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.330\nI did three different types\nof public key hierarchies for\n\n176\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.300\nus, from left to right,\nis what you're actually seeing.\n\n177\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.670\nBut we'll just talk about this one at\nthe top right here for just a moment.\n\n178\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.315\nThis guy right here.\n\n179\n00:09:58.315 --> 00:09:59.730\n&gt;&gt; That's the most important one.\n\n180\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.070\n&gt;&gt; He is the most important one.\n\n181\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.375\nAnd he is actually that because\nhe is called the root CA.\n\n182\n00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:08.890\nThat's usually how you hear, or\nyou can say root certificate authority.\n\n183\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.640\nThe root certificate authority,\nin the entire infrastructure,\n\n184\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.590\nitself, is the only certificate authority.\n\n185\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.312\nIs the only machine that issues\nitself what's called a self-signed\n\n186\n00:10:21.312 --> 00:10:22.800\ncertificate, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.280\nNow what does this root certificate\nauthority really designed to do?\n\n188\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.780\nHe wants to hand out certificates, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.500\nHe wants to issue certificates, but\n\n190\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.860\nwhen he issues it to himself,\nhe is signing it himself.\n\n191\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.370\nAnd he's saying, I can validate myself.\n\n192\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.850\nBut in this entire infrastructure,\nI validate everybody else, too.\n\n193\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.630\nThat's pretty much it, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.760\nSo he issues himself his own\nself-signed certificate.\n\n195\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.790\nAnd he also creates his own public and\nprivate key pair that will help him when\n\n196\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.080\nhe's encrypting data to other machines\nthat are out there, as well, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.010\nSo sometimes you hear about people\ncalling it a trusted party.\n\n198\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.730\nThese are out there.\n\n199\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.195\nYou can have one internally, and\n\n200\n00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:06.300\nthere are many of them externally\nout there on the Internet.\n\n201\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.251\nYou've heard of Entrust,\nGoDaddy, [CROSSTALK]\n\n202\n00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:10.796\n&gt;&gt; GeoTrust, Global Trust,\n\n203\n00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:14.230\nThere are a lot,\nusually with trust in the name, Verisign.\n\n204\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who would have guessed\nthat all these would be that way?\n\n205\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.255\nBut essentially tell us that they've\nset up an infrastructure for\n\n206\n00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:24.100\nthem to issue you a certificate, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.049\nAnd if it's internally in my network, I'm\nsaying I've set up at least the beginning\n\n208\n00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:33.399\nhere of something that can begin to\nissue these digital certificates out.\n\n209\n00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:36.017\nThat can uniquely identify\nsomeone that we need to,\n\n210\n00:11:36.017 --> 00:11:38.645\ndo some authentication,\ndo some nonrepudiation.\n\n211\n00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:40.265\nYou name it, it can do that.\n\n212\n00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:45.365\n&gt;&gt; So whether this root CA is internal\nwithin your organization or external and\n\n213\n00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:49.822\nyou've outsourced it,\nyou really have to have a lot of trust.\n\n214\n00:11:49.822 --> 00:11:53.972\nLike those names even implied, you have\nto trust that this machine is legitimate.\n\n215\n00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:56.472\nIt hasn't been compromised in any way.\n\n216\n00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:58.902\nAnd in fact, a lot of times,\nyou'll see these machines,\n\n217\n00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:02.872\nonce they generate or create certificates,\nthey'll take them offline.\n\n218\n00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:06.515\nBecause that's the most secure thing that\nyou can do with them, right, Ronnie?\n\n219\n00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:11.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is because the goal\nbehind this is to never have this\n\n220\n00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:12.670\nmachine compromised.\n\n221\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.210\nBecause if this machine is compromised,\nright, that means all of the certificates\n\n222\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.200\nthat were issued out to it also\nends up being compromised, as well.\n\n223\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.160\nSo depending on the way that\nthe infrastructure is set up,\n\n224\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.450\nthis is by far the most important\n\n225\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.430\ncomponent inside of your infrastructure\nauthority that you will have.\n\n226\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.170\nNow there's two different types of what we\ncall certificate authorities out there.\n\n227\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.920\nThere's what we call, of course,\nthe root certificate authority.\n\n228\n00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.990\nAnd there's an issuing\ncertificate authority.\n\n229\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.200\nNow this is where it becomes a little\nbit muddy in the waters here, right?\n\n230\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.130\nI can have it where it's actually\nboth on a single machine,\n\n231\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.810\nwhere the root certificate authority\nis also issuing certificates out.\n\n232\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.250\nIdeally, that's not a great thing, but\n\n233\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.150\nif you're doing this internally in your\nnetwork, that may be your only choice.\n\n234\n00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.740\nBecause you only have so\nmany resources that you have available.\n\n235\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.480\nSo in this instance on left-hand side,\n\n236\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.860\nthis is what you're seeing is where the\nroot certificate authority is also issuing\n\n237\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.290\ncertificates to requesting machines,\nas well.\n\n238\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.070\nSo it can handle it,\nif it actually needs to, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.434\nBut when we do that, that means that\nwe have to leave this guy online.\n\n240\n00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:27.725\nThe longer he is left online,\nunless he's completely, 100% protected,\n\n241\n00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:31.130\nthe more chances that there\nare that someone could come along.\n\n242\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.990\nAnd try and compromise the idea of this\nroot certification authority here.\n\n243\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.330\nSo it is very important that we keep\nthat machine as protected as we can.\n\n244\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.000\nSo there are what we call,\nin that particular instance,\n\n245\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.800\nit's called a single tier PKI,\nif you wanna call that, right?\n\n246\n00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.140\nIt's a root,\nit also issues out certificate.\n\n247\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.780\nThere's also a two-tier model,\n\n248\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.950\nwhich is the one that's almost vertical\nhere, in which you have a root CA.\n\n249\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.900\nAnd instead, all he does is he\nissues out another certificate\n\n250\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.590\nto an issuing certificate\nauthority that is not himself.\n\n251\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.490\nSo he essentially assigns\na certificate here.\n\n252\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.170\nAnd then all the certificates are going\nto be issued from this person or\n\n253\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.770\nfrom this particular machine.\n\n254\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.600\nI always just call them person.\n\n255\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.601\n&gt;&gt; So that issuing CA just kind\nof acts as a repository and\n\n256\n00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:22.482\nholds those certificates\nuntil they're needed?\n\n257\n00:14:22.482 --> 00:14:25.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, and\nhe can generate certificates for,\n\n258\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.648\nafter he gets his own\ncertificate from the root,\n\n259\n00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:31.090\nhe can start generating certificates for\neverybody else.\n\n260\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.970\nBut now you can take the root CA offline.\n\n261\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:40.030\nAnd if you never bring up another issuing\nCA, he just gets brought online again.\n\n262\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.730\nAnd then he can issue out another\ncertificate to the issuing CA.\n\n263\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.460\nAnd then that way you actually\nhave two of them, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.860\nSo you can do that, too.\n\n265\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.990\nAnd that's why I call it two tier\nwhen you start to do the idea here\n\n266\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.720\nof this issuing CA.\n\n267\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.360\nUsually, that means that\nthe root can be taken offline.\n\n268\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.850\nAnd that would be ideal if\nyou could actually do that.\n\n269\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.703\nNow as a protection, though,\n\n270\n00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:05.712\nif you believe that something like\nthis could cause issues, too.\n\n271\n00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:09.178\nWhere you're absolutely saying look,\nas much as this is great,\n\n272\n00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:11.710\nI want to actually add\nin an intermediate tier.\n\n273\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.290\nYou can have a three tier at least.\n\n274\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.770\nYou could probably continue to go up,\nand up, and up if you want to.\n\n275\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.580\nBut where there's actually\nan intermediate CA, and a root CA,\n\n276\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.170\nand then an issuing CA, itself.\n\n277\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.470\nThen you can actually\ntake both the root and\n\n278\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.330\nthe intermediate certificate\nauthority offline.\n\n279\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.920\nAnd that way you always have\nthe original root if you ever need to\n\n280\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.040\nrebuild the entire infrastructure.\n\n281\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.250\nOr you can actually stop right here,\nagain, he's offline.\n\n282\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.506\nIf he ever needs to actually\nbring up another issuing CA,\n\n283\n00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:42.840\nyou bring up another one,\nhe can issue out the certificate, as well.\n\n284\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.550\nAnd then issuing CAs go ahead and\nissue out other certificates, too.\n\n285\n00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.556\nSo there's a lot of infrastructure\nthat can be brought to bear,\n\n286\n00:15:51.556 --> 00:15:55.130\ndepending on the need and\nthe size of your organization.\n\n287\n00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.751\nWhen it comes down to an organization\nwith multiple tiers and\n\n288\n00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:00.674\nwhy you would need them, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:00.674 --> 00:16:04.490\nIf your organization might be\nissuing out certificates once Okay?\n\n290\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.908\nAnd not very often.\n\n291\n00:16:05.908 --> 00:16:09.664\nThen doing the single one in\nthat single type of tier,\n\n292\n00:16:09.664 --> 00:16:13.610\nor one tier authority is\nprobably the way to go.\n\n293\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.750\nWhere you might see this is for\nexample inside of an organization.\n\n294\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.500\nLet's say you decide you're gonna put up a\nbunch of wireless access points throughout\n\n295\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.120\nyour entire campus or your building.\n\n296\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.820\nBut you wanna make sure it's actually done\nby issuing certificates to everybody.\n\n297\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.980\nWell you may go ahead and\nset that up to where it's actually\n\n298\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.080\nissued out certificates to all of\nthose wireless access points, so\n\n299\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.990\nthey can do that 802.1x\nauthentication back to\n\n300\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.080\ntheir wireless controller and\neverything that they need to.\n\n301\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.020\nBut then, at that point, right?\n\n302\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.110\nOnce everything like that is done, well\nthis guy's not gonna get pegged too often,\n\n303\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.770\nexcept as individuals connect in.\n\n304\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.260\nAnd that might be more than enough.\n\n305\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.670\nBut if you're constantly not only having\nto do that, but you're having to issue,\n\n306\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.024\nyou're having to revoke certificates,\n\n307\n00:17:00.024 --> 00:17:04.070\nyou're having to actually do a bunch\nof other things, that's when you start\n\n308\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:09.030\nconsidering multiple tiers here in larger\norganizations that they happen often.\n\n309\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.720\nSo the more often of renewing and\n\n310\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.920\nrevoking information is gonna be more\ncommon on your network, the more\n\n311\n00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.970\nthat you're actually going to need to\nhave multiple tiers involved, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.830\nThe other thing about multiple tiers\nis gonna be that what we call that\n\n313\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:28.500\ncertificate revocation list, which we did\njust mention briefly in another episode.\n\n314\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.920\nAs soon as you issue out a certificate,\nit's got a lifetime to it.\n\n315\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.700\nThere is an expiration date.\n\n316\n00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.256\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a sick life cycle that we\nsee here, revolving from the beginning\n\n317\n00:17:40.256 --> 00:17:44.668\nwhen it's born or issued out, and\nthen till the time that it is expired and\n\n318\n00:17:44.668 --> 00:17:47.397\nthen what are we gonna\ndo when it's expired.\n\n319\n00:17:47.397 --> 00:17:52.012\nAnd what happens if someone compromises\nthis certificate and things like that, so.\n\n320\n00:17:52.012 --> 00:17:56.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is a part of we\nhave to take care of the certificate\n\n321\n00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:59.041\nfrom the entire life cycle approach,\nright?\n\n322\n00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:03.334\nBeginning from when it's issued all\nthe way to the end of its life and\n\n323\n00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:08.200\nanything that happens in between,\nit has been compromised.\n\n324\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.003\nIf it changes if the machine\nis no longer in use anymore,\n\n325\n00:18:11.003 --> 00:18:12.922\nwhat do you do with that certificate?\n\n326\n00:18:12.922 --> 00:18:17.792\nSo all that has to be managed in some\nfashion, in some way, in some sense so\n\n327\n00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:23.060\nthat the CAs that we have in place really\nneed to be able to help us do that.\n\n328\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.910\nWhere we may end up having more than\nthe idea of just an issuing CA but\n\n329\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.790\nwe may have a registration authority,\n\n330\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.900\nthere may be other machines\nthat are involved, you name it.\n\n331\n00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.940\nThe other thing, of course,\n\n332\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.790\nis you might want to think about this with\nmultiple tiers if you have an automatic\n\n333\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.320\ntype of enrollment process such\nas an online enrollment as well.\n\n334\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.350\nYou have machines that\nare constantly actually online.\n\n335\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.750\nAnd they're gonna enroll automatically\nas your certificates expire.\n\n336\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.560\nWell, you don't wanna leave\nyour root CA on all the time.\n\n337\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.660\nUsing an intermediate one is\nprobably the way to go, too.\n\n338\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.560\nSo there's a lot of talk in terms of\nhow this infrastructure plays out.\n\n339\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.740\nBut this is kinda that basic process\nhere that we need to understand.\n\n340\n00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.060\nThat you can have multiple tiers.\n\n341\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.730\nYou can have a single tier.\n\n342\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.940\nBut they all serve the same thing\nin which they're gonna try and\n\n343\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.130\nhand out certificates and what they do.\n\n344\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.644\nNow, of course then, it goes to figure\nthat once this infrastructure is in place,\n\n345\n00:19:17.644 --> 00:19:20.679\nand if it is,\nhow do you go about getting a certificate?\n\n346\n00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:22.700\nIs pretty much what we wanna talk about.\n\n347\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.900\nWhich is the idea of what we\ncall the enrollment process,\n\n348\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.156\nis where we want to begin here, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.990\nSo when we start to take a look at\nthe idea of the enrollment process,\n\n350\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.830\non this diagram, I hope that this kind of\nhelps us out as well when we begin, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.700\nIt all begins with whoever is\ngoing to need a certificate.\n\n352\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.030\nThat they can generate\na certificate request.\n\n353\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.180\nNow this can be done in multiple ways and\n\n354\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.750\nfashions depending on what you\nhave running on your machine.\n\n355\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.200\nAnd you can do this, right?\n\n356\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.080\nSo inside of, let's say,\nlike if you were doing this internally\n\n357\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.660\nlike working with\nMicrosoft Certificate Authorities.\n\n358\n00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.100\nYou can bring up a web server,\nthe IIS server,\n\n359\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.850\nand that actually has something that\ncan generate certificates for you.\n\n360\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.860\nAnd even generate them for\nclients if they want it to,\n\n361\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.670\nyou simply go to a web page and\nit tells you,\n\n362\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.060\nthis is the information you need to\nbe able to generate and put in here.\n\n363\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.370\nAnd then it can actually generate\na request certificate for you do so, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.803\nSo, all that is pretty much possible for\nyou to be able to do.\n\n365\n00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:23.309\nAll right-\n&gt;&gt; And Microsoft, and\n\n366\n00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:27.040\nwe might even have shows\nhere on ITPRO.TV's site.\n\n367\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.678\nBut they want you to use their products so\n\n368\n00:20:29.678 --> 00:20:33.022\nthey walk you through\nstep-by-step on technet.\n\n369\n00:20:33.022 --> 00:20:35.760\nYou guys can just set that up yourselves.\n\n370\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.736\nDon't think of it as\na completely daunting task.\n\n371\n00:20:38.736 --> 00:20:41.860\nJust know that there are resources\nto help you through this process.\n\n372\n00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.523\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n373\n00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:47.253\nlet's take a look at step-by-step\nthen how this is normally done, okay.\n\n374\n00:20:47.253 --> 00:20:51.868\nIf you are a requesting server or\na host and you realize that hey,\n\n375\n00:20:51.868 --> 00:20:55.385\nI need to generate a certificate for\nmy machine.\n\n376\n00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:59.989\nWell your machine then, you go ahead\nto tell the generator a key pair,\n\n377\n00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:04.400\nthe public and private key pair\n&gt;&gt; Once you do that,\n\n378\n00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.320\nthen you can generate a request.\n\n379\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:13.210\nThat request will be based on your\npublic key, so it identifies you.\n\n380\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.565\nThat's what it's supposed to do here.\n\n381\n00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:19.495\nNow when you do that and\nyou generate that request based on you,\n\n382\n00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:22.922\nthat turns it into this\nparticular format right here.\n\n383\n00:21:22.922 --> 00:21:28.690\nThis PKCS public key certificate\nstructure or standard, I think.\n\n384\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.120\nI can't remember what\nthe actual proper acronym is.\n\n385\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.730\nIt turns it into a standardized format.\n\n386\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.700\nWell route CAs issuing CAs.\n\n387\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.100\nThey can recognize, they understand\nwhat something like that is about.\n\n388\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.180\nSo they take that information\nbased on your public key.\n\n389\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.240\nAnd there are two possibilities\nonce the root CA accepts it, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.940\nIt can then say, hey, I see the request,\nand there's two possibilities here.\n\n391\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.250\nIt can either automatically generate and\ngo, I approve this.\n\n392\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.950\nWhatever request comes in I'm\ngonna approve, and we're gonna go.\n\n393\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.250\nUsually that doesn't happen.\n\n394\n00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.400\nAnd the reason why you don't want that to\nhappen is, that means anybody can generate\n\n395\n00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.750\na particular PKCS number ten here and\nget a certificate from you.\n\n396\n00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.730\nYou don't want that for a bad guy to\ncome into your network and do that.\n\n397\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.170\nSo normally you want this\nprocess to be manual.\n\n398\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.870\nI know that sounds strange, but\n\n399\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.230\nyou really want somebody making\nthe decision to do this.\n\n400\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.690\nIf it is not approved,\nwell they don't get a certificate issue.\n\n401\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.936\nThat makes sense, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:36.710\nBut if it is approved here, this is\nwhen a couple of other things happen.\n\n403\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.910\nOnce it's been approved,\nnow the certificate\n\n404\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.560\nauthority will end up taking\nyour original request and\n\n405\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.330\ndigitally sign it, okay,\nis what it will do.\n\n406\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.780\nAnd then,\nit will also generate a certificate,\n\n407\n00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.601\nwhich we call an X.509 certificate.\n\n408\n00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:03.740\nThe other thing that will also happen,\nis it will say, hey look, I'm issuing\n\n409\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.262\nthis certificate but there's gonna be\nan expiration date on this certificate as\n\n410\n00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:14.040\nwell, and it will also update the CRL,\nor the Certificate Ratification List.\n\n411\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.380\nA certificate can be revoked for\n\n412\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.950\nwhatever purpose that it needs\nto be revoked for, okay.\n\n413\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.020\nUsually a lot of times,\n\n414\n00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.240\nthis type of replication happens when\na certificate is or not a certificate,\n\n415\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.720\na server is going to be decommissioned\nat some point or no longer exist.\n\n416\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.550\nIt could be key compromise, you realized\nsomebody's compromise this certificate,\n\n417\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.800\nyou notify this root authority and\n\n418\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.730\nthey can put on the certificate\nreplication list right away.\n\n419\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.990\nYou don't know if that certificate is\nstill valid, whatever it might be.\n\n420\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.173\nIt could expire, you name it, there's\nseveral different reasons for this.\n\n421\n00:23:47.173 --> 00:23:51.277\n&gt;&gt; And there's one option, it's a little\nless invasive than actually revoking let's\n\n422\n00:23:51.277 --> 00:23:54.983\nsay if you're still investigating to see\nif that I can't recall off the top of\n\n423\n00:23:54.983 --> 00:23:56.534\nmy head Ronnie do you remember?\n\n424\n00:23:56.534 --> 00:24:00.804\nIt's like a temporary disabling of that\ncertificate instead of actually revoking\n\n425\n00:24:00.804 --> 00:24:03.247\nit but just in case you find-\n&gt;&gt; Put it on hold, something like that.\n\n426\n00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:05.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, the hold status.\n\n427\n00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.522\nThere's so many different\nthings that can be done here.\n\n428\n00:24:08.522 --> 00:24:13.190\nBut, this particular certificate\nrevocation list, this is important.\n\n429\n00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.980\nIt's important because it's\npart of the validation process\n\n430\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.070\nwhen you present your\ncertificate to somebody.\n\n431\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.100\nOkay?\n\n432\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.920\nSo, if everything is approved, you get\nthat signed certificate request and\n\n433\n00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.650\nthen you also end up getting\nyour digital certificate.\n\n434\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.630\nNow, what about the signed request here?\n\n435\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.680\nWell, we go back to that idea of\nthat digital signature, right?\n\n436\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.000\nThis is now where my machine, as it gets\nit back onto this particular process\n\n437\n00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.810\nright here, It gives me that ability\nto take that signed request and\n\n438\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.690\ndo what, find that hashing function and\nbe able to actually go back through and\n\n439\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.430\nsee if the data matches the way that it\nshould, and be able to check that out and\n\n440\n00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.020\nverify it as well.\n\n441\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.130\nSo once we have everything that we need we\nverify that it absolutely came from what,\n\n442\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:11.010\nthe issuing certificate, or\nthe issuing CA here, and\n\n443\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.970\nnow we store it as our own\ncertificate on our machines.\n\n444\n00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:21.450\nAs we connect to other machines out there,\nfor example like ITPro.Tv's website,\n\n445\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:26.206\nwell what can happen is your machine\nchecks the certificate, and it says,\n\n446\n00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:29.230\nhey who can I validate this against?\n\n447\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.920\nAnd on your machine there's\na store of what we call\n\n448\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.280\ntrusted route authorities, okay?\n\n449\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.940\nAnd it can look through that list and go\nhey, this is tied all the way up to that\n\n450\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.890\ntrusted route authority,\nlet me check and verify against what\n\n451\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.980\nthat certificate revocation list to see\nif this certificate is still valid.\n\n452\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.600\nIf it is, it will say yes,\nthis certificate is good and it's trusted,\n\n453\n00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600\nit's secure.\n\n454\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.460\nWhatever the nomenclature is today.\n\n455\n00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.960\nIt will actually give us all\nthat information right away\n\n456\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.120\nthat will verify and let us know.\n\n457\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.740\nBut if the certificate cannot be trusted,\nnow you've got a decision to make, right?\n\n458\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.220\nThe very fact that hey I need to\nconnect here, I don't wanna do this or\n\n459\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.840\nI do wanna do this here.\n\n460\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.970\nBut that's what you also end\nup seeing as well, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.330\nSo it doesn't mean that\nyou can't trust it.\n\n462\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.610\nIt just means that you'd\nbetter be careful.\n\n463\n00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.670\nEspecially out on the Internet.\n\n464\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.530\nIt's never something good that\nyou want to kind of bypass,\n\n465\n00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.280\nunless you know exactly what certificate\nyou're talking about here So\n\n466\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.550\nit's an entire process in terms of\nthat request form that we have to do.\n\n467\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure depending on your\norganization there's gonna be a particular\n\n468\n00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:37.440\npolicy to follow, because you're\ndealing with security here and\n\n469\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.640\nyou might have something like the in of in\ncontrol to say two out of the three people\n\n470\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.390\nfrom our IT department have to be present\nin order to issue out these certificates.\n\n471\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:51.030\nOr you might even have a dedicated HSM,\na hardware security module,\n\n472\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.810\nto go ahead and store and\nissue out these in a very secure way.\n\n473\n00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.180\nBut there are just a lot of\npossibilities with this set up here.\n\n474\n00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.710\n&gt;&gt; All this again depends on the amount\nof resources that you have to have here.\n\n475\n00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.840\nWith the HSM, the hardware security\nmodules, these are very expensive.\n\n476\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.450\nBut they're pretty much the top\nof the line security device\n\n477\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.240\nthat really helps to keep your digital\ncertificate as secure as it can be.\n\n478\n00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.000\nBut overall though,\nusing something like the M of N,\n\n479\n00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.585\nwhich I'm never gonna be\nable to say correctly here.\n\n480\n00:27:20.585 --> 00:27:22.255\nUsing something like that\nis another process but\n\n481\n00:27:22.255 --> 00:27:26.295\nit does require you to be able to have\nall those components in place for\n\n482\n00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:28.705\nsomething like a key escrow\nif you're gonna do this.\n\n483\n00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:33.865\nSo it is kind of a good process,\nbut at the same time you do need\n\n484\n00:27:33.865 --> 00:27:39.430\nto understand this entire process is\nreally designed around the idea that every\n\n485\n00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:44.090\nother system has inherent weaknesses to\nit that you've gotta be able to overcome.\n\n486\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.856\nThe inherent weakness for\nthese systems, right,\n\n487\n00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:51.239\nis the compromise of that root CA and\nthat's what you have to worry about, okay.\n\n488\n00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:54.808\nThe compromise of a root CA is as\nbad as it gets for, of course,\n\n489\n00:27:54.808 --> 00:27:57.050\na certificate authority.\n\n490\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.890\nNow when it comes down to,\nthere's a couple of things that I\n\n491\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.620\nwas looking at this and\nI was like what did I forget here?\n\n492\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.840\nOne of the things that I forgot\nas far as the approval goes is\n\n493\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.420\nhow the heck do we know when we\nshould approve it or who approves it?\n\n494\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.020\nWell it's simple.\n\n495\n00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.246\nInside of a Microsoft CA I\njust right click and\n\n496\n00:28:14.246 --> 00:28:16.658\nsay approved, or\nassigned I think is what it is.\n\n497\n00:28:16.658 --> 00:28:18.620\nUnassigned or assigned.\n\n498\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.990\nI think is what you can do or\nthat's what an issue.\n\n499\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.300\nYou can issue the certificate and\nthat means it's approved.\n\n500\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.380\nBut in a real public CA that's\nout there on the Internet right?\n\n501\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.430\nThey can say all right what is this for?\n\n502\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.850\nAnd then they may require\nyou to verify who you are.\n\n503\n00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n504\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.140\nin other words they may say Ronnie I need\nto see a copy of your driver license just\n\n505\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.300\nfor me okay.\n\n506\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.030\nOr you send this particular documentation.\n\n507\n00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.810\nBut for a business,\n\n508\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.580\nit could be where they really want\nto see the charter of your business.\n\n509\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n510\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.160\nI think that's called high assurance\nsecurity there where they want you\n\n511\n00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.890\nto give them your blood type and\nall sorts of things, yeah.\n\n512\n00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's part of it you know.\n\n513\n00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nAnd I'm just joking.\n\n514\n00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.916\nReally not your blood type.\n\n515\n00:29:00.916 --> 00:29:02.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But especially like for\n\n516\n00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.670\nfinancial industries and\n\n517\n00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.560\nbanking entities, they have to have\nall that information to vouch.\n\n518\n00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.330\nBecause if I'm vouching for\nyou Ronnie, I need something to\n\n519\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.750\ngive that some sustenance or weight behind\nit, so I'm not just vouching for you.\n\n520\n00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.960\nI say I'm vouching for you, but\nI really don't know anything about you.\n\n521\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.300\nI need to do my work as\na certificate authority\n\n522\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.500\nto validate my company\nthat's based upon trust.\n\n523\n00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a due diligence idea, right?\n\n524\n00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.880\nSo that hierarchy that we have, that chain\nof trust that we have, has to be there.\n\n525\n00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.610\nAnd it really does.\n\n526\n00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.610\nThe approval process\nnormally is not an easy one.\n\n527\n00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.790\nI'm not gonna say it's\ncompletely not easy.\n\n528\n00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.720\nYou can go out there even today\nif you try and type in like\n\n529\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.650\ntemporary certificate out on the internet,\nyou can get one for yourself and they'll\n\n530\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.220\nwalk you through the process of how you\nrequest it and how you do everything.\n\n531\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.240\nAnd get a temporary one issued to you.\n\n532\n00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.840\nBe sure that if you do so and\nyou wanna practice something like this,\n\n533\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.040\nrealize they are gonna call you cuz they\nwant you to buy that certificate, right.\n\n534\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.962\nSo they're gonna call you like crazy, but\nit's part of something that if you wanna\n\n535\n00:30:02.962 --> 00:30:06.010\nget used to it that's\nthe way you're gonna do that.\n\n536\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.753\nAs we start moving more into cloud\ninfrastructure and having to secure those,\n\n537\n00:30:11.753 --> 00:30:16.104\nwe're gonna depend on the PKI\ninfrastructure even more and\n\n538\n00:30:16.104 --> 00:30:19.163\ndigital certificates even more as well.\n\n539\n00:30:19.163 --> 00:30:25.121\nThe only last thing that I wanna make\nsure is this idea of the expiration date.\n\n540\n00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:29.354\nWhen I first began you\nused to see fairly common,\n\n541\n00:30:29.354 --> 00:30:35.856\nyou would be three years or it would be\nlike up to five years a certificate for\n\n542\n00:30:35.856 --> 00:30:40.214\nyou getting issued Like, get a website.\n\n543\n00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:43.315\nYou might see that the certificate would\nbe between three to five years before its\n\n544\n00:30:43.315 --> 00:30:44.650\nexpiration date.\n\n545\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.210\nToday, very difficult to\nsee one longer than a year.\n\n546\n00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.030\nSometimes two years, but you'd probably\nnot see one for three years anymore.\n\n547\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.980\nAnd that shows you that the way and\n\n548\n00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.750\nthe technology there, right,\nhas made it to where they're saying,\n\n549\n00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:04.430\nwe cannot afford to issue out this\ngigantically long term types of\n\n550\n00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.520\ncertificates, because they're more\nthan likely to get compromised.\n\n551\n00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.730\nSo they've shortened up the duration and\nusually it's about a year,\n\n552\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.010\nis kind of what you generally see today,\nmore often than not.\n\n553\n00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.710\nSo shorter lengths of time\nbetween you having to get\n\n554\n00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.980\na new certificate is also\na part of that process.\n\n555\n00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.960\nMake sure you keep them\nup to date is also a key.\n\n556\n00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.130\nAnd then check.\n\n557\n00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:29.440\n&gt;&gt; It's a little more work, a little\nmore manual labor there if you will.\n\n558\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.490\nBut it is also more secure also.\n\n559\n00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.200\n&gt;&gt; And that's kinda the key.\n\n560\n00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.000\nThat's kinda the whole reason behind this,\n\n561\n00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.360\nis that we're gonna see that more\ndevices are gonna depend on it.\n\n562\n00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.535\nAnd even one day when you go,\n\n563\n00:31:39.535 --> 00:31:42.750\nno I just need to type in this,\nyou might find out that they're saying no\n\n564\n00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:46.110\nyou need to actually do this\ncertificate authority thing.\n\n565\n00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:51.190\nAnd it's gonna go that way because we\nare starting to see that this is one of\n\n566\n00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.610\nthose security measures that are in\nplace that really is more secure than\n\n567\n00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.570\njust about everything else that\nwe've had in the past so far, so\n\n568\n00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.953\nit is going to continue to head this way.\n\n569\n00:31:59.953 --> 00:32:02.066\n&gt;&gt; And that term was suspended so\nI looked at my notes\n\n570\n00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:02.939\n&gt;&gt; Suspended there we go\n\n571\n00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:03.572\n&gt;&gt; So I looked at my notes.\n\n572\n00:32:03.572 --> 00:32:08.040\nSo, suspended before completely revoked\nif you were wondering but just in case.\n\n573\n00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.370\nWell I think that really does\ndescribe the key fundamentals\n\n574\n00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.050\nhere when we're looking at\nour PKI infrastructure.\n\n575\n00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.670\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it quits for this show.\n\n576\n00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.530\nI think we're about out of time.\n\n577\n00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.090\nSo remember,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n578\n00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n579\n00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.915\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n580\n00:32:25.915 -->

00:00:08.594\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:10.106\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals Series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.460\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.130\nIn this episode we will be describing our\ndifferent types of key exchange security.\n\n8\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.440\nWith us today, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nthank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue on to take a look at,\n\n10\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.010\nof course, our Cisco cybersecurity\nfundamentals series.\n\n11\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.780\nAnd we're at this point where we need\nto talk, of course, about key exchange,\n\n12\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.610\nespecially about the management\npart of key exchange as well.\n\n13\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.550\nAs much as we depend on key exchange,\n\n14\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.560\nwe have to note the differences\nas far as weaknesses.\n\n15\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.810\nAs well as the strengths inside of key\nexchange that we all depend on as well.\n\n16\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.510\nAnd the reason why this is\nimportant is because of\n\n17\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.260\nthe way that key exchange ends up working.\n\n18\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.530\nAnd the idea of cryptographic key\nexchanges work is that all it takes,\n\n19\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140\nright, is a single break in the flow\nof the different components involved.\n\n20\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.961\nIt really compromises everything.\n\n21\n00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:17.609\nSo this a domino effect of different\ntragedies that can happen.\n\n22\n00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.081\nIf we don't actually understand\nwhat those tragedies are,\n\n23\n00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.860\nthey can happen very quickly.\n\n24\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.980\nAnd the hard part is we\nmight not ever spot it.\n\n25\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.850\nSo that's why we want to take a look then\nat a moment at the different components\n\n26\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.770\ninside of the cryptographic key exchange.\n\n27\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.420\nAnd we're going to talk about their\nstrengths as well as their weaknesses,\n\n28\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.800\nto make sure that we understand it, and\n\n29\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.760\nhopefully we'll put it together in\nthe picture of what happens along the way.\n\n30\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.710\nIf it's successful, what happens, and\nthen, of course, if it's unsuccessful,\n\n31\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.270\nwhat is it that we actually have\nto kind of examine and look for.\n\n32\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.680\nSo this is a tough topic.\n\n33\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.810\nWhen it comes down to it as far as\nan exam topic goes on the exam,\n\n34\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.620\nthis is one of the vaguest\nones that they have.\n\n35\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.940\nAnd this is probably something that\nCisco probably doesn't want me to say.\n\n36\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.940\nBut it is the vaguest exam\ntopic that we have to cover.\n\n37\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.630\nSo it's very difficult for us to really\npinpoint in on anything that they want.\n\n38\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.880\nBut that's probably the best way for us is\nto talk about the different components and\n\n39\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.270\nto see what happens there.\n\n40\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, in previous episodes,\nwe've covered things like\n\n41\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.170\nsetting up our different CAs and\nlooking at cryptographic components.\n\n42\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.540\nSo if you guys haven't taken\na look at those shows already,\n\n43\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.420\nthen I would suggest you to do so\nbecause having a solid understanding in\n\n44\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.220\ncryptography will really just\nsolidify this concept and\n\n45\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.640\nall of its vagueness and glory here so\nat least you can be prepared and\n\n46\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.350\nfeel confident when you're\nwalking into that booth.\n\n47\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n48\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.480\nlet's start really from the very\nbeginning of just key exchange, right.\n\n49\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.170\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Whether we're talking about symmetric\n\n50\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.010\nkey or whether we're talking\nabout asymmetric key exchange.\n\n51\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.820\nWhichever one it is, the secrecy of it,\nright, depends on the very fact that we\n\n52\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.220\nhave some key that allows us to encrypt\nthe data and decrypt the data, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.460\nSo, a symmetric key is one key, right?\n\n54\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.700\nIt encrypts as well as decrypts.\n\n55\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.620\nAnd the only way for us to make\nsure that that stays private and\n\n56\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.650\nremains encrypted is that even if I\nwere to send Cherokee a message that was\n\n57\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.480\nencrypted, Cherokee would still have\nto be able to get that particular key.\n\n58\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.550\nNow the way that it used to be done is\nfairly simple, is that I would probably\n\n59\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.320\nmanually walk over to her and\nhand her what the key would actually be.\n\n60\n00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.660\nThat way nobody else is\nactually intercepting that and\n\n61\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.500\nthere's no man in the middle\nattack that's what's gonna happen.\n\n62\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.290\n&gt;&gt; So\nI read this bit of information online.\n\n63\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.910\nI thought it was pretty interesting.\n\n64\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.420\nYou know how sometimes artists\nget information leaked,\n\n65\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.040\nsongs are leaked ahead of times,\nmusicians,\n\n66\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.690\nso Ed Sheeran is friends,\nthey're like BFF, with Taylor Swift.\n\n67\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.440\n&gt;&gt; BFF, yes, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, BFF, and so apparently she is so\ninterested in her security,\n\n69\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.970\nshe doesn't want any of her songs leaked,\nthat she actually had someone\n\n70\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.790\nfly to Ed Sheeran, let him listen\nto the song on the iPad before he\n\n71\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.710\ndecided if he wanted to collaborate and\nthen took the iPad back with him.\n\n72\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.350\nSo the same concept even, I mean if you\nwanna talk about being extremely secure,\n\n73\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.000\nit's still, it's an outdated method but\nit's still the way to go.\n\n74\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, it really still\nis part of that process, right?\n\n75\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.970\nWhat is the most secure method that we\ncan get to get you the decryption key and\n\n76\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.760\nthe encryption key so that on both sides,\nonce we have it exchanged,\n\n77\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.600\nwe're fine, right?\n\n78\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.910\nBut before that point,\nto just get it there,\n\n79\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.520\nwe have to have some security\nmethod to do that So\n\n80\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.590\nwe understand that that's the safest\nmethod as far as the symmetric key goes.\n\n81\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.070\nAs long as you're close,\nit's not really a big deal.\n\n82\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.530\nBut once you start expanding\nthe distances, though,\n\n83\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.330\nit becomes even more difficult.\n\n84\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.060\nAnd that's when we start to move and\n\n85\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.610\nwe start to understand thing which\nis why asymmetric key encryption\n\n86\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.040\nis a lot more protective in this\nway which is kind neat, right?\n\n87\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.450\nWe still need an encryption key,\nwe still need a decryption key,\n\n88\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.538\nbut this time it's two separate keys,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:00.080\nSo we always want to, of course,\n\n90\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.190\nprotect the the private key which\nwe use to decrypt the data.\n\n91\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.800\nAnd we always want to be able to\nshare that public key as well.\n\n92\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.190\nBut during that time, right, if we're also\nusing this as really the main means of\n\n93\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.690\nencryption, it still means I have to be\nable to share a portion of that private,\n\n94\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.490\nor actually create private keys,\nto encrypt the data in between.\n\n95\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.420\nAnd once we start doing this,\nright, we might generate them\n\n96\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.920\nautomatically by using some type\nof key generator on both sides.\n\n97\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.620\nBut the problem is getting them to match.\n\n98\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.450\nSo that's when we start coming up\nwith things like Diffie-Hellman\n\n99\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.640\nkey exchange, right?\n\n100\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.190\nThe Diffie-Hellman key exchange says,\n\n101\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.860\nlook, we're not gonna exchange anything\nthat somebody couldn't publicly get.\n\n102\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.980\nBut from just that\nexchange of information,\n\n103\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.000\nyou should be able to generate that\nsame key as what I would have.\n\n104\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.640\nSo in that way, we're not, I'm not\nactually trying to fly my private key\n\n105\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.710\nover to Cherokee, so that she can\nalso decrypt data that I send her.\n\n106\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.900\nBut at this point, we're actually able\nto generate the keys on our own end.\n\n107\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Yea, not everyone has that Taylor Swift\nbudget there to send the courier\n\n108\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.720\nacross the globe.\n\n109\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; So having these protocols really does\n\n110\n00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.440\ncome in handy, Ronnie.\n\n111\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.573\n&gt;&gt; It really does because this now\nmeans I'm not really sending anything\n\n112\n00:06:16.573 --> 00:06:20.144\nacross an non-private link, or\na public link I should say,\n\n113\n00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:22.260\nthat you wouldn't be able to find.\n\n114\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.954\nSo normally they're prime numbers.\n\n115\n00:06:25.954 --> 00:06:27.270\nI was trying to think of\nwhat they normally are.\n\n116\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.920\nThey're normally prime numbers, so\nanybody can generate prime numbers,\n\n117\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.640\nit's no real big deal to do that and\nthat's something that they can find out.\n\n118\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.150\nBut the key is on both sides is how they\ndo that and then generate, of course,\n\n119\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.300\nthose encryption keys that we\nneed that are exactly the same so\n\n120\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.920\nwe can decrypt the data.\n\n121\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.444\nNow the reason why I wanted to\nstart off with that, right,\n\n122\n00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:52.420\nis that just having that understanding\nof where the key exchange comes from and\n\n123\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.768\nwhy that's an important method is\na strength as well as a weakness, right?\n\n124\n00:06:56.768 --> 00:07:01.007\nIn the symmetric key encryption, the\nweakness is somebody could intercept it,\n\n125\n00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:03.890\nright, in the middle,\nokay, they literally could.\n\n126\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.440\nIf I said, okay, we're gonna hand\nthe iPod off to whoever it is,\n\n127\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.992\nthe BFF of Taylor Swift-\n&gt;&gt; Ed Sheeran.\n\n128\n00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Ed Sheeran, to do that, that's fine.\n\n129\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.580\nBut somebody could still be listening\non the plane and tape recording this.\n\n130\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.000\nYou're listening to it on\nthe way over there, too.\n\n131\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.770\nSo it can still be\ncompromised in that way.\n\n132\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.390\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n133\n00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.620\nBut with the public key exchange,\na lot more difficult to compromise.\n\n134\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.970\nBut at the same time, because of the way\nthat computers are now much more powerful.\n\n135\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.570\nThey can, if we are not careful\nabout the key length that we use,\n\n136\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.280\nthey can be compromised as well.\n\n137\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.632\nSo they can be subject to the idea of\nactually a very short brute force type of\n\n138\n00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:51.191\nfactoring that can be done, where now\nthey can actually end up getting the keys\n\n139\n00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:53.771\nbefore the time that\nyou think they should.\n\n140\n00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:59.486\nSo just in that methodology alone, okay,\nof just a symmetric and asymmetric There's\n\n141\n00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:04.880\na lot of strengths that are there, and\nthe exchange of it is pretty much to key.\n\n142\n00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.630\nThe swapping of the keys, making sure\nthe secret is a strength for us.\n\n143\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.570\nBut we also have to kind of be aware\nthat maybe the exposure of just\n\n144\n00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.690\nenough data out there, and the shortness\nof our keys could also expose, or\n\n145\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.450\nit could compromise that\nkey exchange as well.\n\n146\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:27.630\nSo when you start to do some type of\nsecurity investigation towards trying\n\n147\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.690\nto figure out what happened, right, you\nalways wanna look from the very beginning.\n\n148\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.220\nIs this a compromise of\nthe key exchange itself, or\n\n149\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.360\nis it a compromise of let's say\na digital signature signing?\n\n150\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.760\nIs it a compromise of\nthe certificate itself?\n\n151\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.560\nIs it a compromise of the CA?\n\n152\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.462\nIs it a compromise of just\nthe actual asymmetric process?\n\n153\n00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:52.830\nAll of this is something that we have to\nlook into, or we're gonna find ourselves\n\n154\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.250\nat a lack of something, which is\nnot knowing exactly what happened.\n\n155\n00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.277\nAnd that's where we're gonna get lost.\n\n156\n00:08:57.277 --> 00:08:57.962\n&gt;&gt; Well exactly.\n\n157\n00:08:57.962 --> 00:09:01.019\nIf we don't know where that\nattack has transpired,\n\n158\n00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:05.600\nthen how can we help fix or\nprevent that attack from happening again?\n\n159\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.067\n&gt;&gt; There's so many different things that\ncan go on especially with the key exchange\n\n160\n00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:14.980\nitself, and the understanding of\nthe asymmetric algorithms stuff\n\n161\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.880\nwhere we have to kinda pay attention.\n\n162\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.440\nSo a few that I wanna point\nout is error analysis, right?\n\n163\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.650\nThe very fact that somebody could say,\nlook,\n\n164\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.150\nI can't break through this but I'm getting\nthese errors that are really different and\n\n165\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.680\nthey're actually leading me to more and\nmore information.\n\n166\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.470\nWell if they're trying to crack keys, they\nmay actually get information like that and\n\n167\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.570\nthat could lead them to be able\nto point out a little bit more.\n\n168\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.503\nThere's also something called\na chosen ciphertext attack as well,\n\n169\n00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:45.606\nwhich is relatively passive and\nwhich the attacker ends up discovering\n\n170\n00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:51.405\nsome helpful information by simply\nmodifying what they receive as ciphertext.\n\n171\n00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:53.787\nSo they get an encrypted package and\nthey go,\n\n172\n00:09:53.787 --> 00:09:56.231\nwhat happens if I add this\nlittle bit in here and\n\n173\n00:09:56.231 --> 00:10:00.006\nall of a sudden it changes some value\nthat they think is gonna change to?\n\n174\n00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:03.200\nWell, now they've got a leg up,\nas well, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.970\nBut overall, one of the things that\nnow has kind of come to the forefront\n\n176\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.690\nin the last 10 or\n15 is the length of the key itself, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.890\nSo remember that, at this point, as far\nas public key cryptography goes, and\n\n178\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:23.620\neven symmetric key cryptography goes,\nyou cannot depend on 512 bit\n\n179\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.850\nencryption, you can't depend on 768,\nthey're all pretty much cracked.\n\n180\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.276\nAnd today, even Cisco's own\nrecommendation begins really with 3072 bit\n\n181\n00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:38.304\nwhen you start talking about\nthis type of key length.\n\n182\n00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:42.555\nSo a much greater key length then,\nof course,\n\n183\n00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:47.460\nincreases the ability to\ndefend against somebody's\n\n184\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.270\nattack with the length\nof that key as well.\n\n185\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.560\nSo there is a lot there but,\n\n186\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.220\nwe do have to think about it from that\nstandpoint at the very beginning.\n\n187\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.877\nIs it the process itself of the key\nexchange that could be compromised at this\n\n188\n00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:03.397\npoint?\n\n189\n00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.730\nSo, if it is, then we have to be careful.\n\n190\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.870\nNow, another thing that we're also\nsubject to, of course, is the exchange of\n\n191\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.950\nthe keys, and let me show you where we\nmight have something like this go on.\n\n192\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.810\nSo, here on my laptop,\nthis is kind of a fairly regular aspect or\n\n193\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.500\nregular exchange,\nwhen we start using public key exchange.\n\n194\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.516\nSo here we have our public and\nprivate keys.\n\n195\n00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:28.040\nRemember, we never share the private key,\nwe only share the public key.\n\n196\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.060\nWe digitally sign that public key.\n\n197\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.810\nThe sender gets this.\n\n198\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:37.630\nFrom that point, he can now encrypt\nthe data and send me that data encrypted,\n\n199\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.710\nand that's why I have the lock here.\n\n200\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.365\nOver on my end, I can now have the only\nkey that opens that particular\n\n201\n00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:48.192\ndecryption and then the user can read it.\n\n202\n00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:50.420\nThat's pretty much the way it goes.\n\n203\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.740\nA compromise though in the system\nthat you might also be able to see\n\n204\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.090\nis something like this instead.\n\n205\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.300\nSo I might still get issued my public and\nprivate key.\n\n206\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.760\nAnd when I am now asked to share\nthe public key with whoever I need to,\n\n207\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.750\ninstead an attacker essentially does\na man in the middle attack, and\n\n208\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.180\nhe forges a key in my name, but\nit's actually this attacker's public key.\n\n209\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.890\nSo instead of sending the real\npublic key from the originator,\n\n210\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:28.480\nhe then sends his own public key that\nis digitally signed by the attacker.\n\n211\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.730\nAnd when the sender receives it and\nhe thinks that he needs to communicate\n\n212\n00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.990\nback to the original, well,\nhe encrypts it with who?\n\n213\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.950\nWith the attacker's public key,\nand that now, of course,\n\n214\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.270\ngets sent back to the attacker and\nnot to the originator.\n\n215\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.610\nAnd then the attacker can open it and\nthey can read it.\n\n216\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:53.032\nAt no time notice does the receiver\nreally know anything's happened.\n\n217\n00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:55.056\nThe originator says,\nI sent out my [INAUDIBLE]\n\n218\n00:12:55.056 --> 00:12:56.225\n&gt;&gt; My message is sent.\n\n219\n00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:59.212\n&gt;&gt; It's sent, everything's done,\neverything's good, so\n\n220\n00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:03.150\nI didn't have anything compromised\non my side that I know about.\n\n221\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.590\nAnd that's where our problem also\ncomes in with the key exchange.\n\n222\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.230\nYou cannot tell if somebody has\npossibly stolen that key yet.\n\n223\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.310\nNow it might be a way that you can\ndetermine that, but not very easily.\n\n224\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.940\nBut at this point, you do have to worry\nabout things like this during that\n\n225\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.490\nkey exchange if that's what's\ngonna end up happening, and\n\n226\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.370\nyou've gotta kind of be aware.\n\n227\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.443\nNow another part of this,\n\n228\n00:13:27.443 --> 00:13:31.942\nwhat should prevent this is of\ncourse our digital signatures.\n\n229\n00:13:31.942 --> 00:13:35.215\nRemember that in digital\nsignature creation,\n\n230\n00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:40.365\nthis is supposed to give us what,\nverify the integrity of the data itself,\n\n231\n00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:43.419\nand verify where the data\norigin came from.\n\n232\n00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:47.910\nWell, that's all plain and good,\nunless I am the one that did what?\n\n233\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.210\nThat digitally signed it or\nthe attacker digitally signs this.\n\n234\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.030\nAnd just says, I still,\nwhoever originally sent it, and now,\n\n235\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.680\nI think I'm actually communicating\nwith the originator.\n\n236\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.184\nBut I'm not,\nI'm only communicating with the attacker.\n\n237\n00:14:00.184 --> 00:14:03.186\nSo here in this\nDigital Signature Creation,\n\n238\n00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:06.800\nwe also have to be careful\nat this point too.\n\n239\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.204\nThere is a problem with Digital Signature\nCreation that we don't really think about,\n\n240\n00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:14.536\nwhich is gonna be of course,\nthere is no inherent time stamping.\n\n241\n00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:19.259\nSo there is no duration to think,\nthis Digital Signature,\n\n242\n00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:24.176\nit doesn't say that it's good for\na day or a year or ten years.\n\n243\n00:14:24.176 --> 00:14:27.481\nIt could be a digital signature from\n23 years ago for all that we know, and\n\n244\n00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:28.750\nit's still working today.\n\n245\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.698\nAnd I go, well that's good\nbecause it doesn't change, but\n\n246\n00:14:32.698 --> 00:14:34.860\nit also means that\nthe longer it's out there,\n\n247\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.974\nthe more that there's possibilities for\nthe compromise to go on.\n\n248\n00:14:37.974 --> 00:14:42.480\nAnd if there isn't, it means somebody\ncan easily do exactly what I said.\n\n249\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.120\nWhich is instead, say look,\nI can change this particular encryption\n\n250\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.790\nat any point in this process of\nsending here, and now it could happen.\n\n251\n00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.570\nSo if they change that,\nwell now we have that.\n\n252\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.390\nNormally the digital signature\njust disappears when you change\n\n253\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.630\nthe original packet.\n\n254\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.020\nRight here,\nthey just change the whole thing.\n\n255\n00:15:02.964 --> 00:15:06.822\n&gt;&gt; Right, and a digital signature is\na type of a digital certificate and\n\n256\n00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.763\nwe can set expiration dates\non those certificates.\n\n257\n00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:14.488\nHowever, it is more administrative work if\nwe have to re-issue or renew certificates,\n\n258\n00:15:14.488 --> 00:15:19.090\nbut it is going to be more secure then\nhaving a really lengthy expiration period.\n\n259\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.690\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that all that does\ncome into play but at the same time,\n\n260\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.910\nremember that the strength behind the\ndigital signature itself is that it can\n\n261\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.850\nconfirm this.\n\n262\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.720\nBut the weakness is, we don't have any\nway to verify if somebody has changed\n\n263\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.040\nit within a day, or\nwithin a month, or within a year.\n\n264\n00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.770\nThat all you actually get is just\nit's changed and that's fine.\n\n265\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.638\nAs long as you know exactly\nwho the originator is.\n\n266\n00:15:41.638 --> 00:15:44.670\nBut if you can't prove that in between,\nwe now have a problem.\n\n267\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.404\nBy adding in a date or a time into this,\nthen I can know that hey,\n\n268\n00:15:48.404 --> 00:15:53.060\nwhen this person generated this,\nhere's a timestamp when it was generated.\n\n269\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.476\nBy the time somebody intercepts\nit in the middle here and\n\n270\n00:15:56.476 --> 00:16:01.273\nthey issue a new timestamp Part of that\nidea of hashing should probably include\n\n271\n00:16:01.273 --> 00:16:05.706\nin some timestamp at the very beginning so\nthat if somebody were to try and\n\n272\n00:16:05.706 --> 00:16:09.579\nregenerate one it would not match\nup to the data that is inside.\n\n273\n00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:12.875\nSo we do need to think about\nstuff like that as well, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:17.067\nNo way of knowing also if the private\nkey data has been stolen so\n\n275\n00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:21.410\nthat somebody can regenerate\na new digital encryption.\n\n276\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.741\nSo you've got to actually realize\nthat this stuff can be faked.\n\n277\n00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.470\nAnd that's kind of the key.\n\n278\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.511\nJust like what we showed you in\nthe middle of that process there.\n\n279\n00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:34.407\nSo overall though, digital signature is\ngreat as long as it really does verify\n\n280\n00:16:34.407 --> 00:16:37.017\nthe origin and the integrity of the data.\n\n281\n00:16:37.017 --> 00:16:41.413\nBut it has not mechanism to tell us\nwhether it really came from that person\n\n282\n00:16:41.413 --> 00:16:45.462\nunless we really have that ability\nto check with that third party.\n\n283\n00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:48.309\nBut digital signatures, we generally\ndon't worry about it too much.\n\n284\n00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:51.645\nBecause it's all about just saying,\nyeah, this is what happens here.\n\n285\n00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:54.351\nAnd then you can sign up from that point.\n\n286\n00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:59.069\nAll right, now the last part\nof this process is where we\n\n287\n00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:02.052\nget into the idea of the CA itself.\n\n288\n00:17:02.052 --> 00:17:04.980\nA CA is really a server when\nit comes to down to it, and\n\n289\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.720\nit means we have to offer the same\nprotections as a regular server.\n\n290\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.699\nIf we do not, then a compromise\ncan happen in any shape and form.\n\n291\n00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:18.402\nThe ultimate compromise at the CA is if\nwe can take advantage of that root CA and\n\n292\n00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:20.949\nstart issuing out certificates,\n\n293\n00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.838\nfault certificates in place\nof real certificates.\n\n294\n00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:26.008\n&gt;&gt; Worst case scenario.\n\n295\n00:17:26.008 --> 00:17:29.998\n&gt;&gt; It is a bad scenario because if I\ntake that over that now means what I\n\n296\n00:17:29.998 --> 00:17:34.880\nknow all the private keys to anybody I\nissued out certificates to at this point.\n\n297\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.959\n&gt;&gt; And people are trusting you.\n\n298\n00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:37.290\n&gt;&gt; And people are trusting.\n\n299\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:42.562\nSo this is why we must be very careful\nabout this idea of the root CA as well,\n\n300\n00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:47.431\nand of course the certificate\nauthority that we do end up trusting.\n\n301\n00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:50.812\nMost of the time we're not going to worry\nabout it too much because they have so\n\n302\n00:17:50.812 --> 00:17:52.229\nmany security checks in place.\n\n303\n00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:54.157\nAs far as the third-party ones go.\n\n304\n00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:58.969\nBut remember that at this particular point\nhere, if they compromise the server,\n\n305\n00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:02.260\neverything is pretty much\ncompromised as well, okay?\n\n306\n00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.436\nAnd I just have the same thing\nwith the certificate request, too.\n\n307\n00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:10.976\nSo sometimes you'll also end up seeing\nwhere maybe the certificate request,\n\n308\n00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:15.651\nthat at some point here, there can be a\ncompromise along the chain of these events\n\n309\n00:18:15.651 --> 00:18:17.736\nthat you don't know about as well.\n\n310\n00:18:17.736 --> 00:18:21.864\nSo the problem then,\nwith the entirety of key exchange,\n\n311\n00:18:21.864 --> 00:18:27.208\nespecially when it comes down to\npublic key exchange, is simple, okay?\n\n312\n00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:30.658\nA break in any one of these\nis pretty much a calamity for\n\n313\n00:18:30.658 --> 00:18:32.968\neverything along the path, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:36.725\nIf the CA is compromised,\nyour private key data is compromised.\n\n315\n00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:39.938\nIf your private key data is\ncompromised it means your digital\n\n316\n00:18:39.938 --> 00:18:41.455\nsignature is compromised.\n\n317\n00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:46.314\nIf your digital signature is comprised,\nwell, everything is compromised and\n\n318\n00:18:46.314 --> 00:18:48.350\nthat is the problem that we have.\n\n319\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.789\nSo in an investigation you have\nto determine, then, as you start\n\n320\n00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:57.731\ndoing security investigations,\nwhere did the compromise take place?\n\n321\n00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:00.411\nWas it at the certificate authority?\n\n322\n00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:05.830\nWas it because somebody had been able\nto recreate that digital signature or\n\n323\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.745\ndid somebody intercept and\nthen now forward you a wrong public key?\n\n324\n00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:15.130\nWhatever it might be you have to kind\nof figure that stuff out step by step.\n\n325\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.084\nTaking a look at the strengths, which\nare normally not what we're looking for.\n\n326\n00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:21.311\nBut is the weakness in the process?\n\n327\n00:19:21.311 --> 00:19:26.287\nCould somebody have intercepted my\nprivate key, or my key exchange data?\n\n328\n00:19:26.287 --> 00:19:32.234\nCould somebody along the way have\nactually substituted themselves for me?\n\n329\n00:19:32.234 --> 00:19:35.458\nIs my certificate authority compromised?\n\n330\n00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:38.178\nWhat do I have in place\nthat checks all this stuff?\n\n331\n00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:41.530\nWe don't have anything in\nplace that does that, right?\n\n332\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.328\nThis is where it becomes problematic\nwhen now the key exchanges fail.\n\n333\n00:19:46.328 --> 00:19:49.528\nYou don't know where to begin to look for\nthe failure.\n\n334\n00:19:49.528 --> 00:19:52.999\nThen it means you don't have\na clue whether or not somebody,\n\n335\n00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:54.128\n&gt;&gt; You're still under attack.\n\n336\n00:19:54.128 --> 00:19:58.618\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and you're still under the attack\nAnd that's where it becomes even worse.\n\n337\n00:19:58.618 --> 00:20:03.359\nSo just kind of take a moment, then,\nand walk through it yourself and go,\n\n338\n00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:08.327\nall right, where in the world would I be\ncompromised along that point if I were\n\n339\n00:20:08.327 --> 00:20:13.011\nto try and send data from me to another\nperson using public key exchange?\n\n340\n00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:17.985\nIf I can figure that out,\ndepending on what the action is.\n\n341\n00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:20.598\nI receive a packet of data, let's say, for\n\n342\n00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:24.498\nexample, and the digital signature\nis not on the packet of data.\n\n343\n00:20:24.498 --> 00:20:27.354\nWell, where did that get\ncompromised along the way?\n\n344\n00:20:27.354 --> 00:20:33.378\nOr the idea of the public key is I get\ndata and now I'm supposed to return data.\n\n345\n00:20:33.378 --> 00:20:35.936\nBut the originator never receives it.\n\n346\n00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:40.009\nWell that lets you know something else\nmay have been compromised along the way.\n\n347\n00:20:40.009 --> 00:20:41.690\nOr I continue to send data, but\n\n348\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.516\nit looks like that all my data is\ncompromised from the very beginning.\n\n349\n00:20:45.516 --> 00:20:50.247\nYou might find out it is the certificate\nauthority itself that is also compromised.\n\n350\n00:20:50.247 --> 00:20:54.117\nSo in any of these things,\nit makes it either better or\n\n351\n00:20:54.117 --> 00:20:57.569\nit makes it worse,\nin terms of investigation.\n\n352\n00:20:57.569 --> 00:21:00.748\nWhen you start to actually take a look,\nthen,\n\n353\n00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:05.080\nat the strengths of key encryption and\nthe management of that.\n\n354\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.118\nOkay, it means that it lets you know if\nthe entire process is going through and\n\n355\n00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:11.290\nworks just fine.\n\n356\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.653\nOkay, then you don't have to worry\nabout investigating too much.\n\n357\n00:21:14.653 --> 00:21:17.567\nYou know that everything is in\nplace that way it needs to be.\n\n358\n00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:22.056\nBut it becomes much more difficult in\nyour investigative process, is if you go,\n\n359\n00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:24.110\nit's been compromised somewhere.\n\n360\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.957\n&gt;&gt; But I can't pinpoint that.\n\n361\n00:21:24.957 --> 00:21:26.351\n&gt;&gt; And now I can't pinpoint it.\n\n362\n00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.842\nSo that's why it's very important\nthat we take a moment to try and\n\n363\n00:21:29.842 --> 00:21:32.889\nexamine this idea of the key strengths and\nweaknesses and\n\n364\n00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:37.850\nthe impacts that it has on some type of\ninvestigation that we might be performing.\n\n365\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.139\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and investigations, look,\nwe don't want you to have to go ahead and\n\n366\n00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:46.757\nperform them, but in this day and age,\nultimately, security incidents do happen.\n\n367\n00:21:46.757 --> 00:21:48.165\nSo just be aware of that, and\n\n368\n00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:52.358\nhaving this background knowledge will\nreally help you during that investigation.\n\n369\n00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:57.759\n&gt;&gt; There's really not a lot more\nthan what I'm telling you right now.\n\n370\n00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:03.148\nSo even though this is a fairly vague type\nof exam objective, you probably won't\n\n371\n00:22:03.148 --> 00:22:07.998\nget super in depth on all the technical\naspects of what I was describing.\n\n372\n00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:10.665\nLike whether it's the reflective,\n\n373\n00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:15.490\nlike a brute force exponent type\nof attack, whatever it might be.\n\n374\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.283\nBut it's all about just\ntrying to understand that we,\n\n375\n00:22:19.283 --> 00:22:24.314\nas cyber security analysts, the goal,\nof course, is to pinpoint where\n\n376\n00:22:24.314 --> 00:22:29.112\nthe compromise happened so that we\ncan do a, what was I trying to say?\n\n377\n00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:33.703\nAn actual proper investigation into\nwhat was actually compromised and\n\n378\n00:22:33.703 --> 00:22:38.000\nfigure out then, of course,\nthe scope of the compromise as well.\n\n379\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.639\nBut without understanding\nthat process of where it\n\n380\n00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:43.887\ngoes from the beginning to the end,\nand then where it can fail,\n\n381\n00:22:43.887 --> 00:22:47.035\nthen it becomes much more\ndifficult in your investigation.\n\n382\n00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:50.094\nSo make sure you take that into\nheart before you go into the exam.\n\n383\n00:22:50.094 --> 00:22:53.300\n&gt;&gt; And just a reminder, if you aren't\ncompletely familiar with that process,\n\n384\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.606\nwe did cover that in previous episodes\nwhen you're looking at your certificate\n\n385\n00:22:56.606 --> 00:22:57.763\nauthorities and so forth.\n\n386\n00:22:57.763 --> 00:23:00.807\nSo just check those out if\nyou don't feel comfortable.\n\n387\n00:23:00.807 --> 00:23:04.602\nRonnie, do you have any final thoughts or\nyou think that's it for\n\n388\n00:23:04.602 --> 00:23:05.915\nthis exam objective?\n\n389\n00:23:05.915 --> 00:23:11.289\n&gt;&gt; Well, on this exam objective, you'll\nprobably just make sure that you've got to\n\n390\n00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:16.769\nunderstand what components are involved\nin the entirety of that exchange process.\n\n391\n00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:19.395\nIf you don't then you're\nmissing some component and\n\n392\n00:23:19.395 --> 00:23:21.738\nthat means somebody can\ntake advantage of you.\n\n393\n00:23:21.738 --> 00:23:25.771\nSo always think about it from the\nstandpoint of who is actually going to be\n\n394\n00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:29.802\ntrying to figure this out, or who's\ngoing to be trying to get past you and\n\n395\n00:23:29.802 --> 00:23:33.131\nthen look at all the places that\nthey can take advantage of.\n\n396\n00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:36.137\nAnd that's the key here on\nmaking sure you're ready.\n\n397\n00:23:36.137 --> 00:23:39.402\n&gt;&gt; I think you'll all be great\nsleuths out there, identifying and\n\n398\n00:23:39.402 --> 00:23:40.802\ndetecting these attacks.\n\n399\n00:23:40.802 --> 00:23:42.930\nSo thank you so much for\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n400\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.542\nAnd thank you so much, ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n401\n00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:50.261\nBut stay tuned, we do have some more\nCisco cyber security headed your way.\n\n402\n00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:52.588\nFor this show I'll go ahead and\nsign off as you show host.\n\n403\n00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:53.909\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n404\n00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:54.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n405\n00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.762\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n406\n00:23:59.791 -->

00:00:11.838\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.677\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:17.085\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.980\nwe're continuing through our\nCisco Cyber Security fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.986\nJoining us back in the studio for\nthis endeavour is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:24.630\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.810\nRonnie, how are you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.897\nThank you for having me back on the show,\nand thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:28.630\nstanding in for Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.382\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n15\n00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.792\n&gt;&gt; As we continue on in this show.\n\n16\n00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:38.540\nWe're gonna take a look at really talking\nabout some of the SSL and TLS components.\n\n17\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.642\nNow, if you're wondering why SSL,\nTLS, well what is that all about?\n\n18\n00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.963\nWe're gonna get to that\naspect in just a little bit.\n\n19\n00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:49.721\nBut we really need to talk about this\nidea of some of the components that we\n\n20\n00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:54.160\nfind in this process that we really\nuse everywhere that we need to.\n\n21\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.850\nAnd you might be wondering like\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n22\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.310\nIf this is your first time\ntalking about of course,\n\n23\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.480\nthis idea of using these components.\n\n24\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.240\nWell normally, when we have to communicate\nacross other people's networks, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.480\nSo within my own network,\nI feel fairly confident and\n\n26\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.690\nsure that I really don't have to think\nabout the idea of validating who sent it.\n\n27\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.330\nI really don't have to think about\nthe idea that somebody messed with\n\n28\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090\nthe information in between.\n\n29\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.019\nBut it is possible, don't get me wrong.\n\n30\n00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:26.973\nSomebody could be on my very own\nnetwork actually causing more malicious\n\n31\n00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.950\nthings to happen than what I expect.\n\n32\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.550\nBut normally if it happens anywhere,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.091\nIt's because we go beyond the boundaries\nof what we consider our own network.\n\n34\n00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:40.581\nAnd what I'm responsible for\nin my own equipment,\n\n35\n00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:43.271\nmy own cables in that particular idea.\n\n36\n00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.704\nAnd I need to connect to someone else's\nnetwork either across a WAN link,\n\n37\n00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:50.460\nor even going out on to the Internet.\n\n38\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.510\nAnd we start talking about\ngoing out on to the Internet.\n\n39\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.650\nWell is at that point,\n\n40\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.433\nthe idea of verification is a very\nimportant part of everything that we do,\n\n41\n00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.691\nspecially of something commercial\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n42\n00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:05.520\nAnd we're gonna be sending sensitive\ninformation over that type of connection.\n\n43\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.597\nWe wanna make sure that we are\ncommunicating with exactly who we thought\n\n44\n00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:09.890\nwe're communicating with.\n\n45\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.914\nAnd of course that we actually can\nencrypt that traffic as well so\n\n46\n00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:18.420\nthat anybody tries to intercept\nthat traffic, we can block it.\n\n47\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.743\nSo we're talking about those basic\ncomponents that make up that\n\n48\n00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:26.186\nstructure that helps us to\nprotect that initial and\n\n49\n00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:29.390\nthe on going communication\nbetween a client and\n\n50\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.940\na server across a network that we may not\nknow all the details behind that network.\n\n51\n00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.604\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, one of the things that I think\nthat's I want it to be really secure\n\n52\n00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:40.900\nis something like my banking transactions.\n\n53\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.120\nAre these some of the technologies that\nwe might see if I'm like for instance,\n\n54\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.110\nconnecting to something\nlike Bank of America?\n\n55\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.000\nAre these some of the technologies that\nwe're gonna hope Bank of America has in\n\n56\n00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.520\nplace to make sure that we're secure?\n\n57\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, that's actually a great\nexample of why we would choose to use\n\n58\n00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:56.279\nsome of these different technologies.\n\n59\n00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.555\nAnd what's actually built up inside\nof that to make sure that type of\n\n60\n00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:01.580\nconnection is gonna be secure.\n\n61\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.641\nNobody wants to be able to put information\nout there across the Internet.\n\n62\n00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:08.802\nEspecially getting access to your bank\naccount where you can't show that there is\n\n63\n00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:12.160\nsomeway to verify you're\nconnecting to the right bank.\n\n64\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.079\nAnd of course you're actually putting in\nyour own information connecting to your\n\n65\n00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:15.765\nown bank account.\n\n66\n00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:20.652\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nwhat really is required inside of this\n\n67\n00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:23.310\ntechnology to really help us out.\n\n68\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.976\nSo at the very beginning when we start\nto talk about the idea of different\n\n69\n00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:27.718\ncomponents.\n\n70\n00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:34.190\nWell, we gotta think about the basic\nnature of how do we protect traffic.\n\n71\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.070\nHow do we protect the data\nthat's actually going to go\n\n72\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.970\nacross this type of connection?\n\n73\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.070\nAnd the way that we do so\nof course is by using well,\n\n74\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.940\nsome type of encryption is\nwhat we end up doing here.\n\n75\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.910\nSo when we start talking about\nthe nature of using that encryption,\n\n76\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.473\nwe really have to worry about\na couple of different aspects.\n\n77\n00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:57.617\nOne of course is the data that\nwe communicate across to well,\n\n78\n00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.070\nwhoever else you gonna connect to.\n\n79\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.770\nAnd then the other one of\ncourse is actually what\n\n80\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.830\nin other initial communication,\nhow do we actually do the verification?\n\n81\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.100\nHow do we know that\neverything is going on?\n\n82\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.340\nSo we need to protect that as well.\n\n83\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.190\nAnd that actually comes through\na combination of a couple of different\n\n84\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.570\ntechnologies for us when it comes into\nthe realm of protecting the data.\n\n85\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.500\nAnd that's when we start talking\nabout we're gonna need to use some\n\n86\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.090\ntype of asymmetric encryption.\n\n87\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.641\nWe're also gonna need to use some\ntype of symmetric encryption.\n\n88\n00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.270\nI couldn't remember what\nit was called here.\n\n89\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.540\nSymmetric encryption, and\nto keep all processes of that safe.\n\n90\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.830\nAnd so that is what we actually\nare going to talk about briefly.\n\n91\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.470\nWhich is the use of what we call a cipher\nsuite, as what we're talking about here.\n\n92\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.820\nSo the idea of using cipher suite for\n\n93\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.490\nus, we've used it everyday most\nof just don't know about it.\n\n94\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.190\nThe very fact that as your\nwatching us right now,\n\n95\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.790\nif you're watching from a computer is\nthat you went to ITPro.TV's website and\n\n96\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.590\nyou ended up giving us certificate.\n\n97\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.390\nAnd you see that little green bar,\nthen you'll also see where it says HTTPS.\n\n98\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.480\nAnd if you've done that you've already\nestablished what we're talking about here.\n\n99\n00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.580\nThe idea of using a cipher suite to make\nsure that the connection is secure and\n\n100\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.940\nthat everything is transmitted as securely\nas we can get at this particular point.\n\n101\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.600\nIf you've ever done any type of\nsecured file transfer system or\n\n102\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.410\neven secured mail system at all.\n\n103\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.333\nAll of these are very possible that you're\nusing come type of ciphers suite which is\n\n104\n00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.442\na combination of multiple\ntechnologies together.\n\n105\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:37.724\nNow when we start talking about the idea\nof the technologies, normally of course\n\n106\n00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:43.650\ninvolve, well what do we need to make sure\nthat our cryptography is going to be safe.\n\n107\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.360\nWell it's all about the idea\nof that key encryption, right?\n\n108\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.370\nSo how do we actually keep the keys\nthemselves that we're using for\n\n109\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.740\nthe encryption process to be safe?\n\n110\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.510\nWell, we need to make sure that we\nunderstand that process of the key\n\n111\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.550\nexchange and\nhow that's gonna happen as well.\n\n112\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.910\nWe also need some type of authentication\n\n113\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.610\nalgorithm that we need to\nmake sure that we check on.\n\n114\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.270\nWe also need to provide of course,\n\n115\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.330\nthe type of encryption that both sides are\ngonna agree to that they are going to use.\n\n116\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.325\nAnd then lastly of course, a message\nauthentication factor code that says,\n\n117\n00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:18.180\nhey, I know that this from you and\nthen that's pretty much it.\n\n118\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.890\nSo we need to make sure that we understand\nthis and be of the choose this process and\n\n119\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.640\nsee what it's actually done.\n\n120\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.492\nSo let me goa head and\nshow you on my screen,\n\n121\n00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:31.810\nto show kind of how it breaks down here.\n\n122\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.190\nNormally when you end us seeing\na cipher suite, especially if you\n\n123\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.110\ntake a look at in terms of using\nsomething like Wireshark as a capture.\n\n124\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.026\nOr if you're setting this up such as\na using a VPN tunnel, if you're doing this\n\n125\n00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:50.134\nwith a Cisco SA or if you're doing\nthis with a Cisco iOS firewall.\n\n126\n00:06:50.134 --> 00:06:53.709\nYou may end up having to set\nup your own cipher suite and\n\n127\n00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.765\nnormally, they match on both sides.\n\n128\n00:06:56.765 --> 00:07:01.605\nAnd the way that that process ends up\nworking is that one side says look,\n\n129\n00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:05.335\nhere are the cipher suites that\nI am willing to negotiate.\n\n130\n00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:09.149\nSo they may have a whole list of different\nones that are available to them.\n\n131\n00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.570\nAnd they say, here,\npick from one of these.\n\n132\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.420\nAnd the other side then of course,\n\n133\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.650\nwhatever component that you're\ntalking about on the other end.\n\n134\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.314\nAnd says, all right,\nI can support this one but not that one.\n\n135\n00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:24.141\nAnd so then they go, all right, well let's\nkind of agree that we're gonna use this,\n\n136\n00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:26.300\nso that's the way that it breaks out.\n\n137\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.710\nBut if you were to see this,\nthis is what it would normally look like,\n\n138\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.700\nwhich is pretty much the one\nthat's right there, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:39.970\nSo TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA.\n\n140\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.217\nNow for\nthose use to looking at this, right?\n\n141\n00:07:43.217 --> 00:07:46.021\nIf you're very experienced\nin this like Ronnie,\n\n142\n00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:48.701\nyou picked the weakest\npossible one you could.\n\n143\n00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.632\nAnd I did, and\n\n144\n00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:54.683\nthe reason why is I didn't wanna type\nout anything else that was much longer.\n\n145\n00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.889\nI have enough problems just typing,\nwith typing in all caps and\n\n146\n00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.050\nthen also underscore and everything else.\n\n147\n00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.050\nI can use a short one and\nactually demonstrate the same thing.\n\n148\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, when it comes to that\nnegotiation that you're talking about,\n\n149\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.040\ndoes that happen on the server side?\n\n150\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.500\nDoes it happen on the client side?\n\n151\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.810\nOr it's just more of a mutual agreement\nwhen it says, we have this list, and\n\n152\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.740\nwe're gonna pick from\nthis list of what we use.\n\n153\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually depends\non who negotiates first.\n\n154\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.277\nSo, the one side that says, hey look I'm\ngoing to send you how we're gonna agree\n\n155\n00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:24.420\non this, and so\nhere's some other things that I can do.\n\n156\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.360\nAnd then the other side says,\nwell let me see what I can agree to, and\n\n157\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.230\nthey'll pick on usually, they try and\n\n158\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.350\npick the strongest one as\npossible as what they try to do.\n\n159\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.738\nWell let's break this down for\na moment as you are getting ready for,\n\n160\n00:08:35.738 --> 00:08:40.630\nof course your security's fundamental exam\nas well as understanding the process here.\n\n161\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.628\nAnd we're gonna go through the entire SSL\nprocess in a little bit of time here.\n\n162\n00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:47.990\nBut just kind of make sure that we\nunderstand what we're taking a look at.\n\n163\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.140\nSo when it breaks down and\n\n164\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.080\nyou start seeing a string of characters\nlike what you see right here.\n\n165\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.540\nYou do need to know what\nthese components stand for.\n\n166\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.440\nAnd which one that you're actually\ntaking a look at here, too, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.970\nSometimes, especially when getting\nready for Cisco exams, right.\n\n168\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.430\nYou also have to know a little bit more\nabout the encryption protocols themselves\n\n169\n00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.700\nin your decision on what\nyou're gonna choose.\n\n170\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.000\nNow I chose one of the weaker ones that's\nout there because I just needed to make\n\n171\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.100\nthe example.\n\n172\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.780\nBut remember, the goal is always\nto choose what the strongest\n\n173\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.000\ncipher suite that you can support and\nthat everybody else supports too.\n\n174\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.040\nThere is no,\nI don't know how to say there's no room.\n\n175\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.980\nYou can always choose the highest\nones that are out there, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.100\nBut then it doesn't guarantee that every\nmachine that connects to you, if that's\n\n177\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.450\nwhat you need to guarantee, can support\nthe very highest ones that are out there.\n\n178\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.250\nSo you need to have a well\nrounded balance here.\n\n179\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.110\nI'm not saying pick the weakest\none like what I did right here.\n\n180\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.970\nBut what I'm saying is if you're actually\ngoing to say I'm gonna bring up a web\n\n181\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.200\nserver and we're gonna support only this\nlevel well, make sure you realize that you\n\n182\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.860\nmay have some people connecting\nwith older machines.\n\n183\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.920\nYou know that go, yeah, I never even\nheard of that, it's just not working.\n\n184\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.480\nAnd even though most of the current\nbrowsers will help you out,\n\n185\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.590\nit is possible and\nI hope not really so much,\n\n186\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:07.680\nit is possible somebody is still running\nInternet Explorer 7 or 8 out there.\n\n187\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.050\nIt's insane that somebody would do that,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n188\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.080\nIt should not be somebody\nthat should do that but\n\n189\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.810\nit wasn't too long ago right that\nreally internet explorer six\n\n190\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.560\nkind of really got the boot and\nI say not too long ago.\n\n191\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.260\nProbably good five or\nsix years now but, at the same time,\n\n192\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.610\nthere were still a lot of companies\nusing that internally as well,\n\n193\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.840\nwhich wouldn't support anything that could\ngo on the internet today, just about.\n\n194\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.540\nOkay?\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.790\nSo let me get back to what I'm, I'm just\nkinda harping on something else instead.\n\n196\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.190\nSo, when we start taking a look\nat the idea of a cipher suite,\n\n197\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.320\nwe wanna make sure that we\nunderstand the breakdown.\n\n198\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.360\nNow there are times when you look at it,\nit may include this protocol.\n\n199\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.820\nIt may not.\n\n200\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.340\nOkay.\n\n201\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.044\nSo you may see where it list it,\n\n202\n00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:53.520\nit list it as the idea of\nthe protocol as SSL or TLS.\n\n203\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.740\nMost of the time today, you can see TLS.\n\n204\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.085\nIf you don't see anything at all,\nit's probably in a Default to TLS instead.\n\n205\n00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:03.245\nNow if you don't see anything,\nthey just decided to leave it off.\n\n206\n00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.715\nSo you can see where it\nactually lists a protocol.\n\n207\n00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:09.585\nAnd that just tells you hey, this is what\nit's gonna be used in as the TLS process,\n\n208\n00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.185\nis what it's gonna be used in.\n\n209\n00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:16.655\nBut, we also have to have that key\nexchange which is a big part of\n\n210\n00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:19.880\nthe way that of course\nTLS ends up working.\n\n211\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.010\nHow do we securely exchange the keys here.\n\n212\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:28.130\nAnd DH of course stands for Diffie–Hellman\nand we actually do have some\n\n213\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.640\nepisodes on Diffie–Hellman that\nwe'll be talking about as well.\n\n214\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.490\nSo make sure you check out that show.\n\n215\n00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.610\nBut this is just telling us, hey, we're\ngonna use the Diffie–Hellman algorithm\n\n216\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.140\nhere to help us in the key exchange.\n\n217\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.180\nThe secure key exchange idea.\n\n218\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.550\nAnd of course,\nhow do we actually digitally sign that?\n\n219\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.550\nWell we're gonna use an RSA type\nof signature to help us out.\n\n220\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.250\nNow once we have that part of the process,\n\n221\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.575\nthe word with of course is just\na conjunction for us here.\n\n222\n00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:57.365\nAnd now we have, of course,\nthe encryption that we're gonna use.\n\n223\n00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:59.315\nThis one is using DES instead.\n\n224\n00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:04.195\nThe Digital Encryption Standard along\nwith CBC, Cipher Block Chaining.\n\n225\n00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:07.445\nThat's going to be used for\nencrypting the data.\n\n226\n00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:11.550\nAnd then lastly, the ID of\nthe message authentication factor.\n\n227\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.620\nWhich is gonna be SHA or\nSHA as what we tend to hear that.\n\n228\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.240\nOkay.\n\n229\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.870\nNow, the weird thing, right,\nis that SHA is completely broken.\n\n230\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.850\nIt's not something you should use but\nyes, that I put it on here as example.\n\n231\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.360\nYes.\n\n232\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.122\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n233\n00:12:25.122 --> 00:12:29.560\nI also put this on here as an example of\nsomething that you should know, right.\n\n234\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.140\nThe very fact that this type of hashing\n\n235\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.268\nmechanism at the end is\nnot one you should use.\n\n236\n00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:38.790\nIf somebody says they need to negotiate\nthis and they ask a question like,\n\n237\n00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.640\nis this secure or which of the following\nis secure in terms of cipher suites?\n\n238\n00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.850\nThis will not hear what\nabsolutely stand out as being no.\n\n239\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.900\nSo, don't do that.\n\n240\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.990\nSHA 1 even today though is\nactually no longer secure.\n\n241\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.570\nAs of January 1st, no certificates,\nat least from any of\n\n242\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.470\nthe current certificate\nauthorities that are out there.\n\n243\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.990\nThey've all agreed that as\nof January 1st of 2017,\n\n244\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:08.340\nto not support doing anything with SHA,\nespecially digital signing of anything.\n\n245\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.340\nSo that's why RSA is here, but you can\nkind of guess that all this has to kind of\n\n246\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.150\ntake place, and you've gotta know a little\nbit more about each of the algorithms.\n\n247\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.600\nYou don't have to become a cryptoanalyst,\nokay.\n\n248\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.770\nNow can you?\n\n249\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.280\nYes.\nIs it an incredibly in-depth field?\n\n250\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.930\nYes.\n\n251\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.880\nDo some people love it?\n\n252\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.798\nYes, Cherokee Boose is one of the ones\nthat really loves this stuff.\n\n253\n00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:34.244\nBut overall though, just realize\nthat looking at a cipher suite,\n\n254\n00:13:34.244 --> 00:13:37.647\nyou may have to be able\nto detect whether or\n\n255\n00:13:37.647 --> 00:13:41.259\nnot this is fairly secure one or\nnot secure.\n\n256\n00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:46.097\nOr they may ask you like, is the message\nauthentication going to be secure even\n\n257\n00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:48.690\nwith SHA, probably not so much so.\n\n258\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.500\n&gt;&gt; So it's not just certification endeavor\ntoo, I mean this is real world stuff and\n\n259\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.060\nyou're gonna have to know this in\nthe field if you're in the field that hey,\n\n260\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.710\nI shouldn't be using something like SHA-1.\n\n261\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.940\nIf we are gonna use SHA, then we should\nprobably bump it up to like SHA-256.\n\n262\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.710\nYou have to know this conceptually and\n\n263\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.140\nnot just from the certification endeavor,\nright?\n\n264\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely are gonna do this\nespecially if you're dealing with anything\n\n265\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.235\nthat's gonna be public facing, right.\n\n266\n00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:16.795\nSo if you have clients connecting in,\nyou've got to know that.\n\n267\n00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:21.115\nYou will still have some people\ntrying to connect in with it but\n\n268\n00:14:21.115 --> 00:14:23.170\nat that point, you do have to notify them,\n\n269\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.495\ngo look, we don't accept that trickier\nstandard and they can't connect.\n\n270\n00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:27.715\nThey're just not gonna be able to.\n\n271\n00:14:27.715 --> 00:14:30.775\nThere are some times where\nyou might feel bad and go,\n\n272\n00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:33.015\nlet me just drop the security level down.\n\n273\n00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:37.640\nBut remember that if you drop it down for\nthem, they're not the only ones watching\n\n274\n00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.410\nfor that type of acceptance to come in,\nand you just don't know that.\n\n275\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.210\nAnd so that's why it's very\nimportant that we understand\n\n276\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.103\nat least this concept of choosing\nthe proper cipher suite as well.\n\n277\n00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:50.765\n&gt;&gt; And if I'm, help me out here Ronnie,\nif I'm in a big company where it's like\n\n278\n00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:55.665\nAmazon or something and they stand to lose\n$1,000,000 an hour that little, you know,\n\n279\n00:14:55.665 --> 00:15:00.400\nstepping down the security could really\ncost the company millions of dollars.\n\n280\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.810\nSo we're not just talking about,\n\n281\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.270\nsomebody broke into my home network but\ncould potentially break into some of\n\n282\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.580\nthe biggest networks that you\nknow really on the planet.\n\n283\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.127\n&gt;&gt; And that's why these particular\nmeasures are making sure that there is\n\n284\n00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:14.790\nstrong in this whatever you can support\nis gonna be the key in making sure,\n\n285\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.399\nof course.\n\n286\n00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:19.451\nYou have to kind of balance that\nwith the acceptance factors as well.\n\n287\n00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.949\nSo remember what I said in\nthe very beginning of this.\n\n288\n00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:25.690\nYou can set it at the highest levels and\nnewest protocols that are there.\n\n289\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.313\nThey haven't even pushed out by the\nbrowsers, well your chances have actually\n\n290\n00:15:29.313 --> 00:15:32.200\nmaking sure that everybody\ncan connect as little to not.\n\n291\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.770\nOkay.\n\n292\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.925\nNow where do we see this?\n\n293\n00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:37.500\nLets's go and take a look at my computer\nagain and we'll kinda show you a demo of\n\n294\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.140\nhow you can actually see this information\ncome across and the way that you do this.\n\n295\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.841\nWe're gonna do this again\na little bit later on.\n\n296\n00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:48.321\nBut I just wanna show you where you can\nactually spot the idea of seeing this\n\n297\n00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:51.148\nparticular type of\nconnection going on here.\n\n298\n00:15:51.148 --> 00:15:53.240\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n299\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.448\nNow I'm gonna do something\na little bit differently here.\n\n300\n00:15:55.448 --> 00:16:00.410\nAdd in a second desktop, that way we\ncan just easily move through this.\n\n301\n00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.320\nI'm simply gonna turn on Wireshark for\nright now.\n\n302\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.060\nAnd make sure I'm capturing on the proper\ninterface, and that's the key,\n\n303\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.080\nwhich is gonna be my\nThunderbolt Ethernet EN4.\n\n304\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.250\nSo I know that I'm connecting out\nthrough this particular connection.\n\n305\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.063\nNow that I've got Wireshark\nrunning in the background,\n\n306\n00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.003\nI'm just gonna launch my web browser.\n\n307\n00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:29.780\nAnd go to our ITProTV website for\nright now and just simply login.\n\n308\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.410\nNow I don't have to really worry about\ndoing the login, but I'm just trying to\n\n309\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.120\ngive a little bit more packets than\nwhat I would generally need to have.\n\n310\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.340\nSo simply logging in to the website and\nestablishing this particular connection,\n\n311\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.210\nbelieve it or not I've just gone\nthrough the TLS process here, but\n\n312\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.350\nlet's take a look at least at\nthe beginning of this because we are gonna\n\n313\n00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.840\nlook a little bit more\nin depth later on here.\n\n314\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.730\nSo I'm going to minimize that and\nsimply stop the capture.\n\n315\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.580\nWhen I stop the capture\nI'm gonna apply a filter,\n\n316\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.900\nin the upper left hand\ncorner here called SSL.\n\n317\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.250\nAnd once I apply that filter.\n\n318\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.610\nNow we can see a little\nbit of information.\n\n319\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.940\nLet me see if I can scroll in\na little bit at the very beginning.\n\n320\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.170\nAnd what I'm looking for is really not\nthese guys, cuz I know that my web server\n\n321\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:24.110\nactually begins with or our web server\nbegins with the 192, there we go.\n\n322\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:29.430\nSo right here, so I know that's my IP\naddress to our ITProTV web server.\n\n323\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.606\nIf I take a look at that particular one.\n\n324\n00:17:31.606 --> 00:17:36.990\nLet me set up and\n\n325\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.600\nthen underneath where I see the details,\nI can expand out secure socket layer, and\n\n326\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.470\nnotice TLS record layer right\nhere on the handshake, and\n\n327\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.240\nthen I can continue expand that out,\nand scroll out, and here we go.\n\n328\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.587\nNotice that right here\nis says safer suites.\n\n329\n00:17:53.651 --> 00:17:57.562\nAnd here's the 18 suites, and\nI'm really trying to make us, and\n\n330\n00:17:57.562 --> 00:18:00.040\nmake sure that you see this, right?\n\n331\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.360\nSo it's the same format\nthat what we were looking\n\n332\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.890\nat on my simple diagram that we had.\n\n333\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.470\nSo this way, you know that here's\n18 different, here's a good one.\n\n334\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.610\nUnknown [LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.140\nIs like hey, I've got a couple of\nthese that are actually unknown.\n\n336\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.120\nBut yes, you can actually choose\nany of those right there and\n\n337\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.150\nthat's what this guy's saying,\nhey I'll accept any of this.\n\n338\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.840\nBut then on the server side,\nif I go down to the server hello.\n\n339\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.670\nWell notice it's the same\ninformation on the server side, and\n\n340\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.850\nthis one simply says here's the one\nI've chosen, okay, right here.\n\n341\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.270\nSo that's how it negotiated.\n\n342\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.120\nIt took that list that we saw all 18 of\nthose, and went through, and said hey,\n\n343\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.980\nhere is the highest one that\nI'm gonna support as well.\n\n344\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.720\nAnd you can see right here at\nthe very end on that message,\n\n345\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.420\njust like what Wes was saying.\n\n346\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.280\nYou don't wanna see SHA here,\nyou wanna make sure that you see,\n\n347\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.380\nwell like SHA256 or something like\nthat to make sure that happens.\n\n348\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:58.710\nAlso that CBC, again not as secure\nas this guy right here, this GCM.\n\n349\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.270\nAnd I can't remember what GCM stands for\nright away.\n\n350\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.890\nSomething like some type of\nCommon Method or something like that.\n\n351\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.584\nSo you will see that as well.\n\n352\n00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:13.190\nBut yeah, that's the whole idea,\nis that you actually understand\n\n353\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:18.200\nwhere this is negotiated as well, so those\ncipher suites are very important part\n\n354\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.490\nof the entire process that we have at\nthe beginning and this is that part\n\n355\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:29.550\nof the TLS that really helps us to secure\nthat communication aspect of it, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.960\nNow 18, is that all there really is?\n\n357\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.450\nNo, there's over 200 different cipher\nsuites that are available out there.\n\n358\n00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.270\nRemember that the key here is that not\never single one supports everybody,\n\n359\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.710\nas much as you'd like to say.\n\n360\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:48.050\nBut normally if you have\na current web browser,\n\n361\n00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.900\nit'll probably support the majority\nof the more popular ones.\n\n362\n00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.970\nAnd that's also a key for\nwhat we want to look at as well.\n\n363\n00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.640\nSo just realize that there\nare plenty of them out there and\n\n364\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.970\nhere it is,\nwe showed you over on the client side.\n\n365\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.300\nWhere you can actually see the cipher\nsuites that it supports and\n\n366\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.380\nI believe this, yeah, it actually\nhave the very top one that it had.\n\n367\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.009\nAnd then, like sure, yeah, 128-GCM.\n\n368\n00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.860\nYeah, and there's the one that it said,\nhey, this is the one that I'll pick too.\n\n369\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.710\nSo we agree.\n\n370\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.740\nWe'll negotiate.\n\n371\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.220\nWe'll do everything using this\nparticular suite of ciphers including\n\n372\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.880\nasymmetric one and then including\nthe symmetric ones that we have here.\n\n373\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.790\nNotice there's the encryption\nwith AES right here with GCM.\n\n374\n00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.620\nYou see all that information\nis just right there for us.\n\n375\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.470\nSo understanding this part\nis really a good place for\n\n376\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.450\nus to begin when we start examining\nthe idea of security, and whether or\n\n377\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.630\nnot that particular server\nwill accept it or not.\n\n378\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.500\nIf you definitely see where it\ndoesn't give you that option,\n\n379\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.960\nwell that's when you kinda know like,\nwhat's happening here?\n\n380\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.190\nIs it too low?\n\n381\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.220\nAre each one of these different\nparts of that cipher suite,\n\n382\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.580\nyou do need to be able to examine it and\npull out the information that you need and\n\n383\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.580\nknow whether or not it's secure, or\nnot at least from your perspective, and\n\n384\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.210\nwhether not to support it.\n\n385\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Ron, you know when this, the client,\nthe server here and they're communicating,\n\n386\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.140\nyou talked a little bit about something\nknown as symmetric key encryption and\n\n387\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.030\na symmetric key encryption\n&gt;&gt; How do we obtain those keys?\n\n388\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.520\nWhere do those keys even come from?\n\n389\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.490\nIf we were gonna use one or\nother, where do we see those?\n\n390\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well in this\nparticular processor generated.\n\n391\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.520\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n392\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.870\n&gt;&gt; So they're gonna be negotiated between.\n\n393\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.810\nThey're gonna come up with their own set\nof secret keys that they are gonna use and\n\n394\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.550\nthen they'll communicate\nthose keys with each other\n\n395\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.480\nto make sure that everything is\ngonna be as secure as possible.\n\n396\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.120\nSo they are not stored you don't\nhave to clear the pre-shirt here or\n\n397\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.800\nanything but they will be generated here\nfor us to make sure everything works.\n\n398\n00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Now if I do want to ensure that\nI am connecting let's say for\n\n399\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.080\ninstance that I am connecting to my\nbank account and I am going to Bank of\n\n400\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.930\nAmerica You said, you did tell us\nearlier that we had to verify.\n\n401\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.340\nWe need to verify the identity of\nwho it is that we're connecting to.\n\n402\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.300\nIs there a way,\n\n403\n00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.070\nis there a technology that allows us\nto verify the identity of something?\n\n404\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.050\nOr I said identity of something not\nsomeone that we are connecting to?\n\n405\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.390\n&gt;&gt; There definitely is, right?\n\n406\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.710\nThe idea along with the choosing\nof the cipher suite\n\n407\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.100\ncomes of course the idea of what\nwe call digital certificates.\n\n408\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.880\nNow, there's a particular format\nto this digital certificate.\n\n409\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.510\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou know one that's\n\n410\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.200\ncalled an X.509 type of certificate, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.380\nThat is kinda the industry\nstandard certificate.\n\n412\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.550\nAnd I just wanna show you what\none looks like in all reality and\n\n413\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.890\nthen will actually show you one\nthat makes a little bit more sense.\n\n414\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.230\nSo let's take a look at my machine\nhere and this will help us out.\n\n415\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.760\nI'm gonna pull up a certificate\nthat I created one for me.\n\n416\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.580\nI know you can't see that very easily but\nonce I actually open it up,\n\n417\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.000\nit'll make a lot more sense.\n\n418\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.660\nI guarantee you.\n\n419\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.460\nNo it won't, but\nI'm just gonna tell you that at least.\n\n420\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.690\nSo let me see if I can choose\nthe right utility there.\n\n421\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:58.120\nClick open, and yeah there we go.\n\n422\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.743\nSo let me see if I can make\nthat a little bit bigger.\n\n423\n00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:06.370\nThere that may look\na little bit better here.\n\n424\n00:23:09.774 --> 00:23:14.050\nAll right, Wes, here is a certificate.\n\n425\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.170\nI know it says,\nbeginning of the certificate and\n\n426\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.790\nif I scroll down enough here,\nit says the end of the certificate,\n\n427\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.790\nWes does that clarify a little bit\nbetter on the authentication part and\n\n428\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.105\nI would say absolutely, it looks\nlike stereo instructions from mars.\n\n429\n00:23:28.105 --> 00:23:29.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So perfect if you're on mars,\n\n430\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.160\nand you need to install a stereo,\nyou have your instructions.\n\n431\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does make sense,\ndoesn't it?\n\n432\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.087\nNo, it should not make any sense to\nyou at all, if you're seeing this for\n\n433\n00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:44.248\nthe first time, this type of certificate\nis really what the certificate looks like.\n\n434\n00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:48.918\nI know it's strange and when you look at\nit, like yeah, that makes a lot of sense,\n\n435\n00:23:48.918 --> 00:23:50.826\nbut all that information has me.\n\n436\n00:23:50.826 --> 00:23:52.431\nAnd if you're wondering like,\n\n437\n00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.410\nRonnie did you just expose\nyour personal certificate and.\n\n438\n00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.130\nAnd it doesn't matter because yeah,\ngo ahead and\n\n439\n00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.957\nuse that on anything you want to.\n\n440\n00:23:59.957 --> 00:24:00.960\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n441\n00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.500\nI generated this one again off\nof actually a virtual machine,\n\n442\n00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.020\non a firewall that I set up here.\n\n443\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.790\nJust so\nthat we can see what it looks like.\n\n444\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.560\nNow, the great thing is, you and I, yeah,\n\n445\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.350\nwe can interpret what this means but\nincluded in here, okay.\n\n446\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.330\nI know it's kind of weird\nis the certificate subject.\n\n447\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.052\nNow is this about, okay.\n\n448\n00:24:21.052 --> 00:24:22.390\nIncluded in here of course,\n\n449\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.380\nis the certificate authority\nthat issued the certificate.\n\n450\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.450\nA serial number, the actual owners\ndistinguished name in that certificate\n\n451\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:35.750\nauthority, the certificate\ndigital signature itself can,\n\n452\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.510\nI think that's right here\nat this part of program.\n\n453\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.250\nNow I don't have a clue\nwhere it actually is.\n\n454\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.500\nThe algorithm used to sign\nthe certificates included in here,\n\n455\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.290\nvalidity dates.\n\n456\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.210\nHow long is this certificate valid for?\n\n457\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:52.330\nAnd also included in here, is the public\nkey for my public p cryptography.\n\n458\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.850\nSo all of that's actually used then\nas she implemented right here.\n\n459\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.110\nSo Wes if you were to pick out\nthe validity date, where would you, no,\n\n460\n00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.070\nI wouldn't be able to do that either.\n\n461\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.380\nSo how the heck do we find\nout that information?\n\n462\n00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.340\nWell we normally don't using that,\nmachines used that and\n\n463\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.730\nthey actually understand it.\n\n464\n00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:17.110\nBut the easier way is I've left up my\nconnection of course to ITProTV's website,\n\n465\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.110\nso we can see this a little bit better.\n\n466\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:26.066\nSo for readable or human-readable eyes,\nwe're not a protocol or droid like C-3PO.\n\n467\n00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:33.930\nBut right here, if I click on the ITProTV\nthe little green, you know message here.\n\n468\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.000\nThen it says secure connection,\nyour information is private\n\n469\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.540\nwhen it's sent to this site and\nthat's actually a great confirmation.\n\n470\n00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.010\nI know you can't, you're probably saying,\nwhere the heck is he reading that,\n\n471\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.010\nit's right here.\n\n472\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.620\nSo it says it is private when you\nsend information to this site.\n\n473\n00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.880\nIf I click on details,\nnow notice that my browser pops up and\n\n474\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.150\nover here on the right-hand side,\nsee how far I can extend this out, so\n\n475\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:03.160\nwe can see a little bit better, I can\nclick on View Certificate and there it is.\n\n476\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.950\nNow, right away when I take a look at\ncertificate, this is more what I would\n\n477\n00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.070\nexpect to see an actual,\nwhat looks like a certificate, right?\n\n478\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.910\nSo here above is the certificate\nhierarchy, right?\n\n479\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.230\nIt says this is the ITProTV certificate.\n\n480\n00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.540\nYou can see where it can be validated and\n\n481\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.020\nit actually has gone all\nthe way up to the root CA here.\n\n482\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.140\nSo we have that idea of that chain that\nactually links us up all the way back up\n\n483\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.230\nto the root.\n\n484\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:33.370\nSo it shows us each level in\nhow this was able to develope.\n\n485\n00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.760\nSo your computer when you\nwent here just on mine said,\n\n486\n00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.130\nhey look, I need to verify this one.\n\n487\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.940\nAnd it was able to say, of course I can\nattest that this actually belongs to\n\n488\n00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.940\nthis guy, and\nthis guy actually belongs to here.\n\n489\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.970\nSo it can attest that.\n\n490\n00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.450\nNow I noticed that, let me go back\ndown to ITProTV's as certificate.\n\n491\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.820\nIf I click on details, so the information\nthat we were talking about now is,\n\n492\n00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.160\nwell nice and human readable for us.\n\n493\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.490\nSo here is information of\ncourse about the owner itself.\n\n494\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.270\nAnd then the issuer, and the company,\n\n495\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.230\nand there's the common name\nthat we're looking for too.\n\n496\n00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.510\nHere's a serial number,\nso that's always key, so\n\n497\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.060\nthat we can see that serial number.\n\n498\n00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.480\nHere's the signature algorithm, and how\nit's been protected, so you can see that.\n\n499\n00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.610\nValidity dates like what we saw before,\nas well as the public key information.\n\n500\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.080\nSo here's all that information\nthat we have available to us.\n\n501\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.300\nGoing down you can even\nsee the usage of that key,\n\n502\n00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:37.100\nfor digital signatures, and\nof course key encipherment.\n\n503\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.940\nI like that term encipherment,\nthat means encrypting the keys, okay?\n\n504\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.140\nAs you continue to go down through here,\nmore and\n\n505\n00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.730\nmore information, and the names,\nand the policies, and\n\n506\n00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.410\nyou name it, that's all of the information\nthat's included in here, to help us\n\n507\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.530\nout making sure that we have everything\nsecured the way that we normally need to.\n\n508\n00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.543\nNow we do have to be careful, right?\n\n509\n00:28:00.543 --> 00:28:05.760\nThe very fact is if you end up going\nto ITProTV website and you can't get\n\n510\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.350\na certificate like this, then it could\nbe somebody spoofing ITPro.Tv website.\n\n511\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.820\nAnd that's when you should say,\nwait a minute, and\n\n512\n00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.140\nwhat should happen in your browser's\ntoday if you do something like that.\n\n513\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.780\nIt should tell you look, I can't validate\nthat, no matter what you're connecting\n\n514\n00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.330\nto a website that says ITProTV but,\nyeah, I really can't prove that to you,\n\n515\n00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:32.040\nand so it will give you\na couple of options, right?\n\n516\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.710\nOne of course is unsafe but\nproceed on anyways, go ahead and\n\n517\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:40.360\ndo that or the other one is leave\nthis side and don't come back to it.\n\n518\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.710\nSo it gives you that option\nto be able to do that.\n\n519\n00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.950\nSo even browsers today\nare being very helpful\n\n520\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.730\ntrying to make sure that you\nget that caught into this and\n\n521\n00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.510\nthat you understand how that\nends up happening, okay?\n\n522\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:58.150\nSo in this particular certificate example\nhere, it really does show us, okay.\n\n523\n00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.850\nAll the information that we talked about,\neven though it looks very strange.\n\n524\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.550\nNow, there's a couple of other things\nwe'll take a look at a little bit later on\n\n525\n00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.750\nas well in some of the components.\n\n526\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.680\nBut at least from this standpoint, you've\nseen the idea of a digital certificate.\n\n527\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.420\nWe've also talked a bit about the idea\nhere of course, of using cipher suites and\n\n528\n00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:22.320\nhow you can identify them, and\nunderstand the result behind that, right?\n\n529\n00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.910\nWhy do you need to identify them,\nand what is the import of\n\n530\n00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:30.230\nunderstanding the encryption on it, and\nwhy you should choose one over the other,\n\n531\n00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.320\nall that is actually in play when you\nstart taking look at on cyber security.\n\n532\n00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.080\nAnd this is where we're beginning with\nTLS, but there's a lot more to come.\n\n533\n00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n534\n00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.850\nThat's a lot of good information.\n\n535\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.090\nI stick with my first common.\n\n536\n00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.074\nI still think,\nit is steroids instructions from Mars.\n\n537\n00:29:43.074 --> 00:29:43.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n538\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.680\nSo I call it shenanigans.\n\n539\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.020\nBut does look like we're coming\nto an end of another episode.\n\n540\n00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.990\nNow, I know you have some additional\ncontent that you'd like to let us know and\n\n541\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.970\nexplain to our viewers.\n\n542\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.820\nBut before we sign out,\nwrite down any additional considerations.\n\n543\n00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.210\nMaybe answer the Certificates and the\ncipher suites that we've been discussing?\n\n544\n00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Well just make sure\nthat you pay attention to\n\n545\n00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.270\nthe cryptography that\nwe're talking about here.\n\n546\n00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:08.350\nGo back and view those episodes on some\nof the different hashing algorithms\n\n547\n00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:14.380\nas well as the symmetric I'm not\nsymmetric, the encrypt, I can\n\n548\n00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.420\nnot say the word encryption algorithms\nthat we end up using to protect our data\n\n549\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.890\nto and we still got a lot more to go like\nwe said we really need to walk through\n\n550\n00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.090\nthat entire process of understanding\nhow the TLS communication worked.\n\n551\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.420\nSo that we can understand what happens\nwhen it breaks down and where we have to\n\n552\n00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:37.870\nactually identify issues as it comes along\nbut overall though study more on the exam.\n\n553\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.400\nThey may not go into that\nparticular depth, but yes,\n\n554\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.910\nunderstanding those algorithms\nis gonna be key and\n\n555\n00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.270\nhaving a good understanding of this\nprocess is really gonna help you out\n\n556\n00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.310\nin using the rest of everything\nthat you have to set up.\n\n557\n00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.400\nNot only for the exam, but also in real\nworld experience as you get ready to\n\n558\n00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.850\nset up,\nmaybe a public web server of your own.\n\n559\n00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\nas always we appreciate having you here in\n\n560\n00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.140\nthe studio and\nwe do appreciate you who are watching.\n\n561\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.460\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out,\nand keep in mind we coming back for\n\n562\n00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.340\nthe part two, but until we see you then.\n\n563\n00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.030\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n564\n00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n565\n00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.330\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:19.355\n[MUSIC]\n\n567\n00:31:19.355 --> 00:31:26.109\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:11.774\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:15.386\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:16.840\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.906\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are continuing through our series on\n\n7\n00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.642\nCisco's Cyber Security Fundamentals and\nwe're coming back with a part two and\n\n8\n00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.343\nback to lend his expertise on this subject\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:28.461\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.449\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.293\nThank you again for having me back as\nwe continue on, on this part two where\n\n12\n00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:37.770\nwe're talking about the different SSL,\nTLS components, whatever you wanna call.\n\n13\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.667\nIt is fine, but this is gonna be some of\nthe foundational components involved,\n\n14\n00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:47.564\nespecially when you connect out to,\nlet's say, for example, a web server and\n\n15\n00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.073\nunderstanding how to keep that secure.\n\n16\n00:00:50.073 --> 00:00:53.349\nIn previous episode,\nwe've already mentioned the idea,\n\n17\n00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:57.868\nof course, of using deciphers's weeks and\nmaking sure that we understand that we\n\n18\n00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:02.387\nneed the connect in an encrypted level and\nthat we use multiple protocols to help us\n\n19\n00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:07.300\nout and some other information to ensure\nthat we're actually staying secure.\n\n20\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.806\nWe also, of course, showed you a digital\ncertificate in a row format or\n\n21\n00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:16.773\nits particular format there that's\nactually PKCS like number ten, I think.\n\n22\n00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:19.300\nBut whatever it is or\nseven, I can't remember.\n\n23\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.620\nWhichever one it is there, we showed you\nthat particular format and then we also\n\n24\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060\nshowed you how you can see the information\nin it when you go to a website as well.\n\n25\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.627\nNow here, we wanna make sure that\nwe can understand the process of\n\n26\n00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:36.948\nconnecting to a website securely or\nto any server securely and\n\n27\n00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:39.205\nthe way that it ends up working.\n\n28\n00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:44.035\nAnd the reason why is that when we talk\nabout the idea of asymmetric encryption,\n\n29\n00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:45.982\nyou understand that process and\n\n30\n00:01:45.982 --> 00:01:49.604\nyou understand how the exchange\nactually ends up working.\n\n31\n00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:52.528\nWe've gone over that in\nour previous episode, but\n\n32\n00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:56.676\nwhat is it that we actually end up doing\nwhen we connect to a website that we\n\n33\n00:01:56.676 --> 00:02:00.212\nmight not have ever connected\nto before and then we actually,\n\n34\n00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:04.170\nyou can now establish secured\ncommunication between them.\n\n35\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.250\nThat is the goal for\nus to understanding that process and\n\n36\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.340\nseeing the process, as well.\n\n37\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.064\nSo we're gonna talk\nabout theoretically and\n\n38\n00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.205\nthen we'll gonna show you the connection,\nand show you the details behind that.\n\n39\n00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:17.934\nA little bit inside of Wireshark as we\ngo through and then we'll talk about\n\n40\n00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:22.330\na couple of other components that we need\nto make sure we have an awareness of.\n\n41\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.790\nAnd hopefully,\nthat will help us to wrap up\n\n42\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.110\nthe ID here of some of the different\ncomponents that we have to understand.\n\n43\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.210\nSo, let's go and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n44\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.840\nAnd that way, we'll have this conceptual\nunderstanding of some of the things that\n\n45\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570\nhas to happen there.\n\n46\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.950\nWhen we start to take a look as we connect\nin to some type of server that's gonna be\n\n47\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.090\nrunning, TLS or SSL,\n\n48\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.110\nwe wanna make sure that you know\nthe process here as a client of that too.\n\n49\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.230\nSo when it begins and you make a\nconnection, let's say, you're going across\n\n50\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.290\nto ITProTV's website, you're gonna\nsend what we call a client hello.\n\n51\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.397\nAnd inside that particular hello,\nthere is gonna be that list of cypher\n\n52\n00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:12.842\nsuites that you wan to accept as far as\nthe connection goes and what the actual\n\n53\n00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:18.140\nclient prefers to be able to use and\nthe cypher suites that are available.\n\n54\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.520\nEven though it says, if you can't use my\npreferred one, use these that connect in.\n\n55\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.370\nAt that point, over on the server itself,\n\n56\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.450\nit would choose one of those as\nwell when it actually does this.\n\n57\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.050\nAnd then once it does that,\n\n58\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.420\nit will also contain some other\ninformation which of course,\n\n59\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.710\nincludes somewhat like a session ID, some\ndifferent bytes of information that it\n\n60\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.790\nneeds to including the digital certificate\nand that will also get sent back over and\n\n61\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.820\nthis is when we'll end up getting\nthe server's certificate on this side.\n\n62\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.522\nNow the reason why that's important\nis remember that along with that\n\n63\n00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:58.477\ncertificate comes, what?\n\n64\n00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:03.334\nThe client's, not the client's,\nexcuse me, the server's public key and\n\n65\n00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:07.097\nthat's an important part of\nwhat we need to understand it.\n\n66\n00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:12.599\nThe reason why we need that public\nkey is so that I can do, what?\n\n67\n00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.277\nWell, inside of asymmetric encryption,\nwe already talked about that we need that\n\n68\n00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:24.380\npublic key, so I can send encrypted data\nback to whoever sent me that public key.\n\n69\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.210\nSo, what is the information that\nI am sending back from my side?\n\n70\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.000\nWell, some of that is here is the\nencryption algorithm that I choose to use.\n\n71\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.329\nSo if I'm protecting my data,\nmy application data, my data payload,\n\n72\n00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:43.142\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n73\n00:04:43.142 --> 00:04:48.565\nWhatever information that we are going\nto exchange between the client and\n\n74\n00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.846\nthe server, I want to use AES.\n\n75\n00:04:50.846 --> 00:04:54.081\nI want to use DES, whatever it might be.\n\n76\n00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:57.150\nDES or whatever encryption\nalgorithm you want to use.\n\n77\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.354\nWell, we want to be able to\nuse that encryption algorithm.\n\n78\n00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:05.765\nSo this server knows that\nyou want to use a yes or\n\n79\n00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:10.665\nwhatever it might be, but\nit doesn't have your encryption key and\n\n80\n00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:16.460\nyou can't just send that out across\nthe internet without it being protected.\n\n81\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.672\nAnd saying, yeah, here you go.\n\n82\n00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:21.832\nHere is my encryption key for my data,\nbut what happens now that I have\n\n83\n00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:26.670\nthe certificate over here on the client\nside, it gives me this ability to what?\n\n84\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.282\nTo save.\n\n85\n00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:29.450\nSo now, I'm gonna send what?\n\n86\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.140\nMy encryption keys or I'm gonna\ngenerate some encryption keys for\n\n87\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.410\nthe data that we are going to exchange.\n\n88\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.750\nThat way, we can actually\nhave our encryption key for\n\n89\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.560\nAES which is a symmetric key encryption.\n\n90\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.200\nWe encrypted with the public\nkey of the server and\n\n91\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.390\nnow that's what I'm talking about\nclient key exchange information.\n\n92\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.889\nSo then, we send that back over.\n\n93\n00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.726\nNow of course, over on the server,\nit can decrypt the keys\n\n94\n00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:03.280\nthat the client has sent back\nover with his own private key.\n\n95\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.070\nAnd once it has that encryption,\nalgorithm,\n\n96\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.600\nnow they can exchange encrypted messages.\n\n97\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.130\nSo now, TLS sending data\n\n98\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.340\nback over to the SSL client over\nhere on the left-hand side.\n\n99\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.070\nIt can say, yeah, if I'm sending\ninformation back over to this guy,\n\n100\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.110\nI'm only using AES and\nlet me encrypt it with, what?\n\n101\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.330\nThe key that I got from him and\nthen he sends it back over.\n\n102\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.001\nThe SSL client says, hey,\n\n103\n00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:38.591\nlook at that, I've got my encrypted\ndata that has my encryption key on it.\n\n104\n00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.124\nSo, I'm going to decrypt it with what?\n\n105\n00:06:40.124 --> 00:06:41.501\nThe same key.\n\n106\n00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:46.278\nSo, notice that we're never exposing\nthe actual encryption key data at\n\n107\n00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:48.013\nall during this process.\n\n108\n00:06:48.013 --> 00:06:50.865\nWe are negotiating\nthe initial encryption and\n\n109\n00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:55.150\nwe're showing how we can keep\nthis entire process secure.\n\n110\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:02.000\nSo, that is kind of the conceptual\nunderstanding of this going on.\n\n111\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.020\nNow, it took me four of five\nminutes to explain that.\n\n112\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.728\nIn reality, this happens in a matter\nof maybe even a second or two seconds,\n\n113\n00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:13.840\ndepending, of course,\nwhere the website is across the world and\n\n114\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.400\nhow many different servers you have\nto go to, but let's see the exchange\n\n115\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.148\nof this information happening on the\nclient side is what we are going to do.\n\n116\n00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:26.008\nSo here, we're gonna go back and\n\n117\n00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:31.730\nwe've actually done a process like\nthis in the previous episode,\n\n118\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.850\nbut I am simply gonna launch up\nWireshark if I can spell it.\n\n119\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.164\nAnd on my machine, I am going to make\nsure I select the proper interface.\n\n120\n00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:46.960\nThat's always a key in Wireshark,\nmaking sure you pick the right interface.\n\n121\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.448\nOnce I have that in running,\nI'm gonna leave it in the background.\n\n122\n00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:54.053\nI'm going to connect to,\nwell, the ITProTV website.\n\n123\n00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.803\nAnd it's really this process right here.\n\n124\n00:07:58.803 --> 00:08:01.427\nOnce I got that certificate, I know what?\n\n125\n00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:04.866\nThat the server hello\nhas happened everything.\n\n126\n00:08:04.866 --> 00:08:07.391\nEverything that we've talked\nabout has now happened.\n\n127\n00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.705\nAnything that I do from\nthis point on is encrypted.\n\n128\n00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:14.699\nI want to make sure that I'm, okay.\n\n129\n00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:15.761\nI was right along that, okay.\n\n130\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.790\nSo that's fine.\n\n131\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.385\nSo now I'm logged in, everything that's\ngoing back and forth now is actually being\n\n132\n00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:25.085\nencrypted across that particular\ncommunication channel, all right?\n\n133\n00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:30.007\nSo let me close out of this,\nand in Wireshark I'm going\n\n134\n00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:35.042\nto stop the capture, and\nI'm gonna filter this by SSL.\n\n135\n00:08:37.686 --> 00:08:40.412\nAnd once I do this there are a couple\nof different ones going on.\n\n136\n00:08:40.412 --> 00:08:45.090\nYou could see that I'm actually\nconnecting to different websites here.\n\n137\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.060\nMy ITProTV website\n\n138\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.790\nbegins with 192., right here, 124.249.106.\n\n139\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.340\nSo that is, well, ITProTV's website.\n\n140\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.728\nSo this is the stream that\nI really want to follow.\n\n141\n00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:06.833\nIf I right-click and I go down to follow,\nI can now select the SSL stream.\n\n142\n00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:10.809\nNot so worried about that,\n\n143\n00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:15.060\nbut I'm just trying to limit myself to\na lot of the actual data up here, okay?\n\n144\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.770\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat we're capturing\n\n145\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.930\nright at the beginning to make\nsure that everything is going on.\n\n146\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.970\nSo you can see that initially, okay?\n\n147\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.480\nHere is that three way handshake that\nwe've taken a look at so much so\n\n148\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.610\nin the past here.\n\n149\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.657\nHere's the sin, the sinac, and\nthe acknowledgement that, hey,\n\n150\n00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:38.351\nthings are actually gonna establish\nthat communication channel between us.\n\n151\n00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:42.633\nFrom that point,\nthis is where I begin establishing what\n\n152\n00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:46.925\nthe secure type of communication\nwith the client Hello.\n\n153\n00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:50.250\nAnd it's here we're gonna\nbegin this process, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.995\nSo once we have that client Hello and\nI'm just dragging up the detail Window,\n\n155\n00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:58.718\nremember that what we're taking\na look here inside of this,\n\n156\n00:09:58.718 --> 00:10:01.419\nthis is gonna be our\nlayer two information,\n\n157\n00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:05.807\nour layer three information and\nlayer four, and secure socket layer.\n\n158\n00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:10.099\nOnce I expand this out,\nI can see the Handshake protocol,\n\n159\n00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:12.822\ninside of that Handshake protocol.\n\n160\n00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.610\nAnd this is the information\nthat we're looking for.\n\n161\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.760\nSo the information inside\nof here is really key.\n\n162\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.421\nThere's that Session ID and\nof course, the ciphering method here.\n\n163\n00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:30.560\nSorry for sweets, so I'm gonna say it's\nnot ciphering, compression method.\n\n164\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.660\nSo we have compression.\n\n165\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.930\nThen remember here's those 18\ndifferent ones that we have available.\n\n166\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.301\nSo on my end, this is where I am\nsending that over to the server, and\n\n167\n00:10:40.301 --> 00:10:43.439\nthe server's gonna choose for\nme any of these.\n\n168\n00:10:43.439 --> 00:10:47.030\nNormally, the way that this ends\nup working, of course, is from,\n\n169\n00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.520\nwell top to bottom.\n\n170\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.161\nAnd you can see like down here there's\nthe one that has SHA in it, which kind of\n\n171\n00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:55.648\ntells us, hey, look, maybe this is\nnot the greatest thing in the world.\n\n172\n00:10:55.648 --> 00:11:00.734\nBut if you're gonna do anything with SHA\nyou wanna do it with at least 384 here and\n\n173\n00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:01.978\nthen or SHA256.\n\n174\n00:11:01.978 --> 00:11:04.600\nSo you actually start seeing\nthe information go across here.\n\n175\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.730\nNow, don't get me wrong,\n\n176\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.830\nthe combination of all this makes it\nrelatively secure even to this day.\n\n177\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.733\nBut at the same time, you don't\nwanna use anything that you really,\n\n178\n00:11:13.733 --> 00:11:17.330\nthat might kind of degrade your\nparticular level of security.\n\n179\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.700\nSo on these 18 different suites,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n180\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.880\nSo it shows that I sent that out\non the client Hello from me,\n\n181\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.570\nover to the server for\nthat initial client Hello.\n\n182\n00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.520\nAnd if I scroll down,\nI can now see the next part of that TLS\n\n183\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.660\ncommunication is also right here,\nwhich is on the server Hello.\n\n184\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.550\nThe server Hello responds\nback in that same handshake.\n\n185\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.720\nAnd now there again is that Cipher Suite,\nand\n\n186\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.742\nthat agreement of the information\nthat we send across here.\n\n187\n00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.703\nSee if we actually have any other\n\n188\n00:11:53.703 --> 00:11:55.344\ninformation that we\nneed to take a look at.\n\n189\n00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:02.312\nSo that is the actual information\nin which we are exchanging, and\n\n190\n00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:04.310\nwe are agreeing that.\n\n191\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.800\nNow, here's where it begins.\n\n192\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.232\nNotice that they kinda separate this out,\nso it's not inside of the Hello itself,\n\n193\n00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:16.280\nbut here's where we get\nthe certificate from the SSL server.\n\n194\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.007\nSo you could see the source,\n\n195\n00:12:19.007 --> 00:12:24.243\n192.124.249.106 coming back to me.\n\n196\n00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:28.964\nAnd inside of that, it shows me the\nHandshake Protocol and the certificate, so\n\n197\n00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:29.675\nwithin it.\n\n198\n00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:33.410\nAnd you can see, again, all\nthe information that needs right there.\n\n199\n00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.170\nSo from this point on, you'll\n\n200\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:42.040\nsee a couple more exchanges of verifying\nthat the communication is happening.\n\n201\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.229\nAnd there is where we now come back,\nright?\n\n202\n00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:50.111\nNow that I have the server certificate,\nI can now go ahead and encrypt that\n\n203\n00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:55.181\nwith the public key information from\nthe server on the client key exchange.\n\n204\n00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:57.020\nChange the cipher itself.\n\n205\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.543\nIt says, do another Hello request.\n\n206\n00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:02.372\nYou name it, all that stuff is in there.\n\n207\n00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:05.135\nAnd let's see if we can scroll\ndown here just a little bit.\n\n208\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.467\nAnd you can see more, and\nmore information going across.\n\n209\n00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:15.178\nSo this is where it begins to kind\nof establish the communication.\n\n210\n00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:19.310\nAnd from this point on, if you take a look\nat the protocol, everything else is\n\n211\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.640\nencrypted here as far as the application\ndata that we are now sending.\n\n212\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.990\nAnd as a new session ticket comes along,\n\n213\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:31.450\nyou'll see once again it's still using\nthe same encryption, and there we go.\n\n214\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.370\nWe actually have more and\nmore data now, going back and\n\n215\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.330\nforth across, and\nit's all under TLS, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.840\nSo that is kind of a very generic\nprocess that we have available to us\n\n217\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.140\nto see the information going across.\n\n218\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.920\nWhen you have this type of communication,\nthis is now let you know that everything\n\n219\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.560\nis secure, and that you're now\nactually exchanging data that is\n\n220\n00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.420\nencrypted based on what the negotiation of\nthat between the client and the server.\n\n221\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.250\nSo it's a really important process.\n\n222\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.560\n&gt;&gt; You know, Ronnie,\nsomething that confused me here,\n\n223\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.540\nmaybe you can help with my confusion.\n\n224\n00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.030\nYou said, hey, let's go ahead and\n\n225\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.060\nfollow SSH, and\nthen next thing I know I notice is TLS.\n\n226\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:18.030\nThe other thing I've also noticed\nis that we call it HTTPS and\n\n227\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.890\nyou guys know your acronyms out there\nby the time you get to Cisco, right?\n\n228\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.222\nThat's the hyper transfer, maybe I know,\n\n229\n00:14:23.222 --> 00:14:26.495\nhyper-text [LAUGH] transfer\nprotocol over secure socket layer.\n\n230\n00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:30.673\nBut looking at this Wireshark packet\ncapture utility, I don't see any SSL,\n\n231\n00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:33.188\nall I see is TLS,\ncan you help me out with that?\n\n232\n00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:37.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of unusual here\nthat there's always been this idea,\n\n233\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.381\nSSL and TLS, and what it really means,\nand whether or not we use them.\n\n234\n00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:46.410\nEven Wireshark doesn't have a TLS filter.\n\n235\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.390\nSo if I change this to TLS,\nnotice it doesn't have it.\n\n236\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.300\nIt says, hey, I don't recognize it.\n\n237\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.780\nBut as soon as I type in SSL,\nit really filters,\n\n238\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.240\nand notice the protocol it filters by is,\nwell, TLS.\n\n239\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.560\nSo it doesn't really make a lot\nof sense here, except for\n\n240\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.545\na couple of different things you have to\nknow a little bit historically, right?\n\n241\n00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:09.380\nSSL was developed by Netscape,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n242\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.800\nAnd it worked for a little bit of time\nbut, of course, during that entire time,\n\n243\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.890\nthey knew something that people were\nconstantly pushing for an open standard\n\n244\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.530\nversion of this, because, well, they\ndidn't really want Netscape making all\n\n245\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.990\nthe money based off of this, they were the\nonly ones that had this secure protocol.\n\n246\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:32.790\nSo then that's when the IETF jumped in and\nstarted developing TLS, that\n\n247\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:38.600\ntransport layer security protocol, that\nthen as you started doing this, right?\n\n248\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.180\nIt was developed to also improve on\nthe way that SSL handled things.\n\n249\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.810\nSo SSL went through about three\ndifferent versions, right?\n\n250\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.341\nEach one, of course, saying, okay,\nwe're secure, somebody's breaking it,\n\n251\n00:15:50.341 --> 00:15:54.113\nthen SSL two, secure somebody's\nbreaking it, and then SSL three.\n\n252\n00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:58.554\nIt didn't really necessarily get broken,\nper se, but it was weak and\n\n253\n00:15:58.554 --> 00:16:00.671\nthey knew that was gonna happen.\n\n254\n00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:05.271\nSo TLS really did kinda jump in\nat the latter end of that point.\n\n255\n00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:08.989\nWhen it finally really did kind\nof get some popularity there.\n\n256\n00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:14.219\nSo at the very beginning you might\nalso hear the idea of SSL3.1 and\n\n257\n00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:19.110\nit really is the idea of well,\nTLS actually is what we see.\n\n258\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.425\n&gt;&gt; So if it's called SSL 3.1 and we know\nthat we have one, two and 3.0 or SSL and\n\n259\n00:16:23.425 --> 00:16:26.090\nTLS, are they compatible with each other?\n\n260\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, not necessarily, okay?\n\n261\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.580\nSo I don't wanna say that\nthey are 100% compatible.\n\n262\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.730\nThey're not supposed to be compatible, but\nyet people do use them interchangeably.\n\n263\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.890\nThat's because they kind of do\nthe exact same thing, but no,\n\n264\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:46.160\nNetscape is apparently SSL is their\nproprietary way of doing things.\n\n265\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.720\nSo it's not a direct compatibility.\n\n266\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Now, out of all the choices\nthat we have, Ronnie, SSL and TLS,\n\n267\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.590\nwhat is the most common?\n\n268\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.450\nWhat's the commonality\nwhen it comes to TLSW.\n\n269\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it,\n\n270\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.240\nthis version and\nyou can see I live time capture this.\n\n271\n00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.770\nThis is the most common version that you\nsee out today here, which is version 1.2.\n\n272\n00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.438\nAnd as things develop, of course\nthere'll probably be version 1.3 and\n\n273\n00:17:09.438 --> 00:17:11.270\n2.0 at some point here.\n\n274\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.440\nBut overall though, this is what you're\ngonna end up seeing the majority of times.\n\n275\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.630\nEven when people talk about SSL today,\nthey're probably really using TLS.\n\n276\n00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.460\nAnd that is, I'm not gonna say we're\nNetscape with cuz I don't really know\n\n277\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.120\nin the future of Netscape or\nwhere the past even went in last years.\n\n278\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.710\nThat's kind of the first role,\n\n279\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.600\nkind of commercial version\nbrowser that I ever used.\n\n280\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.310\nAt the same time,\n\n281\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.600\nI never kept with it once we got\nfree browsers that were all there.\n\n282\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.969\nIt was kind of easy to test,\nswitch on over.\n\n283\n00:17:39.969 --> 00:17:44.500\nSo here, you do have some\nconfusion about the protocols.\n\n284\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.970\nBut when you do see SSL,\npeople probably really mean TLS, but\n\n285\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.250\nthis is the way that they learned it, so\nthey still continue to call it that way.\n\n286\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.680\nAt the same time, remember to try and use\nthe highest version of TLS that you can\n\n287\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.244\nif you are making this type of connection\nthat needs to be done using that.\n\n288\n00:18:01.244 --> 00:18:05.380\nBut understand that process,\nit really does help, knowing the hellos\n\n289\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.110\nare really gonna be helpful as well\nwhen you get ready for the exam too.\n\n290\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.068\nAnd just the overall process\nof what's happening there.\n\n291\n00:18:13.068 --> 00:18:18.090\nMany times, right, what we can find\nout is where a process breaks down and\n\n292\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.070\nthen figure out from that point what we\nneed to do to reestablish that process.\n\n293\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.920\nSo it really is an important part of\neverything that we have to do as far as\n\n294\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.300\nunderstanding that\nparticular concept as well.\n\n295\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.930\nIn the process of doing that exchange or\nthat handshake key exchange to happen for\n\n296\n00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.920\nsecure connections to go on to, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.310\nSo that's pretty much the idea of\nunderstanding that key exchange and\n\n298\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.150\nwe really have one other topic\nthat we need to kind of address.\n\n299\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.780\nWhich is, there is a format that\n\n300\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.328\ngoes on with the dealing with what\ncertificates more than anything else.\n\n301\n00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:59.599\nAnd this is what they call PKCS,\n\n302\n00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:05.619\nPublic Key Cryptography Standards, PKCS.\n\n303\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.819\nThese particular ones are essentially\npublic standards or published standards,\n\n304\n00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:11.424\nexcuse me.\n\n305\n00:19:11.424 --> 00:19:14.690\nThey're not there for\npublic key cryptography.\n\n306\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.680\nThis idea of making sure that we know this\n\n307\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.750\nis that there's multiple\nversions of these.\n\n308\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:24.120\nSome of the earliest versions were\nkind of, they were cracked right away.\n\n309\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.208\nSo like PKCS number one.\n\n310\n00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.860\nIt kind of got cracked and\nof course, they improved on it and\n\n311\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.410\nthen they started building up more and\nmore.\n\n312\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.540\nBut there's really two that\nyou have to know about, okay.\n\n313\n00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.350\nThere's number seven and number ten\nare kind of the big ones that you\n\n314\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:44.494\nreally have to remember when\ndealing with this idea, okay.\n\n315\n00:19:44.494 --> 00:19:48.810\nNow, this is where I can't remember,\nI always forget here.\n\n316\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.070\nNumber seven and\nnumber ten, one is used for\n\n317\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.770\nrequesting a public key, okay,\nor requesting a certificate.\n\n318\n00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.660\nSo when you generate\na certificate request itself,\n\n319\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.470\nit will publish something\nthat looks again,\n\n320\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:11.220\nlike the idea of a regular certificate\nthat's based on your own public key.\n\n321\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.970\nWhen all that information is put in there,\n\n322\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.350\nit comes out to be a jumbled stream and\nmessed up things.\n\n323\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:21.330\nBut then the certificate authority though,\nit can take that certificate and\n\n324\n00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.780\nthen generate a certificate based off\nthat and hand it back to you, okay?\n\n325\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.300\nWhen it sends it back to you,\n\n326\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.120\nit comes back in the form of PKCS,\nI think it's number seven.\n\n327\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.030\nI think number ten is the request for\nthe life of me.\n\n328\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.460\nIf I can get them backwards,\nswitch those numbers around.\n\n329\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.160\nI don't know why I can't remember,\nfor the life of me.\n\n330\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.590\n&gt;&gt; No, you're right.\nRequest is ten, yes sir.\n\n331\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.566\n&gt;&gt; Okay, see?\n\n332\n00:20:40.566 --> 00:20:44.820\nYeah, I remember more than I think but\nI can't really remember that.\n\n333\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.100\nYep, so the number ten is the request\nthat you tend to send to the server.\n\n334\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.373\nMake sure you know that and\nthen what you normally get back is\n\n335\n00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:57.180\ngonna be a PKCS number seven which\nis the format of that certificate.\n\n336\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.883\nNow the strange thing is they almost look\nidentical if you would take the raw format\n\n337\n00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:05.050\nto them when you generate\nthis kind of thing.\n\n338\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.080\nCan you generate a request on your own?\n\n339\n00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.869\nDefinitely, okay,\nyou can do that all the time.\n\n340\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.570\nThere's a couple ways you can do that.\n\n341\n00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.630\nRight now if you wanted to,\n\n342\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.040\nyou can go out to some of the certificate\nauthorities that are on the Internet.\n\n343\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.680\nAnd I did this a couple of years ago.\n\n344\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.860\nMaybe not even a couple of years ago,\nI wanted to see.\n\n345\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.700\nBut there's a lot of certificate\nauthorities out there that want you to\n\n346\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.470\npurchase your own certificate.\n\n347\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.500\nSo they'll issue you\na temporary 30-day certificate.\n\n348\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.870\nAnd in their site, you just simply follow\nthe instructions, you fill out the form.\n\n349\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.692\nAnd it would generate that certificate\nrequest that will spit out this long\n\n350\n00:21:43.692 --> 00:21:45.078\nline of code for you.\n\n351\n00:21:45.078 --> 00:21:50.180\nAnd then you'll take that and\nyou'll paste it into a web interface.\n\n352\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.410\nAt that point, they'll end up going\nthrough and either rejecting it or\n\n353\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.350\naccepting it or they may contact you\nbefore they actually make a decision.\n\n354\n00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.640\nSo like on mine, when I actually\nrequested one, they said hey,\n\n355\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.020\nwhat are you requesting this for?\n\n356\n00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.780\nAnd they actually gave me options and\nthe check box on the email.\n\n357\n00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.109\nIs this for personal use?\n\n358\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.955\nIs it the try out the certificate?\n\n359\n00:22:12.955 --> 00:22:14.900\nIs this for another reason?\n\n360\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.030\nAnd I said this is just for\nanother reason.\n\n361\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.350\nI just wanna see how this implements\nin a lab that I'm building and\n\n362\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.640\nthey issued me one right out.\n\n363\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.790\nAnd I was able to use that for a show\nthat I did and it worked perfectly fine.\n\n364\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.760\nYou do have to be ready for phone calls\nand emails that happen after that.\n\n365\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.920\nCuz they really want you to purchase.\n\n366\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.540\nAnd so\nthey'll give you options after that point.\n\n367\n00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.380\nBut you kind of got,\nit's a trade off, okay?\n\n368\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.040\nBut that way you can actually\nsee what that's like.\n\n369\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.092\nIf you have your own lab environment,\nyou can also of course,\n\n370\n00:22:46.092 --> 00:22:50.990\nset up like a Microsoft web service,\nkind of free.\n\n371\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.770\nAnd through the web server itself,\n\n372\n00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.570\nyou can also generate\na certificate request that way.\n\n373\n00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.770\nAnd even build up your own certificate\nauthority if you choose to and\n\n374\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.980\nissue one that way as well.\n\n375\n00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.540\nSo, there's multiple ways where\nyou can see what these look like,\n\n376\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.570\nto make that happen.\n\n377\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.830\nBut that number seven and number ten,\nthose are by far the more,\n\n378\n00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.800\nI don't want to say more important, but\nmore common ones that you generally see.\n\n379\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.100\nNow there's other ones and\n\n380\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.500\nthis is all about containing what's\nactually inside that public key.\n\n381\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.080\nLet me see if I can show one more here.\n\n382\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:26.060\nSo lets go to my screen for a moment and\nI'll show you another one, okay?\n\n383\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.580\nSometimes you end up seeing one,\nlook, PKCS number 12.\n\n384\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.440\nNow this particular format\nhere is a compressed format\n\n385\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.880\nthat includes not only the certificate\nitself but the key pairs too,\n\n386\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.050\nso that everything's\nactually included in here.\n\n387\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.610\nSo let me see if I can\nactually open this thing.\n\n388\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.140\nI can't remember if I've\nopened this one before or not.\n\n389\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.911\nI think I have.\n\n390\n00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:57.620\nFind the text edit and everything is\npretty much browsable by your text editor.\n\n391\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.327\nBut notice that this one is encrypted.\n\n392\n00:24:01.327 --> 00:24:04.910\nSo here, there it is,\nthere's that PKCS number 12.\n\n393\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.260\nAnd if you're looking at wow, that\ndoesn't even look like anything close,\n\n394\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.800\nthat's because it's all encrypted.\n\n395\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.339\nI see weird symbols and\nsome different things going on in here.\n\n396\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.780\nBut yeah,\nthat's kind of the big difference there.\n\n397\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.380\nAnd they all are used for\ndifferent things.\n\n398\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.650\nAnd this is also of course, depends\nthen if you can get the certificate\n\n399\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.210\nformat that you need it in and\nwhat you're gonna use it on.\n\n400\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.890\nDevices may be different, so\n\n401\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:33.200\nrealize that if you're using public\nkeys or the public key infrastructure.\n\n402\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.140\nYou're gonna need to know what format\nyou need and what format to put it in.\n\n403\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.590\nAnd make sure you make\na request of all that.\n\n404\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.070\nSo that way, you'll have everything\nthat you actually ever need\n\n405\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.760\nwhen you're talking about\ndealing with public keys.\n\n406\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.660\nBut as far as SSL and TLS goes,\nthat pretty much is a good gamut on.\n\n407\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.470\nIt's just about all the components\ninvolved in that process and review,\n\n408\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.120\nreview, review is the key.\n\n409\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.730\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nthat's a lot of great information,\n\n410\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.040\nI don't know about you guys out there, but\n\n411\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.750\nthe security step,\nI just find absolutely fascinating.\n\n412\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.070\nYes, that's the inner\ngeek coming out in me.\n\n413\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.070\nNow I can tell you,\nwith all the security talk,\n\n414\n00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.930\nthe one thing it doesn't secure\nare the minutes that we have on the clock.\n\n415\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.320\nSo it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n416\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.180\nBut a lot of great information there,\nRonnie.\n\n417\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.120\nBut are there any final words\nthat you might like to impart to\n\n418\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.690\nour viewers when it comes to SSL and TLS?\n\n419\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember that each one of\nthese processes is something that it's\n\n420\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.320\ncaught out for the exam on for\na particular reason.\n\n421\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.840\nAnd also for cyber security for a reason.\n\n422\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.910\nEither there's a weakness involved or\n\n423\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.030\nthere's a strength behind it\nthat you should know about.\n\n424\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:40.640\nBut make sure that you look over\neach one of these processes and\n\n425\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.860\nalso try to discover that,\nstrengths and weaknesses behind each.\n\n426\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.540\nHopefully by going through that process,\nyou've been working that out as well.\n\n427\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.680\nAnd by looking at the information\nthat we're showing you,\n\n428\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.780\nyou can also see those things, too.\n\n429\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.440\nBut that's gonna be a big help for\nyou when you get ready for\n\n430\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.570\nyour cybersecurity fundamentals exam.\n\n431\n00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, wealth of knowledge.\n\n432\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.670\nIt's a pleasure having\nyou here in the studios.\n\n433\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.500\nThank you for that and\nthank you to you the viewer watching.\n\n434\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up here.\n\n435\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.980\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n436\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n437\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.044\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n438\n00:26:16.776 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.752\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:16.483\nI'm you host West Brain.\n\n5\n00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.653\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.792\nwe're continuing through our Cisco\ncybersecurity fundamentals and\n\n7\n00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:24.370\njoining us back in the studio for this\nendeavors is none other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.550\nRonnie how are you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.630\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great today.\n\n10\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.032\nThank you again for having me back\non the show as we continue on and\n\n11\n00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:33.058\ntake a look at the cybersecurity\nfundamentals here, and\n\n12\n00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:36.219\nwe're diving into a relatively\ninteresting topic today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.317\nIf you love all things cryptography,\nwe are gonna talk, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:43.648\ntoday about the idea of\ndifferent hashing algorithms.\n\n15\n00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:48.086\nIt's not trying to go over every single\ndetail on hashing algorithms per say, but\n\n16\n00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:52.397\nit's talking about their impact a little\nbit and why we choose one over the other\n\n17\n00:00:52.397 --> 00:00:56.447\nand we wanna make sure that we keep on\ntrack about that, because it's a very\n\n18\n00:00:56.447 --> 00:01:01.052\nimportant topic for us, because of where\nwe tend to use hashing algorithms as well.\n\n19\n00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.556\nSo that's where we're gonna\nbe jumping into today, Wes.\n\n20\n00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:05.400\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhen we talk about hashing algorithms,\n\n21\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.047\nthe one thing that kind of confuses me,\nI've heard this term one-way encryption.\n\n22\n00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:10.815\nWhat does that mean, Ronnie?\n\n23\n00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:13.010\nWhy do they call it a one-way encryption?\n\n24\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.440\n&gt;&gt; When we start talking about\nthe idea of one-way encryption,\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.000\nwe got to realize this is\nnot useful protecting data.\n\n26\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120\nThat's pretty much the key here.\n\n27\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.351\nIt doesn't do us any good to be able to\nencrypt data and not be able to decrypt\n\n28\n00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.983\nit, and that's we don't talk about it as\na one way encryption is the ability to not\n\n29\n00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:33.647\nactually decrypt the data at all, and a\nhashing algorithm is designed to do that.\n\n30\n00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:36.096\nIt's not something they\ndiscovered by accident.\n\n31\n00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:41.369\nIt is designed to make it impossible\nthat once you encrypt the data,\n\n32\n00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.542\nthat you can decrypt the data\nitself as much as we can.\n\n33\n00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:50.730\nNow I would say, the word impossible and\nthat, of course, means absolute, but\n\n34\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.712\nthe reality of things are, is that it's\nas close to impossible as we can get.\n\n35\n00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:58.204\nSo I shouldn't actually\never say an absolute,\n\n36\n00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:01.641\nespecially about cryptography\nthat no one will ever break this.\n\n37\n00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.981\nBecause hashing algorithms have been\nbroken and can be broken, but they were as\n\n38\n00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:09.671\nstrong as they thought that they could\nget it at that point in time and\n\n39\n00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.673\nthat's the key.\n\n40\n00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.808\nSo, that's what we normally talk about.\n\n41\n00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:16.090\nSo, that's kinda the idea behind that.\n\n42\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.794\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, in one of the other episodes\nthat we were discussing, you said,\n\n43\n00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:23.799\nthere were some warnings if you're gonna\nuse a hashing algorithm to use one over\n\n44\n00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.423\nthe other.\n\n45\n00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:25.194\nCan you tell me,\n\n46\n00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:28.294\nwhat are the characteristics of\na successful hashing algorithm?\n\n47\n00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:32.093\nIf I know that I'm gonna use one and I can\nhave a little bit more confidence in it?\n\n48\n00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:37.150\n&gt;&gt; The unusual thing about hashing\nalgorithms and what makes them successful\n\n49\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.483\nis that regardless of the data\ninput size when we run them through\n\n50\n00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:46.080\nthe hashing algorithm, they gave\nus what we call a fixed link hash.\n\n51\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.285\nSo that means that if I have a hash value,\nlet's say that's 20 characters long.\n\n52\n00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:54.031\nI cannot tell by that\nhash value whether or\n\n53\n00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:57.640\nnot it's a hash of a file\nthat's 4 gigabytes in size or\n\n54\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.896\nwhether it's a hash of a file that's well,\nlet's say, 500 bytes in size,\n\n55\n00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:08.154\nbecause they will give me the same exact\n20 characters that will be completely\n\n56\n00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:13.284\ndifferent and that's something that we\nwanna make sure that we understand.\n\n57\n00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:17.880\nSo in other words, the fixed link itself\nis actually what makes it successful.\n\n58\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.093\nBecause you can't tell by going,\ngosh, man, look inside.\n\n59\n00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:24.229\nThat's gotta be a huge amount of data or\n\n60\n00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.290\nthat's gotta be a very\nminute amount of data.\n\n61\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.214\nIt leaves us the idea of uncertainty\nwhen we start to actually build these or\n\n62\n00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:33.769\nwhen we start to see these\nhashing algorithms for\n\n63\n00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.341\nan attacker to be able to\ntake advantage of them.\n\n64\n00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.623\nIt's not gonna be very easy just because\nthey can go, one's 16 characters longer\n\n65\n00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:43.664\nthan the other one and\nthat means that there's a greater size.\n\n66\n00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:46.656\nSo, there's no correlation\nof value that we have.\n\n67\n00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:49.657\nThe other one is that what\nwe have just mentioned\n\n68\n00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:54.019\nright before this is that it is as\nclose as we can get to irreversible.\n\n69\n00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.260\nYou cannot be able to say,\nI can tell from looking at this\n\n70\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.953\nthat I can come up with a value\nthat can then decrypt the hash and\n\n71\n00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:06.946\ngive me the plaintext that\nwent into it very easily.\n\n72\n00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:07.942\nYou can't do that.\n\n73\n00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:13.109\nIf you have the plaintext, you can run\nthe same hashing algorithm against it and\n\n74\n00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.973\nthen hopefully get a match.\n\n75\n00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:19.294\nBut if you don't have the plaintext,\nyou can't take the hash value and\n\n76\n00:04:19.294 --> 00:04:23.411\nstart to reverse that to the point\nwhere it spits out the plaintext.\n\n77\n00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.592\nSo, that is the other\npossibility that we also have.\n\n78\n00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:30.144\nNow once you actually have\nsomething like that, well,\n\n79\n00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:34.237\nthen that's what we all desire and\nthat's what we all hope for.\n\n80\n00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:38.405\nMost hashing algorithms are really\ngood at the irreversible part.\n\n81\n00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:43.369\nThe weakness though, in hashing algorithms\nthat we have to worry about is what we\n\n82\n00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.588\ncall, of course,\nthe idea of hashing collisions.\n\n83\n00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:51.117\nAnd this is where we say that\na successful hashing algorithm,\n\n84\n00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:56.617\nof course is resistant to, well,\ncollisions as we wanna talk right here.\n\n85\n00:04:56.617 --> 00:05:01.459\nSo the idea of a collision,\nthe first time I remembered hearing about,\n\n86\n00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.894\nWes, it sounds exactly like that.\n\n87\n00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:08.850\nThat it collides, but the strange\nthing is that's not really what we\n\n88\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.504\nmean by collision which is strange.\n\n89\n00:05:11.504 --> 00:05:14.559\nSo remember, if you're familiar with this,\nthen you understand it.\n\n90\n00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.888\nBut if this is your first time and we're\nexplaining a little more in depth here.\n\n91\n00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:23.125\nA hash collision is when you can\ndiscover the same exact hash\n\n92\n00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:28.166\nvalue even though the input\nof the data may be different.\n\n93\n00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:30.032\nSo, it's possible.\n\n94\n00:05:30.032 --> 00:05:34.419\nIt doesn't happen very often, but\nyou gotta think about this idea that it\n\n95\n00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.020\nactually can occur even more often,\ndepending on your limitation in terms of\n\n96\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.294\nthe different numbers that you use or\nthe field of values that you used.\n\n97\n00:05:43.294 --> 00:05:48.499\nSo for example, if you have\nthe string of zero through nine,\n\n98\n00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.672\nif those are the only values you use.\n\n99\n00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:55.871\nAt some point, it doesn't matter how\nmany combinations that you do or\n\n100\n00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:57.947\nhow much data that you put into it.\n\n101\n00:05:57.947 --> 00:06:03.164\nThere is a possibility that using all\npossible 10,000 combinations, you're\n\n102\n00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:08.097\ngonna end up with the same value twice at\nsome point and that would be a collision.\n\n103\n00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:10.960\nIn hashing collisions,\nit can happen as well,\n\n104\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.911\nbecause there's a limitation in terms of\nthe field values that you have in place.\n\n105\n00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:20.413\nBut it shouldn't be astronomical, but\nsometimes you do find weaknesses in them,\n\n106\n00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.682\nbecause a field is smaller than we think.\n\n107\n00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:27.264\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, now that we understand some\nof the characteristics of a successful\n\n108\n00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:31.857\nhashing algorithm, are there some of\nthe other things that it provides us?\n\n109\n00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:36.150\nAnd if so, what are some of those\nthings that it helps us accomplish?\n\n110\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.512\n&gt;&gt; Well, the idea that it helps us to\naccomplish really two particular valuable\n\n111\n00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:43.408\nnotions as far as the field\nof cybersecurity goes.\n\n112\n00:06:43.408 --> 00:06:47.675\nOne, it can help us to verify\nthe integrity of the data itself and\n\n113\n00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:52.653\nwhat we mean by that is something that\nif it really does is part of the natural\n\n114\n00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:57.868\nprocess and what we do everyday is that\nif something comes off of my computer and\n\n115\n00:06:57.868 --> 00:07:02.870\ngets sent to you and you're across\nthe internet watching this somewhere.\n\n116\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.711\nWell, how do you know that the data hasn't\nchanged between when it left my computer\n\n117\n00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:09.866\nand when it gets onto your computer?\n\n118\n00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:14.672\nThe way that we can do that is I can\ngo ahead and take that file that I\n\n119\n00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:19.923\nmight be sending to you, and\nI can run it through a hashing algorithm,\n\n120\n00:07:19.923 --> 00:07:23.497\nand then I can have that\nhash value right there.\n\n121\n00:07:23.497 --> 00:07:28.601\nAnd then what you can do is when I send\nyou the file is I can tell you I used\n\n122\n00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:33.793\nMD5 on hashing this file here,\nthen you can run it on your computer and\n\n123\n00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:36.436\nyou can come up with a value as well.\n\n124\n00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:39.604\nNow what we can do at that point\nis either call each other or\n\n125\n00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:43.312\nyou can email me as me and say,\nhere is the hashing value that I got.\n\n126\n00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:45.056\nIs this what you got?\n\n127\n00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:47.395\nAnd then I can compare\nboth of those values.\n\n128\n00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:51.910\nAnd if that is exactly what happens,\nthen you know that whatever left my\n\n129\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.370\ncomputer is exactly the same as what\narrived at your computer as well.\n\n130\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.750\nAnd that is something that we definitely\nwant to make sure of as we continue on.\n\n131\n00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.520\nSo that's what we talk about as verifying\nthe integrity of the data as well, okay?\n\n132\n00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.660\nThe other thing that we also have,\nwhich hashing can help us do,\n\n133\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.270\nis verify the origin of\nthe sending message as well.\n\n134\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.730\nBecause not only can we hash the data\nitself to make sure that the data hasn't\n\n135\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.140\nchanged, but we can also take the same\nthing such as using a public key or\n\n136\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.160\nusing a private key here and\ndigitally sign the actual information.\n\n137\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.600\nSo that way if somebody modifies it,\nwell, that digital value goes away.\n\n138\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.280\nAnd then when that digital signature goes\naway, you can say somebody else has messed\n\n139\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.040\naround with this and it didn't come\nfrom Ronnie, well, then you know.\n\n140\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.610\nSo it really helps us in those\ntwo processes overall, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.240\nThere's one last thing cuz I know that\neven though this is probably the third or\n\n142\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.180\nfourth time I've said it in this series,\nbut\n\n143\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.920\nI wanna make sure that we also understand\nthat the idea of some of the things that's\n\n144\n00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.380\nreally neat about hashing algorithms\nare the things that we mentioned, right?\n\n145\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.670\nThe irreversible nature of it, the idea\nof trying to make sure it's resistant\n\n146\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.960\nto collisions, and the fixed value size.\n\n147\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.960\nBut is also the idea\nof an avalanche effect\n\n148\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.740\nthat we have to take into it as well,\nokay?\n\n149\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.880\nThe very fact that a single minute\nchange in whatever file that I hash,\n\n150\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.380\nit doesn't just change the value by one or\n\n151\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.430\ntwo, it changes the value in an incredible\nway to where it's so different,\n\n152\n00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.945\nthat you don't know if I actually modified\nthe entire contents of the file itself,\n\n153\n00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:39.425\nor did I just add in a period, or did I\nchange a period to an exclamation point.\n\n154\n00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:42.725\nOr whatever it is, you just don't\nknow what that value actually is.\n\n155\n00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:47.295\nSo that avalanche effect is\nanother key aspect that makes you\n\n156\n00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:52.240\nnot have to search number by number\nhere to verify that they match up.\n\n157\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.210\nBut is so startlingly different that\n\n158\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.430\nit really is something that you\ncan visibly see very easily.\n\n159\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.873\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, once I understand\nthe concepts behind it and\n\n160\n00:10:01.873 --> 00:10:05.413\nI understand what my company's needs are,\nand now I need to make a decision.\n\n161\n00:10:05.413 --> 00:10:10.039\nAnd I need to implement some kind of\nhashing algorithm, what's the med here,\n\n162\n00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.015\nwhat option do we have out there?\n\n163\n00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:14.754\n&gt;&gt; And\nthere's a lot of different options and\n\n164\n00:10:14.754 --> 00:10:19.543\nwe're gonna take a look at these from\nthe standpoint of going from the least\n\n165\n00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:24.256\nsecure method to the most secure method\nand talk about the differences and\n\n166\n00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:27.740\nhopefully, show you\nthe differences as well.\n\n167\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.500\nNow, we're not gonna get into the nitty\ngritty mathematical details on it.\n\n168\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.788\nOne, I can't count that well.\n\n169\n00:10:33.788 --> 00:10:38.903\nOkay, so I'm not gonna get that way but\nI can explain some of the process to you.\n\n170\n00:10:38.903 --> 00:10:43.262\nBut overall though we wanna make sure that\nwe understand why we would choose not to\n\n171\n00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:46.656\nuse it and why we would choose to\nuse this, and then show you that\n\n172\n00:10:46.656 --> 00:10:50.710\nthe actual differences by hashing\nthe file and letting us see this.\n\n173\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.271\nSo let's go ahead and start off here and\n\n174\n00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:56.925\ntalk about the least secure\none that we have now, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:56.925 --> 00:10:59.362\nThere is one called MD5, okay, MD5.\n\n176\n00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:04.349\nNow, MD5 stands for Merkle–Davidman or\nsomething like that.\n\n177\n00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:06.678\nI always thought it stood for\nmessage digestive, but\n\n178\n00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:09.883\nthe more that I looked it up, the more\nI realize it actually is an algorithm\n\n179\n00:11:09.883 --> 00:11:12.120\nthat came from a couple\nof different people.\n\n180\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.610\nBut that's not the important part, right?\n\n181\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.650\nSo, now like a Spaceballs movie,\nbut that's not important now.\n\n182\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.360\nOr Airplane instead.\n\n183\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.560\nSo, MD5, right?\n\n184\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.010\nThe reason why this particular\nalgorithm pretty much came out\n\n185\n00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.340\nis because of inherent weaknesses in\nprevious versions called, well, MD4,\n\n186\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.060\nis what we also ended up seeing.\n\n187\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.030\nThere was an improvement to\nthe way that MD4 operated.\n\n188\n00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.050\nMD4 had an unusual way of\ndoing certain things and\n\n189\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.600\nthey found out that right away,\nonce they implemented it,\n\n190\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.930\ncracks started to happen in\nthe mathematical foundation of MD4.\n\n191\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.000\nSo MD5 changed it and the way that\nthey changed it is by increasing\n\n192\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.800\nthe length of the field size that\nthey actually ended up using.\n\n193\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.498\nSo in other words,\nthey said, look, here is\n\n194\n00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:07.473\nthe possible number of hash values that\nyou can have and it's insanely big, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:07.473 --> 00:12:11.564\nBut, at the same time,\nsome of the things that they didn't change\n\n196\n00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:16.165\nis also what led to their kind,\nI won't say downfall, but it lead to them,\n\n197\n00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:20.670\nin the future here, discovering,\nwell, hashing collisions, okay?\n\n198\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.187\nSo it too now is considered something that\nyou don't want to end up using, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.050\nIn anything that we do\ntoday on a production hour.\n\n200\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.530\nIn a lab environment, you'll still see it.\n\n201\n00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.190\nNow, one of the strange things about\nthe MD5, even though it's considered\n\n202\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.590\nbroken today and something you\ndon't want to use in production.\n\n203\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:44.815\nA lot of Cisco routers still have\nyour enable secret password,\n\n204\n00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:48.373\nor your secret passwords default to MD5.\n\n205\n00:12:48.373 --> 00:12:51.290\nDoesn't mean all of them will.\n\n206\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.418\nI think some of the Version 15's\nhave it default to something else.\n\n207\n00:12:55.418 --> 00:13:00.630\nBut overall though, you'll still see\nsome of the older ones out there,\n\n208\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.688\nespecially those running version 12 and\nhigher.\n\n209\n00:13:04.688 --> 00:13:08.390\nThey default to MD5, because at that\npoint, even though it was on the verge,\n\n210\n00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.180\nit was still relatively secure.\n\n211\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.834\nBut today though, if you run 15,\nyou may end up seeing where,\n\n212\n00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:18.573\nsome of them will still support MD5, a lot\nof them support newer hashing values for\n\n213\n00:13:18.573 --> 00:13:21.435\nsecuring your enabled passwords as well,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:25.070\nSo, especially if you\nuse the enable secret.\n\n215\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.170\nSo normally, we don't want to see this.\n\n216\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.300\nNow, if you do see it inside of\nan environment in which you have\n\n217\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.860\nall the other security measures,\nthen you're probably fine, right?\n\n218\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.750\nAs long as you have the limitations\nthat you need to set up.\n\n219\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.520\nNot everybody is able to\nget exposure to that.\n\n220\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.460\nJust like the idea of routers,\nyou don't want everybody coming by and\n\n221\n00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.960\nlogging into the router.\n\n222\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.550\nSo, as long as you know the handful of\npeople that are logging into your router\n\n223\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.420\nand setting that up,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n224\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.280\nyou don't have to worry about it too much.\n\n225\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.680\nBut it is kind of that situation\n\n226\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.360\nwhich do you need to actually\nunderstand what's going on here.\n\n227\n00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.080\nIf you use this in a production\nenvironment, in which it's gonna be\n\n228\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.370\nexposed constantly, it's not\nsomething you want to do, all right?\n\n229\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.190\nSo let's take a look at the way and\n\n230\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.320\nthe value of this that's\ngonna help us out, okay?\n\n231\n00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.870\nSo with MD5, here's how it actually looks.\n\n232\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.070\nOn my computer,\nI'm gonna hash a file for us.\n\n233\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.964\nSo inside of the documents folder,\nI just created one called ShowFile, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:23.710\nIt doesn't matter what's in it.\n\n235\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.510\nI'm not even gonna tell you, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.070\nSo that way you can see\nthe differences in this.\n\n237\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:33.258\nSo if I run, not sha, MD5,\n\n238\n00:14:33.258 --> 00:14:38.120\nsum, ShowFile,\n\n239\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.310\nI want you take a look at the output here,\nokay?\n\n240\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.540\nSo that is something that I am\nnever going to memorize, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.650\nI just can't do it.\n\n242\n00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.000\nIt looks like a very long number to me,\nWes?\n\n243\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.610\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue.\n\n244\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.721\nIn looking at it I'd like to say Pat,\ncan I buy a vowel.\n\n245\n00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.720\nSo it really looks relatively long,\n\n247\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.730\nsomething that you're not gonna\neasily kind of break through.\n\n248\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.520\nBut remember that, you and\nI are not the ones that are running and\n\n249\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.370\ntrying to check this value, right?\n\n250\n00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.138\nSo I don't have a calculator.\n\n251\n00:15:08.138 --> 00:15:12.055\nI don't have a sheet of paper and\ntrying to figure this out.\n\n252\n00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:14.380\nWho's doing this and\nwhy would it be considered insecure?\n\n253\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.050\nNow, if was the only one doing this,\nthis is 100% secure, okay?\n\n254\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.000\nRonnie, in his entire lifetime will never\n\n255\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.170\nfigure out what this value actually\nmeans at all, never, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.280\nBut because of computers today and\nthe speed and\n\n257\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.900\nthe power of computers today,\nthis is not sufficient, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.650\nWhy?\nCuz they calculate billions of cycles\n\n259\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.570\nper second, not Ronnie's two or\nmaybe one per second.\n\n260\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.564\nAnd sometimes,\nnot even one per second when I'm thinking.\n\n261\n00:15:43.564 --> 00:15:47.240\nSo you gotta realize that that\nis kind of the key in nature.\n\n262\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.147\nSo I want you to take a look\nat the output of this.\n\n263\n00:15:50.147 --> 00:15:54.112\nAs we start to look at more secure ones,\nwe'll show you what the difference and\n\n264\n00:15:54.112 --> 00:15:57.110\nwe'll see if you can spot them here,\ntoo, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.860\nSo, this particular weakness really\nhas to do with the limited size\n\n266\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.920\nthat it can generate as far\nas the hashes go, okay?\n\n267\n00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.310\nThat is one that we really\ndon't want to have in place.\n\n268\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.840\nNow what really started\nreplacing this then, of course,\n\n269\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.510\nis one that was called SHA, or shaw,\nright, Secure Hashing Algorithm.\n\n270\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.380\nNow its original structure itself,\n\n271\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:26.760\ntoo Is actually one that you do not\nwant to use anymore as well, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.460\nThe idea with SHA, this came up\nas being a good replacement for,\n\n273\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.382\nwell, MD5 here.\n\n274\n00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:39.800\nAfter awhile,\nit too showed a very solid limitation, and\n\n275\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.770\nit was vulnerable to collisions as\nwell where they were able to prove in\n\n276\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.080\nlaboratory environments and then\nmathematical environments here that they\n\n277\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.310\ncould absolutely get through\nSHA in the same way.\n\n278\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.890\nOnce again, it was that limitation\nof the size and In the field here.\n\n279\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.810\nNow, there is a confusion that\ngoes on here on the west, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.420\nSo on the exam and\non the exam objectives for\n\n281\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.310\nthe Cisco Cyber Security,\nthey specifically call out SHA1, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.280\nThat is different than Shaw,\nyou've got to know that, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.200\nSHA1 and SHA are two different algorithms.\n\n284\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.760\nNow one is actually designed, of course,\n\n285\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.490\nto fix some of the inherent flaws that\nwere in SHA, but they are different.\n\n286\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.970\nSo, you may actually see it\nlisted as SHA0 or SHA1, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say Ronnie, I've also\nheard it called SHA1, SHA1 called SHA160.\n\n288\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.660\nCan you help me out with that?\n\n289\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.010\nWhat does that SHA160 mean?\n\n290\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all this is about the idea,\nthe bit length that they use here, so\n\n291\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.920\nboth SHA and SHA1 use 160 bit length,\n\n292\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.195\nand that means here is the bits that they\nuse to generate this value here, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:51.430\nBase of 160 binary bits\n\n294\n00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.830\nis what they normally end up doing here,\nso even they are not, right?\n\n295\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.900\nSo, if you go, well, how big is that?\n\n296\n00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.217\n2 to the 160th, well,\nit's 160 1s and 0s, and\n\n297\n00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:05.261\ntry to come with every single\ncombination of that and\n\n298\n00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:08.950\nyou'll see it's a pretty long\nnumber is what it comes down to.\n\n299\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.928\nEven then, it's not sufficient enough\nto where they were not able to crack\n\n300\n00:18:13.928 --> 00:18:18.907\nthrough that and actually being able\nto use some mathematical equations to\n\n301\n00:18:18.907 --> 00:18:20.738\nfind hashing algorithms.\n\n302\n00:18:20.738 --> 00:18:24.245\nIt's really funny here as far as\nthe map that this goes, right?\n\n303\n00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:28.460\nSHA itself, it's because it did\neverything by the rule book, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.060\nAccording to the way that they did\nthe map, they did exactly the town\n\n305\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.800\nmathematical principles of\neverything they needed to do.\n\n306\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:43.270\nThey realized something that hackers know\nwhat sound mathematical principles too.\n\n307\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.590\nThey're like, all right, so\nif I run this through and\n\n308\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.880\ndo this, when I run this through and\ndo this, I can get these values.\n\n309\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.960\nI can come up with these same values,\nI can figure some of this stuff out.\n\n310\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.926\nThat's exactly what they did,\nthey were able to do that,\n\n311\n00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:58.930\nbut SHA1 is different,\nalmost exactly the same, yes.\n\n312\n00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.220\nThey said, look, right here in the middle\nin one of these processes that you run\n\n313\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:10.130\nthrough we're going to clock the actual\nbit-wise way rotation that it does.\n\n314\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.680\nIn other words, it's changing.\n\n315\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.980\nInstead of doing this one first we're\ngoing to jump over here and do this and\n\n316\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.400\nthen we'll come back and\ndo this one instead.\n\n317\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.820\nSo, that's all it really did.\n\n318\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.760\nIt really did just change one\nof those values And it says, so\n\n319\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.590\ninstead of going one, two, three, four,\nfive, it says, we're gonna do one, two,\n\n320\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.640\nfive, and then four and\nthree, and continue on.\n\n321\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.890\nSo it just kinda jumbled up\nthe middle bits a little bit.\n\n322\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.280\nStill the exact same thing, but\n\n323\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.565\nthat actually made a difference in trying\nto figure out the collisions that I have.\n\n324\n00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:44.290\nSHA-1 today Even though at that\npoint when was no it's not,\n\n325\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:51.130\nthis is not acceptable to hashing\ncollisions, of course to day it is, okay?\n\n326\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.735\nSo January 2017, January 1st is Not used\nto sign digital certificates anymore.\n\n327\n00:19:55.735 --> 00:20:00.435\nSo you do not want to use\nif you do not have to,\n\n328\n00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:03.455\nin doing digital signature\ntypes of things, okay.\n\n329\n00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:06.165\nSo it is deprecated in today's world.\n\n330\n00:20:06.165 --> 00:20:08.945\nNow, let's show you a difference\nhere when we start to look.\n\n331\n00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:14.590\nSo if I type in Sum Showfile.\n\n332\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.190\nNow, Wes, if you take a look at\nthe differences here, here is the original\n\n333\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.740\nMD5, can you see a pattern\nemerging here by comparison?\n\n334\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah one of the things I noticed\nis it looks like your fixed values\n\n335\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.890\nare a lot longer than the MD5,\n\n336\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.840\nthe old layer one that you ran\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n337\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.700\nyou're starting to notice something about\nthe way that they do this idea of math and\n\n338\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.190\nhow they make it more complicated.\n\n339\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.910\nThey're not really making\nit more complicated.\n\n340\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.700\nThey're making it a lot bigger.\n\n341\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.020\nSo in other words the string goes up from\nwhatever the field values were for MD5.\n\n342\n00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.820\nLet's say it was 60 bits and I don't\nknow Somebody will probably send in and\n\n343\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.520\ncorrect me on this, but\nwhatever the size is is fine.\n\n344\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.140\nBut, then, when you go up to 160,\nnotice it added on a lot more characters\n\n345\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.708\nby comparison to the md5 value\nthat we have up here, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:07.420\nSo, this is Was actually a good\nstep in the right direction but\n\n347\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.110\neven today in 2017,\nit is not sufficient anymore okay?\n\n348\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.970\nSo we need to actually move up.\n\n349\n00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.594\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie you and I know you've\nalready told us that is something\n\n350\n00:21:17.594 --> 00:21:20.970\nwe shouldn't be using but comparing it to\n&gt;&gt; To the predecessor MD5, and\n\n351\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.490\nthat relationship here.\n\n352\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.380\nIs it safe to say that what it's doing\nis it's adding more possibilities,\n\n353\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.900\nmore possibilities meaning it's gonna take\na little bit longer to hack or provide\n\n354\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.230\nthose collisions, and like I said, I know\nyou've said they've already done that, but\n\n355\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.330\ncomparative to like the older technology,\nyou're giving more possibilities.\n\n356\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's what it comes down to.\n\n357\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.440\nIs Shaw1 much more secure than MD5.\n\n358\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:44.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n359\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.570\nIs Shah 1 broken?\n\n360\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.210\nYes.\n\n361\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.330\nIs Shah 0 broken?\n\n362\n00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.910\nYes.\n\n363\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.850\nIs MD5 broken?\n\n364\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.550\nYes.\n\n365\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.975\nSo yeah if you want to compare the idea of\none being more secure than the The other,\n\n366\n00:21:57.975 --> 00:22:01.385\nbut all of them are still\nconsidered in today's world, right,\n\n367\n00:22:01.385 --> 00:22:05.195\nnot something you would wanna use inside\na production, and that's the key, okay?\n\n368\n00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:06.255\nAll right, so\n\n369\n00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:10.725\nthe next one that we are going to take\na look at here of course, is SHA256.\n\n370\n00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:16.725\nNow this is also another confusing one\nthat we have to kind of deal with.\n\n371\n00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:22.350\nBecause sometimes, instead of\nhearing like SHA256, and SHA512,\n\n372\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:28.000\nYou hear that a family it's\ncalled show 2 as well okay,\n\n373\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.810\nso it doesnt go for\nlike show0,show1,show2,and show256.\n\n374\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:40.000\nShow2 implements like a family of six\nalgorithms and included in that is show256\n\n375\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.600\nokay, Show256 is prior the one that\nwe now consider the idea of secure.\n\n376\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.540\n&gt;&gt; In our environment that we use today.\n\n377\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.470\nNow this type of algorithm, if we're going\nto do this, right, is used to help us to\n\n378\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.990\nmake sure that we can secure things\nlike very sensitive information for us.\n\n379\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.510\nAnd it is collision resistant.\n\n380\n00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:06.800\nAnd the reason why is now this\nis such a gigantic field size\n\n381\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.820\nit really can take a lifetime for you\nto crack through This particular value.\n\n382\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.290\nNow just when I say that,\nare people figuring out more and more with\n\n383\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.900\nsuper computers that they're able to buy\nand build and home using, what is it,\n\n384\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.610\nthe game consoles.Why can't I remember\nwhat those game consoles are called.\n\n385\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.210\nThe Sony PlayStations and stuff like that.\n\n386\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.600\nWhere they're able to come together, and\nreally literally build a super computer.\n\n387\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.045\nYeah they're starting to get further and\nfurther down in time and it's showing\n\n388\n00:23:36.045 --> 00:23:40.752\nsomething, that there is progress being\nmade here, but at the same time it's still\n\n389\n00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:45.218\nsufficiently high enough where we can\nstill use it for sensitive information.\n\n390\n00:23:45.218 --> 00:23:50.955\nSo if you want to start of with what is\nconsidered secure, this is where you and\n\n391\n00:23:50.955 --> 00:23:56.003\nI would Begin to talk on the idea of\nsecurity as far as the level goes.\n\n392\n00:23:56.003 --> 00:23:57.437\nIt's right here.\n\n393\n00:23:57.437 --> 00:24:00.560\nNow, each one of these,\nthere's a couple of draw backs, right?\n\n394\n00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.550\nThe higher you go the more\nthat you have to compute here.\n\n395\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.500\n256 is talking on the Bit Link that\nthey are using to generate this hatches.\n\n396\n00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.010\nWell, remember that this also\nrequires more CPU, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.000\nSo it takes longer to actually encrypt and\nto do all that stuff as well.\n\n398\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.510\nSo just be aware that this does have some\ncost in terms of compute cycles, okay?\n\n399\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.320\nSo if I do a sha256sum,\nsame thing, same exact file.\n\n400\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.490\nNow, notice the difference here,\nWes, by comparison.\n\n401\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:37.820\nSo it almost adds in like the entire link\nof MD5 as far as the output value goes.\n\n402\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.360\nBut you can see where now this is\nactually much more generous and\n\n403\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.880\nthe sizes are actually what gives us\nthe ability to have less possibilities of\n\n404\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.670\ncollisions that happen.\n\n405\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nI'm gonna do my Sith philosophy here, and\n\n406\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.310\nnotice that you haven't mentioned\ntoo many absolutes in this show.\n\n407\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.380\nIs that because in this point in time,\n256 is secure?\n\n408\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.970\nBut who knows in ten years?\n\n409\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:07.080\n&gt;&gt; That is the key is that we can only\nmake it as secure as we can at this point.\n\n410\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.020\nSo to say that it's absolutely secure,\n\n411\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.040\nwe can be like the early ones say\nabsolutely and then six months later\n\n412\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.480\nsomebody's proven that they've been\nrunning this against a machine for 24\n\n413\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.280\nhours a day for seven weeks and they were\nable to actually generate a collision.\n\n414\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.680\nAnd the problem is they\ndon't notify you about it.\n\n415\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.880\nThey notify you when they decide\nthey're gonna publish it today.\n\n416\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.620\nAnd that's when there's problems\nthat continue to exist out there.\n\n417\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.286\nSo that means, of course,\nthen there is SHA-512.\n\n418\n00:25:34.286 --> 00:25:38.030\nSHA-512, for us, is secure and normally,\n\n419\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.890\nif we're gonna do any type of\nclassified information that we\n\n420\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.210\nhave to generate the hash value to,\nthat's the one that we want, okay?\n\n421\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.380\nBecause that is gonna be one that's\nGonna be much higher value for us.\n\n422\n00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.650\nIt's slower, it does take longer to\nencrypt as well as to, I don't wanna\n\n423\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.940\nsay decrypt, but to generate another hash\nvalue against, if we're going to do this.\n\n424\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.970\nBut just kinda realize that\nthis particular bit link is so\n\n425\n00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:07.480\nbig, it really can take a lifetime,\nin theory, for that to happen.\n\n426\n00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.830\nNow let's take a look here because this\none to me is actually impressive as well\n\n427\n00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.960\n12sum and show file again\n\n428\n00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:20.170\nthis one take a line in a half,\nis what literally takes out.\n\n429\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.710\nSo now, remember, the idea that's field\nside right that's the key were as you and\n\n430\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.610\nI, ten years ago even though might say,\nlook, that's not super secure,\n\n431\n00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.930\nbut it's secure enough for most computer.\n\n432\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.540\nIt'd take a long time and by that point if\nyou're following good password security,\n\n433\n00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.600\nif you're passwords by storing it and\nyou're storing that,\n\n434\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.170\nwell, then most people will\nchange them after a while.\n\n435\n00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.670\nBut then as continue to\nmove forward though and\n\n436\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.400\nmachines start to get bigger and\nbigger and faster, a much more powerful,\n\n437\n00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.590\neven these values are starting to\nkind of show a little bit of age, but\n\n438\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.860\nthat's part of the processes that you\nhave to keep ahead of that curve.\n\n439\n00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.140\nSo, wherever there start in flying attack,\nyou again increase the value size,\n\n440\n00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:10.880\nand so 512 here, you can see now\nthat is considerably longer, okay?\n\n441\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.520\nAnd this value itself is kinda the key.\n\n442\n00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.510\nHashing collisions,\ncan they possibly happen?\n\n443\n00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.790\nYes, okay?\n\n444\n00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.210\nBut the possibilities at this point are so\n\n445\n00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:27.120\nremote, that they're saying,\nif you happen to get it, okay?\n\n446\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.220\nMore than likely, it's luck rather\nthan anything else that's caused.\n\n447\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.160\nWhat you're actually going to see here,\nthat app, okay?\n\n448\n00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.640\nAnd there are certain things that they're\ntrying to do to manipulate things\n\n449\n00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.480\nthat make this work, but\nat this point, this link value is\n\n450\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.300\nin that realm of the almost impossible.\n\n451\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.820\nYeah, I would love to say absolutely,\nyou can't crack that.\n\n452\n00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.450\nAnd two years from now, they're\neating this for lunch for all I know.\n\n453\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.730\nBut that's kinda the idea, okay?\n\n454\n00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.030\nSo just realize that this is what you're\nstarting to see is that on all these\n\n455\n00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:04.970\nhashing algorithms, as much as they\nare susceptible to collisions.\n\n456\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.780\nNow, the longer the bit length,\nthe less susceptible that they are, okay.\n\n457\n00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.200\nThey shorter that they are,\n\n458\n00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.730\nthe more susceptible they\nare to the idea of collisions.\n\n459\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.680\nUnderstanding where hashing is used,\nnot to encrypt data but\n\n460\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.100\nto give us verification of\nthe integrity of the data and\n\n461\n00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.200\nof the origin of the data,\ngreat place to use hashing algorithms but\n\n462\n00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.920\nnot to try and encrypt data in itself,\nthat's not a good use of this.\n\n463\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.400\nBecause if you encrypt it and\nsend it over to Wes, Wes,\n\n464\n00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.270\ncan look at it and go great,\nwhat am I supposed to do with it.\n\n465\n00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.740\nWell, that's exactly it, how do you know?\n\n466\n00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.560\nSo that is kind of where we are in\nunderstanding at least the use and\n\n467\n00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.320\nof course, some of the impacts\nof the way that hashing works.\n\n468\n00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.250\nSo when you take a look at the idea of\ncryptography suites altogether, right?\n\n469\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.320\nYou need to make sure that you understand\nthat pretty much anything with sha1 and\n\n470\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.540\nmd5 is probably not something\nyou wanna use in production.\n\n471\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.720\nAnd the reason again,\nis smaller field sizes lead to possibility\n\n472\n00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.360\nof more collisions which is something\nthat you've got to realize which means,\n\n473\n00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.890\nthere's a more than a good chance\nthat a compromise can happen there,\n\n474\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:20.340\nlonger bit link means less compromise\ncuz you've got a greater field size\n\n475\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.240\nin hash values that they\ncan possibly come up with.\n\n476\n00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.740\nSo you wanna use those instead.\n\n477\n00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.050\n&gt;&gt; All right that's a lot of great\ninformation, Ronnie, in fact so\n\n478\n00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.590\ngreat I need to go check out the security\nconfiguration documentation on\n\n479\n00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.470\neveryone of my connectivity devices.\n\n480\n00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:34.296\nMy web server and\n\n481\n00:29:34.296 --> 00:29:37.842\nmost importantly change the password\non every single bit of my log ins.\n\n482\n00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now,\n\n483\n00:29:39.229 --> 00:29:41.520\nit does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, Ronnie.\n\n484\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.190\nBut before we do, do you have any final\nwords on using secure hashing algorithms?\n\n485\n00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember that the use of\nit may not be decided by you and\n\n486\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.670\nme where technical implementation\nof it is what we're gonna do.\n\n487\n00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:58.130\nI do but decision hasn't come\nfrom good sound understanding of\n\n488\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.440\nthe basis of these our real term that\nwe didn't get into all the math and\n\n489\n00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.660\nhow's it done and\ngenerated, can you do that?\n\n490\n00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.090\nYes but\noverall though what we want to do is if\n\n491\n00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.320\nwe're asked opinion about\nrecommendation right.\n\n492\n00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.440\nShah 1, MD5 should not be\nconsidered a recommendation\n\n493\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:22.480\nwhereas 256 and 512 more than likely\na better recommendation for what we need.\n\n494\n00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n495\n00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.580\nA wealth of information there.\n\n496\n00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.620\nThank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us and\n\n497\n00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.810\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n498\n00:30:28.810

Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on to take a look at more.\n\n13\n00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:42.389\nIn terms of Cisco cybersecurity,\nwhat we're doing today of course,\n\n14\n00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.726\nis really dive into understanding a little\nmore about the encryption algorithms and\n\n15\n00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:48.268\nthose different protocols.\n\n16\n00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:51.216\nThat we need to have a fairly\ndecent understanding,\n\n17\n00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.770\nof why we would choose to use them and\nwhy we wouldn't use them.\n\n18\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.684\nWe're going to begin by defining some\nterms that we need to understand.\n\n19\n00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:03.371\nWe can talk a little bit about the history\nand then we're going to go ahead and\n\n20\n00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:07.187\ntalk about the impact, as well as some\nof the recommendations that we can see.\n\n21\n00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:10.439\nWe'll describe that idea of the\nrecommendations according to the way that\n\n22\n00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.399\nCisco would normally list them out for\nus, so\n\n23\n00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.790\nwe'll be able to see\nthe whole full impact.\n\n24\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.920\nSo, let's begin with this idea\nof the terminology, right?\n\n25\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.380\nEverybody that's in the cybersecurity\nworld, we need to at least understand some\n\n26\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.975\nof the basic terms that you're gonna\nhear when it comes down to cryptography.\n\n27\n00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:28.580\nCherokee, let's go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.680\ntalk about some of those terms\nthat we need to understand.\n\n29\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.276\nThe first one that we have\navailable to us is the idea of,\n\n30\n00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:37.940\nwhat do we mean by when we start\ntalking about an encryption algorithm?\n\n31\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.230\nAnd then we'll talk about\na crypto system altogether.\n\n32\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah, Ronnie.\n\n33\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.960\nA cryptographic algorithm is a cipher and\na cipher is going to be\n\n34\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.220\na mathematical function that's used\nto encrypt and to decrypt messages.\n\n35\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.720\nSo if sometimes we don't want\neveryone to understand or\n\n36\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.500\nsee what it is that we are Communicating,\nso that's why we would go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.430\nuse a cryptographic algorithm.\n\n38\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.200\nWhen we're looking at cryptography,\nit really all boils down to maps.\n\n39\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.880\nSo you'll see that quite\na bit in this field.\n\n40\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nthere's a slide that we've created here.\n\n41\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.910\nLet's go ahead and walk through this,\ncuz that really does lead us into\n\n42\n00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.620\nThis idea of the system\nthat you're talking about,\n\n43\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.640\nsince it's based on the idea of\nmath here as for as the algorithms.\n\n44\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure, if you look at this,\ndon't let it scare you at all.\n\n45\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260\nYou're not gonna do too much math\nhere today, it's not required.\n\n46\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.580\nBut Ronnie and I have spoken in the past\nabout what Encryption is, right?\n\n47\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.810\nWhen we're taking our\nPlaintext We're applying a key, and\n\n48\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.820\nthat's going to jumble and\nencrypt that message, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.980\nSo, the output of that\nis called my ciphertext.\n\n50\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.980\nWell, let's say I wanted\nto send Ronnie an email,\n\n51\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.900\nso now that I wanna send him that message\nencrypted during the transmission.\n\n52\n00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840\nMy cipher text is being transmitted.\n\n53\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.510\nWhen Ronnie receives it, well, he can't\nunderstand all that cipher text, so\n\n54\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.850\nwhat is he going to do?\n\n55\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.460\nHe's going to apply the key depending\non if we're using asymmetric or\n\n56\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.530\nsymmetrical encryption, which we've\nspoke about in previous episodes.\n\n57\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.610\nIf you haven't seen that, check it out and\nthat way he'll be able to extract and,\n\n58\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.530\nwell, decipher by applying that cipher or\nthat key,\n\n59\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.050\nthat algorithm To the message, so\nthat he in fact can view that output.\n\n60\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.950\nAnd if you look right below it on the left\nhand side, that's just the mathematical\n\n61\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.280\nrepresentation of this process for\nthe encryption side.\n\n62\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.490\nNormally it's broken into\nthose two separations.\n\n63\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.960\nthere's those two functions,\nyou have you're encryption and\n\n64\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.610\nyou have your decryption.\n\n65\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.650\nAnd that's just the key to show you\nwhat the letters are representing there.\n\n66\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.160\nAnd Cherokee, we also have on\nthis slide the term protocol.\n\n67\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.130\nSo why is this one here?\n\n68\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.530\n&gt;&gt; So this one is here because\nyou'll hear protocols and protocols,\n\n69\n00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.270\nwe've talked about it.\n\n70\n00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.400\nYou've heard about it.\n\n71\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.060\nProtocols are gonna be a series\nof steps involving two or\n\n72\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.020\nmore parties designed to accomplish tasks.\n\n73\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.020\nWhy is that important?\n\n74\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.440\nWell, Certain things sometimes have to\nhappen in a certain sequential order\n\n75\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.010\nto ensure the security of that data.\n\n76\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.150\nWhether it's being transmitted.\n\n77\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.900\nWhether it's being stored.\n\n78\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.700\nSo we need to adhere to certain protocol.\n\n79\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.280\nSometimes, you're even required\nby regulatory standards.\n\n80\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.990\nAnd they enforce those\nprotocols to be used.\n\n81\n00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.000\nJust to make sure that you are performing\ndue diligence, and making.\n\n82\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.830\nTaking the best steps to ensure the\nprivacy, like HIPAA, for instance, right?\n\n83\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.470\nYou wanna make sure that that\npatient's information is secure.\n\n84\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.700\nSo there might be some protocols\nset forth for you to adhere to.\n\n85\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does make sense that\nall this has to go into the activation\n\n86\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.280\nof that Cryptosystem, right?\n\n87\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.350\nNot only do we have, of course,\nthe idea of encrypting and\n\n88\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.070\ndecrypting We need to make sure\nthat we follow the standards and\n\n89\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.270\nguidelines that are available, so\nthat we can securely transmit that data.\n\n90\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.010\nAnd notice the way that this is described\nhere, series of steps, involving two or\n\n91\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.740\nmore parties,\ndesigned to accomplish this task.\n\n92\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.510\nSo it's not just about me being\nable to encrypt the data,\n\n93\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.690\nit's about making sure that only\nthe person on the other end\n\n94\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.340\ncan decrypt the data,\nwhen we want them to decrypt it as well.\n\n95\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.200\nSo it is a big part of it when we start\nto take a look at the idea of decrypting\n\n96\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.820\nsystems, as well as\nthe algorithms themselves.\n\n97\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.910\nAnd we also want to talk about the idea\nof being able to some crypt analysis.\n\n98\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.160\nSo what do we mean by this?\n\n99\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.640\nSure, so you're gonna have,\ncrypt analysis is the science\n\n100\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.110\nof recovering plain text of\nthe message Without the key.\n\n101\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.970\nSo crackers,\npeople who are breaking code, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.150\nThat's what we're talking about here.\n\n103\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.940\nThere are a couple different ways\nyou can extract that message.\n\n104\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.970\nIf you extract it without\nactually cracking that key,\n\n105\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.670\nthen that it is going to be\nthe non-cryptic is called a compromise.\n\n106\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.780\nAlright just for reference there and\nthen if someone tries to\n\n107\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.150\ncryptographically break that key, that is\ncalled an attack so just be aware of that\n\n108\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.720\nand that's something do really need to be\nconcerned with today's society, Ronnie.\n\n109\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes so when we start to take a look\nright at the idea of doing the analysis or\n\n110\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.890\ncryptanalysis.\n\n111\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.810\nIt really is key for us, right?\n\n112\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.760\nThat we have people able to break\ncodes and the problem with that as\n\n113\n00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.480\nwell is that we have attackers\nwilling to break the code as well.\n\n114\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.550\nWe need to be able to decipher things.\n\n115\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.240\nWe need to be able to decrypt\nthings that we need unhidden.\n\n116\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.980\nBut at the same time,\nwe don't want somebody to actually,\n\n117\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.650\nI won't say uncrypt,\ndecrypt Well, my stuff right.\n\n118\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a hard balance to try and\n\n119\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.820\nkeep in mind, but the study of that of\ncourse is the idea of using the analysis\n\n120\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.580\ntools that are available and\nunderstand the math and the background and\n\n121\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.300\nif you're great at math, all that\nwe're doing is really just massacring-\n\n122\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Right up your alley.\n\n123\n00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, your-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're laughing at us though.\n\n124\n00:06:41.073 --> 00:06:43.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're definitely not impressed by\n\n125\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.060\nmathematical skills at this point.\n\n126\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.770\nBut just kind of realise that\nThat it is involved, right?\n\n127\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.760\nThat all of this is,\nis part of that entire process.\n\n128\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.580\nSo let's go back a little bit and talk\nsome of the history of how this is been\n\n129\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.880\naccomplished and we're gonna give a very,\nvery short and brief history of this.\n\n130\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.970\nBut when it comes down to it let's\ntalk about that word cryptography for\n\n131\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.400\na moment and then we'll talk about some\nof the ways it's been accomplished\n\n132\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.690\nAs far as the earliest\ncryptosystems that we have.\n\n133\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.790\nSo when we break down\nthe word cryptography itself,\n\n134\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.070\nit's a Greek word if you want to.\n\n135\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.630\nThe idea of crypto and\n\n136\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.250\nthen the Greek word verb here graphine or\ngraphfine when you do it.\n\n137\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.910\nCrypto of course means hidden and the idea\nof graphy as the idea of writing in Greek.\n\n138\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.460\nSo the idea of hidden writing\nis what it breaks down to.\n\n139\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.630\nAnd that is because cryptography has\nbeen around for thousands of years and\n\n140\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.270\nused all over the entire world\nusing different crypto systems.\n\n141\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.250\nJust like what Cherokee has explained.\n\n142\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.600\nAnd we wanna make sure that we have\nat least a brief history of that.\n\n143\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.970\nSo what's some of the earliest ones\nthat we can talk about, Cherokee?\n\n144\n00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.603\n&gt;&gt; Well, you asked about the earliest.\n\n145\n00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:53.685\nI forget the exact term for\nthe actual tool that they made.\n\n146\n00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:58.821\nBut different Tribes and\nthey will take these sticks with\n\n147\n00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:04.490\na certain diameter with a little\npiece of leather on it.\n\n148\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.280\nAnd depending on the diameter of\nthe leather they will etch characters and\n\n149\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.140\nwrap a stick around that.\n\n150\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.020\nBut we've progressed.\n\n151\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.760\nSo we're moving forward here in time and\n\n152\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.960\nwe don't have to use that any more but\nlet's go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.970\ntake a look at different types\nof we hear this word cypher.\n\n154\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.530\nSo you said that's our key.\n\n155\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.030\nSo you might hear different terms being\nused explaining different types of\n\n156\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.980\ncyphers.\n\n157\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.710\nSo You might hear the word,\nstream cipher versus block cipher, right?\n\n158\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, Cherokee, even though we're\ngoing to get into that in a moment.\n\n159\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.740\nWhen we talk about some of the earliest\ntype of cryptosystems, right?\n\n160\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.670\nWe can talk about transposition and\nsubstitution more than anything else.\n\n161\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.010\nCuz those are probably the earliest ones\nthat we can really think about here.\n\n162\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.850\nSo let's take a look\nbefore we get into that.\n\n163\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Before it was applied in computing.\n\n164\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.620\nBecause this has been around\nbefore even computers were around,\n\n165\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.130\nlike hundreds-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n166\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.930\nthat's what we're talking about\nhere in terms of history.\n\n167\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.960\nSo let's take a look here on the screen.\n\n168\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.800\nCherokee, the idea\nthe transposition cypher is what?\n\n169\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Transposition is pretty simple.\n\n170\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.770\nYou're just transposing.\n\n171\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.420\nI say it's just simple,\nit can be very very complex.\n\n172\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.260\nThere are a lot of different\ntransposition cyphers available but\n\n173\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.910\nIn the most simplistic form,\nwhich you guys just need to know for\n\n174\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.790\nthis exam,\nis what does transposition mean?\n\n175\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.270\nWell, here, I took my name, and\nI'm moving the order of things about.\n\n176\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.150\nSo, if I take the second number and\n\n177\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.280\nreplace the order followed by the first\nnumber, we've got the H to the C.\n\n178\n00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.746\nAnd then, if I do that again with\nthe E and the R, it goes to E,\n\n179\n00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:30.550\nR there, or wait a second.\n\n180\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.040\nIt should be RE\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah that was my typing ability.\n\n181\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.500\n&gt;&gt; No worries, so we're just swapping,\nthat's transposing, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.290\nSo that's transposition.\n\n183\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.640\nSometimes you'll also hear more technical\nterm called permutation, and also again,\n\n184\n00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.900\nwith the mathematical,\nthey usually it associated with that, but\n\n185\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.830\nit means the same thing all right?\n\n186\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.850\nAnd then substitution is simply\ngoing to be substituting.\n\n187\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.220\nHere, I have a basic one.\n\n188\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.490\nThat, when I was in grade school,\nmy friends and I would write notes.\n\n189\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:03.010\nAnd we would use this alpha substitution\ncipher, one through 26 A through Z and\n\n190\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.110\ntry to conceal our little handwritten\nmessages, so that's gonna be substitution.\n\n191\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.600\nAnd of course those are just\nvery rudimentary examples,\n\n192\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.490\nbut that's really all we need to know.\n\n193\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it,\nour goal behind the history is simple.\n\n194\n00:10:16.605 --> 00:10:19.350\nIs that they existed long before\ncomputer systems did, and\n\n195\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.330\nthey did work for a good amount of time.\n\n196\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.860\nTo tell you the truth,\nall the way up until about the 15th or\n\n197\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.760\n16th century they worked very well leading\nup to really kind of the most complex\n\n198\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.910\none at that point would have been the\nveneer, I can never say it right, Vigmere.\n\n199\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.330\nI don't know how to say it, V-I-G-M-E-R-E,\nhowever you actually say that one.\n\n200\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.190\nBut it really did work fairly\nwell from that point without\n\n201\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.170\nneeding an additional system, right?\n\n202\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.140\nSo even though we had simple\nthings like transposition and\n\n203\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.460\nsubstitution people were able\nto break those after time.\n\n204\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.420\nBut at the same time it started becoming\nmore and more complex and without\n\n205\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.190\ncomputing systems that was perfectly fine\nbecause it still took a long time for\n\n206\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.260\npeople to break.\n\n207\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.730\nBut once computing systems came online,\n\n208\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.110\nthen they could start calculating\nhundreds, if not thousands,\n\n209\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.870\nif not tens of thousands,\nsay billions of calculations per second.\n\n210\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.060\nWell then we needed to change too and\nso when we start moving into that arena\n\n211\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.950\nWe move out of the realm of simple types\nof cryptosystems like transpositions and\n\n212\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.380\nsubstitutions.\n\n213\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.180\nAnd now we start getting into the realm\nof what you were talking about instead.\n\n214\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so computers.\n\n215\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.920\nWe all know computers speak in binary, so\nlet's just break it down to that level and\n\n216\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.320\nlook at it from, well how the computers\nwould be looking at this information.\n\n217\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.420\nSo if we can take a look at\nRonnie's screen real quick,\n\n218\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.800\nwe'll look at the difference between\na stream cipher and a block cipher.\n\n219\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.700\nSo a stream cipher, I'm gonna look\nat each individual bit, okay,\n\n220\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.270\neach binary, and\nencrypt it individually, all right?\n\n221\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:53.490\nWhereas block cyphers, I go ahead and\nI'm going to group together a group of\n\n222\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.770\nbits depending on the algorithm's\nrequirement for the size of that block.\n\n223\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.640\nWe see block ciphers,\n\n224\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.870\nwe'll talk about in a few minutes,\nlike Des had a 64 bit block cypher.\n\n225\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.520\nIs that how many bits you have there,\nRonnie?\n\n226\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.070\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there we go.\n\n227\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.570\nThat's a 64 64 bit.\n\n228\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.970\nHowever let's say here Ronnie,\nif I want to send you a message and\n\n229\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.070\nit was a 1,200 bit plain text,\nbinary message that I wanted to transmit.\n\n230\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:26.540\nNow I wanted to utilize a block cipher,\nI could take 100 blocks, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.188\n100 128 bit blocks all right,\ndoesn't fit too perfectly,\n\n232\n00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:34.020\na 1,200 bit original message.\n\n233\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.525\nSo hat I could do is break that\ninformation up and then, for\n\n234\n00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:42.015\nthe remaining 80 bits, okay, I could\ngo ahead and fill it with some pad, or\n\n235\n00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:46.585\nsome fluff information to make it fit nice\nand perfectly into these little blocks.\n\n236\n00:12:46.585 --> 00:12:49.555\nAnd then each individual\nblock would be encrypted.\n\n237\n00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:52.925\nSo that's the difference between\nstream cipher and block cipher.\n\n238\n00:12:52.925 --> 00:12:56.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the goal here, of course, is that\nwhen we began with the idea of stream\n\n239\n00:12:56.135 --> 00:13:00.300\nciphering everybody thought, wow,\nthis is pretty fast and works very well.\n\n240\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.910\nBut it is sequential and\nit is predictable, right?\n\n241\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.630\nSo stream ciphering can\nbecome very predictable.\n\n242\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.620\nBut with the idea of block ciphering\nwhat Cherokee is describing is that\n\n243\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.998\nwe don't have those perfect 64\nbit blocks or 128 bit blocks.\n\n244\n00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:18.490\nWhat that means is that there's gonna be\nsome in each particular block that we have\n\n245\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.610\nwhich might not fill up the entire block.\n\n246\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.560\nSo the computer system just\nadds in more and more data and\n\n247\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.330\nthat makes it a little bit\nmore unpredictable as well.\n\n248\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.319\nBeing able to run through an algorithm\nwith this type of information makes\n\n249\n00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:31.990\nit a little bit more variable,\n\n250\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.128\nallows the actual computational power\nto actually be expanded quite a bit.\n\n251\n00:13:36.128 --> 00:13:39.745\nInstead of going through every single bit\none at a time and going I'm gonna encrypt\n\n252\n00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:43.153\nthis one, I'm gonna encrypt the next one,\nI'm gonna encrypt the next one,\n\n253\n00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:46.530\nvery predictable, but very small\nat the same time, so very quick.\n\n254\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.700\nBlock cyphering takes a little bit longer,\nnot time that you and\n\n255\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.490\nI would ever calculate.\n\n256\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.960\nBut that's kind of the beginning here and\n\n257\n00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.140\nreally where when we start talking\nabout the calculation power, right.\n\n258\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.670\nThe idea that these block\nsizes are pretty much key\n\n259\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.920\nin making sure that at least a portion at\nwhat we do in the encryption algorithms\n\n260\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.110\nare really gonna work\nthe way that we want to.\n\n261\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.400\nSo it really comes down to\nat least understanding that.\n\n262\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.110\nSo why is it so important that we start\nto deal and understand about how to\n\n263\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:27.060\nmanage these systems when it comes down to\nsomething like cybersecurity here, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.900\nAnd that is because, depending on what\nyou choose, it impacts what can happen.\n\n265\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you just mentioned\ncertain, so, for instance,\n\n266\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.965\nthe block versus string cypher for\nlooking at time.\n\n267\n00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:40.485\nOkay?\nSometimes time is going to be an important\n\n268\n00:14:40.485 --> 00:14:44.425\nfactor that we're trying to examine\nwhen we're choosing which method or\n\n269\n00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.865\nwhich algorithm to utilize here.\n\n270\n00:14:45.865 --> 00:14:50.715\nFor instance, Ronnie, what if I had\nsome sensitive information, and\n\n271\n00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:54.365\nI choose an algorithm that\nwas very slow to crack into?\n\n272\n00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:58.580\nSo maybe, by the time that you\nwere able to crack into my system,\n\n273\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.010\nto extract that information,\nthat information is not relevant anymore\n\n274\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.980\nbecause it's already past its life\nexpectancy of usefulness there.\n\n275\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.890\nSo those are some things that you\nmight want to consider, right?\n\n276\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.850\n&gt;&gt; Not only that right?\n\n277\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.490\nSo, even though that's a great one,\nso for example,\n\n278\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.950\nlet's say it's a battlefield message.\n\n279\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.820\nThat the enemy's gonna attack at dawn.\n\n280\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.100\nWell, and you get it at noon the next day.\n\n281\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.160\nIt has really has out\nused it's usefulness as\n\n282\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.630\nfar as the time sensitivity value of that.\n\n283\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.620\nBut you also have to take a look at\nthe overall value of whatever you're\n\n284\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.070\nprotecting as well.\n\n285\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.023\nThere are systems that you\nimplement in terms of security,\n\n286\n00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:41.924\nas well as in cryptography here where\nyou might be over encrypting data for\n\n287\n00:15:41.924 --> 00:15:44.394\nthe value that that data really has.\n\n288\n00:15:44.394 --> 00:15:48.756\nAnd this is one of the classification\nof data inside your network is one of\n\n289\n00:15:48.756 --> 00:15:52.976\nmost central things you can do that\nshows your serious commitment to,\n\n290\n00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:57.652\nwell security in your network is\ndeclassification of data and information.\n\n291\n00:15:57.652 --> 00:16:02.156\nSo if you already have data and\ninformation setup that automatically tells\n\n292\n00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:06.088\nme as a custodian of the data,\nexactly what encryption to chose or\n\n293\n00:16:06.088 --> 00:16:09.430\nwhat level of encryption\nto chose depending on that.\n\n294\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.610\nAnd I don't have to look at every\nsingle piece of information.\n\n295\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.720\nI go, that's more sensitive then\nwhat Cherokee was expecting.\n\n296\n00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.910\nSo let me encrypt it higher, and that's\nless sensitive let me encrypt it lower.\n\n297\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.860\nWell whoever owns the data itself\nshould be, or whoever actually says or\n\n298\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.690\ngoverns that in the protocol says,\nhey this is how we're going to do this.\n\n299\n00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:34.040\nSo the classification of data really\ndoes help us out as far as determining\n\n300\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.260\nthe value of the data itself and\nwhat level of encryption we use.\n\n301\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.664\nBut speaking of that of course then it\nmeans that there are other things that we\n\n302\n00:16:43.664 --> 00:16:45.644\nhave to take into account as well.\n\n303\n00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:51.394\nRight now as of the recording\nof our studios.\n\n304\n00:16:51.394 --> 00:16:55.950\nThere has been in the past couple of years\nwere systems have kind of failed as far as\n\n305\n00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.785\nsome of the cryptographic systems to the\npoint where the hashing systems available.\n\n306\n00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:03.336\nAnd not that each encryption\nhas been broken, but\n\n307\n00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:07.419\nwe are now discovering more and more that\nencryptions are being broken faster.\n\n308\n00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:10.090\nAnd that is because\nthe systems themselves,\n\n309\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.701\ncomputers themselves are getting faster.\n\n310\n00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:16.355\nThey're calculating more values,\nthey are coming up with more.\n\n311\n00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:18.489\nAnd today the key charm\nis quantum computing,\n\n312\n00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:20.248\neverybody loves quantum computing.\n\n313\n00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.260\n&gt;&gt; The way of the future\n&gt;&gt; As to way of the future.\n\n314\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.575\nNow I don't see quantum\ncomputers lying around anywhere.\n\n315\n00:17:25.575 --> 00:17:28.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are not very cheap, you can't\n\n316\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.220\ngo into a store and buy one, you can't\norder one from your favorite retailer.\n\n317\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.350\nBut at the same time,\n\n318\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.990\nthey're showing where these systems\ncould possibly be compromised by that.\n\n319\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.780\nSo what is happening now of course then\nare different people that are involved\n\n320\n00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.500\nin cyber security are recommending\nsome security levels and\n\n321\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.240\nstrengths that we have to think about.\n\n322\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.550\nSo let's go ahead take\na look at my screen.\n\n323\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.353\nThat will help us out when we do this.\n\n324\n00:17:53.353 --> 00:17:58.489\nNow this is straight from Cisco's\nwebsite that they have as far as when\n\n325\n00:17:58.489 --> 00:18:03.730\nwe start taking a look at using\nencryption systems to its fullest here.\n\n326\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.109\nWhenever we deal with this as far\nas a production network goes,\n\n327\n00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:11.318\nwe wanna make sure that we understand that\nwe need to pick proper encryption for\n\n328\n00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:13.520\nmaking sure our data is secure.\n\n329\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.880\nWe need to make sure that we\nhave the authentication correct.\n\n330\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.530\nAnd that it's also secured as well.\n\n331\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.670\nAnd being on a check for\n\n332\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.730\nthe data integrity,\nas well as a Key Exchange system.\n\n333\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.140\nSo all of these are actually need to\nbe set and level that's acceptable.\n\n334\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.760\nNow the problem is simple right,\njust because Cisco said so,\n\n335\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.000\nthe very fact is it actually also\nmeans something else as well.\n\n336\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.485\nYou don't have to follow it.\n\n337\n00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:40.709\nI know that sounds strange so\n\n338\n00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:45.723\nthose people that are Cisco bound and\nhidden in the Cisco world.\n\n339\n00:18:45.723 --> 00:18:49.160\nEverything that Cisco says,\ndon't get me wrong, it is pretty good.\n\n340\n00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.112\nThey know what they're doing,\nthey are great guys.\n\n341\n00:18:51.112 --> 00:18:52.798\nBut it doesn't mean that you and\n\n342\n00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.993\nyour company has to just go that's exactly\nwhat we have to follow Cisco says so.\n\n343\n00:18:56.993 --> 00:19:00.116\nYou're your own independent company,\nyou decide the future of your company, so\n\n344\n00:19:00.116 --> 00:19:01.230\nyou do what you want to.\n\n345\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.180\n&gt;&gt; Unless they're governed by some sort of\nlike we spoke about I think maybe earlier\n\n346\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.610\nthose regulatory compliances.\n\n347\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.910\nThen you'll have to follow those, right?\n\n348\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYou have to at least follow some minimum\n\n349\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.230\nstandard.\n\n350\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.825\nAnd if there isn't one,\nCisco is saying here's what we recommend.\n\n351\n00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:16.103\nSo as of October of 2015.\n\n352\n00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:18.580\nSo what are these minimum\nstandards based off of?\n\n353\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.127\nIt could be somebody named\nJoe working at Cisco and\n\n354\n00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:24.900\ngo I'm just gonna write this down\non a napkin for and hand it out.\n\n355\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.935\nNot really okay.\n\n356\n00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:29.480\nWhat they've done right is\nthey've tried to do this.\n\n357\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:35.430\nThey realize that the lifetime of\nthe way that we choose these algorithms.\n\n358\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.302\nThey an either be for a good long\nlifetime or they can be very short.\n\n359\n00:19:39.302 --> 00:19:42.289\nThere are some particular\nallgortims that they chose,\n\n360\n00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:44.645\nnot they chose someone chose in the past-.\n\n361\n00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:45.157\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie.\n\n362\n00:19:45.157 --> 00:19:46.970\n&gt;&gt; That might have lasted for six months.\n\n363\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.330\nI mean some of these algorithms\nare just not as strong as others.\n\n364\n00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.610\nSo that's what we're looking at here,\nis this is the minimum.\n\n365\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.760\nAt least Cisco's recommended minimum.\n\n366\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the recommended minimum\n\n367\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.890\nis based on a couple of different\nthings in Cisco's past background.\n\n368\n00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.500\nBut when it comes down to it,\nit really is based on what they believe\n\n369\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.190\ncan still be securable in about\ngeneration in about 20 years top.\n\n370\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n371\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.130\nSo it doesn't mean that they're\nsaying it will last forever.\n\n372\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n373\n00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.760\nAnd there can't even guarantee\nits gonna last 20 years but\n\n374\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.950\nthis is what they believe as\nfar as projected in the future.\n\n375\n00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.530\nThat these are the minimum values that\nif you wanna be able to use them over\n\n376\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.630\nthe duration of your company over time.\n\n377\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:32.270\nThat here is direct amended\nminimum values an that is the key.\n\n378\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.970\nDoesn't mean that you set this\nas being the highest value,\n\n379\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.680\nyou set these as being the lowest values.\n\n380\n00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.208\nSo of course, they recommend\nan encryption algorithm of AES-128.\n\n381\n00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:47.995\nAt the minimum using the cypher block\nchain is what they also recommend.\n\n382\n00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:52.587\nIn the authentication area as far\nas what we use as an algorithm.\n\n383\n00:20:52.587 --> 00:20:57.886\nEither using RCA or DSA for\ndigital signing here,\n\n384\n00:20:57.886 --> 00:21:01.544\nbut notice it's at 3072, for\n\n385\n00:21:01.544 --> 00:21:05.595\n3072 bit is what they recommend.\n\n386\n00:21:05.595 --> 00:21:09.885\nFor checking with hashing\nalgorithms a minimum of SHA-256.\n\n387\n00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:13.635\nAnd then the key exchange no longer\ngood enough to actually be in\n\n388\n00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:17.473\nthe single numbers here in\nthe Diffie-Hellman group numbers.\n\n389\n00:21:17.473 --> 00:21:19.660\nBut actually do Group 15.\n\n390\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.368\nAdded into all of this,\nit does mean something that\n\n391\n00:21:24.368 --> 00:21:28.097\nwould impacted us five, ten years ago.\n\n392\n00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:32.641\nIf we were to implement all of this\nfive or ten years ago on our equipment.\n\n393\n00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:36.414\nWe would had insanely slow networks and\nI really mean this.\n\n394\n00:21:36.414 --> 00:21:41.530\nTo implement 3072 bit on just\nan authentication, pretty harsh.\n\n395\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.450\nThe same thing with the Key Exchange.\n\n396\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.520\nThat's a lot of computational power\nthat's on your equipment that you have\n\n397\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.710\nto wonder about.\n\n398\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.350\nSo, but what about today?\n\n399\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.990\nWell today you really don't have\na lot of those issues anymore.\n\n400\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.440\nI'm not saying you can't,\nbut you really don't.\n\n401\n00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.210\nAnd so, for\nexample the laptop that I'm on.\n\n402\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:58.739\nIt's a MacBook.\n\n403\n00:21:58.739 --> 00:22:00.231\nIt's got 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n404\n00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:05.070\nIt's got an I5 processor in it.\n\n405\n00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.910\nA core, whatever they call it.\n\n406\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.890\nYeah, an I5 processor.\n\n407\n00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.880\nI couldn't remind what it was called.\n\n408\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.380\nA solid state drive.\n\n409\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.230\nThese systems are insanely fast\nin comparison to what would have\n\n410\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.520\nbeen out 15 years ago or ten years ago.\n\n411\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.360\nThat they don't really suffer\nfrom that idea of performance\n\n412\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.350\ndegradation that we would normally have.\n\n413\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:27.260\nSo that's why they talk about the idea\nof the recommended minimums here,\n\n414\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.540\nif we were to do that.\n\n415\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.920\nNow before we move away from\nsome of those recommendations\n\n416\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.850\nlet me show you one more here.\n\n417\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.920\nWhich is,\n\n418\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:41.090\nwe'll call security levels recommended\nby the next generation encryption.\n\n419\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.308\nThe next generation encryption again\nsays hey, 20 years and out, maybe.\n\n420\n00:22:45.308 --> 00:22:48.790\nAnd so\nhere's where you actually start seeing\n\n421\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.860\nsome different ones based\non security levels, too.\n\n422\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.410\nSo when you start to take a look here,\nI'm trying to pull these over so-\n\n423\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.840\n&gt;&gt; I like how they categorized them.\n\n424\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to a point here.\n\n425\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.880\nThis last one is not an official category.\n\n426\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.730\nThis is one that I made here but\nthe first two are.\n\n427\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.810\nSo from Cisco recommended security levels\n\n428\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:14.050\nif you are just really having to secure\nsensitive information in your network.\n\n429\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.150\nDo 128 bit, and that includes all\nthese algorithms that are listed here.\n\n430\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.830\nYou don't really have to know all that for\nthe exam, but I put it on here for\n\n431\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.520\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n432\n00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.133\nBut if you have information that\nyou consider higher than sensitive,\n\n433\n00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:31.177\nthen 192 is really the key.\n\n434\n00:23:31.177 --> 00:23:34.109\nAnd those are the official ones\nthat you'll find at Cisco.\n\n435\n00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:41.180\nBut there is 256 bits it is out there and\nit does give you the ability to do so.\n\n436\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.031\nAnd I say that if you gonna do\nanything that's secret Information,\n\n437\n00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:45.989\nin other words stuff\nthat shouldn't get out.\n\n438\n00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:49.216\nThis is where you should be as\nfar as the link value goes for\n\n439\n00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:52.710\nthe algorithm that you're\ngonna use is at least here.\n\n440\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.899\nAnd you can even see even though they show\nyou an encryption, they show you hashing,\n\n441\n00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.264\nthey show you the Elliptic curve,\nDiffy Hellman algorithms here.\n\n442\n00:24:00.264 --> 00:24:02.838\nNotice that these two on the hashing and\n\n443\n00:24:02.838 --> 00:24:06.670\nthe key exchange are above 256 as well,\nokay?\n\n444\n00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.960\nSo don't go by that,\n\n445\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.430\nmake sure you pay attention to some of\nthese algorithms that are over here.\n\n446\n00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.300\nSo this is what is considered\nnext generation again,\n\n447\n00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.595\nnow think about it 20 years and\nbeyond here is what you're thinking about.\n\n448\n00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:19.520\nRemember the says,\n\n449\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.280\nyou can still probably be using these\nin 20 years, but don't count on it.\n\n450\n00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.110\nThink about the idea of going beyond that,\nand that's what they're recommending here\n\n451\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.510\nas far as basing it based off of\nthose security levels instead, and\n\n452\n00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.930\nthose number of bits is what's\ngoing to help us out, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.783\nSo, that kind of really wraps up just\nabout everything as far as the background\n\n454\n00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:44.944\ntype of information you should have when\ndealing with the encryption algorithms.\n\n455\n00:24:44.944 --> 00:24:49.924\nNow we can start talking a little\nbit about the algorithms themselves,\n\n456\n00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:54.000\nat least just at the beginning here and\nstart to see.\n\n457\n00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.180\nAnd there is one algorithm that stands\nout by itself right at the beginning and\n\n458\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.830\nthat is the one we call digital\nencryption standard itself, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n460\n00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.800\nThe data encryption standard?\n\n461\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, data encryption-\n&gt;&gt; We've been tossing these names back and\n\n462\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.580\nforth, but that's okay because DES,\nnormally you would say DES.\n\n463\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.870\nIt's actually gone by a couple\ndifferent code names to begin with.\n\n464\n00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.410\nAnd so are we just gonna be looking\nat the algorithm to start because\n\n465\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.220\nwe do have a lot of different\nalgorithms to cover.\n\n466\n00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.700\nSo let's take a look at Ronnie's\nscreen here real quick.\n\n467\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.900\nAll right.\n\n468\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.890\nIf we talk about DES for a second,\nthere's a big, long history to it.\n\n469\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.160\nThis was our very first,\nthis was the baby.\n\n470\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.550\nAnd if you think about, Ronnie, in\nthe very beginning here, and when you hear\n\n471\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:38.430\nthe word encryption and you're talking\nin the 70s, when it was just at\n\n472\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:43.970\nthe very infancy of cryptography as far\nas computing goes, like we talked about.\n\n473\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.460\nSo who is using it?\n\n474\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.610\nWell, governmental and military entities,\n\n475\n00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.618\nmaybe some large financial institutions\nnot just your everyday home user.\n\n476\n00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:58.630\nWe weren't able to yet, so\nthe systems were usually proprietary.\n\n477\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:03.080\nMeaning the software had to be from\nwhomever was utilizing that cryptography.\n\n478\n00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.630\nThe manufacture created it.\n\n479\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.770\nProprietary software, hardware,\neveryone had to be on the same systems,\n\n480\n00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.150\nbeing on the same page.\n\n481\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.909\nBut to have that interoperability that\nwas wanted at that point in time,\n\n482\n00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:17.191\nall right,\nthere needed to be a better solution.\n\n483\n00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:21.175\nSo, in 1972, at the time,\nif you guys know of NIST,\n\n484\n00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:25.162\nthe National Institute of Standards and\nTechnologies,\n\n485\n00:26:25.162 --> 00:26:29.090\nthey didn't go by that name\nat this point in history.\n\n486\n00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.560\nThey went by the NBA, which was\nthe National Bureau of Standards.\n\n487\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.130\n&gt;&gt; NBS.\n\n488\n00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:33.825\n&gt;&gt; NBS, sorry.\n\n489\n00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:36.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not playing basketball here.\n\n490\n00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:37.813\n[LAUGH] So many acronyms.\n\n491\n00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:41.354\nAnyhow, so they said,\nlook we need to have an interoperability,\n\n492\n00:26:41.354 --> 00:26:45.690\nsome kind of algorithm that we can use for\neveryone to be on the same page.\n\n493\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.490\nSo who's gonna volunteer?\n\n494\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.598\nRonnie, you?\n\n495\n00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:54.938\n&gt;&gt; No, but it's funny IBM, they were\nthe ones that essentially were approached.\n\n496\n00:26:54.938 --> 00:26:58.650\nIBM kind of said, all right,\nwe'll take this on a little bit.\n\n497\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.790\nAnd they were the ones that started\n\n498\n00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.790\ndeveloping-\n&gt;&gt; They did.\n\n499\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.950\n&gt;&gt; The idea of what happened here.\n\n500\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wasn't that Lucifer?\n\n501\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.370\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n&gt;&gt; They were\n\n502\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.590\nworking on that code name Lucifer there.\n\n503\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they started developing\nthe encryption a little bit.\n\n504\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:13.610\nBut here you start to have where you\nnow have government, essentially asking\n\n505\n00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:19.290\nparticular companies and individuals here,\nthe ability to say hey we need this.\n\n506\n00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.926\nAnd you might go,\nthat's a great thing to do, right?\n\n507\n00:27:21.926 --> 00:27:24.460\nBut that means that they\ncan also keep it private.\n\n508\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.448\nBecause what is the government doing?\n\n509\n00:27:26.448 --> 00:27:29.143\nThey're essentially saying that\nthey are a customer of yours and\n\n510\n00:27:29.143 --> 00:27:31.306\nwe need you to develop this for\nus is what they can do.\n\n511\n00:27:31.306 --> 00:27:32.954\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that way they can actually have\n\n512\n00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:35.040\ncontrol over what the standard could be.\n\n513\n00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nwe didn't really have any volunteers.\n\n514\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.680\nThey sent out an AllCall,\nwhich was called a Federal Register.\n\n515\n00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.970\nAnd the Federal Register was just\na request on requirements for\n\n516\n00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.620\nthis algorithm that they were requesting.\n\n517\n00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.690\nSo if you wanna take a look\nat Ronnie's screen again.\n\n518\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.670\nYou can see some examples of what were\nrequested from this Federal Register.\n\n519\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.310\nI mean, it's kind of interesting.\n\n520\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.120\nThey're a little vague, so\n\n521\n00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.930\nthey didn't really have some\nreally detailed specifics here.\n\n522\n00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.820\nIt just says the algorithm must\nprovide a high level of secrecy.\n\n523\n00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.550\nThe algorithm must be completely\nspecified and easy to understand.\n\n524\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.110\nAnd you can go through and look at those,\nbut it's just kind of interesting.\n\n525\n00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.890\nThey didn't have anyone respond\nto that original register.\n\n526\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.470\nThey released that second register\nI think the following year so,\n\n527\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.100\nstill nothing worth mentioning.\n\n528\n00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.130\nSo they went, like you said, went with IBM\nand they started to develop that Lucifer\n\n529\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.580\nand I think it had went with the code\nname- what was that first one?\n\n530\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.235\nIt was the data encryption algorithm\nis what is started out with.\n\n531\n00:28:33.235 --> 00:28:37.080\nWent by DEA1 for\ntheir particular naming conventions.\n\n532\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.180\nBut this was just the beginning.\n\n533\n00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:38.730\nIt was pretty cool.\n\n534\n00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:44.310\nWe ended up seeing DES as what we all know\nit as today, but that's where it started.\n\n535\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nRemember that DES itself\n\n536\n00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.890\nis just a symmetric key type of\nencryption algorithm that we use.\n\n537\n00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:55.140\nIts block size is a block type\nof ciphering but 64 bits long.\n\n538\n00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.080\nAnd this is where a more interesting\nhistory comes into it, right?\n\n539\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.450\nIt's that the government itself started\nrealizing a couple of different things.\n\n540\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:08.590\nIt's that it was so neat, and so strong\nin its particular way of doing things,\n\n541\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.550\nthat the government was fearful that they\ncould get locked out of their own systems.\n\n542\n00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.940\nSo they did go in in the background\na little bit there, and kind of say,\n\n543\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.410\nlook we need to kind of compromise here\nand reduce the key size and it's like no,\n\n544\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.560\nlet's not do that.\n\n545\n00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.890\nThey settled on 56 bits is what they did.\n\n546\n00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.020\nThey made an 8 bit parity\nis what we see there.\n\n547\n00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.960\nBut today's standard the key here is\nfairly simple, is that as complex as\n\n548\n00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.960\nDES is it's because of not only the idea\nof it being a block cipher, but\n\n549\n00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.140\nit goes through the 16\nrounds of encryption.\n\n550\n00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.390\nAnd Cherokee's gonna explain\na little bit more about that,\n\n551\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.780\nas far as how that works a little bit.\n\n552\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.810\nBut it goes through 16\nrounds of the encryption, so\n\n553\n00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.390\nit's encrypting itself over and over again\n16 times, to do what it needs to do.\n\n554\n00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:54.140\nBut even so, in today's standards\nit's something that we shouldn't use.\n\n555\n00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:54.810\nRight, Cherokee?\n\n556\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly we see DES being used for\nour symmetric encryption,\n\n557\n00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.840\nthe 64 bit cipher, but still by today's\nstandards that's pretty low Ronnie.\n\n558\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.330\nSo we do have other alternatives\nlike Brian just mentioned,\n\n559\n00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.630\nlooking at those minimums.\n\n560\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.250\nIf you are not familiar with those\nalgorithms that we put up there,\n\n561\n00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.110\nwe're gonna be covering\nalgorithms called out for\n\n562\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.880\nthis exam in just a few,\nin the following episodes.\n\n563\n00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.510\nBut let's just quickly take a look at what\ndo these algorithms even look like, right?\n\n564\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.583\nNow don't worry you don't have\nto know this for the exam.\n\n565\n00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.385\nWe just kinda wanna put\nit into perspective so\n\n566\n00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:33.245\nyou can see just how\ncomplicated it really is.\n\n567\n00:30:33.245 --> 00:30:35.201\nSo let's take a look at Ronnie's screen.\n\n568\n00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:36.815\nSo if we look this is an example.\n\n569\n00:30:36.815 --> 00:30:40.780\nThis is just a tiny portion\nof the DES algorithm.\n\n570\n00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.290\nAnd we take our plain text, right, and\n\n571\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.680\nthe plain text is ran through\nan initial permutation.\n\n572\n00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.580\nYou remember that word we talked about\nearlier, so that's a transposition, right?\n\n573\n00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.900\nThe output of that permutation,\nthe initial permutation,\n\n574\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.400\nis broken and we start with our 64 bits.\n\n575\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.580\nAll right, so then we run that 64\nbits through the inital permentation.\n\n576\n00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.820\nOutput is then broken into two sections,\n\n577\n00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.960\nwe have a left and we have a right, and\nthat is going to be 32 bits, 32 bits.\n\n578\n00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.590\nThen the output of that is ran through,\n\n579\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.750\neach one is ran through a function,\nall right?\n\n580\n00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.090\nThen you come to this, the key, this,\nthe key is applied to the function, and\n\n581\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:21.130\nthen you get your x or, which is\ngoing to be your logic gate there,\n\n582\n00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.860\nwhich the output is then transferred back\ninto the left and the right portions.\n\n583\n00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.000\nThen you do that 16 times.\n\n584\n00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.578\nSo that's DES.\n\n585\n00:31:28.578 --> 00:31:31.360\nNow triple DES, and\n\n586\n00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.400\nwe'll get into that when we look\nat some more advanced algorithms.\n\n587\n00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.000\nBut seeing the weaknesses with DES\nthey said okay what are we gonna do?\n\n588\n00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.370\nWe're gonna put a band aid on it\nto kind of extend the life here\n\n589\n00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.420\nuntil we can find a better\nalgorithm to replace it.\n\n590\n00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.200\nSo we'll go ahead and\ntake this concept, all right.\n\n591\n00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.710\nTake this information,\nrun it through the system three times, and\n\n592\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.980\nthen we'll call it Triple DES.\n\n593\n00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.810\nSo, that was kind of an in between, work\naround that they had for that, but that\n\n594\n00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.920\nwas the beginning and you know, and we're\nstill developing methods like Ronnie said,\n\n595\n00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.580\nwith the quantum cryptography,\nevery single day.\n\n596\n00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.110\n&gt;&gt; And as much as DES is compromised\ntoday, okay, that data encryption center.\n\n597\n00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.300\nAs much as that is considered\ncompromised and unsecure and\n\n598\n00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.610\nyou shouldn't use it, you've got to\nremember that this was actually for\n\n599\n00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:17.570\nthe Federal Government and\nit lasted for over a decade and\n\n600\n00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:22.450\nit was re-affirmed multiple\ntimes like three or four times.\n\n601\n00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:26.040\nDuring that time, from the time it was\nimplemented all the way until about 1999,\n\n602\n00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.340\nit was reaffirmed as a standard\nthat could still be trusted.\n\n603\n00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.711\n&gt;&gt; I think it was like every five\nyears that they had to reevaluate.\n\n604\n00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they really did reaffirm that.\n\n605\n00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.450\nAnd each time they were perfectly fine,\n\n606\n00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.965\nuntil about 1996 when they said look\nwe started to realize something,\n\n607\n00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:45.428\nwe need to come up with another one\nbecause it's been used for so long.\n\n608\n00:32:45.428 --> 00:32:50.150\nSo, as they were starting to come up with\nanother one, that is when they started to\n\n609\n00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.190\nrealize something that they needed them\nto move on beyond the idea of this DES.\n\n610\n00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.888\nAnd they started using some other\nstandards that were out there, but\n\n611\n00:32:56.888 --> 00:32:59.440\nthey realized that they\nneeded the competition.\n\n612\n00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.850\nAnd in that competition,\n\n613\n00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:05.600\nis when they actually had an international\ncompetition that really drew a wide\n\n614\n00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.620\nassorted body of different types of\ncryptographers that would come together\n\n615\n00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.060\nto actually develop what they called\na new advanced encryption standard.\n\n616\n00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.630\nBut at least for\nthis episode you have the very beginning,\n\n617\n00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.750\nwhich does set itself alone.\n\n618\n00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.480\nAnd then when we come back for\nanother episode,\n\n619\n00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.130\nbecause we're kind of out of time here,\n\n620\n00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.490\nwe'll talk about what happened in that\nidea of that competition a little bit.\n\n621\n00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.455\nWe're not going to get super deep into it.\n\n622\n00:33:31.455 --> 00:33:34.480\nBut then we'll talk about some of the\nother encryption standards we should know.\n\n623\n00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.170\nAnd it all really did come from that\nidea of the competition that was held,\n\n624\n00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:42.460\nthat most of the well known cryptographers\non the planet really did join in and\n\n625\n00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.260\ndo all the stuff that they needed to.\n\n626\n00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.250\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much for joining us\ntoday Ronnie, and thank you for tuning in,\n\n627\n00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.620\nI appreciate it.\n\n628\n00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.870\nBut, don't go anywhere we have a lot of\nreally great information headed your way\n\n629\n00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.470\nso stay tuned.\n\n630\n00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.054\nRemember, I'm you host Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt;

Well thank you for having me back\nas we continue on to take a look\n\n15\n00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:46.925\nat the idea of encryption, algorithms,\nand some of the different protocols.\n\n16\n00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.385\nAnd today,\nwe're are picking up on a part two.\n\n17\n00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:53.364\nThe reason why of course, is that we\ndid leave you with a cliffhanger and\n\n18\n00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:55.270\nsomebody did mention in HR room.\n\n19\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.650\nWhere we had talked about the idea\nthat the federal government\n\n20\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.990\nhad pretty much been allowing\nDES to continue on for awhile.\n\n21\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.530\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a little bit of a review and\n\n22\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.160\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.260\nAnd then we'll jump into\nwhat happened after that and\n\n24\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.740\nwe'll pick on the idea of that\ninternational competition.\n\n25\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.440\nNow let's take a look at my screen and\n\n26\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.420\nthat way we'll kind of get\na good understanding here.\n\n27\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.640\nThere are some acronyms\nI never remember and\n\n28\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.920\nI think I always do here which\nhe actually showed me this.\n\n29\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.765\nThis is not supposed to be digital but\nyou said data.\n\n30\n00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Encryption\n\n31\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.920\nalways called it digital encryption\nstandard and I was incorrect.\n\n32\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.009\nSo DES has been the encryption\nstandard in the past right?\n\n33\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.240\nFor the federal government and\n\n34\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.590\nthat fit underneath what was called\nthe Fifth Publication of 46.\n\n35\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.050\nYou want to make sure that you\nunderstand what FIPS means.\n\n36\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.621\nAnd make sure you understand\nthis particular acronym,\n\n37\n00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:48.705\nFederal Information Processing Standard.\n\n38\n00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:52.383\nIt shouldn't be too difficult,\nbut I always seem to forget it.\n\n39\n00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.672\nFor the actual United States here,\n\n40\n00:01:54.672 --> 00:02:00.080\nin 1997 it's not that they said this is\nthe only thing that we are going to use.\n\n41\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.040\nBut they said that here is\nthe standardization of this.\n\n42\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.220\nSo what did that really do?\n\n43\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.210\nIt authorized for all unclassified\ndata for the federal government.\n\n44\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.090\nSo at the beginning it said if you\nare going to encrypt unclassified data.\n\n45\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.860\nRemember there is secret and\nthen there is confidential and\n\n46\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.530\nthen there is unclassified.\n\n47\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.130\nWhen you have some of those different\nsystems that are out there.\n\n48\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.600\nBut they continued to reaffirm it.\n\n49\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.376\nSo there was actually a FIPS one,\ntwo and thre,.\n\n50\n00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:31.599\nAnd in 1999 is when FIPS 3 came out.\n\n51\n00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.310\nThe 46-3 here came out.\n\n52\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.040\nAnd they said look, even though DES\nis still okay it's only designed for\n\n53\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.230\nLegacy systems.\n\n54\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.780\nAnd what that means for us is if that\nmachine can only do DES, then use it.\n\n55\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Well these companies they probably\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n56\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.740\npurchasing the equipment.\n\n57\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.500\nAnd they threw a big stink actually on\n\n58\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.770\nthe years prior when they\nwanted to pull it back earlier.\n\n59\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.380\nThey said look we're\nalready put all this money.\n\n60\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that make sense.\n\n61\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.000\nSo, in 1999 they didn't really push it\nhard they said that if you're actually\n\n62\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.830\nencrypting new data on new machines\nmake sure you use at least triple DES.\n\n63\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.680\nAnother standard that\nhas been out there for\n\n64\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.330\na little bit of time, because if you\ninherit weaknesses that they found of DES.\n\n65\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.595\nNow has been a while, but people have been\nworking on cracks for DES for a while.\n\n66\n00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:24.452\n1996 is when they really stopped\nofficially recommending any type of\n\n67\n00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:25.402\nencryption.\n\n68\n00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:31.410\nAnd then after 1998 and\n2000 I think right around 99.\n\n69\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.770\nOnce this particular crack took place,\nwhere DES was cracked\n\n70\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.510\nin 56 hours by a group called\nthe Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n71\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.060\nThat's when the federal government\nsaid we're reclaiming 46-3 here,\n\n72\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.720\nand we're not gonna\nrecommend that any more.\n\n73\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.660\nSo it was at that point and they realized\neven before that, so about 1996, 97,\n\n74\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.680\nsomewhere around there.\n\n75\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.840\nThey started this\ninternational competition.\n\n76\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.190\nAnd this was the first time that\nthe federal government said look.\n\n77\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.180\nThe US government.\n\n78\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.630\nSo everybody else around the world\nprobably doesn't care so much about it.\n\n79\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.040\nBut here in the US, it's kind of neat.\n\n80\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.650\nThe very fact is that the government\ndidn't go to a single entity and\n\n81\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.230\nsaid hey secretly create\nthis encryption for us.\n\n82\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.700\nAnd we're gonna initiate\nback doors into it so\n\n83\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.880\nthat we are the only ones who can get\naccess to it and not break the system.\n\n84\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.080\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people thought that what's the\nNSA was doing because they were actually\n\n85\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.410\napproving this algorithm.\n\n86\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.870\nAnd there was\nan investigation launched and\n\n87\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.500\nthe outcome of that investigation\nis sealed, classified.\n\n88\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.430\nBut it was determined that the NSA\ndid not have any foul play during\n\n89\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.320\nthe evolution of this algorithm.\n\n90\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.846\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's funny Bruce Schneier who\n\n91\n00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:46.838\nis probably the leading cryptographer that\njust about everybody knows in the field of\n\n92\n00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:47.623\ncryptography.\n\n93\n00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:52.162\nSaid it took them 20 years, those other\ncryptographers 20 years to actually\n\n94\n00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:56.968\nunderstand that the NSA was really helping\nout the encryption algorithm to get better\n\n95\n00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:58.700\nover 20 years time.\n\n96\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.930\nThey just didn't know that and\n\n97\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.440\nthey weren't ever told what\nwas actually happening.\n\n98\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.330\nBut really the NSA did help that\nparticular standard last a lot longer than\n\n99\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.850\nit probably needed to.\n\n100\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.600\nBut overall though, that's when\nthe federal government said look,\n\n101\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.660\nlet's do this.\n\n102\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.680\nAnd through the Department of Commerce\nhere in the United States they put\n\n103\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.730\nout an international call, so they didn't\neven limit it to the United States here.\n\n104\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.065\nThey put an international\ncall out to try and\n\n105\n00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.970\ncome up with what they call\nan advanced encryption standard.\n\n106\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.790\nAnd it would essentially replace DES,\nis what it would end up replacing.\n\n107\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.170\nSo all of the cryptographers, or\nvery well known cryptographers around\n\n108\n00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.310\nthe entire globe participated\nin this particular competition.\n\n109\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.630\nAnd it was probably one of\nthe greatest achievements\n\n110\n00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.000\nof the Commerce Department to\nessentially bring this together.\n\n111\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.760\nIf you read some of the people that\nwere involved in the competition.\n\n112\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.337\nIf you go to Bruce Schneier's website.\n\n113\n00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:59.740\n&gt;&gt; I love him.\n&gt;&gt; And take at what he says about this.\n\n114\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.180\nHe says about this, he says this is\nprobably one of the greatest things that\n\n115\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.090\nhis team ever participated in.\n\n116\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.240\nBecause it was really an open standard.\n\n117\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.848\nIt was really an open competition and\nvery fair on how they did everything and\n\n118\n00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:17.176\nhe said that even though he didn't\nthink that, well you can't blame.\n\n119\n00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.744\nHis didn't win, is what it comes down to.\n\n120\n00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:21.020\nEven though he thought\nthat his should've won.\n\n121\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.383\nNow he said,\nhe participated in again today.\n\n122\n00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.605\nAnd they had another competition like\nthat where they were opening that.\n\n123\n00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:29.062\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's the thing it's not always, and\n\n124\n00:06:29.062 --> 00:06:32.700\nwhen they were looking at this\ncompetition it wasn't the strongest.\n\n125\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.360\nTo be honest with you,\nit wasn't the strongest algorithm.\n\n126\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.920\nIt was what's gonna work the best\n\n127\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.230\nin the systems that we have\nout in the environment today.\n\n128\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.670\nSo there were a lot of factors\nwhen judging came about.\n\n129\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.747\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo that's when in 1997 they went ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:49.725\nthey did that they put that\ncomposition out there.\n\n131\n00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:54.902\nAnd for three years time all these people\nended up submitting their particular\n\n132\n00:06:54.902 --> 00:07:00.570\nencryption algorithms to be judged and to\nbe compared peer-reviewed by each other.\n\n133\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.500\nAnd it was really kind of something\nfairly simple in a different route.\n\n134\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.920\nYou either got an upvote or\n\n135\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.420\nyou got a downvote, and\nall the ones that were available.\n\n136\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.928\nSo they widdled it down\nin the first year or so\n\n137\n00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:15.300\ndown to 15, and finally in that second or\nthird years they widdled it down to five.\n\n138\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.790\nAnd then in the end only one stood up when\n\n139\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.140\nthey did the competition and\nwhat they did.\n\n140\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.170\nSo there were always positive\nvotes versus negative votes,\n\n141\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.200\neverything that ended up happening.\n\n142\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.350\nBut it's kinda funny,\n\n143\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.600\nsince we actually talked about\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n144\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.060\nWe think that that's the name\nof the actual algorithm.\n\n145\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.560\nIt's not.\n\n146\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.580\nThe name of the algorithm, NIST actually\nselected the ultimate replacement in 2001.\n\n147\n00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.380\nAnd it was now considered\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard, but\n\n148\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.380\nit was submitted by, and\nit was actually called Rijndael.\n\n149\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.131\nI can't tell you exactly how to pronounce\nit except I've seen it written out\n\n150\n00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:51.174\nphonetically so many times.\n\n151\n00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:54.444\nI know that's what the way\nthat they pronounce it.\n\n152\n00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:57.024\nSo the actual algorithm\nitself was done this way.\n\n153\n00:07:57.024 --> 00:08:01.899\nWhere they were able to take that, and\nnow Rijndael's considered the advanced\n\n154\n00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:06.863\nencryption standard in today's world,\nand format that we have as well, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:09.500\nNow, AES itself, at the very beginning,\n\n156\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.338\nit started off with the fact that the\nreplacement here had of course criteria,\n\n157\n00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:17.364\nsaid it has to begin\nwith 128 bit encryption.\n\n158\n00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:19.770\nAll these have to begin with that.\n\n159\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.645\nDES or Triple DES was actually a part of\nthat and Cherokee had mentioned this in\n\n160\n00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:29.895\na previous episode that even though the\noriginal DES took 16 rounds of encryption\n\n161\n00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:35.157\nand to do everything that it did, Triple\nDES then, it runs it through three times.\n\n162\n00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:39.430\nBut this is actually is 48 rounds of\nencryption if you do it three times.\n\n163\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.480\nBut it's actually even more\ncomplicated than that, Cherokee,\n\n164\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.000\nwhen you take a look at it.\n\n165\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.628\nWhat it does is the first 16 rounds\nit encrypts it one way with one key,\n\n166\n00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:50.546\nand if you actually use a second key for\nthe second round-\n\n167\n00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:51.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have options,\n\n168\n00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.368\nyou can use multiple keys.\n\n169\n00:08:52.368 --> 00:08:56.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what they do with that\nis that they actually decrypt it 16\n\n170\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.448\ntimes with the second key, and\nthen they take a third key, and\n\n171\n00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.504\nthey encrypt it again a third time,\n16 rounds with a third key.\n\n172\n00:09:04.504 --> 00:09:09.551\nSo it's encrypt, decrypt with another key,\nand encrypt with another key again,\n\n173\n00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:13.459\nto the point where it's like\nrunning a steak through a grinder.\n\n174\n00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:14.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n175\n00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.095\nthen running that particular chopped,\nthat ground meat,\n\n176\n00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:19.616\nback through the grinder again and\nyou kinda get a pate.\n\n177\n00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:22.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then running that through again,\n\n178\n00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:24.782\nand what you get is liquid\nmeat at that point, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:24.782 --> 00:09:27.439\n&gt;&gt; That's disgusting.\n&gt;&gt; But that's, sounds actually good to me,\n\n180\n00:09:27.439 --> 00:09:28.706\nbut I'm okay with that.\n\n181\n00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:31.790\nBut overall though,\nit's a fairly strong encryption.\n\n182\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.271\nAnd even today, DES has its particular\nplace as a symmetric key encryption, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:41.495\nNow the unusual thing about\nTriple DES that we have to\n\n184\n00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:43.895\nunderstand is its weakness.\n\n185\n00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:46.805\nIts weakness happens to be that\nyou can't keep one key and\n\n186\n00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:50.577\nyou can't keep reusing those keys,\nyou can't keep them for a long time.\n\n187\n00:09:50.577 --> 00:09:55.394\nSo Triple DES is today still\nconsidered a secured algorithm as\n\n188\n00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:58.090\nlong as you change the keys often.\n\n189\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.068\nIf you don't change your keys often,\nthen you're toast with Triple DES, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.169\nSo if you're one of those people and\nyou go yeah,\n\n191\n00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:06.902\nwe'll change it ten years from now,\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n192\n00:10:06.902 --> 00:10:09.572\nSo if you're gonna do this,\nthat's what you want to do.\n\n193\n00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:12.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you never wanna be predictable,\nand that's what could happen here is if\n\n194\n00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:16.270\nyou're using that same key over and\nover, you wanna always be non-random.\n\n195\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's one of the DES-\n&gt;&gt; Or random, I'm sorry.\n\n196\n00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:21.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna be considered\na little bit more random-\n\n197\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.829\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n198\n00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:23.059\n&gt;&gt; In that challenge to do that.\n\n199\n00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:26.011\nSo here they call it marginal protection,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.661\nBut design for more legacy today\nmore than anything else but\n\n201\n00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:33.686\nis still considered acceptable\nas far as level encryption goes.\n\n202\n00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:36.556\nSo remember there's\na weakness in this key which\n\n203\n00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:41.319\nis the idea that the lifetime of that key\nhas to be short, it can't be super long.\n\n204\n00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:46.327\nSo the one that went out\nthough is AES-128, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:51.756\nNow with AES-128 and\nall the subsequent versions, right?\n\n206\n00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:56.643\nThere's AES-128, 192, 256 and they\ncontinue prior now to go up and up, right?\n\n207\n00:10:56.643 --> 00:11:00.895\nAnd we'll talk about this one that they\nspecifically call out on the exam in\n\n208\n00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:02.457\njust a moment here, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:02.457 --> 00:11:07.685\nWith AES-128,\n128-bit block size that they do,\n\n210\n00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:13.991\nthis one has really one weakness that\nwe can know at this point, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:20.696\nThis one, AES-128, and\nthat is brute force attacking, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.860\nBrute force attacking is the only way.\n\n213\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.366\nNow if you go why is it susceptible\nto brute force attacking?\n\n214\n00:11:26.366 --> 00:11:29.471\nIt's because every algorithm is\nsusceptible to brute force attacking.\n\n215\n00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:33.076\nIf you think about the parameter of brute\nforce attacking, try every possible\n\n216\n00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:34.927\ncombination that there is-\n&gt;&gt; Eventually-\n\n217\n00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:35.995\n&gt;&gt; And eventually it's going\n\n218\n00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.443\nto come up with the right one, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:37.443 --> 00:11:39.169\nSo that's what they're pretty much saying,\n\n220\n00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:41.037\nwell eventually we're going to break it,\nokay?\n\n221\n00:11:41.037 --> 00:11:42.648\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n222\n00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:46.973\nSo remember that other ones really\ndo have some weaknesses to them, but\n\n223\n00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:51.734\nthe great thing about AES regardless\nof what version you're using, 192,\n\n224\n00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:56.153\n128, 256 itself, it really comes\ndown to the time that you have.\n\n225\n00:11:56.153 --> 00:12:00.128\nSo as long as you're willing to\nbreak the key in a billion years,\n\n226\n00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:02.790\nyou're probably perfectly fine, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.775\nIs really what it comes down to.\n\n228\n00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:09.363\nAnd that is because these keys are so big\nnow, or this particular encryption is so\n\n229\n00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:13.749\ndifficult that they're saying if you\nthink about it, it could possibly take\n\n230\n00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.956\nyou a billion years to crack some of\nthese keys just by trying brute force.\n\n231\n00:12:17.956 --> 00:12:21.006\nEven in today's computing,\nit'd take you a long time to do so.\n\n232\n00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:25.503\nSo if you go by what people say, that\nthe universe is 13 billion years old or\n\n233\n00:12:25.503 --> 00:12:29.371\nthe planet is 13 billion years old,\ntakes you a billion years so\n\n234\n00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:33.094\nif you can take 1/13 of that as\nfar as your time period goes,\n\n235\n00:12:33.094 --> 00:12:36.783\nsure that's an acceptable loss and\nyou can consider unsafe.\n\n236\n00:12:36.783 --> 00:12:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, like we were talking about\nin the previous episode, Ronnie,\n\n237\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.776\nwhere we were looking at\nthe impact of these algorithms,\n\n238\n00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:48.660\nare you gonna to be able to\ncompromise our systems before the,\n\n239\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.165\nmy data has become, well, useless or\nthe life expectancy has ran out.\n\n240\n00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.717\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbecause of the strength of this, right?\n\n241\n00:12:55.717 --> 00:12:59.051\nIt is considered quantum\ncomputing resistance.\n\n242\n00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:04.585\n&gt;&gt; And that is a, yeah, that's a new term,\nthe QCR is a neat little acronym there.\n\n243\n00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:05.443\n&gt;&gt; Nice and shiny acronym.\n\n244\n00:13:05.443 --> 00:13:09.912\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it means that even quantum\ncomputing has a hard time figuring out\n\n245\n00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:12.976\nevery possible combination\nhere on AES 128.\n\n246\n00:13:12.976 --> 00:13:15.955\nNow as you continue to go further up,\nthere is a,\n\n247\n00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:20.754\nI don't say it's a current battle, but\nat least for the last five years or so,\n\n248\n00:13:20.754 --> 00:13:24.025\nif you've gone on the Internet,\nand you can do this,\n\n249\n00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:28.390\ndo your favorite search engine and\ndo AES 128 versus AES 256, and\n\n250\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.970\nright at the top of the list if you do\nthat you actually see AES compromised,\n\n251\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.510\nAES 256 compromised,\ncompromised, compromised.\n\n252\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.762\nYou'll go, why are people still\nusing this thing, though, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:40.762 --> 00:13:41.663\nThen, if it's compromised?\n\n254\n00:13:41.663 --> 00:13:45.449\nAnd it's not compromised, they're saying\nexactly what I've been saying here.\n\n255\n00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:48.864\nIt can be compromised, but it's gonna take\nyou a billion years to compromise it.\n\n256\n00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:52.431\nAnd the reason behind this is\nthat there's a key rotation\n\n257\n00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:57.202\nthat 256 uses that's apparently trash,\naccording to Bill Schneider.\n\n258\n00:13:57.202 --> 00:13:59.155\n[LAUGH] Or Bob.\n\n259\n00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:00.284\n&gt;&gt; Bruce.\n&gt;&gt; Bruce.\n\n260\n00:14:00.284 --> 00:14:02.825\nBill.\nHe's going to chop my head off for that.\n\n261\n00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bruce Schneider says look,\n\n262\n00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:05.779\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n263\n00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:06.803\nHe says it himself.\n\n264\n00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:12.389\nThe way that the key rotation system\nworks inside of 256 is trash,\n\n265\n00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:14.908\nbut everybody knew it, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:17.910\nAnd he says even though you might\nhave a possibility breaking it,\n\n267\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.749\nthe only people that's been able\nto try and prove it are people\n\n268\n00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:24.042\nthat are theoretically saying that\nquantum computing could break it.\n\n269\n00:14:24.042 --> 00:14:27.567\nBut it will still take hundreds,\nif not thousands of years to break it.\n\n270\n00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:31.330\nSo he says don't worry\nabout security of 256.\n\n271\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.141\nHe says yeah, there's a theoretical\ncompromise on the mathematical and\n\n272\n00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.375\nacademic compromise.\n\n273\n00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.303\nBut we can't really worry\nabout that in our lifetime,\n\n274\n00:14:39.303 --> 00:14:41.667\nbecause it's not gonna be broken through.\n\n275\n00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:44.278\nSo you'll see in some instances, right?\n\n276\n00:14:44.278 --> 00:14:49.157\nWhere you might go always use AES-256, you\nmight end up working for a company that\n\n277\n00:14:49.157 --> 00:14:53.989\nsays, I'm using AES-128 and this is\nwhere you can surprise somebody, right?\n\n278\n00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:56.818\nWith your cyber-security\nninja skills here, is go,\n\n279\n00:14:56.818 --> 00:15:01.070\nI know why you're using that, cuz it\ndoesn't have the weakness of AES-256.\n\n280\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.499\nAnd you'll see a little eye pop up, like\nthe Spock eye, go, you know about that?\n\n281\n00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:07.556\nI say yes, it's the key rotation values.\n\n282\n00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:10.580\nAnd that guy might buy you lunch-\n\n283\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For all you know.\n\n284\n00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.216\nI'm joking.\n\n285\n00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:14.045\nIt may happen, but overall though,\n\n286\n00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:16.591\njust kinda realize that\nsome people will say that.\n\n287\n00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:20.245\nSo, what is special\nabout this AES-256 then?\n\n288\n00:15:20.245 --> 00:15:28.080\nAES-256 itself is again only successful\nto all essentially brute force attacks,\n\n289\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.590\nand AES-256 also is quantum\ncomputing resistant as well.\n\n290\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:38.006\nSo it's really strong, but what this\ndoes is it changes something for us and\n\n291\n00:15:38.006 --> 00:15:39.736\nits called AES counter mode.\n\n292\n00:15:39.736 --> 00:15:42.271\nWhat the heck is AS counter mode?\n\n293\n00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:46.240\nRemember that everything that we're\ntalking about DES, Triple DES here,\n\n294\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.979\nAS, they're all block cyphers,\nall of it, okay?\n\n295\n00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:53.974\nAS 256 here says we can actually take\nthe block cypher that we have now and\n\n296\n00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:57.237\nchange it back into a stream\ncipher if we want to.\n\n297\n00:15:57.237 --> 00:15:58.331\nGo figure.\n\n298\n00:15:58.331 --> 00:16:02.940\nIt's one of the things that makes\nit quirky, but it is out there.\n\n299\n00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.390\nAnd it is specifically called out for\nthe cyber security exam.\n\n300\n00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.630\nI would make sure that\nyou understand that,\n\n301\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.120\nthat AS, even though it's not\ntechnically or the counter mode.\n\n302\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.130\nIt's not technically a stream cipher.\n\n303\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.910\nIt does allow you to take block cipher and\nchange it into a stream cipher as well.\n\n304\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n305\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.908\nwhen we talked about which one we would\npick, I would pick atleast AES-128.\n\n306\n00:16:25.908 --> 00:16:30.520\nBut for higher security,\nI would still go with the AES-256.\n\n307\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.880\nNow, if you're completely paranoid and\nyou go.\n\n308\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.480\nI don't care if it's theoretical or not,\nI don't want that compromise to be there.\n\n309\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.570\nPick AES-128 and you'll still be fine.\n\n310\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.290\nThey pretty much said,\neither one works incredibly well.\n\n311\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.770\nYou'll get faster performance out of 128,\nitself.\n\n312\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.160\nSo just remember, that's kind\nof a thing that you still have.\n\n313\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.700\nAnd yeah, somebody in our chat here, we're\ntalking about DES a little bit earlier.\n\n314\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.550\nYou know he says, yeah there are still\nsome systems out there that are still\n\n315\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.358\nrunning as far as the length of time goes.\n\n316\n00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:06.260\nEven today DES, so hard to imagine but\nits possible but just kinda remember that.\n\n317\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.350\nSo but today recommend a strategy,\npick the better ones here.\n\n318\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.391\n&gt;&gt; And of course, there are algorithms\nthat we can't even cover in the show.\n\n319\n00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:18.110\nBecause well us as civilians Ronnie, we're\nnot even preview to that information.\n\n320\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.230\nSo governments,\nthat's another ball game there.\n\n321\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's funny how\nthe United States regulates encryption.\n\n322\n00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Did you now\n\n323\n00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.850\nhow it regulates encryption?\n\n324\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.158\n&gt;&gt; Well I don't know\nwhat standards they use.\n\n325\n00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:32.172\nBut I do know that they wouldn't like,\nthey do not let new manufactures and\n\n326\n00:17:32.172 --> 00:17:34.162\ndevelopers go past a certain level.\n\n327\n00:17:34.162 --> 00:17:38.697\nSo that they can atleast feel\nconfident within their abilities to\n\n328\n00:17:38.697 --> 00:17:40.350\ndecrypt if necessary.\n\n329\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.180\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, encryption,\ncertainly AS here, is not exportable.\n\n330\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.845\nSo, you can't sell equipment that has\na higher level of the encryption standard\n\n331\n00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:52.499\noutside the United States.\n\n332\n00:17:52.499 --> 00:17:55.233\nAnd the way that it's classified\nhere in the United States,\n\n333\n00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:57.200\nit's classified as munitions.\n\n334\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.310\nSo the same thing as selling weapons.\n\n335\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.360\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n336\n00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah so\n\n337\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.920\nthey don't let you do that\noutside the United States.\n\n338\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.400\nSo it's kinda weird but\nthat's how they keep the thing going.\n\n339\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.990\nThe secrecy that they need to atleast\nlegally that's how they explain it.\n\n340\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.090\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right now,\n\n341\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.100\nwe've talked about essentially now,\nthe symmetric types of key encryption.\n\n342\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.530\nBut remember that's not all that\ngoes in to the system here.\n\n343\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.517\nNow, we need to talk about of course,\nthen securing the idea here\n\n344\n00:18:25.517 --> 00:18:29.700\nof keys as well and\nthe idea of asymmetric encryption.\n\n345\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.049\nAnd that's when we deal with RSA and\n\n346\n00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:36.840\nDSA..Let's take a look at my screen\nagain,right here, RSA and DSA.\n\n347\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.997\nYou do need to know what RSA stands for\nmake sure you know that.\n\n348\n00:18:40.997 --> 00:18:43.865\nI know this is something\nthat sounds silly but\n\n349\n00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:46.440\nthat could be a point on the exam for you.\n\n350\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.290\nJust because you know\nexactly what RSA stands for.\n\n351\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.375\nSame thing with DSA.\n\n352\n00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n353\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.760\n&gt;&gt; May just be that simple where you go,\nI just need to what it stands for?\n\n354\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.120\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n355\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.580\nthey're not gonna ask you\nthe history of Ronald Rivest.\n\n356\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.330\nYou look at that RSA, the acronym,\n\n357\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.430\nthat's gonna be the names of\nthe people who worked together on that.\n\n358\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.040\nBut If you don't know who Ronald Rivist\nis then, look him up anyways.\n\n359\n00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.560\nHe's like the Father of cryptography\nthere, is some really cool stuff, so.\n\n360\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.180\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n361\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.260\nSo, let's talk about the RSA, right?\n\n362\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.250\nThe idea here of course is, the asymmetric\nencryption that we normally use\n\n363\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:25.500\nto help us to preserve the public and\nprivate key information that we need.\n\n364\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.200\nSo when we actually use\nsomething like this,\n\n365\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.960\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat we choose the ones that we need to.\n\n366\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.680\nAnd so, first of all, remember that this\nis an asymmetric type of encryption.\n\n367\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.340\nThat is actually gonna be key.\n\n368\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.450\nAnd then of course,\n\n369\n00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.830\nthere is a particular weakness to our SA,\nwhich is the Bitlink values.\n\n370\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.290\nThe earlier bitlink values of 768 today,\nand even 1,024,\n\n371\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.860\nare not considered as\nsecure as they should\n\n372\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.950\nbe for use between different\nsystems if you're using RSA.\n\n373\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:02.270\nSo you one, make sure that you understand\nthat that's actually part of what you have\n\n374\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.180\nto deal with here too.\n\n375\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.610\nSo if you can, avoid both of those,\nthe RSA-768 and 1024.\n\n376\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:17.100\nAnd as long as you're above that,\nthe RSA-248 or 372, 3072.\n\n377\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.300\nThat's probably the one\nthat you'll end up using.\n\n378\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.540\nWhen you are actually establishing\nsome type of asymmetric type\n\n379\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.110\nof encryption to use.\n\n380\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.910\nNow, remember that RSA\ncan actually encrypt\n\n381\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.500\ndata as well as also do digital signing.\n\n382\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.480\nSo it has the ability to do both.\n\n383\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.050\nBut when we use RSA to encrypt,\n\n384\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.830\nwe wanna encrypt just very small amounts\nof data because of the complexity level.\n\n385\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.000\nDSA is a totally different beast itself.\n\n386\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.890\nSo this stands for\nDigital Signature Algorithm,\n\n387\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.985\nDSA when we start to talk about that one\nit is only used for digital signing.\n\n388\n00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:53.919\nSo, this one's weakness is that\nit can't do real encryption.\n\n389\n00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.345\nIt's only used to sign\ndigital messages itself.\n\n390\n00:20:57.345 --> 00:21:01.620\nAnd on this one itself there's actually\na couple of different things too.\n\n391\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.070\nIt has where if you expose any part\nof the components inside of it,\n\n392\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.070\nit will crack very easily.\n\n393\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.750\nSo even though DSA has been out there for\na long time.\n\n394\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.280\nThey talk about entropy states,\n\n395\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.280\nuniqueness, secrecy of\nthe signature itself.\n\n396\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.035\nBut you have to be very careful about\nhow all of this information is handled.\n\n397\n00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:29.140\nIf any of that exposed,\nlike what the lifetime is of that key,\n\n398\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:34.540\nwhat the signature length, whatever\nit might be, then DSA is not good.\n\n399\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:40.940\nSo much if you try and do a comparison\nby searching out on the Internet here.\n\n400\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.290\nUsing your favorite search\nengine RSA versus DSA.\n\n401\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.160\nYou'll see that there is even\na lot of people today in\n\n402\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.000\nproduction network that says,\nwe're turning off DSA.\n\n403\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.404\nBecause we really don't see\nany real future value in it.\n\n404\n00:21:52.404 --> 00:21:55.251\nIt doesn't mean that\nthey're completely right.\n\n405\n00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:59.190\nIt just means that as they look at it\nthey don't see where it helps anything.\n\n406\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.390\nSo they've just turned it off instead.\n\n407\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.750\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you did use a really\nfancy term there, you said, entropy.\n\n408\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.330\nAnd if you guys, earlier I was\ntalking about that randomness.\n\n409\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.889\nThat's just another way to go ahead and\nexplain that.\n\n410\n00:22:09.889 --> 00:22:15.310\nYou'll probably see that in a lot\nof cryptography books as well.\n\n411\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, if you're gonna use this,\nmake sure you use 2048 or 3072.\n\n412\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.190\nIf you were gonna use something like DSA.\n\n413\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.970\nLet's get into the idea of protocols here,\nespecially the tumbling protocols too.\n\n414\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.831\nAnd that's why we actually added\nin protocols here at the end.\n\n415\n00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:33.516\nSSL and\nTLS we've already talked about that a bit.\n\n416\n00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:37.650\nWe even had an entire show\ntalking about SSL and TLS..\n\n417\n00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.490\nMake sure you check that show out, and\n\n418\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.160\nthat will help set up\nthe explanation that we need.\n\n419\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.400\nRemember that this is actually both.\n\n420\n00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.100\nIt does asymmetric as well as\nsymmetric encryption for us.\n\n421\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.045\nIt really does provide just\nabout everything that we need.\n\n422\n00:22:51.045 --> 00:22:54.432\nAnd we're connecting to websites today,\nyou're probably using TLS,\n\n423\n00:22:54.432 --> 00:22:56.090\nis what you're doing.\n\n424\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.910\nThere are different weaknesses here.\n\n425\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.170\nThere's an attack called a PODDLE attack.\n\n426\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.640\nThere are timing attacks.\n\n427\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.999\nFor those that remember the heart bleed\nattack on the open version of SSL,\n\n428\n00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:08.478\nthat was out there.\n\n429\n00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:11.590\nAll these are kinda weaknesses-\n&gt;&gt; Systems still today, who was it?\n\n430\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.499\nThere was a security report just generated\nthat there are thousands of systems today\n\n431\n00:23:15.499 --> 00:23:17.400\nstill susceptible to that attack.\n\n432\n00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's because people don't\nupdate their systems and they should have.\n\n433\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.630\nBut that's another story.\n\n434\n00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.200\n&gt;&gt; So, we're not going to\nget into that right now.\n\n435\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.863\nBut just remember that if you\nneed to fix something here,\n\n436\n00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:31.000\nyou wanna make sure that you're running\natleast TLS version 1.2 or higher.\n\n437\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.150\nDo not try and run anything lower that.\n\n438\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:39.980\nAnd that will kind of fix the heart bleed\ntype of weakness that you have there.\n\n439\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.550\nAs far as SSH goes, make sure you\nuse version 2 and never version 1.\n\n440\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.272\nAnd that is also a key.\n\n441\n00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:49.540\nVersion one has been compromised itself.\n\n442\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.528\nBut version two still continues to\nactually be strong and holds its place.\n\n443\n00:23:54.528 --> 00:23:57.303\nNow its susceptible\nweakness here is simple.\n\n444\n00:23:57.303 --> 00:24:00.510\nThere's a man in the middle attack that\nyou can work and password cracking.\n\n445\n00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.447\nAnd that is, the man in the middle attack\nis probably the most accepted one, right?\n\n446\n00:24:04.447 --> 00:24:10.380\nBecause, usually we're normally going\nto SSH into a router or switch.\n\n447\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.550\nAnd that means somebody could\nintercept that call in the middle and\n\n448\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.100\nthen pass it on, and actually\ncontinue to forward the information.\n\n449\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.490\nAnd you might not ever\nnotice the difference here.\n\n450\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.230\nAnd there is no way that\nyou can prove that, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.170\nNow, hopefully,\n\n452\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.720\nwhen you actually generate that encryption\nkey, everything should be fine.\n\n453\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.990\nAnd you're not supposed\nto be able to do that.\n\n454\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.680\nBut there are some implementations\nthat are susceptible to that.\n\n455\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.620\nAnd it's also susceptible to SYN flooding,\nas well.\n\n456\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.154\nSo everybody has their own whatever\nalgorithm that you're using,\n\n457\n00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:44.820\nhashing value that you're using,\nor whatever you are using.\n\n458\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.850\nThere are weaknesses to it.\n\n459\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.880\nOur goal behind this is fairly simple.\n\n460\n00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.600\nIt is to make sure we reduce that\nattack surface as much as possible.\n\n461\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.380\nBy trying to weed out the ones that we\nshouldn't use versus the ones we should.\n\n462\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I've even seen questions before\non exams were they specifically call out.\n\n463\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.655\nFor instance, you just described\na couple of different protocols to me.\n\n464\n00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:05.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n465\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.664\nBut what were their predecessors?\n\n466\n00:25:07.664 --> 00:25:12.050\nSo if you were presented with\na protocol that was used prior to\n\n467\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.695\nan unsecure protocol they might say,\nokay here we have Telnet.\n\n468\n00:25:16.695 --> 00:25:20.210\nWhat would be a secure option over Telnet?\n\n469\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.750\nOr if we're looking at HTTP okay,\nwhat would be the secure alternative?\n\n470\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.220\nAnd so\njust putting it in that context to be\n\n471\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.130\nyou might see something like\nthat to be ready for it.\n\n472\n00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes sense for\nus to understand that.\n\n473\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.740\nBut when you are now moving into\nthat realm of cyber security and\n\n474\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.760\ntrying to understand in that context,\nit is always about understanding\n\n475\n00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.780\nthe underlying technology,\nat least a little bit.\n\n476\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.240\nAnd remembering the choices that you\nmake or the choices that were made.\n\n477\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.480\nAnd whether or not that makes you\nsusceptible attacks is also a key\n\n478\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.490\nfactor in cyber security as well, okay?\n\n479\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.190\nBeing able to take a look at these\nalgorithms, getting more knowledge and\n\n480\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.180\nmore in depth into them,\nmakes you more of the cryptographer,\n\n481\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.060\nbut people love this stuff.\n\n482\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.900\nAnd there's a whole field and\nif you're really good at the math and\n\n483\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.330\nthere's a few people in our chatroom\nthat seem to love it which is great.\n\n484\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.560\nIf you're really good at it\nthere is a future for you.\n\n485\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.390\nEspecially if you're willing to try and\n\n486\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.840\ndevelop new cryptography because\nthe government is on another big push for\n\n487\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.530\nthe next cryptographic standard or the\nnext levels of cryptography that we need.\n\n488\n00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.690\nAnd the reason why, is that AS is kind of\n\n489\n00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.920\nthe lone holdout that really is\nstill quantum computing resistant.\n\n490\n00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.040\nWhere as these new ones that are now being\ndeveloped, they're starting to get there,\n\n491\n00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.420\nbut they're still in their infancy.\n\n492\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.540\nSo don't think that there's not a future\nin it, there is still a big future in it.\n\n493\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.860\nBecause I realize all these systems\nare gonna have to be replaced one day.\n\n494\n00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.870\nAnd you understanding the basis\nof it now is gonna help you out.\n\n495\n00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.642\nIt's gonna help you and\nyour company out as well,\n\n496\n00:26:55.642 --> 00:26:58.689\nas you start securing systems\ninside of your company.\n\n497\n00:26:58.689 --> 00:27:03.903\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you don't have to be\nan extreme mathematician, there are other\n\n498\n00:27:03.903 --> 00:27:08.561\nskill sets that are coveted by\nthe government when trying to hire.\n\n499\n00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:11.870\nThey're also looking for\nthings like linguists and\n\n500\n00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.982\nalso just pattern recognition.\n\n501\n00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:18.074\nSo sometimes you might be on the other\nside of things trying to extract different\n\n502\n00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:19.967\npatterns then things like that too so\n\n503\n00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:23.708\njust keep that in mind as you continue\ndown your IT career journey there.\n\n504\n00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.182\nRonnie, what are you thinking?\n\n505\n00:27:25.182 --> 00:27:28.028\nAny other final thoughts\nbefore we wrap this show up?\n\n506\n00:27:28.028 --> 00:27:30.643\n&gt;&gt; Well,\njust remember a key to this, right,\n\n507\n00:27:30.643 --> 00:27:33.340\nis understanding where the weaknesses are.\n\n508\n00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.090\nAs well as where to implement them and\n\n509\n00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.315\nbeing able to identify\nthem is also a key here.\n\n510\n00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:41.710\nIt's all gonna be a part of something\nthat you're gonna have to be able to do\n\n511\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.420\nrelatively intuitively when\nyou get into the field.\n\n512\n00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.210\nYou can't stop and\n\n513\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.040\ndo a search on everything, especially\nif it's time sensitive and critical.\n\n514\n00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.930\nThese are some of the basic facts that\nwe've been kind of harping on you\n\n515\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.980\nabout too.\n\n516\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.500\nSo make sure you understand\nthe impact of this, and\n\n517\n00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.650\nmake sure you actually continue to study,\nand\n\n518\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.060\nthat will get you through this portion\nof the Cisco cybersecurity exam.\n\n519\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you sir for\njoining us today.\n\n520\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.240\nI appreciate that very much,\nand I appreciate you guys for\n\n521\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.260\nbeing here with us today, but\nstay tuned we have some more\n\n522\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.020\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals\ninformation headed your way.\n\n523\n00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.700\nBut for this show, I'll sign off.\n\n524\n00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.990\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n525\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.780\n&gt;&gt;

Series.\n\n3\n00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.180\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590\nIn the last couple of episodes,\nwe were looking at different terms to\n\n5\n00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.340\nexplain processes and different\napplications within a Linux environment.\n\n6\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.640\nIn this show, we're gonna be\nlooking at Windows definitions and\n\n7\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.700\nwell, who'd better help us with that then,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.030\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nhere, as we continue on to take a look at\n\n10\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.020\nthe idea here of using\na host operating system and\n\n11\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.400\nunderstanding some of the impact\nthat security has on it.\n\n12\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.080\nAnd one of the places that we\ncan begin looking of course,\n\n13\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.830\nis in the operating system itself.\n\n14\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.590\nAnd some of the environments\nthat we have to worry about, and\n\n15\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.340\nof course performance factors.\n\n16\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.260\nSo we're gonna jump into a list of\njust different terms that you need to\n\n17\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.150\nunderstand.\n\n18\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.300\nAnd if you've been heavily into the Linux\nworld for one reason or another, and\n\n19\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.340\nyou haven't gone into Windows, well\nhere's kind of a little bit of a small,\n\n20\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.170\nyeah jump into the realm\nof some of the same\n\n21\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.630\ntypes of things you've got\nto be able to identify.\n\n22\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.302\nBut remember that if you're actually very\nfamiliar with it, well this is kind of\n\n23\n00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:19.812\na review process and it's just making\nsure that we understand these terms and\n\n24\n00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.441\ngetting ready for the exam as well.\n\n25\n00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.757\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool, what is the first\nterm that we'll be looking at, Ronnie?\n\n26\n00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:28.465\n&gt;&gt; So just like anything else, right,\nwe have to begin with a fundamental\n\n27\n00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:32.630\nunderstanding of what happens\nwhen an application launches.\n\n28\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.200\nAnd it's about the idea of a process\nwhen we first start up here and\n\n29\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.760\nstart to take a look.\n\n30\n00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.500\nWhen it comes down to all\npractical intents and\n\n31\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.130\npurposes, a process is really\na program running, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.813\nAnd when I mean that,\nI don't mean the program itself, but\n\n33\n00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.189\neverything else that's\ninvolved in that program.\n\n34\n00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.345\nBeing able to operate the way that it\nneeds to so it can function for what you\n\n35\n00:01:55.345 --> 00:02:00.440\nneed it to do and for what I need it to do\non our machines that's running as well.\n\n36\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.590\nSo normally what does this\ninclude as far as the process?\n\n37\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.310\nIt's what we call the idea of using\na virtual memory address space.\n\n38\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.709\nThe executable code of course,\nin other words the program itself.\n\n39\n00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.297\nThe open handle to system objects and\n\n40\n00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:18.483\nthis is when your program itself calls\nupon other elements that it needs.\n\n41\n00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:21.563\nWhether it's to file that exists\nsomewhere else or to a database or\n\n42\n00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.880\nwhether it's to the operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.860\nIt knows that it can call on that, and\nit actually has open handles to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.760\nSecurity context of course whose\npermissions are they running underneath.\n\n45\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330\nProcess identifier as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.375\nEnvironment variables that\nwe need to prioritize,\n\n47\n00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:43.560\nmaximum minimum working set sizes, and\neven a minimum of at least one thread.\n\n48\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.220\nSo, all of that is that super important\nwhen it comes down to everything that\n\n49\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.310\nyou need to know?\n\n50\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.937\nNo, but I just wanted you to know that\neven though you generally casually\n\n51\n00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:54.859\na lot of times we'll mention\nthere's a program running.\n\n52\n00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.836\nYou kinda think only about what,\nthe code itself, but\n\n53\n00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:00.690\nthere's a lot more to\nthat than just a code.\n\n54\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.605\nSo a running program takes\nup more resources and\n\n55\n00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:08.070\nhas more to do than just the idea\nof the code that's running, okay.\n\n56\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.040\nSo why does that help us and\nwhat does that do for us?\n\n57\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.160\nWhen a process or\nthe idea here of a program gets running.\n\n58\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.831\nWell, the first thing is when it launches,\nit gets put in the RAM and it takes up so\n\n59\n00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.399\nmuch RAM of your computer's, available\nRAM that it has, ready to go, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.676\n&gt;&gt; So, it's kind a little bursty there at\nthe beginning absorbing more than when\n\n61\n00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.650\nit's stabler.\n\n62\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit has to take up some space, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.215\nSo if I have four gigs RAM and\n\n64\n00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:37.960\ntakes up a portion of that four gigs\nof RAM to be able to run there, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.960\nAlong with that, though, if it only\nruns in RAM, that's perfectly fine.\n\n66\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.660\nBut usually, it has to do some processing,\nwhich means what?\n\n67\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.050\nIt also has to access the CPU, so\nwe need to also be able to take a portion\n\n68\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.890\nof that CPU to assign that so\nthat that process can run as well.\n\n69\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.744\nSo we don't have that luxury of\njust saying it needs this much.\n\n70\n00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:03.990\nIt takes this much.\n\n71\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.850\nWe just assign it,\nat least at the very beginning,\n\n72\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.360\nhowever it can divide the actual RAM,\nit divide sit up at that point.\n\n73\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.500\nSo it makes sense, right?\n\n74\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.400\nIf I have four programs running,\n\n75\n00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.170\nthen let's say that the operating\nsystem will take up a percentage.\n\n76\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.950\nThose other two programs will\ntake up a percentage and\n\n77\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.420\nthen the one that I just launched will\ntake up a percentage of that as well.\n\n78\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.930\nAnd so it tries to divide it up as\nevenly as it can at the beginning\n\n79\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.570\nwhen there's not a lot to actually do.\n\n80\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.280\nOnce though you actually get 40, 50,\n\n81\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.650\n60 processes running,\nit has to manage that very easily.\n\n82\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.570\nIt has to be able to keep track\nof all those things that go on.\n\n83\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.390\nSo it's one of these things\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n84\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.040\nThat process is, for us, is making sure\nthat we can also access CPU, memory,\n\n85\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.940\nas well as additional\nresources that it needs to.\n\n86\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.090\nAnd the great thing is that the program\nitself doesn't have to manage it himself.\n\n87\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.059\nHe can rely on the operating\nsystem to do it.\n\n88\n00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.420\nOkay, all right so, when we start\nkeeping a look at all that, right?\n\n89\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.520\nSo, this process that's running\nessentially is just trying to say, for\n\n90\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.060\nus to keep everything juggling,\n\n91\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.750\nwe need to have everything in\nline the way that we need to.\n\n92\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Now, when you say that\nit handles that for us and\n\n93\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.700\nwe don't have to worry about when\nthat processor program is closed and\n\n94\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.880\nfinished and it puts the available\n\n95\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.150\nsystem services back into per se\na pool for availability, right.\n\n96\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.600\nWell what happens, Ronnie,\n\n97\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.270\nis there ever an instance where\na particular application or program\n\n98\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.130\ndoesn't ever relinquish those resources\n&gt;&gt; It can happen and sometimes,\n\n99\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.660\nit's due to bad programming.\n\n100\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.340\nIt's what we call a leaky\napplication a lot of times or\n\n101\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.360\nit is malicious software\ndesigned not to do so.\n\n102\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.520\nSo if you do have a program that runs and\nyou can't close it out no matter what,\n\n103\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.650\nit's gonna continue to\neat those resources and\n\n104\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.760\nthen those resources won't be available.\n\n105\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.920\nBut the operating system generally is\nvery good that you have a program or\n\n106\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.570\nprocess closes out.\n\n107\n00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.410\nIt is able to remanage and redistribute\nall of those different resource that\n\n108\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.360\nneeds to among the existing\nprogram that's available.\n\n109\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.150\nSo that each program can get a little\nbit more, kind of hold it for\n\n110\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.560\nsome other program that's coming up and\nopen.\n\n111\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.510\nSo it can do that, but if a program is\ndesigned to say, I don't care what you do,\n\n112\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.190\noperating system, I'm going to\ncontinue to eat this amount of memory,\n\n113\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.230\nthen it's gonna do that.\n\n114\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.890\nIf it can continue to say I'm gonna eat\nmore memory, it will continue to try and\n\n115\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.100\neat up every available bit of free memory\nand that's what it's really hoping for\n\n116\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.544\nas far as malicious programs go.\n\n117\n00:06:31.544 --> 00:06:34.730\nA leaky application is\nin the program itself.\n\n118\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.050\nIt just says,\neven though I'm supposed to close out and\n\n119\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.110\nrelinquish that portions of it close out,\nbut the other portion, it says yeah,\n\n120\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.170\nI'm still gonna hold onto the RAM.\n\n121\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.840\nAnd again, that comes down to\nthe idea of just poor programming.\n\n122\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.390\nThat's the easiest way to think about\nsomething like that when it happens.\n\n123\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.570\n&gt;&gt; So one way we could combat that,\nI mean,\n\n124\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.310\nor if you had an end user calling you up\non the help desk ticket and saying look,\n\n125\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.940\nI've got a problem, I think it might\nbe with this particular program.\n\n126\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.540\nReally you would just go through\nthe process of elimination and\n\n127\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.360\nchecking out does it work in this\nwhen I launch this app or this app?\n\n128\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.460\nAnd then by using tools like Task Manager\nto look at those utilization resources,\n\n129\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.620\nwe can help identify and\nnarrow in on that particular problem.\n\n130\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually that's\na great place for us to begin.\n\n131\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.770\nSo let's take a look on my\nmachine as we start to examine\n\n132\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.620\nthe Task Manager a little bit too.\n\n133\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.414\nNow the great thing is Task Manager\nhas become an incredibly useful\n\n134\n00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:27.659\ntroubleshooting tool over the years.\n\n135\n00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.158\nWhen it really got its beginning,\nit gave us a very good little summary\n\n136\n00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:37.440\nof information, but now it really does\nhave a lot of valuable information.\n\n137\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.050\nAnd it begins with,\nwell this idea of processes here.\n\n138\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.190\nAnd notice that process\nis never kept by itself\n\n139\n00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.050\nas far as out of context of anything.\n\n140\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.754\nA process in what we're\nnormally looking at it, and\n\n141\n00:07:49.754 --> 00:07:53.877\nthe reason why we're looking at it,\nI should say, is because of performance.\n\n142\n00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:57.763\nAnd if you take a look at what normally\neffects performance on computer,\n\n143\n00:07:57.763 --> 00:08:00.326\nwell it's really these\nfour components here.\n\n144\n00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:06.400\nCPU, memory, disk usage itself,\nas well as the network usage.\n\n145\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.070\nAny impact to the four of those that is\nsignificant is normally what tells you and\n\n146\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.910\nwhat the user is going to\nexperience on their end\n\n147\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.320\nas being something that slows it down.\n\n148\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.290\nSo the CPU is running high constantly.\n\n149\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.530\nWell, that means its gonna slow down.\n\n150\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.737\nIf you don't have enough memory available\nand that's actually constantly high.\n\n151\n00:08:26.737 --> 00:08:29.385\nYour problem is you need more memory\ncuz everything is slowing down\n\n152\n00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:30.680\nbecause it has to.\n\n153\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.270\nSame thing with disk utilization.\n\n154\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.470\nThe more that you have to write to\nthe hard drive, well, it means that your\n\n155\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.920\ncomputer has to slow down because that's\nthe slowest component on your system.\n\n156\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.620\nA lot of times,\nit's gonna be a conventional hard drive.\n\n157\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.285\nNow, let me kind of caveat that.\n\n158\n00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:51.860\nIf you have a solid state drive, I don't\nthink it's quite as fast as RAM yet.\n\n159\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.310\nBut it's starting to get pretty\ndarn close to the speeds of RAM.\n\n160\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.520\nNow when I say that, right,\nit's in orders of magnitude.\n\n161\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.620\nIs way faster than the conventional\nhard drive, closer to speeds of RAM than\n\n162\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.060\nwhat a conventional hard\ndrive would ever give you.\n\n163\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.670\nBut the idea again is disk utilization,\nany time you have the right off to summon\n\n164\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.890\nmechanical like a conventional drive,\nthat's gonna slow your system down.\n\n165\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.390\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n166\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.660\nthen as you send data\noff of your computer.\n\n167\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.830\nIt has to slow down because it has to wait\non that component to actually send it out\n\n168\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.710\nand then receive messages\nback that says what?\n\n169\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.310\nI've successfully transmitted.\n\n170\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.170\nSo all of these things are actually\nslow downs that we can experience.\n\n171\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.270\nSo what you're hoping for here of course,\nis that, in any one of these processes\n\n172\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.540\nthat you're not consuming any\nmore than you really need to.\n\n173\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.290\nAnd the Windows operating system\ntries to do a very good job at this\n\n174\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.590\nwhen it takes a look here.\n\n175\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.320\nSo what you're seeing again,\nis the live time as it's going through and\n\n176\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.340\nit's saying here it is.\n\n177\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.120\nYou're using about this much of\nyour CPU and your RAM usage.\n\n178\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I was just joking around.\n\n179\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.800\nBut really you could be a superhero and\nsave someone's day if they have multiple\n\n180\n00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.440\nprograms running and\nthen you get one that hangs up on you.\n\n181\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.400\nInstead of having to reboot that\nentire system, you can use a very\n\n182\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.750\nsimple tool like this just to end that\none particular process or program.\n\n183\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.980\nWithout a coworker losing all their\nwork that they've been working on for\n\n184\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.016\nthe past hour or so.\n\n185\n00:10:14.016 --> 00:10:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that make sense, so\nlet me launch up the Edge browser here for\n\n186\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.800\njust a moment.\n\n187\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.890\nAnd we'll go to something non-political\nhere which is ITPROTV's website instead,\n\n188\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.280\nso that we can see this.\n\n189\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.140\nNow what Cherokee is talking\nabout is something like this.\n\n190\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.910\nNotice that my CPU usage just for\nthis browser jumped up to like 42% but\n\n191\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.260\nnot it actually jumped back to down.\n\n192\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.660\nIt's only using about 1 or 2%.\n\n193\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.310\nI can't chase it far enough.\n\n194\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.560\nNow it's actually gone all the way down\nto zero as we've kind of relaxed and\n\n195\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.000\nthere it goes back up.\n\n196\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.370\nSo if you have a some type of program\nthat is constantly eating that,\n\n197\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.780\nyou can select it and you can either\nright-click on it and go to End Task.\n\n198\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.348\nAnd now that will take that away.\n\n199\n00:10:56.348 --> 00:11:01.450\nApparently I wasn't able\nto do it fast enough.\n\n200\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.240\nSo, there we go.\n\n201\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.010\nSee look, it's still not actually\nletting me get out of it, Cherokee.\n\n202\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.440\nNotice that, that no matter what\nhappened it took a couple of times and\n\n203\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440\nit's still going on.\n\n204\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.540\nSo, maybe-\n&gt;&gt; I think there's away to\n\n205\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.480\nfreeze that screen.\n\n206\n00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.590\nIf we look maybe under videos-\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n207\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.570\nWell nope.\n\n208\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.640\nSo is still just running in\nthe background there somewhere.\n\n209\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.740\nAnd then finally got rid of it.\n\n210\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.896\nI finally was able to catch is when, who\nknows how the other process I turned off.\n\n211\n00:11:22.896 --> 00:11:24.056\n&gt;&gt; Good for you [LAUGH].\n\n212\n00:11:24.056 --> 00:11:28.722\n&gt;&gt; But you can kind of see that that's the\ninformation that you really can get when\n\n213\n00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:31.700\nyou start to take a look\nat the idea of the process.\n\n214\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.990\nAnd now if I expand out some like\nTask Manager, notice this, Cherokee.\n\n215\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.980\nIs that if you kind of see this where\nit's Task Manager, Task Manager.\n\n216\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.300\nI'm not running it twice but\n\n217\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.440\nit's appearing twice in the system\nis what you're seeing there.\n\n218\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.360\nAnd this is the same thing we had inside\nof Linux where we talked about the idea of\n\n219\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.570\nforking and it is a child process for us\nthat's really running in the background.\n\n220\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.820\nSo it's still using those same thing.\n\n221\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.780\nRegardless of the operating system,\n\n222\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.910\nwe still have that continual\nnature of what it's doing there.\n\n223\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.459\nAnd it really is kind of key for\nus to understand that.\n\n224\n00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.145\nNow, even though this is one\nof the things we look at,\n\n225\n00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.810\nit's not the only thing\nwe need to look at.\n\n226\n00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.280\nAs I click on Performance now, we can see\na couple of other things more in summary,\n\n227\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.810\nlet me zoom out a little bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n228\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.530\n&gt;&gt; I love the way that they've really just\nspend the extra time in developing this\n\n229\n00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.060\nGUI here.\n\n230\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.050\nIt's so pretty now, the colors and\nit's just in easy-to-read format here.\n\n231\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.916\nLooking at older operating\nsystem versions in Windows.\n\n232\n00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:36.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does make it easier to\nfind and that's kind of the key, right?\n\n233\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.510\nIs that the utilities are now more\nuseful for everyone and not just for\n\n234\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.260\nthe technician to be able to spot things.\n\n235\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.140\nBut what we wanna look at is really\ndown here in this grouping of well.\n\n236\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.040\nDifferent sets of statistics and different\nthings that we're taking a look at.\n\n237\n00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.130\nNotice that on my computer,\n\n238\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.160\nI can tell that 70 processes\nare currently running right now.\n\n239\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.440\nAnd then there are threads and\nthere are handles too, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.880\nNow when we start talking\nabout the idea of threads,\n\n241\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.020\nyou gotta remember that this\nis a little bit different.\n\n242\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.650\nA process or an application when it's run,\nit takes up RAM.\n\n243\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.290\nThe idea of the thread though\nis how much or how often or\n\n244\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.620\nhow many times, I'm trying to think of the\nbest way to describe this, which I can't.\n\n245\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.300\nThat particular process needs\nto access the CPU, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.440\nSo the more threads that there are,\n\n247\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.450\nmeans that that process needs to access\nthe CPU more often, is what you'll see.\n\n248\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.470\nEvery process has at least one thread.\n\n249\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.830\nIt says I need to access that CPU and\nthat's all it needs.\n\n250\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.697\nBut it could be that multiple times inside\nof a single process that you're calling\n\n251\n00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:48.318\non the CPU, multiple times inside of that.\n\n252\n00:13:48.318 --> 00:13:50.640\nAnd that's what has to happen, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.720\nSo it creates more and\nmore threads to be able to communicate and\n\n254\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.590\nget all that information back.\n\n255\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.540\nSo this is not uncommon that you\nsee something like 70 processes and\n\n256\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.440\na lot more threads.\n\n257\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.680\nBecause every program could be saying I\nneed to access the CPU more often and\n\n258\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.380\nit really does it in terms of bandwidth.\n\n259\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.980\nIt's kind of weird how these\nprocesses ended up working.\n\n260\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.810\nBut it could be that a program says look,\nI need to access the CPU,\n\n261\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.520\nI need to get about 100\nmegahertz of this process time.\n\n262\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.460\nAnd it can do it and\nit might do 50 the next time.\n\n263\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.640\nIt might do 300 the next time for\nall we know.\n\n264\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.360\nBut the more threads that there are,\nthe more active that your CPU probably\n\n265\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.550\nis going to be as far as what it\nactually needs to do here, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.860\nSo that is kind of another key for us.\n\n267\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:40.030\nWhat we're hoping for and what we don't\nwant to see, right, is that you have\n\n268\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:45.916\nvery few processes and a tremendous,\nan insanely tremendous amount of threads.\n\n269\n00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:51.500\nNow, there is a ratio in how they\nare able to figure out how to do this.\n\n270\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.380\nDo I know how to do that?\n\n271\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.000\nNo, okay, so I can't tell you.\n\n272\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.240\nBut there has to be a way that they\ncan actually see when you're doing it.\n\n273\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.180\nSo if you continue to eliminate\nthe number of processes.\n\n274\n00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.760\nIn theory,\nthe thread count should go down.\n\n275\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.700\nThat's the only thing I can tell you,\nokay?\n\n276\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.408\nIf it continues to go up regardless of the\nnumber of processes that you [INAUDIBLE]\n\n277\n00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:11.236\nmade, you're down to 30.\n\n278\n00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:16.310\nAnd you're still getting 2,000 threads or\nhigher or more, then you probably need to\n\n279\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.670\nfigure out why that one particular\napplication is trying to peg the CPU out.\n\n280\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.590\nAnd that normally does indicate\nsome type of malicious software\n\n281\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.910\nthat may be happening, too, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.710\nSo threads and\n\n283\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:33.240\nprocesses go hand in hand when you do\nstart to take a look at those combined.\n\n284\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.690\nThe other one here is Handles.\n\n285\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.450\nNow Cherokee,\nwe've talking about this a little earlier.\n\n286\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.440\nWhat about handles here?\n\n287\n00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.080\nDo you know much about\nthe idea of using handles?\n\n288\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.810\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n289\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'd love for you to explain that to me.\n\n290\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.350\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo\n\n291\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.640\nlet's talk about handles\njust a little bit here.\n\n292\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.060\nBecause it's actually there, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.386\nI don't think I have it in my list or\nif I do, there it is, okay.\n\n294\n00:15:52.386 --> 00:15:53.839\nIt is a little bit further\n[INAUDIBLE] list, but\n\n295\n00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:55.191\nlet's talk about why we're here, okay.\n\n296\n00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:56.756\nSo it doesn't make sense\nto talk about it later.\n\n297\n00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.346\nThe idea of handles for\n\n298\n00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:02.874\nus is that every process not only\nneeds to access the CPU, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:02.874 --> 00:16:05.389\nWe know that every process takes\nup a certain amount of RAM.\n\n300\n00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:08.446\nSo anytime you see RAM\nutilization on the hardware,\n\n301\n00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:10.840\nthink about the idea of RAM, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.320\nAny time you think about threads, think\nabout the process utilization of CPU,\n\n303\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.050\nokay?\n\n304\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.810\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n305\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Then, when you talk about handles,\n\n306\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.810\nthis is where it becomes\na little bit more unusual.\n\n307\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.510\nThis is when a process says, hey,\nI need to access a resource.\n\n308\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.340\nThe resource can be the operating system.\n\n309\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.790\nSo, it says, hey,\noperating system, I need this.\n\n310\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.150\nAnd the operating system tries to do that.\n\n311\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.260\nSo, it can actually rely on\nthe operating system a lot more or\n\n312\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.560\nit could be something like a client trying\nto reach out to a database program and\n\n313\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.770\nsaying, hey,\ncan you get me more information on this?\n\n314\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.850\nCan you feed me more information here?\n\n315\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.640\nCan you do this?\n\n316\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.010\nNo, this is what's happening too.\n\n317\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.860\nNow you might wanna like,\nwhy are there so many more handles,\n\n318\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.940\nwell think about all of the things that\neven task manager is calling on right now.\n\n319\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.030\nSo even in the processes, task manager's\none of those processors, right?\n\n320\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.620\nBut look at all the information\nthat's stored here, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.620\nAll of these are stored in different\nlocations on the operating system,\n\n322\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.530\nall the valuable information.\n\n323\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.550\nSo now,\nif we go back to the performance here,\n\n324\n00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:17.310\nit makes sense that that one application,\nsuch as task manager Says what?\n\n325\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.510\nI need it from here, here,\nhere, here, here, and here.\n\n326\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.070\nOkay?\n\n327\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.126\nI need it from all these locations.\n\n328\n00:17:21.126 --> 00:17:22.501\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like pulling all these-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n329\n00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:24.240\n&gt;&gt; Components to see, what are you doing?\n\n330\n00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080\nWhere are you at?\n\n331\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nTrying to get all that information back,\n\n332\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.190\nand so\nnow you can see where an application says,\n\n333\n00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.040\nI need all these resources.\n\n334\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.330\nSo the more handles means\nthe more resources that\n\n335\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.430\nparticular program may\nbe pulling on as well.\n\n336\n00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.480\nWhether it's the operating system or\ndatabase, or another program, or\n\n337\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.030\nfile somewhere, it's actually doing it.\n\n338\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.060\nOkay and so that's kind of a key\nin understanding the usage and\n\n339\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.060\nthe utilization too.\n\n340\n00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.490\nAlso taking a look here at\nthe idea of performance,\n\n341\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.560\nremember that what we're looking at and\n\n342\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.730\nof course it's CPU and RAM, the majority\nof the times in today's world.\n\n343\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.990\nDisk utilization, especially if you're\nstill running conventional hard drive and\n\n344\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.920\nyou might be wondering,\nwhy do you keep harping on that?\n\n345\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.065\nBecause if you wanna see the speed\nof your computing jump up 100-fold,\n\n346\n00:18:10.065 --> 00:18:14.360\nchange your conventional hard drive\nover to a solid state drive and\n\n347\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.390\nsee how fast the computer fills that\nwill just be beyond your amazement.\n\n348\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.460\nAnd you might be going,\nI've done that Ronnie, I didn't feel that.\n\n349\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.760\nNow, go to a computer running\na conventional hard drive and\n\n350\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.280\nsee if you can sit down for more than\ntwo minutes without getting frustrated.\n\n351\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.440\nI know because I didn't actually go,\n\n352\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.570\nwhen I switched over to\nthis particular computer.\n\n353\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.890\nI was like,\nit's not as fast as I thought it would be.\n\n354\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.480\nBut I sat down at a regular-\n&gt;&gt; Got spoiled.\n\n355\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n356\n00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:44.508\nI sat down at a regular conventional\n&gt;&gt; A computer that had\n\n357\n00:18:44.508 --> 00:18:48.040\na conventional hard drive on it,\nI couldn't believe how slow it felt.\n\n358\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.120\nAnd so,\nyou don't notice the speed in that way.\n\n359\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.360\nYou notice it when you try and go back,\nand go this was a great computer.\n\n360\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.540\nAnd then you're like, are you joking?\n\n361\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.490\nWhy is this thing so slow?\n\n362\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.860\nAnd it's not this slow, it's now,\nyou didn't realize how much that speed\n\n363\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.050\nincrementalism actually happened to you\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n364\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.980\nthose are kinda some of the big\nthings that we should be aware of.\n\n365\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.800\nAnd it really is pushing and pointing us,\nright, in cybersecurity to look at\n\n366\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.750\nthe fundamental things that we can\nidentify when something is happening on\n\n367\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.000\na computer, especially with some\ntype of malicious software.\n\n368\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.708\nSomething going on on our machine, it\nreally does impact performance right away\n\n369\n00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:27.099\nto the point where we need to be able to\nidentify that and be able to stop it.\n\n370\n00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:32.397\nUsing the ending task is probably the one\nof the best things that we can do.\n\n371\n00:19:32.397 --> 00:19:36.210\nAll right, so some other terms\nhere that we have to get to.\n\n372\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.260\nThe next one is,\nwhat do we take a look at here.\n\n373\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.930\nMemory application, the idea of actually\nunderstanding memory allocation.\n\n374\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.730\nMemory allocation is about effectively\nusing the memory that's available.\n\n375\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.070\nAt one point, memory management\nhad to be a bit more aggressive,\n\n376\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.770\nas we started buying more and\nmore programs, but\n\n377\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:01.330\nthe bit size of our operating system,\n32 bit, only gave us so much memory.\n\n378\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.080\nAnd then of course, you actually had\nprograms that would take up much\n\n379\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.120\nmore memory, and now you have programs\nthat take up a tremendous amount of memory\n\n380\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.370\nto where it really doesn't\nfeel like it can operate well.\n\n381\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.780\nSo the Windows memory manager though is\nactually fairly a good memory manager.\n\n382\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.300\nI'm not gonna say it's\nthe best one in the world,\n\n383\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.810\nbut it's a fairly decent memory manager\nthat pretty much does I need to be able to\n\n384\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:30.880\nkeep a balance of how much RAM I have\nto be able to operate as well as what\n\n385\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.310\nthe end user feel like performance and\nthat essentially what it comes down to.\n\n386\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.650\nThe way it does it is by\nallocating enough memory for\n\n387\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.120\nthat program to run and to be able to\neffectively manage that if the program\n\n388\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.960\ncloses down to reclaim that memory and\nto do everything that we need to.\n\n389\n00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.740\nNow, we can affect the memory management\nin a couple of different ways.\n\n390\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.800\nThe way that we can do it is\nby giving it more memory.\n\n391\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.030\nThat's kinda the key, right?\n\n392\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.190\nIf I can physically add in more RAM,\n\n393\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.700\nthe memory manager doesn't\nhave to be as aggressive.\n\n394\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.680\nBut at the same time,\nthat means it costs more too.\n\n395\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.490\nBut the other way, of course, is through\nwhat we call the idea of the swap file or\n\n396\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.930\nfor us\n&gt;&gt; Paging file?\n\n397\n00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.950\n&gt;&gt; Paging file, yeah, inside of Windows.\n\n398\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.968\nSo I always use swap file,\nI don't know why.\n\n399\n00:21:12.968 --> 00:21:16.295\nSo let's go ahead and take a look and\nsee what we can find in that one.\n\n400\n00:21:16.295 --> 00:21:22.781\nSo on my computer here,\nif I right click and I go up to system.\n\n401\n00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.440\n&gt;&gt; Got drilled down a little bit for\nthis one.\n\n402\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd inside of system,\n\n403\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.560\nhere, the Window,\nI need Advanced System Settings,\n\n404\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.570\ninside of Advanced System Settings,\nunderneath Performance.\n\n405\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.130\nRemember, everything that we deal\nwith here has to do with performance.\n\n406\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.400\nAnd we're looking for\nwhat we call the Virtual Memory Settings.\n\n407\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.970\nAnd inside of the virtual memory settings,\nyou're gonna go to the advanced tab and\n\n408\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.690\nit's right here on the virtual memory.\n\n409\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.290\nSo if I click change,\nit's automatically managing this.\n\n410\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.850\nNow we're on the paging file\nessentially a portion of the hard drive\n\n411\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.620\nthat the operating system\ncan treat like memory.\n\n412\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.400\nIf it doesn't have enough RAM to\nactually run the way that it needs to.\n\n413\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, do you ever change yours and\nmanually put in specifications or\n\n414\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.850\nlimits here?\n\n415\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.850\n&gt;&gt; I used to.\n\n416\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.450\nOkay.\n\n417\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.100\nYes, I used to do that.\n\n418\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.900\nAnd that is because sometimes,\nyou've gotta remember, right, the more\n\n419\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.530\noften that you access this paging file,\nthe slower your system is going to get.\n\n420\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.810\nSo the recommendation is normally one and\n\n421\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.810\nhalf times the amount\nof RAM that you have.\n\n422\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.570\nSo you have eight gigs of RAM\non your computer interior right?\n\n423\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:37.360\nThat's what should be 12 gigs of hard\ndrive space that you should allocate.\n\n424\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.060\nThat can be a lot for\na particular hard drive.\n\n425\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and especially because the price\nof memory has gone down and its easier\n\n426\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.531\nlike you mentioned number one to put more\nmemory, physical memory into our system.\n\n427\n00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:50.934\nIt's not as beneficial per se as if we\nwere dealing with machine with a very\n\n428\n00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:54.924\nlow amount of memory, where it\nwould be a little more applicable.\n\n429\n00:22:54.924 --> 00:22:56.484\n&gt;&gt; Well, and because it really is,\n\n430\n00:22:56.484 --> 00:23:00.443\nit's gotten better over time as far as the\nmemory management goes, notice down here\n\n431\n00:23:00.443 --> 00:23:04.855\nat the bottom where it actually has the\nminimum recommended and currently allowed.\n\n432\n00:23:04.855 --> 00:23:07.740\nMine says, currently allocated,\nand this is using.\n\n433\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.750\nWell, Window's doing it.\n\n434\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:16.520\nThey're saying, look Ronnie, you're\nonly using half the size that I'm at,\n\n435\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.100\neven though this is what's recommended I'm\nonly going to use half the size of this.\n\n436\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.240\nAnd hat means it's dynamic.\n\n437\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.710\nIt can expand out to\nthat size if it needs to.\n\n438\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.030\nBut currently allocated,\nit doesn't need to.\n\n439\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.430\nSo when you actually choose to manually\nset this up, you can uncheck that and\n\n440\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.990\nthen you can create a custom size if you\nwant to, or even say no paging file.\n\n441\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.700\nIf you do no paging file,\nyou've got to be careful cuz\n\n442\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.760\nit might actually eat up more RAM\nthan you expected to eat up as well.\n\n443\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.376\nBut just kind of realize that you can\nmanage that on your own if you need to,\n\n444\n00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:51.446\nbut usually that's the way that you tend\nto see that idea a little bit more, too.\n\n445\n00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:52.311\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n446\n00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:57.598\nwhat we were doing there was we were\nkind of having the operating system.\n\n447\n00:23:57.598 --> 00:24:02.364\nWe're kind of playing a trick on\nthe operating system by telling\n\n448\n00:24:02.364 --> 00:24:06.300\nit to use a portion of my\nhard disk drive as memory.\n\n449\n00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.660\nSo that's why we're allocating a portion\nof that drive to appear as holding\n\n450\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.760\nlesser, was it data, not at rest.\n\n451\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.270\n&gt;&gt; At rest.\n\n452\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, so if we're not accessing\nit frequently, then it's gonna go ahead,\n\n453\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.230\nthat data, move it on over, onto that\nhard drive space, that paging file,\n\n454\n00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.520\nso it can free up the physical memory\nto use, to make our systems faster.\n\n455\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.960\nBut, you also mentioned about\nthe difference between solid state\n\n456\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.410\nversus our classical drives, so,\n\n457\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:45.690\nwould it be beneficial to point that\npaging file to a solid state drive?\n\n458\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to point it to something\nif you're gonna use it at all, so\n\n459\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.710\nif that's the only thing you have, you-\n&gt;&gt; If you have a hybrid system, and\n\n460\n00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.800\nyou had two different hard drives.\n\n461\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna point it to the fastest\ndrive that you have available,\n\n462\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.490\nso, yes, that's what I would say,\nis that you would definitely do that.\n\n463\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.730\nDon't point it to the slowest drive\nyou have, you will not be satisfied.\n\n464\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.230\nIf you have the fastest\nmemory in the world,\n\n465\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.820\nand you are using a paging\nfile that's slow,\n\n466\n00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.560\nit's still gonna operate at the slowest\nthing, which is gonna be the paging file.\n\n467\n00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.590\nSo, always try to make it actually work\nat the fastest speed it possibly can,\n\n468\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.720\nwhich you're gonna be your fastest drive\nthat you have available to you, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.020\nSo that's a part of that concept\nthat we also have to think about.\n\n470\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.180\nNow, the other one,\n\n471\n00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:28.020\nthe other concept here that we have to\ndeal with is the idea of a registry, okay?\n\n472\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.767\nLet's go and\ntake a look at my computer and\n\n473\n00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:36.166\nlet me see if I can get\naccess to the registry So\n\n474\n00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:40.465\nI wanna launch up the command prompt and\nfrom here, I can type in regedit.\n\n475\n00:25:44.215 --> 00:25:48.730\nAnd here is what the registry\nessentially looks like.\n\n476\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.560\nIt's kind of a hierarchical database here,\n\n477\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.010\nlet's see if I can not full screen that\nand we get access to it a little bit more,\n\n478\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.910\ncollapse all these things down so\nthat we can see it.\n\n479\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.550\nApparently, I've been playing in there and\n\n480\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:04.020\nonly leaves it at the last state\nthat it was in when you take a look.\n\n481\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.030\nAll right, so what is this thing?\n\n482\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.530\nIt's a database of databases,\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n483\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.370\n&gt;&gt; Database of system settings.\n\n484\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's databases of databases.\n\n485\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.170\nEvery single system that\nwe have on our computer\n\n486\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.835\nhas a data base of where everything is,\nokay?\n\n487\n00:26:18.835 --> 00:26:22.320\nAnd the registry essentially gives\nus the ability to take a look at\n\n488\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.680\nall those data bases, so that's why I call\nit a data base of data bases here, okay?\n\n489\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.442\nNow, in this particular idea,\nthe registry editor,\n\n490\n00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:33.345\nthere are sometimes when you can actually\nhave a registry setting to change or\n\n491\n00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:35.520\nyou can tweak your own registry settings.\n\n492\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.085\nAnd you have to be careful,\n\n493\n00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:41.320\nbecause you can damage the computer as\nfar as getting back access into it.\n\n494\n00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.590\n&gt;&gt; It is really easy, though, to create\na back up of these settings before, so\n\n495\n00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:50.065\nyou're not permanently damaging anything,\nit's very, very easy, it's,\n\n496\n00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:51.700\nI mean literally two steps.\n\n497\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.591\nYou just go into file,\nexport, and you're done,\n\n498\n00:26:54.591 --> 00:26:57.455\nand you can import that if\nyou mess it up too badly.\n\n499\n00:26:57.455 --> 00:27:01.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, hopefully you'll remember\nwhere you put that particular export, but\n\n500\n00:27:01.658 --> 00:27:03.370\nthat's to key it, right?\n\n501\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:09.360\nSo, the Registry Editor gives you\na single source that you can access and\n\n502\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.120\nchange any configuration\nsetting that you want to.\n\n503\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.720\n&gt;&gt; But we're not recommending just\nto go change your decimal background\n\n504\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.400\nthrough regedit.\n\n505\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.790\nIt's on a, you really have to feel\ncomfortable knowing what it is that you're\n\n506\n00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.960\nchanging, I wouldn't trust any source\nonline, I've actually seen websites where\n\n507\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.240\npeople put some really bad\nadvice just to be mean online.\n\n508\n00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.000\nSo, I would go with your vendor, like\nMicrosoft, for any kind of registry edits.\n\n509\n00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just be careful here, right?\n\n510\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.000\nThe key, though,\nis that if we do spot something,\n\n511\n00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.420\nif there's any changes that are made\nto your system that you can't identify\n\n512\n00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.590\nthrough the regular gooey interface,\nit will show up here, and\n\n513\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.430\nthat's what it comes down to So\nwhat are the databases here?\n\n514\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.380\nThis helps us to see every application-\n&gt;&gt; Our five hives.\n\n515\n00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it gives us that ability,\n\n516\n00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.870\nof course, to understand what's\nactually installed on the computer.\n\n517\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.560\nThis of course is your current user for\nprofile who is logged in right now.\n\n518\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.070\nThis gives us information\nabout the hardware that\n\n519\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.450\nwe can control through\nthe operating system.\n\n520\n00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.580\nEvery user that's ever logged on,\nthey have their own little\n\n521\n00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.560\nsetting here as well,\nso that as you log on,\n\n522\n00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.700\nit takes their settings and\nmoves them up to the current user.\n\n523\n00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.390\nAnd then right now, whatever's the current\nrunning operating system configuration is\n\n524\n00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.710\nalso gonna be setup right here,\nas far as the software goes, and\n\n525\n00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.130\nthe operating system too.\n\n526\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.390\nUsually, if there's anything that's\nchanging, it's gonna be underneath this\n\n527\n00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:35.570\nlocal key right here, the local machine,\nand underneath SYSTEM at some point.\n\n528\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.840\nAnd this is where you gonna do\na lot of the changes that are set,\n\n529\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.950\nbut don't, again, mess around\nthis unless you really have to.\n\n530\n00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.200\nNow, if you're told to do it you\nneed to be familiar with this, but\n\n531\n00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.220\njust realize that this is where you go,\nall of those configurations and\n\n532\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.960\nthose settings for your operating system,\nthis is how Windows finds it, okay?\n\n533\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.662\nSo it's really not designed for you and\nI go to pick them out through it,\n\n534\n00:28:56.662 --> 00:28:58.159\nthat they give us an interface to do it?\n\n535\n00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:02.821\nYes, but essentially as when Windows says,\nI need to change this, it knows how to go\n\n536\n00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:08.140\nthrough this particular system to be able\nto go add it and do whatever we need to.\n\n537\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.150\n&gt;&gt; And the beauty behind like\ncentralized file storage,\n\n538\n00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.680\nwell, when you get any kind\nof malware like Rootkits,\n\n539\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.410\nthey're down at this low-level\nportion of your operating system.\n\n540\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:25.110\nIn my opinion, it's just better to\nre-image or wipe that system and\n\n541\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.102\nstart from scratch, and\n\n542\n00:29:26.102 --> 00:29:29.400\nthat's just my experience,\nthey kind of creep back up, if you will.\n\n543\n00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.250\nThose symptoms start to reappear,\neven if you go in and fix the registry,\n\n544\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.390\nsometimes that can happen, so just keep\nthat in mind in a production environment.\n\n545\n00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.530\nThat's very common and why people might\neven setup a file storage system.\n\n546\n00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very true, this is one of\nthe most powerful utilities that you\n\n547\n00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.500\nhave on your computer that you\ncan mess up very easily, so\n\n548\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.640\nbe very careful with this\nparticular system here.\n\n549\n00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.760\nWe really have two terms\nthat we need to talk about,\n\n550\n00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.100\njust briefly here at the end\nof our episode here, one is\n\n551\n00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.530\nwe want to talk about the use of WMI, the\nWindows Management Instrumentation set.\n\n552\n00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.290\nEverything on your computer,\nthere's a logging form,\n\n553\n00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.310\nthere is some type of storage and\n\n554\n00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.490\nlogging and everything that ever\nhappens on your computer, it's logging.\n\n555\n00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.400\nBut we can also control that and have the\ninformation sent offsite somewhere, and\n\n556\n00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.320\nthis is where the WMI helps\nus to be able to do that and\n\n557\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.765\nhelp us to filter that data down to find\nexactly what we need to be able to do.\n\n558\n00:30:23.765 --> 00:30:27.540\nSo we are here on a centralized management\nenvironment, this is great stuff for\n\n559\n00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.280\nyou to find what exactly\nwhat you looking to do and\n\n560\n00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.620\nto be able to see all of those logs\nreported in just about one place.\n\n561\n00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.720\nThis is kind of a key\nelement if you have that and\n\n562\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.790\nyou have a thousand machines that\nyou're actually worried about.\n\n563\n00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.200\nThis is one that can really pull out that\none specific element between all thousand\n\n564\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.470\nof those that we need.\n\n565\n00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.920\nSo that is a system that's in place.\n\n566\n00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.750\nThe other one is the term services, okay?\n\n567\n00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.850\nServices are really equitable to the idea\nof the demons that we talked about,\n\n568\n00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.110\ninside a Linux as well,\nservices run in the background,\n\n569\n00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.690\nthey don't need user interaction at all.\n\n570\n00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.660\nThey can run when the operating\nsystem boots up, and\n\n571\n00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.200\nthey normally are processes that run\nin the background to make the operating\n\n572\n00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.530\nsystem do all the things that we\nexpect for an operating system to do.\n\n573\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.470\nSo, services really do equate to\nthat nature of what we want, so\n\n574\n00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.990\nif you need something that runs without\nyour user account being logged in,\n\n575\n00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.930\nyou're gonna implement a service.\n\n576\n00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.280\nIf you're looking for performance issues,\nyou're gonna take a look, of course,\n\n577\n00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.570\nat processes and the threads as well as,\nof course, the handles.\n\n578\n00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.210\nAnd understand that\ninside the Task Manager,\n\n579\n00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.160\nyou can also find the process\nID if you want to.\n\n580\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.380\nAnd if you can learn a few\nother Windows commands,\n\n581\n00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.040\nyou can actually even run some\nof those Windows commands\n\n582\n00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.790\nto help you also kill that process in\nthe command line if you want to as well.\n\n583\n00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.540\nBut all these terms are something\nthat you should be familiar with for\n\n584\n00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.880\ntroubleshooting, especially if you\ndo suspect something like the nature\n\n585\n00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.170\nof malicious software on the computer,\nso it's always good.\n\n586\n00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that gives us a pretty\ngood start here on Windows terminology,\n\n587\n00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:08.190\nif you're not already familiar.\n\n588\n00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:13.260\nJust to recap again, we looked at those\nprocesses, we also talked about WMI,\n\n589\n00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.640\nwe talked about the different services,\nwe talked about different threads,\n\n590\n00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.238\nmemory allocations, what else?\n\n591\n00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:24.945\nAnd handles, so, there's a good start for\nyou, but that does mean we're out of\n\n592\n00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:28.165\ntime for this particular show so,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n593\n00:32:28.165 --> 00:32:30.455\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n594\n00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:31.265\n&gt;&gt; I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n595\n00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:33.031\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

Your watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.946\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\nCisco Cybersecurtiy Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:17.860\nI'm you show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.170\nIf you've been working with computers for\na while and you understand how they\n\n7\n00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.190\noperate, but you're not really clear\non the terminology or the definitions.\n\n8\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.680\nThen the next couple episodes\nwill be perfect for you,\n\n9\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.440\nbecause we're gonna go ahead and define\nthose terms that you may not already know.\n\n10\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.620\nWith us to help today is Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studio.\n\n11\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.090\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.110\nAs we continue on taking a look\nat what more topics that\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.110\nreally help us to become better\nat the idea of cyber security.\n\n15\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.030\nAnd this is where our limitations\nreally begin to show up\n\n16\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.760\nwhen we start entering\ninto the security realm.\n\n17\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.990\nIs that most of us, if we end up\nworking for a particular company,\n\n18\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.940\nwe'll end up seeing that we might be\nvery good at working with Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.930\nWe might have done desktop support.\n\n20\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.120\nWe might understand\nthe idea of deployment.\n\n21\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.830\nWe might even understand how to\nmanage an Active Directory domain.\n\n22\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.580\nBut there are certain tools and utilities\nthat you as cyber security specialists.\n\n23\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.180\nYou need to at least be familiar\nwith that we're gonna go over.\n\n24\n00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.400\nAnd some of those tools of course,\nnot only reside inside of Windows, but\n\n25\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.268\nreally also inside of\na Linux distro instead.\n\n26\n00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:28.660\nSo today, we're gonna take a look at\njust a few terms that are called out\n\n27\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.320\non the Cisco cyber security\nfundamentals exam.\n\n28\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.350\nThat they want to make sure that you,\nif you're someone that says hey,\n\n29\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.740\nI'm a cyber security professional.\n\n30\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.120\nThat you're not just the one that says\nI can work as long as it's on Windows.\n\n31\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.910\nI need to have a little bit\nmore understanding to this and\n\n32\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.310\nI need to broaden my scope and\nbe able to do that as well.\n\n33\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Plus if you're able to communicate and\narticulate properly with your peers,\n\n34\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.470\nthat's really gonna help you\nout in the job field as well.\n\n35\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIt's no doubt that this is where the world\n\n36\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.580\nis going and cyber security is\noperating system agnostic essentially.\n\n37\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.080\nAnd the two biggest ones that we have to\nreally deal with is the idea of course\n\n38\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.470\nfundamentally of Windows,\nwhich we're gonna get into.\n\n39\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.320\nBut also of course, then Linux,\n\n40\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.840\nwhich is the one that we're actually\ngonna talk about right now.\n\n41\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.000\nNow you might be wondering like well,\nwe're not really diving directly into\n\n42\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480\neverything that you can actually\nunderstand about Linux today.\n\n43\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.910\nDon't get me wrong on that.\n\n44\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.770\nWe do have series right here at ITProTV\nthat is you wanna go that far, you can\n\n45\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.950\njump right into it and that will help you\nto get a full understanding of Linux.\n\n46\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.377\nBut we're really talking about some of the\nbasic tools that you should be able to go\n\n47\n00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.638\nto a Linux operating system and run them.\n\n48\n00:02:36.638 --> 00:02:41.253\nAnd be able to spot some other things if\nyou need to to help that process of doing\n\n49\n00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:43.350\na little bit of troubleshooting.\n\n50\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.560\nAnd then maybe even potentially\nidentifying a problematic\n\n51\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.090\ntypes of incident there.\n\n52\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.640\nSo it can be used in cyber\nsecurity understanding,\n\n53\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.100\nwhat you're looking for as well.\n\n54\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.420\nOkay, so that is really what our hope and\ngoal is.\n\n55\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.397\nAnd there's really just\na few utilities and\n\n56\n00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:02.570\na few terminology that we just need\nto make sure that we understand.\n\n57\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.450\nWe're going to show you a couple of them\nand then of course, we're going to do\n\n58\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.010\na demonstration on a couple of them,\nto kind of help us out as we get into it.\n\n59\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.130\nOkay, so what we're gonna use today\nis just an install of Debian or\n\n60\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.910\nDebian, however you wanna to pronounce it.\n\n61\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.330\nI don't know exactly.\n\n62\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.160\nI'm using a little bit\nof an older version 7.5,\n\n63\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.270\nI know that there is 8 and\nlater out there right now.\n\n64\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.210\nBut it should still work.\n\n65\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.960\nAll the commands that we should do\nare gonna be backward compatible.\n\n66\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.410\nBut these are at least the basic ones\n\n67\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.094\nthat you need to understand\nfrom the host security side.\n\n68\n00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:38.270\nNot from the end user's side,\nthat if they're having issues and\n\n69\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.610\nthey're needing to deal with issues.\n\n70\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.340\nAnd you need to do some troubleshooting,\n\n71\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.030\nhere are some of the things that\nyou need to be able to determine.\n\n72\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.540\nSo that's where we are going to begin is\nmaking sure that we can do that, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.820\nSo let's take a look at some\nof those terms, Cherokee.\n\n74\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n75\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.110\nwe're gonna start off with the idea\nof what a process is, okay.\n\n76\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.810\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n77\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.060\nwhen we start talking about this idea of\na process in the operating system terms.\n\n78\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.150\nThis is gonna be true but\nnot only of course inside of Linux, but\n\n79\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.710\nalso inside of Windows.\n\n80\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.913\nSo notice again, it's really about\nthe basic underlying idea of\n\n81\n00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:14.690\nan operating system rather than whether\nit's Linux or whether it's Windows.\n\n82\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.150\nSo we need to understand\nwhat the process is and\n\n83\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.890\nwhy it's very important\nto us in what we do.\n\n84\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.750\nSo what is essentially is a process?\n\n85\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.629\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that comes to my mind,\n\n86\n00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.930\nI don't know why it's\nkind of a cheerleader.\n\n87\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.789\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n88\n00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.770\n&gt;&gt; That make sense, does it make sense?\n\n89\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n90\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.396\nBut I'm gonna wait.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n91\n00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:32.812\nI have such a weird way sometimes\nwhether your like thinking and\n\n92\n00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:34.180\nstudying about things.\n\n93\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.910\nBut if we think about a supporting role,\n\n94\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.430\na cheerleader is there usually to\nsupport a team or something, right?\n\n95\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.730\nSo processes are usually supporting some\nother program or application because\n\n96\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.770\nwhen you look at that and that program\nis dependent on the certain process.\n\n97\n00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.540\nSo that's kind of how I relate the two,\n\n98\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.570\nI don't know if it makes sense that way,\nbut.\n\n99\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, it really does,\nin this sense, right?\n\n100\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.430\nWhen we start mentioning the idea\nof a process inside of Linux here.\n\n101\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.670\nIt also includes the program\nthat's running, but\n\n102\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.400\nalso everything else that supports it.\n\n103\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.370\nSo yeah, in the same way like\nthe idea of a football team.\n\n104\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.850\nEven though it's really about\nthe football game itself,\n\n105\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.430\nthe cheerleaders are in the process\nof helping and supporting.\n\n106\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Kind of on the sidelines,\ndoing their thing, right?\n\n107\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320\n&gt;&gt; Kind of giving help and support to\nwhatever that program needs to run.\n\n108\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.860\nA process itself really represents\nthe entirety of the running program.\n\n109\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.500\nA program has coding in it, but that's\nnot all that it has to be able to run and\n\n110\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.860\ndo what it needs to, right.\n\n111\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.070\nThe coding exists but\nit only exists in the state that it is in.\n\n112\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.010\nOnly when we choose to run it, right,\n\n113\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.690\ndo we then start calling on\nother things that we might need.\n\n114\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.010\nWe might need access to RAM,\n\n115\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.580\nwe might need access to data\nthat exists on the hard drive.\n\n116\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.290\nWe might need access of course, to\nthe operating system that's underlying it.\n\n117\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.750\nAnd altogether, right?\n\n118\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.910\nEverything that connects in to make\nthat program essentially run in that\n\n119\n00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.660\noperating system essentially\nbecomes what we call our processes.\n\n120\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.280\nWhat we have, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.590\nNow the problem with trying to understand\nthat is that every single program that we\n\n122\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.620\nend up running essentially\nhas a process to it, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.420\nNow even though you and\nI name these ideas and programs by name.\n\n124\n00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.490\nOperating systems don't tend\nto look at them by name, but\n\n125\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.640\nthey tend to look at them by process IDs\nis what we're trying to get at here.\n\n126\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.340\nLets go ahead and\n\n127\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.160\ntake a look at my computer and that way\nwe'll kind of start here at the beginning.\n\n128\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.670\nI do have my edition of the VM running and\n\n129\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.110\nI simply launched up\nthe terminal window for us.\n\n130\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.970\n&gt;&gt; Funny sidenote.\n\n131\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.290\nI've heard that it was an homage to Deb or\nDeborah and Ian's relationship.\n\n132\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.530\nSo Debian.\n\n133\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is true.\n\n134\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.010\nIt's a combination of both of their names\ntogether, that actually is the underlying\n\n135\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.510\nbasis of this operating system,\nat least the name of it.\n\n136\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.758\n&gt;&gt; How romantic.\n\n137\n00:06:52.758 --> 00:06:55.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna agree with you on that\nsince I don't know anything else about\n\n138\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.430\nDeb and Ian.\n\n139\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.210\nSo in this instance here, as we start to\ntake a look, how do we start seeing some\n\n140\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.290\nof that information that we really need to\nsee and what can we learn from them, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.180\nSo let's go and see and then we'll talk\nabout what we can learn right away.\n\n142\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.330\nWhen a computer,\nwhen an operating system and\n\n143\n00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.780\nwith along with the hardware\nthat's underlying it.\n\n144\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.475\nSomebody start saying hey, I wonder if\nthere's a processes that's gone wrong.\n\n145\n00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.160\nWhere do I normally think about about\nfrom a troubleshooting standpoint,\n\n146\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.070\nfrom a desktop support standpoint.\n\n147\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.260\nI was saying about it from a standpoint\nof performance more than anything else.\n\n148\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.060\nSo I'm looking at RAM, I'm looking at CPU,\n\n149\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.960\nI'm looking at disk utilization,\nas well as networking.\n\n150\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.580\nThose are kind of the four big punches\nthat really impact thus as far as\n\n151\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.580\nthe performance of my entire\ncomputer in the operating system and\n\n152\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.205\neverything else goes.\n\n153\n00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.856\nAnyone of those that affects\nany of those four, right?\n\n154\n00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:52.994\nThat is one we start noticing performance\ndips to the point where a user goes,\n\n155\n00:07:52.994 --> 00:07:56.508\nsomething is wrong,\nsomething is not operating exactly right.\n\n156\n00:07:56.508 --> 00:08:01.443\nAnd our goal in troubleshooting is to\nbe other pinpoint that down To just\n\n157\n00:08:01.443 --> 00:08:02.605\nwhat we need to.\n\n158\n00:08:02.605 --> 00:08:07.200\nThe reason why this is important in\ncyber security realm is fairly simple.\n\n159\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.680\nWe start task and go, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.010\nSo I know something is pegging up the CPU.\n\n161\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.560\nWell, that's great to be able to\nidentify that, in the Windows world,\n\n162\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.080\nwe just go to right-click on it and\nwe end the task.\n\n163\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.460\nNo big deal, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.900\nBut at the same time,\nour goal is to try and\n\n165\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.530\nfigure out what caused it and\nwhy is that program causing it.\n\n166\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.545\nIn the cyber security realm, that could\nactually be telling you something that\n\n167\n00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:30.725\neither an attack or some type of-\n&gt;&gt; Arbitrary code,\n\n168\n00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:34.365\nsome kind of malware is running that\nyou really don't want to be there,\n\n169\n00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:38.005\ninstead of just a legitimate leaky app or\nsomething like that.\n\n170\n00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:41.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\nsome type of exploit has taken place where\n\n171\n00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:43.575\nthey've actually been able\nto take advantage of that.\n\n172\n00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:44.125\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n173\n00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.665\nthat's one of the things that we want to\nbe able to spot if we're gonna do this.\n\n174\n00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:49.895\nSo inside of a Linux operating system,\n\n175\n00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.035\nthere are many different\nways to get at this.\n\n176\n00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:54.240\nWe're really looking at\nthe fundamental ones [LAUGH] that\n\n177\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.430\nare called out by the exam.\n\n178\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.720\nSo let's talk about this\nidea of a process here.\n\n179\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.840\nAnd really,\n\n180\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.170\nif we don't want to add in any additional\ntools at this particular point here.\n\n181\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.980\nWhat we can do is we can\nactually run one called ps,\n\n182\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.950\nI always say ps here,\nps aux, okay, a-u-x here.\n\n183\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.560\nNow when I do something like that and\nI press Enter,\n\n184\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.430\nthat shows me all of the actual\ncurrent processes that are running\n\n185\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.770\nright now from when I typed it in and\nthe problem that I have is simple.\n\n186\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.920\nIt's hard to see, right?\n\n187\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.100\nCuz I have to scroll down the screen and\nwhen I look at it.\n\n188\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.530\nSo where is there a legend?\n\n189\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.220\nWell, the legend's right\nup here at the top.\n\n190\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.180\nThat shows me all the stuff that's\nactually right there, right?\n\n191\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.080\nWho is the user that launched this and\n\n192\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.830\nyou can see everything was run by root and\nthat's cuz I'm logged in.\n\n193\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.890\nThere is that process ID that's\ngonna become very important to what\n\n194\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.580\nwe're actually focusing on.\n\n195\n00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.940\nThe percentage of CPU,\nas well as memory and VSZ.\n\n196\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.530\nWhich I can't really remember what\nthat one stands for, but we're not so\n\n197\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.290\nworried about that one.\n\n198\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.226\nBut what we're looking at is right\nhere also under status too, okay.\n\n199\n00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:06.070\nThese are kind of the processes that we\ntend to actually look at when we start to\n\n200\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.950\ntake a look as well as start time.\n\n201\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.240\nBut really remember, it's all about\nthe idea of trying to figure out\n\n202\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.410\nwhat some of the information\nthat we're seeing here is, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.920\nSo you'll start seeing sometimes\non the status, it'll change,\n\n204\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.550\nit'll give you a different mark.\n\n205\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.050\nAnd some of these will actually add\nin multiple editions of things.\n\n206\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.130\nAnd usually when we run a process,\n\n207\n00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.530\nlike this is one I wanted to see which\nis the one that I just ran here.\n\n208\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.140\nSo here's me compared to root.\n\n209\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:35.490\nI can see that this process is running\nitself cuz you see that R, okay?\n\n210\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.080\nSo that means hey Ronnie,\nhas just launched this process and\n\n211\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.360\nwhat did the operating system do?\n\n212\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.420\nIt assigned it a process ID.\n\n213\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.600\nAnd now I can also see on this one.\n\n214\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.650\nAnd this is where it gets hard\nbecause now it's like Cherokee,\n\n215\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.720\ndo you remember what this column\nrepresented here by chance?\n\n216\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.430\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n217\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm hoping that you did and\nI was gonna say if you did,\n\n218\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.400\nthat's amazing memory, okay.\n\n219\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.120\nHere this one I believe\nis the CPU Utilization.\n\n220\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n221\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.337\n&gt;&gt; If I remember, yep.\n\n222\n00:11:01.337 --> 00:11:04.905\nSo notice I have to kind of scroll up and\ndown to actually find that out and\n\n223\n00:11:04.905 --> 00:11:08.670\nthe next one right here is memory\nusage and then all the other stuff.\n\n224\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.740\nBut at this point here, if you actually\nrealize that hey, I can't see everything.\n\n225\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.530\nYou can always pipe that\ninto the last command and\n\n226\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.716\nthat would then show you\na screenshot at a time.\n\n227\n00:11:18.716 --> 00:11:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Until you actually figure out\n\n228\n00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.860\nwhat you're looking for, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.620\nSo from this point in time as I\ncontinue to do something like that,\n\n230\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.280\nyou'll see that at some point I'll\ncome down here to the very end.\n\n231\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.560\nAnd you can see that it also\nadded in that less command that\n\n232\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.740\nI piped it into as well, okay?\n\n233\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.890\nSo we might be able to see that if\nI now start looking at the CPU,\n\n234\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.990\nas well as the memory utilization.\n\n235\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.820\nThat this is going to help me out if I\nrealize that something is taking up 90% of\n\n236\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.180\nthe processing time or\n\n237\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.150\nwhatever it might be or\na lot of the memory is where it begins.\n\n238\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.340\nSo if I find out something like this,\nI want to make sure that I note those two.\n\n239\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.945\nAnd let me make sure I actually do that\nright now or I'm gonna forget that,\n\n240\n00:11:57.945 --> 00:11:59.472\nis what's going to end up happening here.\n\n241\n00:11:59.472 --> 00:12:00.308\n&gt;&gt; The process ID number?\n\n242\n00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:00.912\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:00.912 --> 00:12:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n244\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.646\n4424 and 4225 or 425, sorry, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:08.516\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine.\n\n246\n00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:11.154\nSo I may use these again, I may not.\n\n247\n00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:13.040\nAnd we'll actually see what happens here.\n\n248\n00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.680\nSo let's see what happens if I\nkind of cancel out of that thing.\n\n249\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.350\nAnd now that I'm done and\nif I run that again,\n\n250\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.460\nlet's see now what happens\nthis time at the bottom here.\n\n251\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.580\nAnd yep.\n\n252\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.900\nSo now you actually notice that it\nactually ended up giving me, well,\n\n253\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.100\na little bit different number.\n\n254\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.241\nSo every time I close out of a program and\nI relaunch it,\n\n255\n00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:39.482\na process ID number is gonna\nend up changing if I do that.\n\n256\n00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:43.330\nMost of those programs that run,\nthey wanna run constantly.\n\n257\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.320\nThey're not closing out and\nthen relaunching themselves.\n\n258\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.910\nClosing out and\n\n259\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.870\nrelaunching themselves, they're gonna\nkind of keep the same process ID number.\n\n260\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.670\nNow this the one that really is that\n\n261\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.440\nthe very basic of being built into the\noperating system that you have available.\n\n262\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.211\nBut you also have inside of,\nif I can type it in here is top.\n\n263\n00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:08.620\nTop pretty much gives us about what\nlooks like almost exactly the same but\n\n264\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.490\na little bit more here.\n\n265\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.547\nWhere you can see that process ID and\nthe user and\n\n266\n00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:16.540\nof course, there is that CPU and\nmemory time.\n\n267\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.664\nAnd you're now starting to take a look and\n\n268\n00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:22.200\nyou will actually see that it's\nshowing live time instead.\n\n269\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.670\nSo even though the early one\nkind of showed me a snapshot,\n\n270\n00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.850\nthis one as I'm running top here,\nyou'll see it's highlighted at this point.\n\n271\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.030\nAnd that is kind of coming up and\nit's disappearing, it's coming up and\n\n272\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.030\nit's actually just showing us what's\ntaking up the most and it's doing it,\n\n273\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.590\nsorting it in this order,\ngiving us that ability.\n\n274\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.170\nAnd this has been around for\na long time as well.\n\n275\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.210\nSo we might actually take a look\nat something like this to\n\n276\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.440\nkind of give us another picture and\nwhat we might choose to see.\n\n277\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.950\nAnd then there of course are other tools.\n\n278\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.910\nNow there are programs that out there that\nyou might have to install into Linux.\n\n279\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.030\nTo give you a little bit colorful and\n\n280\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.820\na little bit more dynamic designs to\nbe replacement to something like top.\n\n281\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.880\nThere's one that's called htop and\nI've installed it on my machine.\n\n282\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.480\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at that one as well, okay.\n\n283\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.900\nSo here, we've just finished running top.\n\n284\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.040\nAnd now if I type in htop,\nnow you can see a difference here.\n\n285\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.400\nSo notice that this one gives us\na summary right up at the top here.\n\n286\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.467\n&gt;&gt; You weren't joking about colorful.\n\n287\n00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:21.269\n&gt;&gt; Where I can see the CPU, yep.\n\n288\n00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.906\n&gt;&gt; Literally.\n\n289\n00:14:21.906 --> 00:14:24.440\n&gt;&gt; And the memory,\nas well as the swap file.\n\n290\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.920\nYou can see the number of tasks or\nprocesses that are running for\n\n291\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.405\nus and the number of threads and\nyes, you can see this too.\n\n292\n00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:35.510\nAnd the average load time for right\nnow that's happening and this uptime.\n\n293\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.770\nAnd in the background here,\n\n294\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.500\nyou can see just about everything\nthat top was showing us too.\n\n295\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.640\nBut it gives us a little bit more\nas far as visually taking a look.\n\n296\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.590\nAnd there is one that's\nrunning which is root and hey,\n\n297\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.540\nlook at that,\nthat's htop running right there too.\n\n298\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.870\nSo it does show us a little bit more and\n\n299\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.340\nat the bottom of course,\nyou can do some other things here.\n\n300\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.890\nIt doesn't matter which one of these\ntools that you use as long as you feel\n\n301\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.860\ncomfortable in being able to spot\nthe information that you need to.\n\n302\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.200\nWell, we're really looking for\nthe process ID a lot of times.\n\n303\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.670\nAnd of course,\nis it affecting like CPU and memory usage?\n\n304\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:17.140\nThis one gives us a little bit more on the\ndrive itself as far as the swap file goes,\n\n305\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.560\nbut overall though,\nit's kind of the same tool and utility.\n\n306\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.740\nSo all of these can show us the\ninformation that we're really looking for.\n\n307\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.686\nWe should be familiar with at\nleast some of these, okay.\n\n308\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.980\nNow, once we have that in harmony,\n\n309\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.580\nsee if I can stop this one as well and I\nam just using a short cut there, Ctrl + Z.\n\n310\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.312\nSeems actually work for\nstopping that process and\n\n311\n00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:41.289\nyou can tell it right away says hey,\nyep, I wanna stop that process too.\n\n312\n00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:46.988\nNow there's one more that I want to show\nas well which is one that's called pstree.\n\n313\n00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:54.060\nPstree and\nthis one shows us every process but\n\n314\n00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.533\ninside of a hierarchy tree.\n\n315\n00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:01.191\nNow you might be wanna like and\nwhy the heck do I need to see that?\n\n316\n00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:05.050\nSometimes you need to see the sign of\npredecessors independencies, right?\n\n317\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.700\nWhat is actually linked to what?\n\n318\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.470\nAnd this one will actually give you\na little bit more to be able to see that.\n\n319\n00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.855\n&gt;&gt; So if I go ahead and close out or\nkill one particular service or\n\n320\n00:16:13.855 --> 00:16:18.895\nstop one service,\nit's not going to affect any programs\n\n321\n00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.825\nthat may be running that are dependent\non that particular service.\n\n322\n00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:24.095\n&gt;&gt; Well, at least,\nthat's what you're hoping, right?\n\n323\n00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:27.705\nIf you choose to stop\na process that's running,\n\n324\n00:16:27.705 --> 00:16:29.945\nright, it could affect other services.\n\n325\n00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:34.785\nSo instead of you going, I'll just stop\nit, and then everybody starts calling you\n\n326\n00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:38.370\nand going, hey, I can't do this anymore,\nI can't print, I can't do something.\n\n327\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.920\nWell, this will give you that\nchance to take a look and\n\n328\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.390\neffect it before you\ndecide to run something.\n\n329\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.120\nLet's go back and kind of use these\na little bit more effectively here.\n\n330\n00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.860\nAt least, I hope that that's what's\ngoing to end up happening, as well.\n\n331\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.860\nIf you choose a process running,\nlet's say a, I'm just going to try.\n\n332\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.980\nLet's say for example top, right.\n\n333\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.030\nAnd you know that that's\nrunning in the background.\n\n334\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.500\nI'm just gonna stop it to make it\na little bit more clear for us here.\n\n335\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.930\nSo if you find out what that process\nID that's running whatever it is, okay.\n\n336\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.210\nYou also need to of course,\nhave the ability to stop that type of\n\n337\n00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.000\ncommand after you've actually\nhave that process ID.\n\n338\n00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.240\nFor us,\nthat actually comes in the form of kill.\n\n339\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.690\nKill stops a process.\n\n340\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.310\nThere's two ways to do this.\n\n341\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:30.120\nThere is a kill dash 15, then you\nactually put in the process ID number.\n\n342\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.950\nWhat we were talking about earlier\nalthough, this one no longer reads this.\n\n343\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.040\nIf I were to do something like that,\nthat would kill it.\n\n344\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.570\nBut this is what we call,\nsomething like a graceful kill that means,\n\n345\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.930\nhey, I'm going to politely ask you\nto stop, and you are going to stop.\n\n346\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.910\nAnd that's pretty much the way it goes.\n\n347\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.790\nNow the great thing about this way of\ndoing this is that once you do this,\n\n348\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.870\nyou should see that the memory allocation\ngoes back into the pool of memory\n\n349\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.210\nthat you have opened up.\n\n350\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.410\nAnd that everything works fine.\n\n351\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.050\nAnd that you're ready to go okay?\n\n352\n00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.900\nYou do have to be careful\nhere with the idea of kill\n\n353\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.370\ncuz you can actually kill some processes,\nespecially if you're like me.\n\n354\n00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.150\nYou fat finger the actual\nprocess ID number and\n\n355\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.190\nyou go did I just enter in 4 4 2?\n\n356\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.700\nI didn't mean 2 4, I meant 2 5.\n\n357\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.750\nAnd that can cause some different\nthings if you're not very careful.\n\n358\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou wanna make sure you got the right\n\n359\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.020\nprocess ID there but\n\n360\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.150\ndoes the 15 represent anything\nsuch as like a counter or a timer?\n\n361\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.850\n&gt;&gt; It is more about the idea that this\nis a graceful idea being nice, okay?\n\n362\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.180\nAnd you choose not to enter anything\nat all and you just say kill and\n\n363\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.380\nthen the process ID number.\n\n364\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.150\nIt really represents 15.\n\n365\n00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.080\nIt's just one of those particular\nmessages that you have.\n\n366\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.158\nNow, the other one though, if it won't\nrespond, if you can't do anything else,\n\n367\n00:18:44.158 --> 00:18:49.450\nthen kill -9 that will stop everything and\nit just says I'm\n\n368\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.360\njust taking away the actual signal from\nyou That you can't do anything at all.\n\n369\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:59.290\nSo, the dash 15 represents\na saved term which is\n\n370\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.030\nnicely asking you through the terminal,\nsignaling that you're gonna stop and\n\n371\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.880\nthe other one is,\nactually I'm telling you wrong.\n\n372\n00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.580\nI can't remember what\nthe actual terminology is.\n\n373\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.730\nOne is actually a signal kill.\n\n374\n00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.410\nOne is actually a signal term,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n375\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.710\nIf I don't, forgive my terminology there.\n\n376\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.440\nBut just kind of realize that this\none will stop everything in its\n\n377\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.260\nprocess if you start to see that.\n\n378\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.680\nBut you do have to determine\nthat process ID first.\n\n379\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.870\nDo your research on it.\n\n380\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.200\nVerify and see what it actually is and\n\n381\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.369\nsomething like will actually help you\nout when you start to take a look.\n\n382\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.745\nThese ideas as well.\n\n383\n00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:32.262\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n384\n00:19:32.262 --> 00:19:32.943\nThat's process tree.\n\n385\n00:19:32.943 --> 00:19:36.196\n&gt;&gt; Now, and that's not what I want to do.\n\n386\n00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:37.850\nI got one more to do.\n\n387\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.080\nSo remember that the kill [INAUDIBLE]\nhelped us out to be able to stop that.\n\n388\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.471\nNow, the other thing of course that\nyou have, make sure I undo that,\n\n389\n00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.001\nis that you can also do.\n\n390\n00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:51.587\nA listing here on pstree, and\n\n391\n00:19:51.587 --> 00:19:56.751\nif you have a process\nID number that you're\n\n392\n00:19:56.751 --> 00:20:01.496\nspecifically looking for, pstreep.\n\n393\n00:20:01.496 --> 00:20:05.620\nSo if you're not sure even at that point\nnotice that it gives you the process ID\n\n394\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.298\nnumber directly to the right\nof the information.\n\n395\n00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:12.365\nSo starting here at the top\nthe network manager is 2407.\n\n396\n00:20:12.365 --> 00:20:18.490\nAnd look at that the DACP client is here,\nthe network managers.\n\n397\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:23.387\nAnd that way you can actually see what\nis related to each other as well as\n\n398\n00:20:23.387 --> 00:20:28.788\nthe process ID you specifically trying\nto kill once process so that pstreep.\n\n399\n00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:32.622\nBut if you want to go even\ndeeper into that, let's take for\n\n400\n00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:36.534\nan example this idea of the,\nI'm trying to see right here,\n\n401\n00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:40.705\nlet's do that 2744,\nthat color server kit here.\n\n402\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.203\nAnd then 2744.\n\n403\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.640\nAnd now we'll show you just one tree.\n\n404\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.620\nSo that way you can really kinda\nzoom in on what you need to\n\n405\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.140\nby just using something fairly simple.\n\n406\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.509\nJust when you think that you're done,\nI'm kinda close to being done here.\n\n407\n00:21:02.415 --> 00:21:06.848\nThere are of course ways inside of the\nactual graphical user interface that you\n\n408\n00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:08.370\ncan go to.\n\n409\n00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.060\nAnd there is the System Monitor.\n\n410\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.870\nSystem Monitor to us here inside\nof Debian is probably very\n\n411\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.980\nmuch equivalent to the idea of\nthe Task Manager in Windows.\n\n412\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:25.260\nSo if you're more familiar with the\nWindows gallery of things, make sure you\n\n413\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.540\ncheck this one out, too, and that can also\nhelp you to spot it graphically as well.\n\n414\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.040\nSo don't be afraid of the tools\nthat you find right here.\n\n415\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.550\nBut this is one of those things\nthat we really have to make\n\n416\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.450\nsure that we do pay attention to.\n\n417\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.670\nNotice here's our system, of course,\nit gives us the information, and\n\n418\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.910\nthis can be valuable information.\n\n419\n00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.640\nHere are all the processes a lot neater,\na lot easier for us to look at here.\n\n420\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.930\nAnd don't forget even though I\nkind of skipped over the user,\n\n421\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.320\nI did show you the importance of that,\n\n422\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.740\nespecially processor running but the key\narea especially of program that's taking\n\n423\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.270\nup too much it's understand whose\ncontext are they running in.\n\n424\n00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.220\nSo who's the user that their\nrunning in because the idea of\n\n425\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.470\nLinux distros help you to\nhave multiple users run.\n\n426\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.720\nYou can actually identify you know\nhow that particular process began and\n\n427\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.130\nwhat account as well.\n\n428\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.040\n&gt;&gt; Is there a way, I don't know I can't\nrecall in Linux if you can look and\n\n429\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.499\nsee it the dependency, do we hit GUI\ninstead of hopping back into the terminal.\n\n430\n00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:23.211\nI really can't remember.\n\n431\n00:22:23.211 --> 00:22:25.308\n&gt;&gt; I don't know for sure myself.\n\n432\n00:22:25.308 --> 00:22:26.051\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n433\n00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:30.160\n&gt;&gt; There may be a way to do it but\nit may be an add on product as well.\n\n434\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.650\nBut at least from this point here,\nyou can see a little bit, so\n\n435\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.800\nhere it gives you the CPU, the Memory Swap\nand of course, Network History.\n\n436\n00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.730\nThey show those big three for us,\nthe only one that's missing here\n\n437\n00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.670\nis the Disk Usage,\neven though they call it the swap.\n\n438\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.770\nYeah, network history is down here at\nthe bottom and the idea of swap here is\n\n439\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.610\nsupposed to be helping us with that idea\nthe disk usage more than anything else.\n\n440\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.760\nBut in the monitoring and being able to\nsee certain things here, spotting that\n\n441\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.850\nprocess ID, understanding that it does\nrepresent what a process really is,\n\n442\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.240\nand why it's important to us, and we'll\nsee later on when we get into Windows.\n\n443\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.320\nWe'll talk about threads and\nother things too, and handles and\n\n444\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.970\nsome of the different\nthings that are there.\n\n445\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.110\nBut for us in Window, in Linux,\n\n446\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.010\ninside of a Linux distribution,\nthis is what we're looking for.\n\n447\n00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.760\nDo pay attention to whatever\ndistro that you're using.\n\n448\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.000\nYou may find the syntax just\na little bit different.\n\n449\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.020\nBut usually those commands I did\nwork across just about everybody,\n\n450\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.550\nevery particular flavor of\nLinux that I know about.\n\n451\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.750\nBut there may be some that it doesn't so\njust pay attention.\n\n452\n00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Alytics is kind of notorious\nthe different variations and\n\n453\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.340\nvariants out there.\n\n454\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.400\nThe distributions to\nhave some pretty bizarre\n\n455\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.910\nnames sometimes on\ndifferent components there.\n\n456\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.070\nBut I don't think we're\nfinish talking about Linux.\n\n457\n00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.410\nWe do have some more terminology\nto cover so stay tuned.\n\n458\n00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.150\nI'll be coming up in the next episode.\n\n459\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.300\nBut for this one we'll go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n460\n00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.500\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n461\n00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.727\n&gt;&gt;

Boose\n&gt;&gt; In the last episode,\n\n6\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.170\nwe were looking at Linux terminology.\n\n7\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.404\nThis is gonna pick up where we left of and\n\n8\n00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:28.147\nspecifically we'll be looking\nfurther down that process idea.\n\n9\n00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:34.090\nAnd the first idea of concept\nthat we'll be looking at is Fork.\n\n10\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.680\nI know we're not gonna be\ntalking about eating utensil,\n\n11\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.220\nbut to help us explain this concept,\nis Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.690\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n14\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.500\nas we continue on talking about\nsome of the terminology here.\n\n15\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.340\nIt's really important that we get\nat least a little bit of this down\n\n16\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.290\nas we begin our career in cybersecurity.\n\n17\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.160\nIt's not enough for\n\n18\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.970\nus to be good in just one operating\nsystem, we have to at least know a little\n\n19\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.710\nbit about troubleshooting in just about\nevery one that we come in contact with.\n\n20\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.710\nAnd know some of the basics and\nthat's really what we're going over here.\n\n21\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.790\nSo, do not think that\nthis is a tutorial on\n\n22\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.960\nlearning all about Linux\nbecause this really isn't.\n\n23\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.480\nWe're just going over\na few of the concepts, and\n\n24\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.130\nof course the utilities\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n25\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.724\nAnd of course today we're gonna jump\ninto that concept of using forks,\n\n26\n00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.030\nis what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n27\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.289\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n28\n00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start\ntalking about what is a fork?\n\n29\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.241\nWhat is this bigger process?\n\n30\n00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:31.299\nWell, when it comes down to the idea\nof a fork, it is a process.\n\n31\n00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.614\nAnd you're saying, okay, so\n\n32\n00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:35.560\nyou just talked about processes\nin the previous episode.\n\n33\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.640\nWhat makes this one different?\n\n34\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.880\nWhen you decide that you're\ngoing to launch a program, It,\n\n35\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.120\nof course, goes ahead and\ncreates the process ID.\n\n36\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.890\nBut then, it also creates what\nthey call a child process as well.\n\n37\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.110\nAnd when it does that,\nit's exactly identical,\n\n38\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.360\nit's like making a duplicate\nof the original process.\n\n39\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.390\nAnd then it makes a child ID or\n\n40\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.500\na child process that's exactly identical\nExcept for a couple of things here, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.690\nThe most important aspect of this\nis that it will have a different\n\n42\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.470\nprocess ID number.\n\n43\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.680\nSo the concepts and\neverything else is pretty much the same.\n\n44\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.460\nBut overall though, it will actually\nend up creating that child process and\n\n45\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.420\nthere'll be two different child IDs for\nus.\n\n46\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.340\nAnd when we start to interact, we interact\nwith the child process itself And\n\n47\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.970\nnot really the idea of\nthe parent process too, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.080\nSo, when you start thinking about it,\na single process,\n\n49\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.350\nit really all links back to one\nparent process called init, I-N-I-T.\n\n50\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.490\nThat's kind of the top of the tree, but\n\n51\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.830\nthen there's all the other\nprocesses underneath it.\n\n52\n00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.630\nBut then every process in itself can have\nmany child processes underneath that.\n\n53\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.200\nAnd in these, remember that\nthey are identical except for\n\n54\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.800\nthat idea of the process ID.\n\n55\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.010\nNow, when we start talking about\nmemory as well as registers and\n\n56\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.420\nsome of the things that it does here,\nokay?\n\n57\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.080\nOverall though,\nit really isn't gonna do anything\n\n58\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.560\nuntil it has to make some type of\ncall to actually do something here.\n\n59\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.810\nSo most people ask,\nwell why does it have to do that?\n\n60\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.080\nWhy not just generate a whole new\nprocess if we're going to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.570\nAnd that is because at the time that it\nwas developed in the operating system,\n\n62\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.400\nthere was an incredible limited amount\nof RAM and limited amount of CPU,\n\n63\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.700\nas well as limited amount\nof hard drive space.\n\n64\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.400\nSo, what you had here was\na system that was developed\n\n65\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.510\nin the earliest day is of computing or\ncomputers in operating system.\n\n66\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.240\nAnd they knew something, that if we just\ncontinue the right process after process,\n\n67\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.520\nafter process each one of process will\ntake up a certain amount of memory and\n\n68\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.320\nthey'll run out of processes right away.\n\n69\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.190\nSo by creating this idea of a fork,\n\n70\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.800\nit allows them to duplicate\nthe same process, but\n\n71\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.540\nnow it looks back at pairing process and\ngoes hey, you are exactly identical to me.\n\n72\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.200\nSo I don't really have to take up anymore\nRAM at this particular point in time,\n\n73\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.670\nI can just use what's\navailable that I can see, and\n\n74\n00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.480\nthat's all that we have to worry about.\n\n75\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.940\nSo it allowed us, at that point in time,\nto be able to do that.\n\n76\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.230\nIn today's operating systems where\nyou have 8 gigs of ram on a computer,\n\n77\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.750\n4 gigs of ram on a computer, that is so\n\n78\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.980\nmuch bigger than what they had\nin the earliest days of this.\n\n79\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.330\nAnd also, of course, CPU cycles and\n\n80\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.660\neverything else that you\nhave available to you.\n\n81\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.310\nWell, they just continued this\nprocess on as very effective,\n\n82\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.950\nbecause of everything that it\nactually does to help manage\n\n83\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.680\nthe way that the processes really work\neffectively, they just continued on.\n\n84\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.880\nThey didn't actually have to replace it.\n\n85\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.640\nThey said, look,\nit's managing the memory fairly easily and\n\n86\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.860\nthe resource utilization fairly easily,\nwhy would we break that system?\n\n87\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.160\nJust to change it because\nwe have more resources.\n\n88\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.970\nSo it continues to be a process\ntoday that we worry about.\n\n89\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.150\n&gt;&gt; So no more manual IRQ list or worrying\nabout having to prioritizing there?\n\n90\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that actually is\na good way to think about it.\n\n91\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.950\nThe very fact is that we don't have to\nworry about over utilizing resources.\n\n92\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.130\nThat aren't available to us.\n\n93\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.300\nAs long that we have our set of resources,\na lot of time this idea of forking really\n\n94\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.940\nhelps us to use that as\nefficiently as we can.\n\n95\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.520\nSo it really is one of those things that\nwe do and there's a concept behind this.\n\n96\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.280\nMake sure I call it out right.\n\n97\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.010\nIt does, we'll call it copy on write.\n\n98\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.030\nAnd this is where that chad process says\nlook, as long as we're interacting and\n\n99\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.770\nwe're doing fine, I'll just use whatever\nthe parent says that I have access to.\n\n100\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.580\nI'm not gonna even worry about it.\n\n101\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.860\nBut it's when things change and you go,\nI need to write something different.\n\n102\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.530\nIt's only when it needs to\nwrite a brand new process and\n\n103\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.030\nsaid all right, now I need to change So\nit really does spawn off and\n\n104\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.000\nthen create another process\nID to do that instead.\n\n105\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.040\nAnd now you're actually\neating up the memory.\n\n106\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.270\nSo you had a process with a child process\nthat was taking up two gigs of RAM.\n\n107\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.920\nAnd now you launch, and you go,\nI need to this idea of copy on write,\n\n108\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.870\nwhich happens When the program changes,\nwell then it will spawn and it will take\n\n109\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.970\nup two more gigs of RAM giving you four\ngigs of RAM that is taking up instead.\n\n110\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.940\nAnd that's just an example,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n111\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.430\nIt's not gonna take up four gigs of RAM.\n\n112\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.810\nMight take up 256 megs or so,\nbut that's the goal and idea.\n\n113\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.890\nAnd this is important concept for\nyou and me because\n\n114\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.270\nWe need to understand which process we\nmight be shutting down, which particular\n\n115\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.020\nprocess might be causing some issues for\nus and that's the whole reason for\n\n116\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.260\nunderstanding this idea of using force and\nthe underlying operating system as well.\n\n117\n00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.140\nSo along with that once we get that\nconcept down it's not very easy to show,\n\n118\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.460\nyou have to do some\nprogramming to do that But\n\n119\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.050\nyou do need to learn a few\nthings from this which is.\n\n120\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.700\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie what do we need to\ntake away from this process or\n\n121\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.260\nwhat can we learn from this?\n\n122\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to the idea\nof understanding forking right, there's\n\n123\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.290\nnothing that we're gonna do to change the\nway that the underlying operating system\n\n124\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.630\nworks so we're not be able to sit and\ngo okay, don't do this anymore.\n\n125\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.360\nIt's the way Linux was\ndesigned in the background.\n\n126\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.780\nSo, what we need to\nunderstand though is that,\n\n127\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.710\neven though this is a great process and\ndoes everything efficiently for us, and\n\n128\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.630\nhelps us to make sure that the operating\nsystem continue to run, is that we also\n\n129\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.460\nneed to understand that there is\nan inherit weakness in the process itself.\n\n130\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.840\nSo, that is open to what we call some\ntype of denial of service attack here.\n\n131\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.840\nThrough the forking process.\n\n132\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.340\nNow the reason why this happens is that\nthere's a particular type of exploit\n\n133\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.850\nthat's called a fork bomb, in which\nwhen a process is requested to run,\n\n134\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.250\nand do what it needs to do, and\nthen it creates a child process,\n\n135\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.980\nis that somebody can take that and\nscript something to make it loop over and\n\n136\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.950\nover again, to the point where\nthe CPU utilization gets so high or\n\n137\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.800\nthe RAM utilization gets so high,\nthat you really run out of resources.\n\n138\n00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.860\nAnd now everybody is actually\ndenied access to the servers.\n\n139\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.388\nSo, we need to be able to see and\nspot things like that to help us out here.\n\n140\n00:07:58.388 --> 00:07:59.090\nOkay.\n\n141\n00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.616\nNow, is there a way to fix that.\n\n142\n00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:01.508\nYes.\n\n143\n00:08:01.508 --> 00:08:05.604\nAnd that a reason why there's a way to\nfix that is because when you remember\n\n144\n00:08:05.604 --> 00:08:07.770\ntaking something like TOP here.\n\n145\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.200\nLet's go to my computer screen and\n\n146\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.710\nlet's see if I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n147\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:20.100\nSo I'll open up the terminal and\nI will run something like top, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.050\nNow if you can get to that point\nwhere your machine is not crashing,\n\n149\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.400\nthat's very hopeful, okay,\nthat you can do this.\n\n150\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.560\nIf you're in this type of\nloop where you can't do it,\n\n151\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.660\nwhat you should be able to spot\nhere of course is that process ID.\n\n152\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.530\nAnd also you're looking for\nwho the user is, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.400\nIf all of a sudden you start seeing that\nparticular process like what mine's doing.\n\n154\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.920\nIt actually popped up my name\na couple of times here and\n\n155\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.630\nit continues to do that very rapidly and\ncontinues to do that.\n\n156\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.290\nThen you can spot who ran that\noriginal fork process and\n\n157\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.600\nthen be able to shut down\nthat entire process chain.\n\n158\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.560\nAnd hopefully be able to get that on\nthe point where it's no longer running.\n\n159\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.440\nAnd then you can go in, now find that\nprocess ID, get rid of the program and\n\n160\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.100\nhopefully you'll be able to run again.\n\n161\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.040\n&gt;&gt; And you can see this can potentially\nbe some pretty nasty stuff.\n\n162\n00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.500\nAnd we're not just talking about just\nyour run of the mill newbie attacks.\n\n163\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.730\nEven large governmental entities\ncould use something like this.\n\n164\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.450\nSometimes you'll hear\nthe term like sleepers.\n\n165\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.020\nBecause it is a fork bomb, there might be\nsome kind of detonation whether it be time\n\n166\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.670\nor triggered to go ahead and\nset something like this off.\n\n167\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.190\nThat could even cause permanent or\nphysical damage to the actual hardware.\n\n168\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.690\nBecause Ronnie, that's essentially\nwhat we're doing, right?\n\n169\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.580\nWe're attacking that machine to the point\nwhere it could cause physical damage.\n\n170\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.300\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n171\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.230\nNow if you're looking at the bottom\nedge of the screen here,\n\n172\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.530\nokay, I am typing in a line of code.\n\n173\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.080\nI'm not gonna run it right now, okay, but\n\n174\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.060\nI am typing in, let me make sure I\nactually typed this incorrectly.\n\n175\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.510\nI believe that that's it, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.780\nNow if you end up finding coding that\nlooks something similar to this or\n\n177\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:07.080\nyou end up finding coding that calls\nupon itself multiple times here.\n\n178\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.270\nThat is kind of coding for a fork bomb.\n\n179\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.120\nIt's really what it does here.\n\n180\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.500\nSo in this instance, I'm not gonna\nrun this cuz I don't know what\n\n181\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.730\nthe output would be during\nthe middle of the show.\n\n182\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.090\nSo in this one, it's strange but\nthat really is all it takes for\n\n183\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.130\na fork gum bomb to actually end\nup getting created in there.\n\n184\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.580\nTo make it run to that point where\nit could lock up your computer\n\n185\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.190\non a real production that's a big and\nbad that you don't want.\n\n186\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.346\nSo you find a script file with this\nin it or something very similar,\n\n187\n00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:38.089\nit is not something you want\nto play around with this.\n\n188\n00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:41.576\nSomething you wanna be able to\nremove from that machine and\n\n189\n00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:44.786\nthen examine on your own\nas far as coding goes.\n\n190\n00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:48.010\nBut just kind of realize that it can\nbe launched by something just as simple\n\n191\n00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.013\nas code like this.\n\n192\n00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Pretty simple, yeah.\n\n193\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.570\n&gt;&gt; To do that.\n\n194\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.951\nSo, this fork bomb is something we\ndefinitely want to make sure that we\n\n195\n00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.770\nunderstand and know.\n\n196\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.060\nBecause it can cause\nthat null in services, so\n\n197\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.080\nwhen you spot it, it normally is\ntoo late is what it comes down to.\n\n198\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.270\nA user really is not able to log into\ntheir system without the system rebooting\n\n199\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.870\nconstantly just about.\n\n200\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.079\nAnd then once you actually detect that\nfork bomb, you need to identify well,\n\n201\n00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:14.320\nwho actually owns it.\n\n202\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.340\nAnd that's why we might use\nsomething like top to give us\n\n203\n00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.020\nwhoever actually owns that process.\n\n204\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.743\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat they're the bad guy, but\n\n205\n00:11:20.743 --> 00:11:21.271\nit means-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n206\n00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:22.350\nthat's just who it's pointing back to.\n\n207\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's who it's pointing back to and\n\n208\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.730\nthat's where you begin your investigation\nof figuring out where these process begin.\n\n209\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.810\nAnd then hopefully,\nultimately ending as well,\n\n210\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.680\nonce you start finding where you start\nseeing that script file to come in.\n\n211\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.430\nSo it is important for\nus to understand the forking,\n\n212\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.990\nas well as that process, cuz that's part\nof the basic system of what we do here.\n\n213\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.400\nYeah, all right, so of course,\nthat means there's a lot more for\n\n214\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.660\nus to understand and learn too.\n\n215\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.410\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat some other information here to\n\n216\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.930\nhelp us out when we move into the realm of\npermissions is what we wanna move in to.\n\n217\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.580\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n218\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.630\nAnd hopefully, this will help us\nout when we deal with permissions\n\n219\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.420\nin dealing in tight side\nof Linux here a little bit.\n\n220\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.800\nNow this is a little bit strange.\n\n221\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.130\nIf you're in the Windows world,\nyou know about permissions.\n\n222\n00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.414\nRead, write, read and execute,\nmodify, full control,\n\n223\n00:12:18.414 --> 00:12:25.298\nthere are basic permissions that you have\nthat of course every file has on it.\n\n224\n00:12:25.298 --> 00:12:30.110\nWhile in Linux, it's kind of the same way,\nexcept that it is different, right?\n\n225\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.040\nYou still have permissions that\ngovern how and who can access files.\n\n226\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.350\nBut when you start to see it,\n\n227\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.910\nit doesn't do it in the same\nway that Windows does it.\n\n228\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.600\nAnd you need to be able to spot\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.630\nSo the way that you do this is\nthat you can run a simple command\n\n230\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.140\nto list all the files in the directory.\n\n231\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.920\nYou can do that.\n\n232\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.840\nAnd then you can also add in\nan additional option to show you\n\n233\n00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.500\nwhat the permissions are on each file.\n\n234\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.210\nNow I wanna zoomed in on this,\nso that you can see it and\n\n235\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.610\nwe'll actually see those\na little bit more.\n\n236\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.600\nI did this on my own machine but\nwe're gonna go to Linux box and\n\n237\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.530\nalso show you this thing too, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.390\nI named the same thing.\n\n239\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:10.910\nSo I'm trying to find out the permissions\non this showfile.rtf here.\n\n240\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.140\nWhen I first ran it,\n\n241\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.010\nthere's a command that we run\ncalled ls- l from the terminal.\n\n242\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.450\nAnd when it does it, you're looking for\n\n243\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.840\nthe information right here\nat the very beginning.\n\n244\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.010\nAnd it's hard for you to see,\nbut there's actually,\n\n245\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.210\nwell, multiple characters right here that\nyou need to be able to pay attention to.\n\n246\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.030\nAnd there's ten specific characters.\n\n247\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.260\nAnd yes, you should be able to identify\nwhat those characters are about and\n\n248\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.680\nwhat they do, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.020\nSo when it comes down to Linux,\n\n250\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.630\nthere's a couple of basics that we need\nto know as far as permissions go, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.450\n&gt;&gt; I know you look at this and it looks\na little confusing at first, but it really\n\n252\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.770\ndoes make sense when you compare it back\nif you're familiar to Windows already.\n\n253\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.440\nCuz you can kind of okay, relate the two.\n\n254\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's start off with the three\nbasic permissions that we have and\n\n255\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.410\nthen we'll talk about the combinations,\nright?\n\n256\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.610\nSo for us there's read stands for\nan r, there's write, w, and\n\n257\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.450\nthen there is an x, which is execute.\n\n258\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.370\nNow those are three basic permissions,\n\n259\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.760\nbut you can then combine them like r and\nan x which gives you a read and\n\n260\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.760\nexecute, or an r and\na w which gives you a read and write.\n\n261\n00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.730\nSo you can see where the combination of\nthem effectively give you kind of the same\n\n262\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.340\npermissions that you would generally\nfind inside of a Windows box overall.\n\n263\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.440\nThe second thing that you have\nto know of course then is that\n\n264\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.410\nwe actually have three different\ncategories here too, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.480\nThere's actually of course,\nthe owner and then there's a group.\n\n266\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.180\nThat you can be in and then there's\neverybody else is what it boils down to,\n\n267\n00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.710\nokay, or others when you say take a look.\n\n268\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.488\nSo the order that you're seeing here and\n\n269\n00:14:47.488 --> 00:14:49.798\nthis is why actually it kind\nof folded this out here.\n\n270\n00:14:49.798 --> 00:14:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I separated with the colors,\nthat's nice.\n\n271\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.730\n&gt;&gt; So this is how we separated out here,\nso that we can see and load it better.\n\n272\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.420\nIs that the order is very important and\nyou do need to know this as they might\n\n273\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:05.250\nshow something like this to you as you get\nready for your exam here to deal with.\n\n274\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.230\nSo what does it break down to?\n\n275\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.300\nWhen you see this at\nthe beginning of a file,\n\n276\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.410\nyou want to make sure that you take a look\nat that very first character, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.420\nThat very first character,\nif it's a dash, it represents a file.\n\n278\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.760\nIf it's a directory, okay,\nit should have the letter d.\n\n279\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.490\nVery important, okay,\nthat you can distinguish whether or\n\n280\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.600\nnot the permissions are on a file or\non a directory.\n\n281\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.800\nNow if you go,\nI know in Linux everything's a file.\n\n282\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.480\nWhy do you say well,\nthey still actually differentiate them.\n\n283\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.939\nSo even though-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in my mind I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n284\n00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:42.166\nit's kind of like a nature\nto me to separate it,\n\n285\n00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:45.091\nI still am in that\nWindows kind of mindset.\n\n286\n00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:47.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where I'm thinking folders, so\n\n287\n00:15:47.323 --> 00:15:52.170\nwhen I see that directory in my brain\nit's still registering as a folder.\n\n288\n00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.200\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n289\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.520\nYeah, and that's exactly what we can do.\n\n290\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.610\nBut remember that they still differentiate\nit here as far as permissions go, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.257\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; The first group of three\n\n292\n00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:03.913\nare what we call the owner permission.\n\n293\n00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:08.898\nSo whoever actually has created the file\nUsually is considered the owner\n\n294\n00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:10.541\nof that file, as well.\n\n295\n00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:15.960\nIn this instance then, the owner has\nread and write permissions on this file.\n\n296\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.660\nEvery file is only a part of a single\ngroup and on this one the group that it's\n\n297\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.960\na part of, someone else looking at this\nconnection will only have re-permissions.\n\n298\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.790\nThey can't do anything else.\n\n299\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.950\nAnd then anybody else also takes\na look at this file, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.630\nThey also have re-permissions on it too.\n\n301\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.060\nSo is as easy as that when you\nstart to break things down.\n\n302\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.048\nBut it can be a little bit challenging\nwhen you start seeing the whole list of\n\n303\n00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:50.098\nthem but you need to be able to determine\nwhy a particular user may have access\n\n304\n00:16:50.098 --> 00:16:52.374\nto it or\nwhy they may not have access to it and\n\n305\n00:16:52.374 --> 00:16:55.124\nthen how do you change\nthese permissions here too.\n\n306\n00:16:55.124 --> 00:16:57.149\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna look at binary values?\n\n307\n00:16:57.149 --> 00:17:00.366\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not actually gonna take\na look at the idea of the substitution\n\n308\n00:17:00.366 --> 00:17:02.170\nvalues that we have-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n309\n00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.970\n&gt;&gt; Where you can actually\nmake these substitute by\n\n310\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.680\nusing different numbers instead-\n&gt;&gt; Numerical values.\n\n311\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.493\n&gt;&gt; Numerical values that they have.\n\n312\n00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:11.741\nSo they call it some type of shorthand,\nis what they call it.\n\n313\n00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:13.827\nYou might see 777 or 755,\n\n314\n00:17:13.827 --> 00:17:18.420\nthat's fairly common where they\ngrant the levels of permissions.\n\n315\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.669\nAnd that's because each one of these\nis assigned a numerical value.\n\n316\n00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:25.006\nRead, I think is one, write is two,\nand I think execute is four,\n\n317\n00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:27.280\nif I remember right, something like that.\n\n318\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.833\n&gt;&gt; So if you're familiar with those\nnumbers and those assignments,\n\n319\n00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.440\nthen it's faster to look\nat those permissions.\n\n320\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.670\nBut if you're not, it would take\na little bit more time to go ahead and\n\n321\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.900\nlook them up, so.\n\n322\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou might see them in both ways,\n\n323\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.240\nbut overall though,\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of the way that you\n\n324\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.070\ngenerally see it written in the operating\nsystem itself so I'm going to keep\n\n325\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.210\nto that one because the other way is about\nyou trying to be faster at doing this and\n\n326\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.060\ndon't get me wrong, you can be but\njust kind of understand.\n\n327\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.620\n&gt;&gt; The cost.\n\n328\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.520\n&gt;&gt; So lets see what happens here.\n\n329\n00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.950\nSo Cherokee if you were to\nget to that same file and\n\n330\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.160\nyou were to take a look\nat something like this.\n\n331\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.420\nOkay, and let's say you were to get\na question that says, hey the owner has or\n\n332\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.330\nlet's say the group has what\nset of permissions on this one.\n\n333\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.980\nIf you were to take a look.\n\n334\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Read, write, execute and yeah.\n\n335\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n336\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So let's see if Cherokee is right here.\n\n337\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.880\nSo Cherokee is right.\n\n338\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.010\nSo it'd be read, write and execute.\n\n339\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.970\nSo it could be that you do see\nthe beginning of a file here and\n\n340\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.480\nyou go, I need to understand what\npermissions were actually granted here,\n\n341\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.830\nto be actually able to do that.\n\n342\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.500\nAnd we can actually manipulate these\npermissions to show you how to\n\n343\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.820\ndo that in a moment.\n\n344\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.660\nAnd of course, this one here Cherokee,\nwhat about the other group?\n\n345\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.500\nWhat does this particular?\n\n346\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.590\nWhat about others here?\n\n347\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.040\n&gt;&gt; Execute only.\n\n348\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Execute only.\n\n349\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.480\nAre you sure?\n\n350\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.390\nPositive?\n\n351\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.240\n&gt;&gt; For the other group?\n\n352\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.770\nYeah.\n\n353\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n354\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:49.980\n&gt;&gt; Sure?\n\n355\n00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Read and execute.\n\n356\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.010\n&gt;&gt; I did missed the little\nplace over there.\n\n357\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.200\n&gt;&gt; You missed them right here.\n\n358\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.720\n&gt;&gt; Threw me up.\n\n359\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo there you go.\n\n360\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.630\n&gt;&gt; You got me right\n&gt;&gt; But.\n\n361\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.380\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n362\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.650\n&gt;&gt; But those are fairly easy for\nyou to be able to understand,\n\n363\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.900\nas long as you kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Pay attention.\n\n364\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.740\n&gt;&gt; Get the separation out, right?\n\n365\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.750\nWhere you will end up\nseeing something like this.\n\n366\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.280\nSo even though this was done on a Mac,\n\n367\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.070\nlet's see if I can prove\nthis to be true here.\n\n368\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.116\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go to documents.\n\n369\n00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:21.132\nI believe And\nthere's I have my show fall so\n\n370\n00:19:21.132 --> 00:19:27.600\nat this point if I want to see the cvls-\nL and then seal I can zoom in so,\n\n371\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.316\nCherokee, right away when you\nsee that noticed there it is.\n\n372\n00:19:33.316 --> 00:19:38.213\nThere's the same thing I can see is\na file I can see the owner has read and\n\n373\n00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:43.470\nwrite permissions The group is read and\nothers is read here, okay?\n\n374\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.670\nSo we can see something like\nthat very easily to do that.\n\n375\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.606\nNow, the other thing that I can do is I\ncan modify these permissions as well,\n\n376\n00:19:51.606 --> 00:19:53.713\nthere is something that's call chmod.\n\n377\n00:19:53.713 --> 00:19:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Chmod, I knew it.\n\n378\n00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.550\n&gt;&gt; And\nnow you have a choice of what you can do.\n\n379\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.900\n&gt;&gt; I can do something like group and\n\n380\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.440\nowner and then I can add some\npermissions if I want to.\n\n381\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.890\nSo let me make sure I'm actually doing\nright, it's just gonna do the group here.\n\n382\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.221\nSo if I wanted the group to\nalso have execute permissions,\n\n383\n00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:15.530\nI can do that group and\ntell it to add in the execute permissions\n\n384\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.640\non ShowFile and now if I do an ls-l.\n\n385\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.060\nNow notice that here on the group,\n\n386\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.160\nit changed that from what we had up here,\nokay.\n\n387\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.450\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, alternatively,\nfor that syntax,\n\n388\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.820\nwould we put a minus sign if we were\nto remove one of those permissions?\n\n389\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's check it out.\n\n390\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.490\nThat would be true.\n\n391\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.750\nSo, if we take that away and\nnow we run the same command.\n\n392\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.780\nNow notice that we have now\nremoved that permission.\n\n393\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.820\nWhat have you wanted to do for\ngroup and the owner?\n\n394\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.617\nWell, this would be just\nkind of the same thing here.\n\n395\n00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:55.612\nSo instead,\nI would do put go and then plus.\n\n396\n00:20:58.365 --> 00:21:00.261\nAnd now if I run that.\n\n397\n00:21:00.261 --> 00:21:01.070\nOops.\n\n398\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.031\nLet me zoom out here for a little bit.\n\n399\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.430\nWhat did I?\n\n400\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.680\nNo.\n\n401\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.250\nG plus O.\n\n402\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.349\nDid I do that right?\n\n403\n00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.920\nI did it for the group and the other.\n\n404\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.690\nI thought I said owner\nwhich was not right.\n\n405\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.500\nThat should be you for\nthe owner, which is the user.\n\n406\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.080\nOK?\n\n407\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.400\nI was like why did that not\nright on the owner here.\n\n408\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.480\nBut, where was it?\n\n409\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.530\nThere it is.\nSo that's group and other,\n\n410\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.060\nnot group and the owner itself.\n\n411\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.840\n&gt;&gt; Ok.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n412\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.420\n&gt;&gt; So you could see where\n\n413\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.650\nthis actually comes and a handy for you.\n\n414\n00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.720\nBeing ought to understand just those two,\nright?\n\n415\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.350\nSeeing the actual permissions,\n\n416\n00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.590\nunderstanding what they are, and then no\none that you can modify there's permission\n\n417\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.900\nis also a big part of what\nwe also need to do here too.\n\n418\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.360\nOkay?\n\n419\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.500\nNow, that's just kind of the basic, right?\n\n420\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.340\nSo, this can get much more in depth.\n\n421\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.569\nSo, don't get me wrong.\n\n422\n00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:01.937\nCherokee, mentioned the idea of\nthe abbreviated values where you can\n\n423\n00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:03.430\nsubstitute numbers for them.\n\n424\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.847\n755 is kind of the one you normally see\nwhich means the owner gets this much\n\n425\n00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:11.643\npermissions and then usually it\nalso means then that the group and\n\n426\n00:22:11.643 --> 00:22:14.560\nthe owner gets read and\nwrite permission, okay?\n\n427\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.070\nOr, yeah that's right, or no, read and\nexecute permissions if I remember right.\n\n428\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.810\nSo you'll end up seeing that\nthose numbers kind of go around.\n\n429\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.890\nSo you can use either one as you're\ngetting faster, your pricing, those\n\n430\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.870\nnumbers, but here is the way it's reported\nout in the operating system, basically.\n\n431\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.010\nOkay, we need to talk quickly about\nwhat we'll call a sym link, and\n\n432\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.480\nthen what we'll call demons or\ndaemons here, okay?\n\n433\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.710\nA symbolic link, or a sym link,\nis almost like a short cut.\n\n434\n00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.225\nNow, for those of you Linux guys\nthat are about to stone me to death.\n\n435\n00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:48.900\nOkay, I understand because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n436\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.220\n&gt;&gt; It's not technically a shortcut but\n\n437\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.120\nit is fairly similar to\na shortcut that you might make so\n\n438\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.440\nI'm gonna use a Windows world cause\nthat's where my background is, right?\n\n439\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.150\nYou create a shortcut on your desktop it\nlinks back to a location somewhere but\n\n440\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.350\nits normally on your own computer but\n\n441\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.860\ntry to make a shortcut that\nlinks to somewhere else.\n\n442\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.210\nIt's not going to work right?\n\n443\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.510\nTo another volume, to another,\nnot to another volume, to another computer\n\n444\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:18.950\nsomewhere on your network to a hosted\ndevice out on the Cloud somewhere.\n\n445\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.230\nWhatever might be the link, does not work.\n\n446\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.940\nThat's because,\nthat's just the way it works.\n\n447\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.610\nA shortcut says,\nI don't know how to get there.\n\n448\n00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.260\nI'm just not going to be able to do that.\n\n449\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.010\nBut a symbolic link though does.\n\n450\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.400\nSo when you actually create\na symbolic link inside of Linux,\n\n451\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.150\nit gives you that ability to point to\na location even though the location\n\n452\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.040\nmay not exist right there on your\ncomputer at some point, okay.\n\n453\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Would you say that would be\ncomparable to something like a map to\n\n454\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.460\ndrive in a Windows environment?\n\n455\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.410\n&gt;&gt; Very much so, okay,\n\n456\n00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.320\nvery similar to that idea of a map drive\n&gt;&gt; When you do this.\n\n457\n00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.145\nNow, of course,\n\n458\n00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:57.618\nin Linux you may have find some people\nthat will take exception to that too.\n\n459\n00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:01.349\nBut overall that I would say is\nfairly similar to that concept and\n\n460\n00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:05.581\nidea where the tendency use more often\nout today, course is if you have.\n\n461\n00:24:05.581 --> 00:24:07.370\nSome type of access to a Cloud Drive or\n\n462\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.690\nsome sort, whether you're doing one\ndrive or whether you're doing Dropbox.\n\n463\n00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.373\nWhere at Dropbox,\nthat's what we use right here in ITProTV.\n\n464\n00:24:15.373 --> 00:24:18.125\nIt shows up as a folder on my finder.\n\n465\n00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:20.140\n&gt;&gt; Sort of integrated.\n\n466\n00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.540\n&gt;&gt; And all I have to do is click on it.\n\n467\n00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.580\nAnd it looks like that all those files\nthat I have access to are actually on\n\n468\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.606\nmy computer.\n\n469\n00:24:25.606 --> 00:24:29.420\nAnd to a point, some of them are right but\nnot all of them actually are there.\n\n470\n00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.670\nAnd that's because it's sinking back and\nforth.\n\n471\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.630\nBut it actually is linking up to\na location somewhere else that's actually\n\n472\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.550\nallowing that connection to go on.\n\n473\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.330\nSo symbolic links really do help us in\nthat instance, in that particular place.\n\n474\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.310\nAnd you need to know that, because as\nyou're troubleshooting, and you're\n\n475\n00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.060\nnot sure about a location, verify whether\nor not it is a symbolic link or not.\n\n476\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.110\nAnd that may help you to eliminate what\nparts you don't have to worry about\n\n477\n00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.460\ntroubleshooting.\n\n478\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.980\nLast process that we really want to\nmention here is the idea of a demon or\n\n479\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.060\ndaemon, okay?\n\n480\n00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.960\n&gt;&gt; Sounds spooky.\n\n481\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.690\n&gt;&gt; I know it does sound\na little bit spooky, right?\n\n482\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.210\nD-A-E-M-O-N, and people pronounce\nit differently all over the planet.\n\n483\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.470\nSo I'm gonna say,\n\n484\n00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.280\nDaemon cuz I believe that that's the way\nthat most people tend to pronounce it.\n\n485\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.429\nAny time you see where there's\na processes running like FTP and\n\n486\n00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:18.470\nyou're on the server side,\nyou'll see it's list as FTPD.\n\n487\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.880\nOr you'll actually see\nsomething else like DHCP.\n\n488\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.957\nIf that's the service that's\nrunning inside the Linux,\n\n489\n00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:29.845\nyou may see DHCPD at the end, and\nthat's stands for the idea of the Demon or\n\n490\n00:25:29.845 --> 00:25:32.896\nDaemon that you're talking\nabout which means a server.\n\n491\n00:25:32.896 --> 00:25:37.160\nA server is, for us a process\nthat runs without needing a human\n\n492\n00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.480\ninteraction to actually run\nin the background for us.\n\n493\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.480\nAnd it can start at\nthe startup of a computer.\n\n494\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.740\nBut at the same time,\nwe can log out of the computer, and\n\n495\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.870\nthe process can still run by itself.\n\n496\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.030\nOkay, and so it does really equal out to\nthe idea of what we would call a service\n\n497\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.800\ninside of Microsoft too.\n\n498\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.510\nWhere we can actually\nhave it run underneath,\n\n499\n00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.580\nnot the context of my user account.\n\n500\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.370\nBut it can run as a self or\na system account and\n\n501\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.190\nstill keep running even if I'm\nlogged off of the computer as well.\n\n502\n00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.813\nSo inside the Linux, Daemons are pretty\nmuch we end up running entire servers,\n\n503\n00:26:10.813 --> 00:26:13.918\nwhereas in the Windows world,\nwe call them servers or\n\n504\n00:26:13.918 --> 00:26:16.144\nservices that run in the background.\n\n505\n00:26:16.144 --> 00:26:20.740\nMost of these services are going to start\nup when the computer starts up as well.\n\n506\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.150\nSo they don't need our\npermission to start up.\n\n507\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.320\nThey start up when everything else in\nthe operating system starts up, too.\n\n508\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.470\nRunning in the background doesn't\nneed our interaction to do its job or\n\n509\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.610\nto do anything.\n\n510\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.860\nSometimes, maybe at the beginning.\n\n511\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.540\nIt might require a configuration or\ntwo but besides that,\n\n512\n00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.540\nit knows how to do\neverything it needs to do.\n\n513\n00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.190\nOkay.\n\n514\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.280\nSo those are kind of the basic\nLinux terms that we really have to\n\n515\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.840\nmake sure that we understand overall.\n\n516\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.130\nPlease do not take this as\nbeing a full Linux on demo or\n\n517\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.210\ntutorial, to get you up to speed on Linux,\nit's not.\n\n518\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.170\nIf you wanna do that, check out our\nLinux shows that we have available\n\n519\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.990\nin our library, and\nthat one should be a better place.\n\n520\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.940\nAs far as cyber security goes,\nunderstanding just a little bit of those\n\n521\n00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.900\nconcepts is really gonna get\nyou off on the right foot and\n\n522\n00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.520\nget you prepared for the exam.\n\n523\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.954\n&gt;&gt; Well, hasn't been a comprehensive\ntutorial but Ron and\n\n524\n00:27:08.954 --> 00:27:11.245\nI have looked at everything from forks,\nfork bombs.\n\n525\n00:27:11.245 --> 00:27:14.512\nWe've looked at permissions,\nwe've looked at our,\n\n526\n00:27:14.512 --> 00:27:17.660\nwas it the sem-link and\nthen also our daemons.\n\n527\n00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.380\nSo hopefully, you guys can understand\nthose terms a little bit easier now.\n\n528\n00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.790\nI think it's time to go ahead and\nmove on to our Windows terminology, so\n\n529\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.020\nstay tuned and\nthat's what we'll be looking at next.\n\n530\n00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.900\nSo thank you for joining us today.\n\n531\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.630\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this show.\n\n532\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.870\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n533\n00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:34.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n534\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.635\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n535\n00:27:39.439 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Your Cisco\ncyber security series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.550\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.530\nIn this episode, we will be looking at how\nto describe end point security monitoring.\n\n8\n00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.030\nSo if you think about this\nconcept of defense in depth,\n\n9\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.175\nwe're not talking about devices on\nthe perimeter or edge of our network,\n\n10\n00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.535\nwe're really looking at\nour individual endpoints.\n\n11\n00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:34.795\nSo, to help us explain this topic today,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n12\n00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:36.215\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:40.285\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue on in our cyber security\n\n14\n00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:44.495\nfundamentals and understanding\nmore about endpoint security,\n\n15\n00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:47.460\nespecially about monitoring\nendpoint security.\n\n16\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650\nA lot of times it's very easy for\n\n17\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.180\na technician to think that we've got\neverything under control as long as I know\n\n18\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.140\nthat my users are able to get access\nto what they need on their computers,\n\n19\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.460\nthat they're not locked out of their\ncomputer or out of their email.\n\n20\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.810\nAnd as long as nobody's complaining,\nwe're perfectly fine.\n\n21\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.630\nBut the very fact is, remember that\nsecurity attacks today, they normally\n\n22\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.630\nhappen underneath the eye of the people\nthat are using the computer systems, and\n\n23\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.420\nthey don't really know\nwhat can be going on.\n\n24\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.050\nIf you can slip an email into\ntheir inbox and make it something\n\n25\n00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.185\nthat seems like they click on it,\nit's very easy to get through all those\n\n26\n00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:32.230\ndifferent layers of security just by\ndoing some type of social engineering.\n\n27\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.960\nWell, when we start looking into the realm\nof cyber security, what we're also trying\n\n28\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.800\nto do, of course, is be able to monitor\nfor situations, like that, as well as,\n\n29\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.890\nof course, other things that\ncould compromise our systems and\n\n30\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.680\nmake sure that we\nunderstand the focus here.\n\n31\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.559\nIn this particular level, right,\nwhere we're talking about the fundamentals\n\n32\n00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:54.709\nof cyber security,\nwe're starting with the endpoint devices.\n\n33\n00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.598\nIt doesn't mean that we don't\nneed protections on servers or\n\n34\n00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:04.057\non the network devices themselves, such\nas routers, and switches, and firewalls,\n\n35\n00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:09.140\nbut it means that, hey, we need to also\nmonitor the endpoint security itself and\n\n36\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.870\nthat means we need to\nknow what to look for.\n\n37\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.198\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We need to understand what is actually\n\n38\n00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:18.840\navailable at the end points for us that we\nneed to verify that are on and working or\n\n39\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.015\nthat we can pull information out of.\n\n40\n00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:25.202\nSo, we're gonna take a look at\nseveral different ways that we\n\n41\n00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:29.320\ncan actually take a look at\nthe mechanisms that are in place.\n\n42\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.450\nI can't even know the word\nthat I'm wanting to use,\n\n43\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.470\nthat will help us to find\nout what is going on.\n\n44\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.750\nSo, there's a whole list of them for\nus to go through, and\n\n45\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.000\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n46\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and talking about a list,\nI see the first topic on that list is HID,\n\n47\n00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:43.772\nhost intrusion detection.\n\n48\n00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:45.020\nWhat does that mean, Ronnie?\n\n49\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.850\n&gt;&gt; When we start taking a look at\nhost intrusion detection right,\n\n50\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.100\nit is the idea of an intrusion\ndetection system.\n\n51\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.030\nRegardless of whether it's host based or\nwhether it is network based, right?\n\n52\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.140\nThe very fact is,\n\n53\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.170\nwe want to know when something has\nactually got access into my system.\n\n54\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.670\nAnd when we're talking about an intrusion,\nwe're talking about unauthorized access.\n\n55\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.010\nNot every access is good, okay,\nbut not every access is bad.\n\n56\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.520\nWe need a way to distinguish that, right?\n\n57\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.250\nSo, inside of our networks,\n\n58\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.650\nwe have what we call an intrusion\ndetection system that says, look hey,\n\n59\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.720\nhere's a packet that I see coming through\nhere and it's not supposed to be here.\n\n60\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.015\nWell, what does an intrusion\ndetection system normally do?\n\n61\n00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:30.585\nWell, at that point, it normally just\nsays, all right let me log that something\n\n62\n00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:34.101\nbad has happened, and now let me go ahead\nand send an email alert to Cherokee at 2\n\n63\n00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.170\no'clock in the morning letting her\nknow an intrusion has happened.\n\n64\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.630\nOn a host based intrusion detection\nsystem, you're adding in that additional\n\n65\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.213\nlayer of security, just like Cherokee\nwas talking about in defense in depth,\n\n66\n00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:50.860\nsaying look, it might have gotten past my\nnetwork layer intrusion detection, but\n\n67\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.450\nnow, at the end user's computer,\n\n68\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.425\nwe can have another intrusion\ndetection system that alerts us,\n\n69\n00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:01.990\nonce again, to the very fact that\nunauthorized access has happened, as well.\n\n70\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.800\nSo, instead of inspecting the data\nwhen it arrives on the network,\n\n71\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.720\nit actually inspects the data as it comes\ninto the computer itself, as well, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.260\nThen, it continues to monitor,\nwhat we call,\n\n73\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.320\nthe computer system state to detect\nwhat programs are actually running,\n\n74\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.980\nand whether or not any program is\naccessing resources unusually.\n\n75\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.920\nNow, how do you define unusually?\n\n76\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.710\nWell, that's up to every system, and the\nway that the intrusion detection system\n\n77\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.480\nis monitoring and saying,\nhere's what it is.\n\n78\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.390\nSo, there are limits that are set on\nhow you want to describe that and\n\n79\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.470\nhow you want to define the way that that\nsystem is being accessed unusually here.\n\n80\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.930\nSo there's no easy bar to say, here it is.\n\n81\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.110\nHere's what we have to do.\n\n82\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.270\nBut, that's where it begins.\n\n83\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.420\n&gt;&gt; Right and I think we have even\ncovered that in a previous episode,\n\n84\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.370\nRonnie, when we were talking about\nthe different types of analysis\n\n85\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.370\nengines whenever you're\ndealing with these systems.\n\n86\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.680\nWhether it be looking for\nthose anomalies via heuristics base or\n\n87\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.910\nsignature and pattern things,\nthings like that, different options.\n\n88\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's take for an example\nright, that you might end up finding\n\n89\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.960\nyourself where a database program that\nyou got, well, this is a great program,\n\n90\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.450\nbut then it says, I need to access\nevery password on the machine.\n\n91\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.010\nWell, why would it do something like that?\n\n92\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.360\nIt doesn't seem to make sense.\n\n93\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.839\n&gt;&gt; Out of the ordinary, yeah\n&gt;&gt; Where there's a resource.\n\n94\n00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.971\nYes, out of the ordinary.\n\n95\n00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.345\nBut those are things that,\n\n96\n00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:24.070\nhopefully, the intrusion detection\nsystem is able to pick up.\n\n97\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.880\nSo, the neat thing is,\n\n98\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.740\neven though we normally think about\nintrusion detection as it just\n\n99\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.910\naccessing or entering the system, and\nthat we need an order when that happens.\n\n100\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.960\nA host based intrusion detection,\nagain remember, tells us that happens,\n\n101\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.480\nbut really monitors the state\nof the computer for\n\n102\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.130\nthat unusual anomalous type of activity\nthat's happening on your system so\n\n103\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.190\nit can detect that and\nthen set an alert when it needs to, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.040\nNow, this is a great idea.\n\n105\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.170\nIt really is something\nworth taking a look at and\n\n106\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.600\nworth making sure that if your end\nuser devices are expensive devices,\n\n107\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.560\nare something that you're actually\ngonna be using for a good long time,\n\n108\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.290\nit is worth taking a look at when\nyou put it onto your network.\n\n109\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.040\nThere are problems with it,\nthough, too, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.880\nUnlike network intrusion\ndetection systems,\n\n111\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.220\non host based intrusion detection systems,\nthey have to be installed.\n\n112\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.820\nAnd you can do that,\n\n113\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.920\nyou can deploy that in your application\ndeployment however you want to.\n\n114\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.680\nBut, normally though, the configuration\nthough has to happen on each and\n\n115\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.590\nevery individual computer.\n\n116\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.390\nAnd that's because every\ncomputer's actually done\n\n117\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.850\nwhere the user uses\na little bit differently.\n\n118\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.250\nSo, a single template,\nyou might begin there, but\n\n119\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.570\nif you turn on some type of heuristic\nfeature, it's gonna take a bit of time\n\n120\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.110\nbefore it actually is able to\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n121\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.230\nBut then,\nit also takes a learning curve too, right?\n\n122\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo you'll end up with false\nthe positives and false negatives and\n\n123\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.880\nstuff like that,\nthat you also have to deal with too.\n\n124\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.936\nSo, just kind of realize that that it is\nsomething else that you need to make sure\n\n125\n00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:59.620\nthat you inspect as you start doing this.\n\n126\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.520\nThe other thing, of course,\nis the limitation of the host\n\n127\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.440\nbase intrusion detection system,\nis that it only monitors itself.\n\n128\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.097\nSo, it can't tell you, it might be a\nsingle machine that says, I know I'm safe,\n\n129\n00:07:13.097 --> 00:07:17.283\nthere might be 15 machines on the same\nVLAN as that one machine that may be\n\n130\n00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:19.334\ntotally infected with something.\n\n131\n00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.020\nIt could be that.\n\n132\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.010\nDoes that mean that machine is safe?\n\n133\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.720\nHeck no.\nBut, the very fact is,\n\n134\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.010\nit's the only thing that it\ncan do is monitor itself.\n\n135\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.751\nSo, it doesn't give any\nextended coverage or\n\n136\n00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:35.192\nany warning about other systems that\nmaybe infected out there too, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:35.192 --> 00:07:38.587\nAnd, of course, the other thing that you\nhave to worry about with these is that\n\n138\n00:07:38.587 --> 00:07:39.942\nthey can be disabled, right?\n\n139\n00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:43.200\nAnd the end user goes,\nI don't need that, I'll just disable it.\n\n140\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.314\nOr it can be disabled by software if\nsomebody's smart enough to figure out-\n\n141\n00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:47.240\n&gt;&gt; A malicious, yeah.\n\n142\n00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.833\n&gt;&gt; Figure out how to do this.\n\n143\n00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:53.280\nThey, of course, can take a look at that\nparticular point and do that as well.\n\n144\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.276\nSo, a lot of the systems that you\nhave in place, right, are like that.\n\n145\n00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:01.891\nAnd it's kind of funny, for example, let's\ntake a look at my computer here just for\n\n146\n00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:02.478\na moment.\n\n147\n00:08:02.478 --> 00:08:05.839\nWhen we start to take a look\nat the idea of Windows,\n\n148\n00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:09.130\nthere is really a couple\nof options that we have.\n\n149\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.650\nAnd I'm must gonna type in,\nat least I think I am, firewall here.\n\n150\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.670\nAnd notice that there is\nthe Windows Firewall and\n\n151\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.320\nthen there is the Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security too, okay.\n\n152\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.860\nNow these things really are great firewall\nmeasures that are host based overall.\n\n153\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.060\nBut it's here on the Windows firewall\nwith advanced security, along with\n\n154\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.720\nWindows Defender in combination with that,\nthat really does act like an intrusion\n\n155\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.100\ndetection system as well and\nit can also be a prevention system too.\n\n156\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.040\nSo when you actually put all of it\ntogether, it can do that in combination.\n\n157\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.130\nBut whereas this is just\na regular firewall,\n\n158\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.540\nthis one with advanced security where\nwe can limit exactly what we want and\n\n159\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.918\nlimit the activity going in and\nout of my computer.\n\n160\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:58.833\nWell, that really is part of that\nentire system that really more\n\n161\n00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:02.098\nrighteously belongs, or\nmore rightly, excuse me,\n\n162\n00:09:02.098 --> 00:09:05.810\nbelongs into the category\nof intrusion prevention.\n\n163\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.010\nBut it is detecting what's\nhappening as data is moving in and\n\n164\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.610\nout of your systems as well.\n\n165\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.650\nSo that's a good kind of basis for you to\nthink about when you start thinking about\n\n166\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.450\ntypes of host-based detection systems\nlike what we're talking about as well.\n\n167\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.470\nOkay, all right, so our next category\nis actually two different ones and\n\n168\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.580\nwhich could be very easily confused.\n\n169\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.276\nAll right Cherokee, so what is\nthe difference between anti virus and\n\n170\n00:09:32.276 --> 00:09:33.113\nanti malware?\n\n171\n00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:34.250\nWhat would you think?\n\n172\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, looking at virus I'm just\nthinking more signature definition\n\n173\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.960\nbased whereas the anti malware can be\na little bit more comprehensive in\n\n174\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.090\na sense that it covers more\nthan just well, viruses.\n\n175\n00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.230\nSo, we see a lot of different\ntypes of malware being used today.\n\n176\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.840\nSo personally,\nI try to use that term accordingly,\n\n177\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.480\nbecause sometimes you can just\nsay them interchangeably,\n\n178\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.990\nno one's going to really balk\nat you too much for that.\n\n179\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.770\nBut we do wanna understand that there is a\ndifference between these two terms, right?\n\n180\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.660\n&gt;&gt; That's what we really want to get to.\n\n181\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.223\nSo it's strange, right?\n\n182\n00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:13.056\nThe term anti-malware is a big\numbrella term in which antivirus also\n\n183\n00:10:13.056 --> 00:10:18.490\ncomes underneath as far as\na anti-malware type of system belongs.\n\n184\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.368\nSo the way I was trying to think about\nit is how could I actually phrase this,\n\n185\n00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:26.243\nevery antivirus is anti-malware, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:26.243 --> 00:10:27.006\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n187\n00:10:27.006 --> 00:10:29.508\n&gt;&gt; But\nnot every anti-malware is an antivirus.\n\n188\n00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:32.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n189\n00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:37.200\n&gt;&gt; So it is hard because even I\ngot tongue tied in my mind, right?\n\n190\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.785\nI was like,\nthat's not working out logically.\n\n191\n00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:42.395\n[CROSSTALK] So just kind of realize that.\n\n192\n00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:46.560\nSo, let's make sure we understand why we\nwould actually choose to implement both.\n\n193\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.194\nSometimes people do get that mistake that\nCherokee was talking about where they go,\n\n194\n00:10:50.194 --> 00:10:51.170\nyou just have to do one.\n\n195\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.822\nYou don't have to worry\nabout doing the other.\n\n196\n00:10:53.822 --> 00:10:57.456\nWell, that doesn't offer you the full\nrange of protection that you need\n\n197\n00:10:57.456 --> 00:11:01.342\nif you're going to be taking a look at\nthe systems that are out there, right.\n\n198\n00:11:01.342 --> 00:11:05.983\nSo, the way that you would choose to\ndo this as far as a fundamental best\n\n199\n00:11:05.983 --> 00:11:10.548\npractice goes is that you do need to\nrun an antivirus on your computers\n\n200\n00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:15.130\njust like from day one when they\nintroduced antivirus, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.280\nNow, just when I say that, there's\nprobably a bunch of people listening right\n\n202\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.520\nnow that you know their\nears just perked up and\n\n203\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.800\nthey've just been reading recently,\nespecially in this last year or so\n\n204\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.450\nwhere some of the biggest people have\nsaid, anti virus are you joking?\n\n205\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.370\nDon't run that anymore, it's garbage.\n\n206\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.100\nIt really is.\n\n207\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.640\nThat's what they're telling you.\n\n208\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.280\nAnd it's amazing about how many people\nare starting to take that effect.\n\n209\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.040\nAnd what they have started to find out is,\nit may be true.\n\n210\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.610\nAnd the weird is there was kudos\nactually given to Microsoft Defender.\n\n211\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthat's what I was going to mention.\n\n212\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.070\nI'm saying,\nyou see Microsoft leading the way.\n\n213\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.550\nThey take their old\nSecurity Essentials and say.\n\n214\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.190\nAll right, let's just kind of\npush it on into the Defender.\n\n215\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.840\nSo you don't really see that anymore.\n\n216\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.810\nWhereas the Security Essentials was really\njust focused on Antivirus technology.\n\n217\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.230\nAnd now you see that it\nkind of just expanding.\n\n218\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you are.\n\n219\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.100\nYou're starting to hear people are,\nsecurity experts are saying,\n\n220\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.790\ndon't worry about antivirus.\n\n221\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.240\nMy suggestion, even right now,\neven though those guys may, and they may,\n\n222\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.670\nthey may know exactly what you\nknow they're talking about.\n\n223\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.938\nThe very fact is there are a database,\nthere's a ton of.\n\n224\n00:12:26.938 --> 00:12:27.884\n&gt;&gt; Pre-existing.\n\n225\n00:12:27.884 --> 00:12:30.711\n&gt;&gt; Thousands, pre-existing viruses and\nstuff that's out there.\n\n226\n00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:33.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've already been known,\nthey've been documented,\n\n227\n00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:37.680\nand that's what you have security\nanalysts every day working against this.\n\n228\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.360\nSo why not take that really important\ninformation and use it to your advantage.\n\n229\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.970\nGo figure.\n\n230\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.100\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you want, right?\n\n231\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You want to be able to protect against\n\n232\n00:12:44.945 --> 00:12:47.236\neven those old things and\nyou might even, why do I need that?\n\n233\n00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:52.246\nBecause some attacker out there is gonna\nsay, I'm gonna take a guess that Ronnie,\n\n234\n00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:55.130\nhe may be one of those guys that thinks-\n&gt;&gt; He didn't update.\n\n235\n00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.052\n&gt;&gt; That he doesn't update.\n\n236\n00:12:56.052 --> 00:12:59.673\nAnd even though he thinks he's\ngot anti-malware running,\n\n237\n00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:02.130\nthis may slip underneath his radar.\n\n238\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.420\n&gt;&gt; And I like how you said newbie,\n\n239\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.110\nbecause I mean,\nhe doesn't even have to create a new code.\n\n240\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.230\nIt's something that's already been done.\n\n241\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.210\nHe can just grab it, run that script.\n\n242\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.210\nAnd guess what, if Ronnie didn't update,\nthen Ronnie is.\n\n243\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.580\n&gt;&gt; All set.\n&gt;&gt; Out of luck.\n\n244\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.263\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit really is kind of an unusual thing.\n\n245\n00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.900\nMy suggestion is make sure you run.\n\n246\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.330\nNow what about anti-malware then?\n\n247\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.480\nWhy would I choose to run both?\n\n248\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.280\nWell anti-malware, as good as anti-virus\nis great at you know detecting everything\n\n249\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.672\nit already knows about.\n\n250\n00:13:28.672 --> 00:13:32.172\n&gt;&gt; As long as those definitions are up\nto date, that's the caveat there.\n\n251\n00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:36.784\n&gt;&gt; But anti-malware though is good at\nactually detecting other things that don't\n\n252\n00:13:36.784 --> 00:13:39.860\nexactly fall in line but\ntend to be malicious.\n\n253\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.030\nSo, it's more heuristic in it's nature.\n\n254\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.589\nThat means it can find stuff that\nmay not actually exist yet, or\n\n255\n00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:48.828\nseems to be more malicious code,\nbecause it can do that.\n\n256\n00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.840\nIt can figure that stuff out.\n\n257\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.194\nSo, this newer type and way of doing it,\nlike the cryptoware and all of that stuff,\n\n258\n00:13:55.194 --> 00:14:00.500\nanti-malware is really good and\neffective at stopping things like that.\n\n259\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.830\nSo, the combination of both is\nkey is what it comes down to.\n\n260\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.630\nAlong with that and of course of\nupdating both of these in what they do\n\n261\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.250\nis also key behind everything\nthat you do as well.\n\n262\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:19.780\nWhen somebody does not take the end\npoint security serious enough\n\n263\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.660\nto think that hey, I don't need to worry\nabout running anti virus on their system.\n\n264\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.351\nThey may have some fool\nproof way of making sure\n\n265\n00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:28.909\nthat nothing ever happens to their system.\n\n266\n00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:32.966\nIf you're not sure, in other words,\nyou can't guarantee it,\n\n267\n00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:37.700\none of the best things to do is follow\nwhat we know as conventional wisdom for\n\n268\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.050\nsecurity, which is antivirus and\nanti-malware.\n\n269\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.780\nMake sure those things are up to date and\nthat you're going.\n\n270\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.380\nAnd of course, making sure that\nyour computer is up to date and\n\n271\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.150\napplications that you're running\non your computer is up to date.\n\n272\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.740\nYou can't expect that\nthat's not going to happen.\n\n273\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.160\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, when you say that,\njust to kind of remind you guys out there.\n\n274\n00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.810\nHe's not talking about\nconflicting pieces of software.\n\n275\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.110\nYou really wanna make sure\nthat you understand what\n\n276\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.280\ntype of solution you do choose so\n\n277\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.670\nthat they're not fighting against each\nother and working opposing in that manner.\n\n278\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.480\n&gt;&gt; So, what are the weaknesses\nbehind choosing these?\n\n279\n00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.560\nWell, the weakness behind\nchoosing them is simple,\n\n280\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.090\nthinking that one is better than the other\nor one is not dependent on the other.\n\n281\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.300\nIt's both together that make the effective\ncombination for a security barrier for\n\n282\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.920\nthe individual host.\n\n283\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.080\nAnd that's what we'd really\nwant to focus in on.\n\n284\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.070\nSo let's take a look at\nour system here again, and\n\n285\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.180\nthis will help us out in the Windows side\nof things, which is Windows Defender.\n\n286\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.440\nSo Windows Defender,\nI want to make sure I can.\n\n287\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.550\nI started to,\nI was gonna say I can see it there.\n\n288\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.361\nSee if I can launch that thing up.\n\n289\n00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.785\nWindows Defender itself\nit doesn't look fancy.\n\n290\n00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:49.592\nSo it doesn't have all the bells and\n\n291\n00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:52.424\nwhistles that some of the thrid\nparty utilities have but\n\n292\n00:15:52.424 --> 00:15:56.114\nthis is one that is built into\nthe operating system by Microsoft itself.\n\n293\n00:15:56.114 --> 00:15:57.356\nIt's the one that they recommend.\n\n294\n00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.757\nYou can always verify whether or\nnot your system is running.\n\n295\n00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:04.207\nWhenever you see a different,\nwhich is a red x, or a yellow,\n\n296\n00:16:04.207 --> 00:16:05.593\nsaying\n&gt;&gt; Warning.\n\n297\n00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:08.920\n&gt;&gt; Stuff may be out of date, you wanna\nmake sure that you check that out.\n\n298\n00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.510\nAnd of course,\n\n299\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.980\nif it is, make sure you also come\nover here and update the system too.\n\n300\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.042\nSo this is a combination of both\nanti-malware as well as an anti-virus type\n\n301\n00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:20.210\nof system.\n\n302\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.900\nYou can see whether they're quarantined.\n\n303\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.840\nYou name it, historical things.\n\n304\n00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.100\nAnd of course, make sure that\nyou're running a regular scan, too.\n\n305\n00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.250\nAlways be sure that you update before you\nrun your latest scans that are available.\n\n306\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.268\nAnd make sure that your system is getting\nup to, that's not the one I wanted.\n\n307\n00:16:37.268 --> 00:16:38.803\nI was trying to make sure.\n\n308\n00:16:38.803 --> 00:16:40.350\nYeah, there's realtime protection.\n\n309\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.990\nSo this one actually shows you whether or\nnot it's turned on or turned off.\n\n310\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.237\nSo this one actually has it both on cloud\nbased as well as realtime protection.\n\n311\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.470\nAnd then you can even have a scan\noff line which is something that's\n\n312\n00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.500\nvery helpful later on as you need to,\nespecially if your system gets infected.\n\n313\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.080\nGives you the ability\nto boot directly up to\n\n314\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.390\na Windows Defender disk that you made and\nthen\n\n315\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.120\nit can scan your system without you ever\nhaving to launch the operating system.\n\n316\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.630\nVery good,\n\n317\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.150\nespecially when you're not sure whether\nyour computer has been infected or not.\n\n318\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.160\nAnd it can help you to-\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love those pre-boot\n\n319\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.085\nenvironment tools.\n\n320\n00:17:17.085 --> 00:17:19.234\n&gt;&gt; And it does.\n&gt;&gt; Live CDs, yeah.\n\n321\n00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really helps.\n\n322\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.300\nI was trying to see where else we\nneeded to take a look at in here,\n\n323\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.930\nbut that's pretty much about it.\n\n324\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.280\nSo they don't give you a lot\nof tons of options anymore.\n\n325\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.710\nBut make sure that you understand,\n\n326\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.820\nwhichever one that you're\nrunning inside of your network,\n\n327\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.470\nthe updates are pretty much the important\naspect of doing this as well, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.100\nAll right, so\nthat moves us into, of course,\n\n329\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.710\ntalking about the host based firewall.\n\n330\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.360\nAnd now we're really just\ntaking a look briefly\n\n331\n00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.500\nat the idea of what a host based firewall\nis in a previous episode, as well.\n\n332\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500\nAnd here we're just mentioning it\nagain for the sake of completeness.\n\n333\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.480\nThe very fact is, it is one of the primary\nways that we can really help defend our\n\n334\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.580\nnetwork beyond the perimeter,\nright, inside of your own network.\n\n335\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.810\nMost of the time when you're\nnew at this you think okay,\n\n336\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.763\nI've got my firewall on\nthe edge of the network.\n\n337\n00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:10.208\nWhy do I need to worry about\nhaving a host based firewall?\n\n338\n00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:12.720\nWell, remember that things\nstill get on your network\n\n339\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.350\nthat doesn't come in through the firewall.\n\n340\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.100\nPeople bring in additional connections,\n\n341\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.540\nsuch as going over your\ncompany's wireless.\n\n342\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.853\nOr they may bring in a USB thumb drive.\n\n343\n00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Thumb drives, yeah.\n\n344\n00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.960\n&gt;&gt; So when you start to take a look at\nsomething like this, it is those types\n\n345\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.670\nof things that the Windows firewall really\ndoes help us out with as well, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.451\nAll right, Ronnie, the next thing we\nwanna take a look at here is going to be\n\n347\n00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.876\napplication whitelisting and blacklisting.\n\n348\n00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:42.009\nWhat's the difference?\n\n349\n00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we start taking a look\nat the idea of using what we call\n\n350\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.970\nwhitelisting or blacklisting, right,\nthere's a couple of different theories\n\n351\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.160\neven in firewall technology that really\nmakes sense to use as an analogy,\n\n352\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.430\nright, in just regular physical security,\nokay?\n\n353\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.200\nSo let's think about the way\nthat we treat our homes,\n\n354\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.430\nat least I hope the way that\nyou treat your home as well.\n\n355\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.070\nSo you have a couple options as you leave\nyour house to come to work at ITProTV,\n\n356\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.060\nCherokee.\n\n357\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.240\nOne is that you leave the house.\n\n358\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.160\nAnd you go, look,\nI'm just gonna close the door behind me.\n\n359\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.544\nI'm not gonna worry about\nlocking the door at all, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:19.456\nNow when you do something like that, the\npotential chances are that somebody that\n\n361\n00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:23.660\nyou don't know, and it's possible, right,\nthat they can just walk into your house.\n\n362\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.109\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so no lock,\n\n363\n00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:29.732\nnothing, they're just gonna walk in,\nsit down, make a sandwich,\n\n364\n00:19:29.732 --> 00:19:31.119\nwhatever they want to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:32.420\n&gt;&gt; And then leave, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.960\nSo it is very possible that you do it.\n\n367\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:40.200\nBut then there's the other side where you\ngo, look, I'm gonna lock my door, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.300\nThat person can't get in.\n\n369\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.830\nBut somebody with a key can.\n\n370\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.410\nMake sense?\n\n371\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.300\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n372\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, whitelisting and blacklisting\nessentially work the same way.\n\n373\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.560\nIf you whitelist something,\n\n374\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.530\nyou're giving that application a key to\nbe able to get access into your computer.\n\n375\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.570\nOkay, and say I can run and\nI can do what I need to.\n\n376\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.160\nIf you're blacklisting it,\nthough, you're actually saying,\n\n377\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.290\nI'm not gonna give you a key at all.\n\n378\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.510\nI'm locking the door completely which\nis great, and that's fine, okay, and\n\n379\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.500\nthat actually says,\n\n380\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.860\nlook, I am going to make sure that hey,\nnobody gets in, no matter what, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.760\nSo we actually have to\nuse a combination of.\n\n382\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.000\nWe don't normally wanna leave\nthe door completely open so\n\n383\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.550\nthat anybody can walk into our systems.\n\n384\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.870\nBut we do need applications to run.\n\n385\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.210\nSo the way that we do it safely, is what?\n\n386\n00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.230\nWe go all right, whoever I wanna let\nin my house, they have to have a key.\n\n387\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.510\nWe don't just leave the door open and\n\n388\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.340\njust go, only the people that need to be\nin my house, will go into my house, okay?\n\n389\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.500\nSo that is the same thing.\n\n390\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.290\nSo two theories here, right?\n\n391\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.420\nThe way that the old firewalls,\n\n392\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.701\nthe original type of firewalls really\nused to work was simple, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.910\nWe'll let everybody through and\nthen just start closing off\n\n394\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.730\nthat portion, those applications\nthat you don't want to go through.\n\n395\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.653\nSo that way any application that came\nin to your system, you go, all right,\n\n396\n00:20:56.653 --> 00:20:58.173\nI don't want that one to come through.\n\n397\n00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.570\nI'll mark that one x and we're fine, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.300\n&gt;&gt; But what if there's an application out\nthere that you're not aware of that you\n\n399\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.030\ndon't want that kind of\ntraffic on your network.\n\n400\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.260\nSo how can you then close it off if\nyou're not even aware it exists?\n\n401\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.404\nWell, if you're not aware that it exists,\nthen you're kind of in trouble, right?\n\n402\n00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:12.761\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; So that's the problem that you have.\n\n403\n00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n404\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.000\n&gt;&gt; But that's the way it used to be,\nis that, they would just kinda go,\n\n405\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.310\nall right, just mark all the traffic\nthat you don't want to come in, and\n\n406\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.640\nthen leave it open for everybody else.\n\n407\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.660\nWell, after a while, of course,\n\n408\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.320\nit didn't take long before like, that's\nkind of the reverse approach I want.\n\n409\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.770\nFirewalls, though,\nthey start off right out of the box.\n\n410\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.410\nEverything is closed, okay, so\nit's a solid door that's closed.\n\n411\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.170\nAnd then they only say, only open it up,\n\n412\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.620\nin other words,\nonly give a key to the applications or\n\n413\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.250\nto the traffic or to whoever that you\nwant to be able to access the system.\n\n414\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.760\nAnd the way that the firewall works,\n\n415\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.700\nit says, only if you open the door,\nis what it's saying.\n\n416\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.120\nSo don't even let somebody knocking\nat the door, just only open the ones.\n\n417\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.007\nOn your individual systems,\nor inside of your network,\n\n418\n00:21:58.007 --> 00:22:02.113\nyou also want to take an approach that\nactually best suits your network instead.\n\n419\n00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:06.000\nAnd the best one is to blacklist\neverybody at the beginning.\n\n420\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.409\nI know that that sounds strange, but just\nsay, here is only who I want to let in.\n\n421\n00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:15.220\nAnd that way you're only allowing\njust a very small footprint of people\n\n422\n00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.550\nthat you want to let in or applications.\n\n423\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nduring that tuning period there,\n\n424\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.770\nyou're gonna find a little bit of,\nI guess, opposition.\n\n425\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.400\nOr you're gonna hear about it because\none time setting up a mail server and\n\n426\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.040\ntrying to find, just for an example,\nthat spam filter level, right?\n\n427\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.237\nKind of the same concept.\n\n428\n00:22:35.237 --> 00:22:37.600\nAm I gonna be applying whitelists or\nblacklists?\n\n429\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.980\nHow are we gonna have that work?\n\n430\n00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.000\nNow from the IT department, you want\nyour network as secure as possible.\n\n431\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.630\nBut coming from\na salesperson's perspective,\n\n432\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.630\nthey want prospective clients to be\nable to communicate with them and\n\n433\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:55.250\ncome into your network and send an email\nwithout the IT department stopping them.\n\n434\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.830\nSo yes, it's great to be secure, but\n\n435\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.490\nyou also want to remain productive\nin a business environment.\n\n436\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.280\nAnd that's were that fine line\ncomes into place, that balance.\n\n437\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.480\n&gt;&gt; And it has to, right?\n\n438\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.230\nYou can't allow for\n\n439\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.650\neverything to come in because that's\njust dangerous for everybody.\n\n440\n00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.430\nBut at the same time, you can't restrict\nit so much that business can't be done.\n\n441\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you have to find that balance and\n\n442\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.930\nthat balance is using whitelisting and\nblacklisting to do so.\n\n443\n00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.890\nYou can be insanely restrictive,\n\n444\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.630\nright, where it's almost\nimpossible to get work done.\n\n445\n00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.620\nBut you can be so\n\n446\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.580\npermissive in it that you might as\nwell not have any security at all.\n\n447\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.530\nSo it really is dependent upon\nthe way that those systems are set up.\n\n448\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.330\nAnd that's what you have to do.\n\n449\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.330\nNow as far as different technology goes,\non the individual hosts, you\n\n450\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.940\nmight be wondering, do we have anything\nlike that on our systems to do something?\n\n451\n00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.030\nWell, in Windows you do.\n\n452\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.940\nLet me show we were talking about.\n\n453\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.484\nSo here on my system inside of the local\nsecurity policy, which I already brought\n\n454\n00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:57.553\nup, here you have, of course,\nwhat the local security policy manager.\n\n455\n00:23:57.553 --> 00:24:00.312\nAnd when you start to take a look\ninside of the security settings,\n\n456\n00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:04.210\nyou see all of these different folders\nthat you have listed right here.\n\n457\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.004\nNotice that there's one called\nSoftware Restriction Policies.\n\n458\n00:24:08.004 --> 00:24:11.609\nSoftware Restriction Policies really are\nessentially defining the white list and\n\n459\n00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:13.010\nthe black list for you, right?\n\n460\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.270\nYou're saying,\nwhat do you want to restrict?\n\n461\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.340\nWell, this is fine,\nthis is where you would go an do this.\n\n462\n00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.170\nNow, it works a lot better if\nyou have an active directory\n\n463\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:22.960\nset up and that\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n464\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.030\n&gt;&gt; Everybody actually\nfollows the same thing.\n\n465\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.660\nBecause on the individual host, right,\nI can do it, okay, one at a time.\n\n466\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.710\nIf I'm in a network though\nof a thousand people-\n\n467\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.020\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna take you a while.\n\n468\n00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.530\n&gt;&gt; It takes you one at a time,\nthat's why I didn't wanna do it.\n\n469\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.610\nCuz even one computer\ntakes you a while but\n\n470\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.790\nI can set up a group policy\nthat can push this out instead.\n\n471\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.450\n&gt;&gt; One and done.\n\n472\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.040\n&gt;&gt; One and done and then that way I\ndon't have to worry about it either.\n\n473\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.190\nSo this is what you can do.\n\n474\n00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.780\nYou can say, look,\nI need this version, okay?\n\n475\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.410\nSo, let's say it's like Adobe Reader or\nsomething.\n\n476\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.350\nYou might say, I wanna allow\nAdobe Reader Version 9 to come in, but\n\n477\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.470\nI don't want Adobe Reader Version\n8 to come in.\n\n478\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.430\nYou can do even stuff like that.\n\n479\n00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.720\nNow, this software restriction policy\nhas been around forever and a day.\n\n480\n00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.490\nOf course, Windows says, look.\n\n481\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.500\nDon't use this.\n\n482\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.020\nYou don't have as much control\nas you think over here.\n\n483\n00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.710\nBecause it can't determine certain things,\nokay.\n\n484\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.400\nBut this application control\npolicy is more restrictive.\n\n485\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.790\nAnd, as well,\n\n486\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.790\nit actually gives you that ability to kind\nof even be more granular in your control.\n\n487\n00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.530\nOf all the applications that you want.\n\n488\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.390\nSo, the use of both of these,\n\n489\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.160\nwhether we're talking about\nApplication Control Policies, or\n\n490\n00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.930\nSoftware Restriction Policies,\nis pretty much the key.\n\n491\n00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.840\nAnd if you're wondering like,\nwell if one of them is not supposed to be\n\n492\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.850\nused then why is that still in place, it's\nbecause we still actually run with legacy\n\n493\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.340\nsystems inside of our networks, and\nnot everybody is on Windows 10, okay.\n\n494\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, and kinda like the concept,\neven you think about, like driver signing,\n\n495\n00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.300\nright, or prohibiting unsigned\n\n496\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.780\nprograms from running your drivers\nfrom running things like that as well.\n\n497\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.720\nYou can really define at a granular\nlevel the control over your network,\n\n498\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.830\nthat is the beauty also\nwith active directory.\n\n499\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.300\nBut, it just depends on how you\nwant to approach your systems.\n\n500\n00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.430\nUsually at an enterprise environment\nthat is probably a pretty common\n\n501\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.190\napproach that one would take.\n\n502\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt that we\nhave to worry about stuff like this.\n\n503\n00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.860\nLast one, that we wanna talk about here,\nof course,\n\n504\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.080\nis understand that concept of what we\ncall sandboxing within our systems.\n\n505\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.250\nNow, we do this on networks all the time,\nwhere we set up a virtual environment\n\n506\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.750\nto do testing for\nupdates and everything else.\n\n507\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.880\nSo, it doesn't actually affect everybody,\nright?\n\n508\n00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So you might have an update server,\n\n509\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.210\nyou can go, Microsoft released\n25 updates this past Tuesday or\n\n510\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.230\nwhatever Tuesday it's on.\n\n511\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.272\nI don't know if I need to push out all 25?\n\n512\n00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:37.144\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n513\n00:26:37.144 --> 00:26:37.933\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do you do?\n\n514\n00:26:37.933 --> 00:26:40.250\nYou want to sandbox that or\nyou want to do a test bed environment.\n\n515\n00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.160\nSo, you might set that up to say, all\nright I am gonna be using these machines.\n\n516\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.910\n&gt;&gt; Select the ones you want.\n\n517\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.579\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd that way you gonna find out whether it\n\n518\n00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:49.100\naffects them badly or not, okay?\n\n519\n00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.960\nYou can test it out in that way.\n\n520\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.900\nSandboxing essentially kind of gives\na couple of things about applications and\n\n521\n00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.650\neven computer systems that run.\n\n522\n00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.730\nEssentially, what we're doing is we're\nrestricting the code of applications that\n\n523\n00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.750\nrun on our systems here and\n\n524\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:05.920\ngiving them only the privileges that\nthey need to run but no more than that.\n\n525\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.690\nSo, we're restricting them and we're\nactually using the principle of least\n\n526\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:13.200\nprivilege here on applications\nis what we're trying to do.\n\n527\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.310\nWe don't want to give them any\nadditional types of permissions\n\n528\n00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.990\nto be abused at any point.\n\n529\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.120\nThe great thing is,\na lot of programs today\n\n530\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.640\nare already running in\nsandboxed types of conditions.\n\n531\n00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.000\nFor example, your browser is\nalready running in a sandbox.\n\n532\n00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.560\nIt used to be,\n\n533\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.890\nyour browser was kind of the big porta\nrightl, directly into your systems today.\n\n534\n00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.400\nBut today you might gotta\ncrash a browser but\n\n535\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.360\nmost of them are limited to\nthat particular environment.\n\n536\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.070\nWhere its like, yeah I can affect\nthe browser but I'm not gonna\n\n537\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.210\nlet you get access to the lower levels\nof my operating systems anymore.\n\n538\n00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:52.228\nSo, this way they run in what\nwe call some type of low mode or\n\n539\n00:27:52.228 --> 00:27:57.386\nprotected mode in your systems\nthat really only allow for\n\n540\n00:27:57.386 --> 00:28:01.480\nthat particular application environment.\n\n541\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.118\nIt doesn't allow it to spread.\n\n542\n00:28:03.118 --> 00:28:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't necessarily\njust have to be an application.\n\n543\n00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.330\nFor instance, Ronnie,\nif we had virtual environments set up.\n\n544\n00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.670\nAnd I had some virtual machines\non my physical laptop here.\n\n545\n00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.660\nI could sandbox my virtual machines.\n\n546\n00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.780\nI am essentially isolating them.\n\n547\n00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.500\nSo, by isolating the information\nstored within that app.\n\n548\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:25.120\nI can do it on a per app basis,\nper network basis,\n\n549\n00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.030\nif I have my virtual machines connected\nwith the virtual switch there.\n\n550\n00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.330\nIt just depends on some different\ntypes of configurations.\n\n551\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:38.040\nWhereas in a physical realm,\nif I have a computer and\n\n552\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.920\nit's completely removed from my network,\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n553\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.900\nThat's called Air gapping,\nwhen it's not connected logically and\n\n554\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.260\nphysically to your networks.\n\n555\n00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.980\nSo, you kind of have to think\nabout it like that as well.\n\n556\n00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.590\nThose terms are kind of similar, but\nAir gapping is complete segregation.\n\n557\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.770\nIf you have a really old, antiquated,\nlike Windows XP machine that was\n\n558\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:04.340\nembedded into a production machine in a\nmanufacturing environment on their floor.\n\n559\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.980\nAnd you didn't want it to go ahead and\n\n560\n00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.980\nbe a part of your normal\nproduction environment.\n\n561\n00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.160\nSo, I like that concept sand boxing.\n\n562\n00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.862\nRonnie, it always makes me think\nof like look, I'm allowed to play.\n\n563\n00:29:13.862 --> 00:29:18.000\nAll right, so when I'm setting up a lab,\nI can go play in this lab,\n\n564\n00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.050\nin those virtual machines,\nI can mess up a bunch of things, and\n\n565\n00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.024\nnot have to worry about the consequences\non my virtual, on my production network.\n\n566\n00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:27.860\nYep, that's exactly the concept\nthat we want to understand.\n\n567\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.490\nThe great thing, like we said,\nis now, remember,\n\n568\n00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:34.140\nthat especially on the individual\nhosts almost everything is sandbox.\n\n569\n00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.940\nI'm not gonna say completely everything,\nbut almost everything.\n\n570\n00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.810\nYour browsers like we were talking about,\n\n571\n00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.010\nweb page content,\nplug in content, you name it.\n\n572\n00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.280\nAnd one of the big things that is\ncoming back today of course are even\n\n573\n00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.610\nmacro viruses inside of.\n\n574\n00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.250\nYour office applications as well,\n\n575\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:56.480\neven PDFs today are also sandbox, because\nof weaknesses that they found earlier too,\n\n576\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.820\nso just imagine that,\njust about everything that you can,\n\n577\n00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.260\nis going to be in an environment in which\nthe machine is trying to protect itself.\n\n578\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.130\nBy making sure it only has\naccess to what it needs to.\n\n579\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.590\nThe weakness behind this, of course,\n\n580\n00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.510\nis in your BYOD environment,\nyour bring your own device environment.\n\n581\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.240\nMobile apps are generally not sandbox.\n\n582\n00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.000\nThey have access to\neverything on that phone and\n\n583\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.352\nthat's why you've gotta be very careful.\n\n584\n00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:21.374\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why you see those custom\n\n585\n00:30:21.374 --> 00:30:23.000\nphones, like the black phone.\n\n586\n00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And those phones, they're not for\n\n587\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.625\nthe average person, those are for.\n\n588\n00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:29.990\n[LAUGH] Those are for people who are\nextremely concerned about their security,\n\n589\n00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.600\nand they don't see that interoperability\nwith a lot of the applications.\n\n590\n00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.700\nBecause like Ronnie said,\nthose applications do require\n\n591\n00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.280\nother system components to work properly,\nand function properly.\n\n592\n00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that pretty much brings us\nto that list of different types of things\n\n593\n00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.390\nthat we have to worry about\n&gt;&gt; And that we have to be monitoring,\n\n594\n00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.050\nright, on the usage,\non the end user type of usage,\n\n595\n00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:53.300\non these host systems because if we\ndon't this is where it will get us.\n\n596\n00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.660\nMost of the compromises that tend\nto happen within our networks\n\n597\n00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.260\nis not intentional, a lot of times.\n\n598\n00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.580\nIt's unintentional.\n\n599\n00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.140\nIt doesn't happen from\nthe security expert.\n\n600\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.110\nIt happens from the end user standpoint.\n\n601\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Were the end users directly\ninterfacing over the networks?\n\n602\n00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.420\nWell, end user host systems.\n\n603\n00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.590\nSo that's why it's very important that\nwe understand all these components that\n\n604\n00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.990\nwe can use to protect our systems as well.\n\n605\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can understand, Ronnie,\n\n606\n00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.080\nbecause if we're looking at our to\ndo list and we have some serious\n\n607\n00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.660\nserver issues that need to happen\n&gt;&gt; We may neglect some of these\n\n608\n00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.560\nend user systems but looking at the\ninformation we've covered in this show,\n\n609\n00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.800\nwe can see how important really\nis to cover all the basis here.\n\n610\n00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.800\nSo thank you for joining us today to\nexplain that, and thank you for tuning in.\n\n611\n00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.700\nThat does it for this show, so\nwe're gonna go ahead an sign off.\n\n612\n00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.950\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n613\n00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.800\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to your Cisco cybersecurity\nfundamental series I'm your show host,\n\n6\n00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:17.960\nCherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.590\nIn this episode we will be looking\nat ways to interpret different\n\n8\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.710\noperating system log information.\n\n9\n00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.300\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.870\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.070\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non with our Cisco cyber security.\n\n13\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.640\nAnd today we're looking in that domain\nobjective what we call host security.\n\n14\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.260\nSo when we start talking about\nthe IVO security, remember that\n\n15\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.670\nas a beginner in security, a lot of times\nwhat you believe of course is that you're\n\n16\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.490\ndefending against bad guys and that\nyour constant vigilance against the bad\n\n17\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.890\nguys what makes you almost superhero-like\nbecause you have a lot of skills.\n\n18\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.990\nWell, those skills are built up over time.\n\n19\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.720\nAnd the place that you begin is not\nalways the most exciting place to begin\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.520\nwhich is taking a look at the idea of what\nwe call log files on computing systems and\n\n21\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.270\nespecially on the end user system as well.\n\n22\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.820\nWhen it comes down to different attacks\nthat may happen or different events that\n\n23\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.060\nmay happen, we need to be on a correlate\nthat would other things that go on.\n\n24\n00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.575\nBut remember that the end\nuser point all right?\n\n25\n00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:22.120\nWhenever the end user is,\n\n26\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.780\nthat can either be the target of what it\nis the attackers trying to achieve or\n\n27\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.600\nit can be essentially an opening or a door\nway for a picker attacker to come in.\n\n28\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.310\nAnd how do you spot things like that?\n\n29\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.770\nHow do you know what's going\non with your machines?\n\n30\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.650\nWell, the reason that you can\nknow it is because the machines\n\n31\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.120\nreally do try to keep track of\neverything that goes on in the machines.\n\n32\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.540\nSo it's up to us to be able to\ntake the data that we can find and\n\n33\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.740\nmaybe be able to interpret\nit a little bit more.\n\n34\n00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.950\nBut the only way to do that of\ncourse is by examining those logs.\n\n35\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.280\nSo, Cherokee, in your past experience, the\nidea of looking at logs is that something\n\n36\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.270\nthat was an exciting thing for you or\ndid you kind of find it boring like I did?\n\n37\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.190\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of boring, but it is like you\nsaid, it is something you have to do and\n\n38\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.400\nit's almost like just one of those\nthings when you are do list.\n\n39\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.950\nSo you just check through it and\nmake sure you sign off and\n\n40\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.430\nmake sure it gets done because it's\nreally all about those details.\n\n41\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.030\n&gt;&gt; And there is no doubt that that's kind\nof the first things that we really need to\n\n42\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.770\nget ingrained into our lives and into our\nmind here is to check for these logs.\n\n43\n00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.120\nNow, it may not be on a daily basis.\n\n44\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.690\nEven though, the further out that you get,\nthe more managerial skills that you get,\n\n45\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.190\nthe more important that you rely\non the information like that.\n\n46\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.450\nAt a technician level,\nright, it takes a keen eye.\n\n47\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.660\nIt takes time for\n\n48\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.910\nyou to be able to spot some of\nthe things that you really need to spot.\n\n49\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.010\nOnce you do and you become,\nit forms a habit that\n\n50\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.560\nyou actually need to do is that when you\ncome to a system that maybe compromised,\n\n51\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.010\nis to think about this idea\nof looking at those logs\n\n52\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.020\nbecause you'll probably find\nmore valuable information there.\n\n53\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.840\nWhether it's actually after an attack,\nwhether it's during an attack, or\n\n54\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.550\neven before an attack as you look at them,\n\n55\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.630\nall of these will give you a little bit\nmore perspective because the operating\n\n56\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.140\nsystem really is trying to\nkeep track of everything.\n\n57\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.470\nSo when take a look at a mixed\n\n58\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.930\nof willy Windows logs just a bit here\nas well as some other systems do.\n\n59\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, we're really don't wanna\nbe letting these logs accumulate I mean if\n\n60\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.690\nthey get to a large they might even\nstart to affect our storage space and\n\n61\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.360\nthings like that.\n\n62\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.940\nSo it's definitely\nsomething to keep an eye on\n\n63\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.730\nfrom the performance standpoint as well.\n\n64\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.960\n&gt;&gt; And it used to be even more critical,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.600\nIn the early days of computing systems\neven and user desktops, and that was\n\n66\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.510\nbecause we really did kind of give our end\nusers fairly low performance machines.\n\n67\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.470\nBut today, a common desktop environment,\nyou get more RAM and\n\n68\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.280\nyou get larger hard drives.\n\n69\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.300\nAnd even though we might not fill them up,\nlog files they can still fill up and\n\n70\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.020\nthey can still cause some problems.\n\n71\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.350\nBut even more critical than\nthat is if we don't, right.\n\n72\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.880\nIt's hard to actually spot\nwhich you're looking for.\n\n73\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.335\nSo this is where that proverbial needle\nin the haystack really comes in.\n\n74\n00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:03.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're monitoring that\n\n75\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.390\non a daily basis and\nyou get used to seeing it, it's easier for\n\n76\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.710\nyou to spot things that are different\nthan it is for you to spot the idea of,\n\n77\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.960\nI don't know if that's actually different\ndata or not when it comes down to it.\n\n78\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.950\nThere's an analogy, a friend of mine got a\njob as a teller back in the early '90s and\n\n79\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.960\nhe was telling me that one of the things\nthey did help them train on counterfeiting\n\n80\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.020\nis that they make them look at real money\nall time when they're taking a look at.\n\n81\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.768\nSo when they put all they look\nat the actual real money,\n\n82\n00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:43.029\nnot because they are looking\nat counterfeit but\n\n83\n00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:48.514\nthey know something if they get feel,\nthe texture and they get used to the look.\n\n84\n00:04:48.514 --> 00:04:50.055\nThen when a counterfeit does come by,\nit makes it easier to spot.\n\n85\n00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:50.749\n&gt;&gt; Identifying those anomalies.\n\n86\n00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.080\n&gt;&gt; It makes it easier to spot.\n\n87\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.674\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n88\n00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:56.865\n&gt;&gt; And so that's the same thing that\nhappens here as far as log files go is\n\n89\n00:04:56.865 --> 00:05:01.127\nthat we do need to take some time and\nsome effort in examining the logs,\n\n90\n00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:04.477\nknowing how regular system works and\nmay seem boring.\n\n91\n00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:10.170\nBut at that same time, the anomaly pops\nup a lot easier as you start doing it.\n\n92\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.030\nThat's what we're going\nto be examining here.\n\n93\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.570\nAt least a little bit in brief,\n\n94\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.010\nespecially on the ones focusing on\nsecurity more than anything else.\n\n95\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.260\nWhen it comes down to different types of\nsecurity logs that we're going to find in\n\n96\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.690\nhost systems, it's really about the access\nmore than anything else, right.\n\n97\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.710\nWho is giving access in that host machine\nand who's being able to log in, log out?\n\n98\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.050\nAre they successful,\nare they failing at us?\n\n99\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.180\nAnd that's what you're\ntending to take a look at.\n\n100\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.090\nSo let's go and start from the perspective\nof Windows has been the major\n\n101\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.840\none that we need to look at first because\nthat's probably what most people are on.\n\n102\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.320\nEven if you're a Linux or a Unix guy and\nyou go, I don't like Windows logs.\n\n103\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.990\nA portion of the exam is based\non looking at Windows logs.\n\n104\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.230\nWe want to make sure that\nwe point those out too.\n\n105\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.550\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine here.\n\n106\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.100\nI went ahead and I pulled up.\n\n107\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.790\nThe Event Viewer, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.590\nThe Event Viewer is about the easiest\nplace that we'll find inside\n\n109\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.890\nof a Windows machine.\n\n110\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.090\nTo take a look at all logs\nthat are available to us\n\n111\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.640\nthat Windows itself generates, right?\n\n112\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.040\nSo, over on the left hand side you can see\nback and zoom a little bit to help us out.\n\n113\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.550\nI have the context of the machine that\nI'm looking at which is the local\n\n114\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.850\nmachine itself and that's always key\nmake sure you keep the context in mind.\n\n115\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.750\nBut underneath that notice it's\nall about the operating system and\n\n116\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.990\nwhat it keeps track of as well.\n\n117\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.690\nThere's application logs.\n\n118\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.830\nThere's security logs.\n\n119\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.830\nThere's setup information System logs, of\ncourse, are very important for us too, and\n\n120\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.600\neven forwarded events.\n\n121\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.240\nWe can have somebody else's logs generate,\n\n122\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.840\nand forward a copy of that over\nto my machine, if we want to.\n\n123\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.110\nBut when it comes down to access logs,\nthis is where we normally start and\n\n124\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.770\nwe begin here is by taking a look at the\nsecurity of the information that we have.\n\n125\n00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.600\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, sometimes I hear the term,\naudit log.\n\n126\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.430\nLooking at this, and\n\n127\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.550\nhere you can even see where it says audit\nsuccess, audit logs and security logs,\n\n128\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.520\nsecurity is just the branding or the\nnaming that Microsoft has chosen, correct.\n\n129\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.260\nThose are interchangeable terms there?\n\n130\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's exactly right.\n\n131\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.670\nThe very fact is here inside of Windows,\n\n132\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.550\nwe're really taking a look at the idea\nof auditing, which is accounting for\n\n133\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.040\nthe fact that somebody has\nactually audited success,\n\n134\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.520\nwhich means we marked it and we know that\nsomebody has successfully logged on.\n\n135\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.390\nAnd you can see the categories over here\non the right-hand side, Special Logon, and\n\n136\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.600\nLogon, and then Event IDs.\n\n137\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.700\nAnd it even tells you the Source of logs,\nas well as the Date and Time.\n\n138\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.890\nNow, I have not generated a failure here,\nbut we can do that fairly easily.\n\n139\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.820\nSo now we'll take a look\nat that aspect of it too.\n\n140\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.590\nSo we can pull this back up.\n\n141\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.590\nI'm just going to simply\nlog out of this machine.\n\n142\n00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.249\nIf I can sign out, I should say sign out.\n\n143\n00:07:56.249 --> 00:08:02.399\nThe newer hip term inside of this\nenvironment, of course, is signing out.\n\n144\n00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.011\nThen I am going to create a failure here.\n\n145\n00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo, my log on is me and\njust use my super secret password.\n\n146\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.671\nHopefully, there it is, I should\nnow have generated a particular log\n\n147\n00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:19.784\nthat tells me that my brute force\nattack has not work successfully.\n\n148\n00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:23.394\nAnd so now,\nif I log back in correctly here, and\n\n149\n00:08:23.394 --> 00:08:28.656\nthat's always a big kind of a major idea,\nespecially for me typing.\n\n150\n00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:29.793\n&gt;&gt; The successful login.\n\n151\n00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:31.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the successful login.\n\n152\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:38.090\nI probably have more audit failures than\nI have successes, in terms of my typing.\n\n153\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.980\nWe'll take a look at this too.\n\n154\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.430\nLet me scroll back out and\ngo into security here, oops, security.\n\n155\n00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.130\nAnd now will see a contrast\nin a difference right here.\n\n156\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.765\nSo, I can see that there's\nan Audit Failure as well as\n\n157\n00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:53.830\nan Audit Success, right?\n\n158\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.290\nYou need to learn the terms especially\non these audits here to give us.\n\n159\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.420\nNow, as we take a look at\nthe one that immediately,\n\n160\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.280\nhope we followed that one first,\nso as a success here, and\n\n161\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.410\nwe'll make sure that we see,\nwe can see something that this is not\n\n162\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.230\nme actually logging in, notice it's\nactually the system logging in here.\n\n163\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.030\nAnd I can scroll down and there we go,\nnow look at that, there it is.\n\n164\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.050\nI did actually log in successfully.\n\n165\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.670\nSo, from this log we can tell a lot of\ntimes who actually logged in successfully.\n\n166\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.630\nWhich is good.\n\n167\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.080\nAnd you have some other\ninformation right here\n\n168\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.830\nof course that you can use\nif you need to help you out,\n\n169\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.050\nespecially on those logs that you're\nnot really sure of what they mean.\n\n170\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.410\nAnd you can get a lot of\ninformation generated,\n\n171\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.800\nsometimes too much information generated.\n\n172\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.820\nSo, we don't want that to happen either.\n\n173\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.035\nSo, make sure you take\na look of these event IDs.\n\n174\n00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:49.390\nAnd there are plenty of places on the\nInternet to kind of help you out there.\n\n175\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.950\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if I were examining\nsome of these logs, and\n\n176\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.620\nI saw that there were numerous failed\nlogin attempts at some odd hour,\n\n177\n00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.620\nlike 3 AM or something, for an employee\nwhich I know doesn't work those\n\n178\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.860\nlate shifts like that, is there something\nI could do, maybe within Active Directory,\n\n179\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.540\nto go ahead and\ncreate those block-out hours?\n\n180\n00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can actually set up your\nown particular type of scheduling\n\n181\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.500\nwhere you do block out those hours\nwhere they can log in as well.\n\n182\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.236\nSo, let's also take a look at\nthe audit failure at the same time.\n\n183\n00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:23.014\nThere you go, you get a clear indication\nright here that tells you that the account\n\n184\n00:10:23.014 --> 00:10:23.852\nfailed to log in.\n\n185\n00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:24.579\n&gt;&gt; Denied.\n\n186\n00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:27.583\n&gt;&gt; And now you actually\nalso get that denied here.\n\n187\n00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:31.630\nAnd now notice it didn't issue\nme a security ID, so null.\n\n188\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.780\nAnd that even says who tried\nto do it using a username and\n\n189\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.120\nwhat Cherokee is also pointing out is of\ncourse, this is why it's important to pay\n\n190\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.117\nattention to information like this,\nespecially in the idea of time.\n\n191\n00:10:44.117 --> 00:10:50.180\nYou may not think that timing matters,\nbut the time that an event does matter.\n\n192\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.630\nAnd so, this also means that inside\nof your network, right, you need time\n\n193\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.930\nsynchronization to also occur, or you're\ngonna get some weird errors beside that.\n\n194\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.330\nBut overall, though, just kinda\nrealize that as far as Windows goes,\n\n195\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.140\nthese particular types of logs\nare really kind of key for us to verify.\n\n196\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.290\nWe take a note of the time,\nwe take a note of different things.\n\n197\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.070\nAnd then from that point,\nwe can set up different security policies\n\n198\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.420\nto help us to actually restrict\ntheir particular time and\n\n199\n00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.240\nlogin if we need to or\neven down to that user if we need as well.\n\n200\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.153\n&gt;&gt; And this is really important because\nnot only just keeping that good documented\n\n201\n00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:27.985\nand to keeping in good track,\n\n202\n00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:31.375\nit might kind of be like\nprecursor leading to an event.\n\n203\n00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:34.816\nOr, it might not seem relevant\nat that point and time but\n\n204\n00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:38.476\nIf I need to go ahead and\nperform an investigation later on,\n\n205\n00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:41.791\nit might actually fill in\nkind of a pieces to a puzzle.\n\n206\n00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:44.715\n&gt;&gt; And that's why it's\nimportant to keep these logs,\n\n207\n00:11:44.715 --> 00:11:46.384\nas many of them as you can too.\n\n208\n00:11:46.384 --> 00:11:49.443\nSo, whether you're backing them up make\nsure you get a good machine back up of\n\n209\n00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:50.776\neverything that you're doing.\n\n210\n00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:54.524\nBut, it's very important if this is\nleading up to a particular crime that yo\n\n211\n00:11:54.524 --> 00:11:56.540\nhave everything ready to go.\n\n212\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.190\nSo, we're really only focusing in on\nthose auto logs as far as any details go.\n\n213\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.410\nBut remember, anything that\nhappens on your Windows machine\n\n214\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.170\nusually generates a log of some sort.\n\n215\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.080\nSo, this is true whether it's the\noperating system itself generating logs.\n\n216\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.020\nAnd normally there's\ndifferent levels of them.\n\n217\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.610\nThere's warnings.\n\n218\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.590\nThere's information.\n\n219\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.360\nThere are errors of\ncourse that you may have\n\n220\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.580\nalong with the same information on\nthe date, and time and the source.\n\n221\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.430\nAnd even some of the categories that\nare also available out there too.\n\n222\n00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.840\nThe idea of course of applications that\nrun can also generate errors and logs.\n\n223\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.250\nThese are things you should examine too\n\n224\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.780\nespecially if you believe\nthat something is happening.\n\n225\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.780\nSo, here that might be something\nthat raises concern for me.\n\n226\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.850\nI notice that even though it's under\napplication, the source says hey,\n\n227\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.590\nthis is from a security SPP,\nwhich I can't say, and\n\n228\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.850\nnow it says hey, license activation and\nit gave the following error code.\n\n229\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.870\nSo my trial time period is saying ooh,\n\n230\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.170\nI'm gonna actually say I don't want\nthis to be any more activated.\n\n231\n00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.470\nSo, you will get some information\nlike that and it comes across.\n\n232\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.920\nBut always stuff for\nyou to be able to spot.\n\n233\n00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.470\nAnd this should be a good\nprimary source of information.\n\n234\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.590\nEspecially after an event has happen, but\n\n235\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.660\nalso when you do bring a new machine,\nto start taking a look at these,\n\n236\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.380\nso that you know the regular pattern\nof events that happen as well.\n\n237\n00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.130\nSo, just take a little bit of time.\n\n238\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.200\nMake sure you understand these logs here\nand that you know that you can see them\n\n239\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.460\nfairly easily by simply double\nclicking on the information.\n\n240\n00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.748\nBut if they ask you how can you\nverify that Ronnie has logged in,\n\n241\n00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:39.050\nmake sure you understand you would go to\nsecurity and you'd find one of those logs.\n\n242\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.140\nAnd then find out whether or\n\n243\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.920\nnot you can actually see the account and\nthe actual login happening itself.\n\n244\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.680\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat will help us out too.\n\n245\n00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.730\nSo, we're really only focusing in on\nthat secure login side of Windows.\n\n246\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.730\nIt doesn't mean that\nthere's not a lot more.\n\n247\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.050\nLater on we're gonna also\nget an ISS access logs too.\n\n248\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.000\nBut at this point, that's what\nwe wanna do on the host security\n\n249\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.350\nside just to be able to verify just\nat least that much information.\n\n250\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.340\nBut take a little bit more time and\ndiscover that on your own.\n\n251\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.400\nAll right, so that's a Windows operating\nsystem, what about different platforms?\n\n252\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.920\nDo they have something that would be\ncomparable to this type of logging system?\n\n253\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.690\n&gt;&gt; They really do.\n\n254\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.920\nJust about every system does but\nthey called differently, right?\n\n255\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.660\nSo when it comes down to Linux and\n\n256\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.430\nUNIX, they are different\nsystems that are out there.\n\n257\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.860\nBut on the host side, in other words\nat the end user side of things,\n\n258\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.490\nyou wanna make sure that you\nunderstand how to get access to them.\n\n259\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.050\nThere are GUI interfaces for them or\n\n260\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.610\nGraphical User Interfaces that you can\nkind of see just like the Event Viewer.\n\n261\n00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.420\nAnd you may have to download those and\nuse them.\n\n262\n00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.150\nBut of course, in Cisco,\nit's never as easy as just doing that.\n\n263\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.040\nWindows definitely, but overall though,\nif you're actually working on Unix or\n\n264\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.640\non a Unix LAN You need to know\na couple of different locations,\n\n265\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.090\nespecially where those\nlogs are going to be.\n\n266\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.630\nSo let's go on and\ntake a look at the idea of very much so\n\n267\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.630\nwhat I would call the UNIX\nbased types of labs here.\n\n268\n00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.510\nAnd I'm simply gonna use my [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Mac desktop?\n\n269\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my Mac desktop to help us out.\n\n270\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.610\nIt is a UNIX based type\nof operating system.\n\n271\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.150\nWe're going to bring up\nthe command prompt, or\n\n272\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.570\nthe terminal or I should say,\ntechnically the terminal here.\n\n273\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n274\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.530\n&gt;&gt; So, we need to know where logs off.\n\n275\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.160\nOkay.\n\n276\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.782\nSo inside of Linux and\n\n277\n00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:27.930\nUnix they're normally locate\nin just the same spots here.\n\n278\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.656\nAnd last going to be inside\nof the var directory.\n\n279\n00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:33.298\nAnd then, log,\n\n280\n00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:37.900\nso easy enough to actually understand\nto know until you don't know it, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.960\nSo once I have that, I can go ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.770\nmake sure then that I am\ninside of the log directory.\n\n283\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.640\nDo an ls to list all the contents.\n\n284\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.228\nAnd here you can see that on my machine,\n\n285\n00:15:49.228 --> 00:15:53.081\nthere's a lot of different\nlogs that are available here.\n\n286\n00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:57.708\nAnd what we're specifically looking for\nis this idea of the system log, too.\n\n287\n00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.896\nYou may find out, for example,\n\n288\n00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:04.772\ninside of Linux They don't call it\nsystem log they call it like Syslog.\n\n289\n00:16:04.772 --> 00:16:08.599\nSo let me see if I can scroll\nover to my Linux box over here.\n\n290\n00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:17.586\nAnd I should just put them all in this\n\n291\n00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:22.593\nkind of order here that I need them in.\n\n292\n00:16:22.593 --> 00:16:24.807\n&gt;&gt; It's all right,\nwe took our motion sickness pills, right?\n\n293\n00:16:24.807 --> 00:16:27.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, we hope.\n\n294\n00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:29.810\nSo remember the same location.\n\n295\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.883\nSo cd, and this one is gonna be log.\n\n296\n00:16:34.883 --> 00:16:38.530\nActually, backwards c, I did it backward.\n\n297\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.082\nI wonder if that would be wrong on\nthe exam, if I did it backward?\n\n298\n00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:44.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably, and so now went ahead and\n\n299\n00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:46.257\ndid a list command for us.\n\n300\n00:16:46.257 --> 00:16:49.350\nAnd now you can see that there's\na couple of different ones.\n\n301\n00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.465\nBut when it comes down to system logs,\nnotice that here inside of this\n\n302\n00:16:53.465 --> 00:16:57.690\n[INAUDIBLE] instance, that we actually\nhave syslog is what we have instead.\n\n303\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.008\nIt really is kind of the same type of\ninformation that we're looking for.\n\n304\n00:17:02.008 --> 00:17:06.610\nBut this is what gives us some information\nabout the operating system as we continue\n\n305\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.010\nto work with it a little bit more.\n\n306\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.266\nSo let's examine some of\nthis to help us out too.\n\n307\n00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:15.580\nI'm going to go back to this one,\n\n308\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.473\ncuz this is kind of what we're\ngonna do here in a moment.\n\n309\n00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:24.000\nIf I wanna take a look at the contents\nof that log file, it's easy.\n\n310\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.114\nI'm gonna use a command called less and\nthis works in Linux realm.\n\n311\n00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:34.600\nLess and\nthen system.log is just what I hope, yep.\n\n312\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.470\nAnd now this scrolls by, all of a sudden\nmy eyes starts crossing, right?\n\n313\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.947\nBecause there's just so\n\n314\n00:17:41.947 --> 00:17:45.686\nmuch information on the screen of\nwhat we are taking to look at.\n\n315\n00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:50.017\nWhen it comes down to the idea of\nsyslog messages or system log messages,\n\n316\n00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:54.423\nthere really is a breakdown of four\ndifferent parts that you should know.\n\n317\n00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:56.924\nWe're gonna examine it more in detail\nin a moment, but let me go ahead and\n\n318\n00:17:56.924 --> 00:17:58.430\nlist those parts for us.\n\n319\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.631\nThere is the program\nname that may be running,\n\n320\n00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:02.442\nsomething that we call the facility.\n\n321\n00:18:02.442 --> 00:18:04.531\nIn other words, what actually does this.\n\n322\n00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:08.720\nThere's a priority number and then\nthere's the message of the log itself.\n\n323\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.480\nSo we can take any of these things and\n\n324\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.650\nreally kind of help us out to see,\nespecially if we're focusing in.\n\n325\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.110\nBut we need to know those parts, and\n\n326\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.600\nwe need to be able to identify\nthem a little bit better.\n\n327\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.695\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n328\n00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:25.526\nI'm gonna scroll back over here and\nthen get into this.\n\n329\n00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:28.148\nAnd I tried to break this down so\nthat we could see it a little bit more.\n\n330\n00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:28.796\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So this-\n\n331\n00:18:28.796 --> 00:18:29.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:18:29.296 --> 00:18:31.383\n&gt;&gt; Particular past weekend, right?\n\n333\n00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:32.476\nSpend some time and\n\n334\n00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:34.670\ntry see how I can best display this.\n\n335\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.151\nSo if you wanna like that's the different\nIP address to what you have on your\n\n336\n00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:38.660\nmachine.\n\n337\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.950\nI'm using the same machine, but I did at\nhome, where this one is actually not.\n\n338\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.167\nYou can even see the data on this one so\n\n339\n00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:44.986\nis a little bit-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n340\n00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:45.838\n&gt;&gt; Dated here.\n\n341\n00:18:45.838 --> 00:18:48.953\nSo here is a break down\nof single log entry.\n\n342\n00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:52.505\nAnd I'm not gonna tell you you\nhave to memorize this, but\n\n343\n00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:54.804\nyou do need to know portions of this.\n\n344\n00:18:54.804 --> 00:18:55.387\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n345\n00:18:55.387 --> 00:18:59.690\nI wish I could tell you differently,\nbut that's just how it's gonna be.\n\n346\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.280\nSo the first particular portion,\n\n347\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.935\nwhen somebody is connecting to your\nmachine is made who made the request?\n\n348\n00:19:05.935 --> 00:19:07.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It make sense.\n\n349\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.576\nSo in other words, did your machine\nactually reach out and contact or\n\n350\n00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:11.787\ndid somebody else do so?\n\n351\n00:19:11.787 --> 00:19:16.716\nSo you'll see that information\nnormally logging in as the IP address,\n\n352\n00:19:16.716 --> 00:19:20.920\nwhich I wasn't gonna be able to\nsave the way that I wanted to.\n\n353\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.690\nEvery once in a while, you'll also see\ninstead of these two dashes instead,\n\n354\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.690\nyou might see the name of a user.\n\n355\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:33.710\nSo it's very possible you might see that\nand you might see a user ID number here.\n\n356\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.301\nBut this are not necessarily\ngenerated on any single machine.\n\n357\n00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:40.358\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that they are not generate and\n\n358\n00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:44.421\nthey do not have a default, you get dashes\ninstead, that's what it cmes down to.\n\n359\n00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:47.268\nSo mine, they're just one available.\n\n360\n00:19:47.268 --> 00:19:50.885\nYou can of course then have a very\nimportant element that even Cherokee\n\n361\n00:19:50.885 --> 00:19:54.760\nwas talking about inside the Windows,\neven right here, okay?\n\n362\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.343\nSo notice this one even\nthough it reports it in UDT,\n\n363\n00:19:57.343 --> 00:19:59.754\nno actually this one\nreported local time here.\n\n364\n00:19:59.754 --> 00:20:03.508\nMinus five UTC on February 2nd at\n\n365\n00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:09.240\n5:15:57:31 a fraction of a second.\n\n366\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.662\nGo figure, they really broke that\none down, and what request was made?\n\n367\n00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:21.416\nSo this shows you that I was\ntrying to contact a website at,\n\n368\n00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:24.713\non at, excuse me on http1.1.\n\n369\n00:20:24.713 --> 00:20:26.681\nSo notice the get command here?\n\n370\n00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:28.650\nSaying here's the request that was made.\n\n371\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.200\nThen you have these numbers and\nbelieve it or\n\n372\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.510\nnot, these are gonna be the important\nnumbers that you want to pay attention to.\n\n373\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.597\nReally when it comes down to it,\nit is this number right here.\n\n374\n00:20:39.597 --> 00:20:41.605\n&gt;&gt; The status number.\n&gt;&gt; That is very important, yep.\n\n375\n00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:42.149\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n376\n00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:47.290\n&gt;&gt; This status number,\nwhen you take a look at it, 200 means?\n\n377\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.550\nGood, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:53.584\nSo everything connected, status is okay,\nyou made a good solid connection.\n\n379\n00:20:53.584 --> 00:20:55.232\nHave you ever seen that 404 error?\n\n380\n00:20:55.232 --> 00:20:56.520\n&gt;&gt; I have unfortunately.\n\n381\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, anything that begins with a 4,\n\n382\n00:20:58.441 --> 00:21:01.131\njust kinda tells you something\nhappened on your side.\n\n383\n00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:02.748\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is what is comes down to.\n\n384\n00:21:02.748 --> 00:21:04.442\nAnything that begins with a 5,\n\n385\n00:21:04.442 --> 00:21:08.390\nmeans something happened on\nthe other end on the server side.\n\n386\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:14.325\nSo even though it's small and it's tiny,\nyou may see an entry like this.\n\n387\n00:21:14.325 --> 00:21:17.117\nMaybe even on the cyber security example,\n\n388\n00:21:17.117 --> 00:21:20.458\nit says that this machine\nconnects successfully.\n\n389\n00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:23.884\nwell you're not looking at all\nthe rest of this information, right?\n\n390\n00:21:23.884 --> 00:21:28.944\nYou're really look at one number here,\nand that is key, if you\n\n391\n00:21:28.944 --> 00:21:32.528\ndon't know those it may kind of get you-\n&gt;&gt; Hurt you.\n\n392\n00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:33.343\n&gt;&gt; On the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n393\n00:21:33.343 --> 00:21:37.323\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time, it means that\nyou're looking in a log even in real life\n\n394\n00:21:37.323 --> 00:21:39.737\neveryday and\nyou don't know what they mean.\n\n395\n00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:41.465\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty bad, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:44.409\nSo just kind of make sure you understand.\n\n397\n00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:48.000\nSo this is the status that tells\nyou everything connected fine.\n\n398\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.036\nHere's the size of what was sent, and\nthere's also a possible refer, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:53.036 --> 00:21:56.969\nNow the idea of this refere, referer,\nwhich I'm not gonnabe able to say.\n\n400\n00:21:56.969 --> 00:21:59.705\nI kept missing some syllables there,\n\n401\n00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:04.970\nthis is normally what was typed\nin to get access to that website.\n\n402\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.408\nSo here it's saying, no, the website\nthat you were trying to correct to,\n\n403\n00:22:08.408 --> 00:22:10.330\nRonnie was on your own machine.\n\n404\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.260\nSo this, yeah,\nI'm not gonna report that to you.\n\n405\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.389\n&gt;&gt; Like the URL?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n406\n00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:14.900\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n407\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's not gonna do that for you.\n\n408\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.440\nAnd of course the user agent, so\n\n409\n00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.480\nthis is what was in header,\nas far as who would do this.\n\n410\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.720\nNow you'll notice a couple\nof different things.\n\n411\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:32.229\nIt says the header information\nincluded Mozilla 5 on Mac 10.11.6.\n\n412\n00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:36.309\nAppleWebKit here, KHTML like Gecko.\n\n413\n00:22:36.309 --> 00:22:37.393\n&gt;&gt; Great system info.\n\n414\n00:22:37.393 --> 00:22:41.984\n&gt;&gt; Chrome, yey, Safari, it just says,\nlook, all this information right here,\n\n415\n00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:46.620\nUser-Agent in the request for header,\nit says all those are very possible.\n\n416\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:51.249\nAs far as details go, this is some of\nthe stuff that you will see, okay?\n\n417\n00:22:51.249 --> 00:22:54.477\nNow, if you're not sure about\nthose protocol numbers,\n\n418\n00:22:54.477 --> 00:22:57.651\nI also have this link that I\nincluded here on this slide.\n\n419\n00:22:57.651 --> 00:23:00.605\nOr on this simple diagram,\nI shouldn't say slide,\n\n420\n00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:03.301\nthis diagram that I made to help us out,\nright?\n\n421\n00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:07.189\nYou'll see that there's a long list of\nthem that you can definitely go to and\n\n422\n00:23:07.189 --> 00:23:09.450\nsee a lot more information on it.\n\n423\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.132\nBut at our level we're at least trying\nto make sure that we can spot them here.\n\n424\n00:23:13.132 --> 00:23:14.692\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so\n\n425\n00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:16.150\nthat's a successful one.\n\n426\n00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:21.000\nNow let's see if we can spot\nan unsuccessful one as the key.\n\n427\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.322\nNow as it's almost identical Cherokee,\nokay?\n\n428\n00:23:25.322 --> 00:23:28.027\nSo if I was looking for\nwhether or not it was success,\n\n429\n00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:29.700\nwhat number would I focus in on?\n\n430\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.451\n&gt;&gt; That 404, and\nit looks like it's a problem on my end.\n\n431\n00:23:32.451 --> 00:23:33.571\n&gt;&gt; It's a problem on your end.\n\n432\n00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:34.611\n&gt;&gt; Story of my life.\n\n433\n00:23:34.611 --> 00:23:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what we have here.\n\n434\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.458\nSo on this one, yeah,\nit definitely did not connect in, but\n\n435\n00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:43.818\nnotice this time, the referer did show up.\n\n436\n00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:44.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n437\n00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.901\n&gt;&gt; So this time I just typed in the IP\naddress that was on the same network but\n\n438\n00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:48.928\nit was just random.\n\n439\n00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:54.103\nAnd says, you're trying to make\na request but the request is to where?\n\n440\n00:23:54.103 --> 00:23:56.850\nIt's the one doesn't even exist, Ronnie.\n\n441\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.949\nSo I'm gonna say, yeah, it's not there.\n\n442\n00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:00.893\n&gt;&gt; Go check your IP address.\n\n443\n00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:01.701\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n444\n00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:02.321\n&gt;&gt; Go and check and\n\n445\n00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:03.668\ndo some other information here.\n\n446\n00:24:03.668 --> 00:24:06.377\nBut notice that pretty much is identical.\n\n447\n00:24:06.377 --> 00:24:09.440\nAnd they put them one on top of the other,\nright?\n\n448\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.410\nA listing of two.\n\n449\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Sure, A, B, C.\n\n450\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.870\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you understand that.\n\n451\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.909\nYeah, so just kind of be\naware as you get ready, but\n\n452\n00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:18.393\nis it important that\nyou take a look a lot?\n\n453\n00:24:18.393 --> 00:24:19.880\nYes, okay?\n\n454\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.782\nSpanning these really are helpful,\n\n455\n00:24:21.782 --> 00:24:24.918\nespecially if you are making\nmultiple connection at a time.\n\n456\n00:24:24.918 --> 00:24:28.027\nTrying to get access in\nthe what we actually need here,\n\n457\n00:24:28.027 --> 00:24:31.079\nis going to be key when you\nstart to take a look that up.\n\n458\n00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:35.689\nSo take a look also and that link of\nthat information when go back in and\n\n459\n00:24:35.689 --> 00:24:36.569\nwatch this.\n\n460\n00:24:36.569 --> 00:24:39.827\nMake sure you spend a little\nbit of time looking at those.\n\n461\n00:24:39.827 --> 00:24:43.208\nBut I already told you kind of\nbasic breakdown, the 200, 400,\n\n462\n00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:47.680\n500, those are by far the most common,\nthere may be some other ones out there.\n\n463\n00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.770\nBut at this point here,\n\n464\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.853\nmake sure you at least know those minimum-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n465\n00:24:51.853 --> 00:24:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Ones that you want to pay attention\nto when you get there, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.004\nNow we've really got a lot more to go, and\n\n467\n00:24:58.004 --> 00:25:00.536\nthere's some other things\nthat I do need to point out.\n\n468\n00:25:00.536 --> 00:25:05.149\nBut I think I'm running low on time, and\nit's not fair to try and cram it all in.\n\n469\n00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:08.134\nSo we may just go ahead andsave that for\npart two.\n\n470\n00:25:08.134 --> 00:25:08.837\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we won't do that.\n\n471\n00:25:08.837 --> 00:25:10.051\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No craming here,\n\n472\n00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:12.123\nwe made just go ahead and\nsave it for later.\n\n473\n00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:16.361\nSo in this episode, Ronnie, thank you for\nshowing us how to go ahead and\n\n474\n00:25:16.361 --> 00:25:19.768\naccess our Windows and\nUnix logs and then decipher them.\n\n475\n00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:23.500\nSo thank you for that, and\nthank you very much for joining us today.\n\n476\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.534\nBut stay tuned, like Ronnie said, we do\nhave more information headed your way.\n\n477\n00:25:27.534 --> 00:25:30.791\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign of as\nyour show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n478\n00:25:30.791 --> 00:25:31.615\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.453\nThis is actually a part two\nwhere in the previous episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:24.941\nwe were looking at how to interpret\noperating system log data.\n\n10\n00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.854\nWe were able to look at\na Windows enviroment,\n\n11\n00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:31.770\na UNIX environment and\nalso Apache log server.\n\n12\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.190\nIn this show, we're gonna go ahead and\nexplore that concept a little bit further.\n\n13\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.820\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in Studios.\n\n14\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.120\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.042\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n16\n00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:44.199\nhaving me back as we continue on to\ntake a look at more cyber security.\n\n17\n00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.875\nEspecially the idea of the logs that we\nhave to take a look at as well as part of\n\n18\n00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.200\nwell understanding more in cyber security.\n\n19\n00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.060\nI did make a big gigantic kind of unusual\nmistake where I jumped over a few things\n\n20\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.470\nand went right into Apache log services,\nlogging.\n\n21\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.109\nSo that we did spend a bit of time in\nthere, but I wanna show you why I did.\n\n22\n00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.970\nCuz I was trying to think,\nwhy did I jump into that?\n\n23\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.780\nIt's because of the log that we accessed,\nbut it's good material,\n\n24\n00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.290\nmake sure you go back and catch that.\n\n25\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.240\nAnd we're kinda come back out and pick up\nwhere I had originally had intended to go.\n\n26\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.750\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810\nSo let's go directly to my machine here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.010\nAnd one of the things that I told\nyou that we really need to make sure\n\n29\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.810\nthat we understand is that,\nespecially inside of Linux and\n\n30\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.487\nUnix, we need to know where-\n&gt;&gt; The location.\n\n31\n00:01:29.487 --> 00:01:31.599\n&gt;&gt; The location is going to be.\n\n32\n00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.307\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n33\n00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:35.260\n&gt;&gt; Which is gonna be that\nvar/log that you have.\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.600\nAnd then if you go in here,\n\n35\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.430\nnormally when that seeing all of these\ndifferent logs that are available.\n\n36\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.538\nAnd I was pointing out the idea\nof system log which is fine.\n\n37\n00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:49.565\nIt's something that we definitely\nneed to be able to get into and\n\n38\n00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.630\nnotice there is Apache2 log in here.\n\n39\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.130\nAnd I was gonna show you how,\nbut I apparently just said, no,\n\n40\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.610\nI don't need show anybody that.\n\n41\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.208\nBut let me go ahead and\nswitch into the apache2,\n\n42\n00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:07.315\nOops, Well maybe it isn't in the log.\n\n43\n00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:12.949\nCd, Apache, sorry.\n\n44\n00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.110\nI can't, I forget, there we go.\n\n45\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.689\nA little bit better, and\nthat'll have to be from the root.\n\n46\n00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.305\nAnd there was nothing actually in here,\nbut over on the server that I am\n\n47\n00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:26.385\nrunning the Apache server on though,\nit is residing in here.\n\n48\n00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.677\nAnd that was the information that we\nreally broke down that we take a look at.\n\n49\n00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:33.557\nNotice, there's the apache2.\n\n50\n00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:34.767\nAnd for one reason or another,\n\n51\n00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:38.962\nI just kind of naturally went into\nit without actually doing it here.\n\n52\n00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:44.696\n[LAUGH] So apache, which I can't spell,\nthat's probably another reason,\n\n53\n00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:48.109\napache2, we need to get some permissions.\n\n54\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.426\nAnd then I can do into cd apache2 and\nif I do ls,\n\n55\n00:02:57.426 --> 00:03:01.855\nthis is where I told you we'll do ls.\n\n56\n00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.664\nAnd I didn't say something about access\nlog, but I was thinking access log, and\n\n57\n00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.310\nthat's probably what got me\nstarted at the beginning.\n\n58\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.430\nSo we were able to kind of get in here and\n\n59\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.930\nsee that, but\nI hadn't connected anything at that point.\n\n60\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.219\nBut for some reason my mind said,\nyeah, I've already connected, so\n\n61\n00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.135\nI wasn't gonna worry about it too much.\n\n62\n00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:23.410\nBut since we are actually\nhere we wanna continue on.\n\n63\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.740\nSo you did get a chance to\nlook at the apache logs.\n\n64\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.300\nMake sure you understand especially those\nparticularly numbers when you're accessing\n\n65\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.107\nan Apache log server or\nany other web server out there.\n\n66\n00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:38.447\nThe number is 200, 400, 500,\ngo back and take a look at those,\n\n67\n00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.690\nvery key to what we want.\n\n68\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.820\nThe other portion,\nof course is the idea here of Syslog.\n\n69\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.871\nWhich I did get started and\nwanna talk about Syslogs and I was like,\n\n70\n00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.447\nlet's abandon that and\njust do what I wanna do on my own.\n\n71\n00:03:49.447 --> 00:03:52.480\nAnd that was something I\nshouldn't have done, right?\n\n72\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.750\nCuz there's a lot of information inside\n\n73\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.120\nof those logs that we\ndefinitely need to take a look.\n\n74\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.735\nLess, and this was system.log.\n\n75\n00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:11.573\nI have to get into the, Cd\n\n76\n00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:16.672\ndo this, wrong.\n\n77\n00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.662\nI'm gonna mess up completely here.\n\n78\n00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:24.780\nThen I can go into system.log,\nless system.log.\n\n79\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.879\nI just can't type it.\n\n80\n00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.222\nSo I've showed you this-\n&gt;&gt; Lot of information.\n\n81\n00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're really gonna break\nthis down a little more and\n\n82\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.400\nthat's when I went to the slides.\n\n83\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.007\nOkay, this seems different, but\nlet's go with it and do this.\n\n84\n00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:38.290\nHere in this one right?\n\n85\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.600\nThe layout is a little bit different, but\n\n86\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.450\nit does include the four piece of\ninformation that we're talking about.\n\n87\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.700\nProgram that's normally running,\nthe facility, the priority, and\n\n88\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.860\nthen the message itself that\nwe wanna take a look at.\n\n89\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.620\nSo this is something we definitely want\nto break down just a little bit more and\n\n90\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.000\ntake a look at it.\n\n91\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.796\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, when you say the message,\n\n92\n00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:01.629\nwould this be comparable to like per se\nan event id in a Windows operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.800\nSo I could take that information and\nresearch it online or\n\n94\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.620\nI'm just thinking\nsomething different here.\n\n95\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.136\n&gt;&gt; This may be something\na little bit different.\n\n96\n00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:12.470\nIt normally has some type of action or at\nleast pointing you to what's gone wrong.\n\n97\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.445\nWhereas the event ID might point\nyou around to what's gone wrong.\n\n98\n00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a little bit more unusual.\n\n99\n00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.127\nSo for example right here at the bottom.\n\n100\n00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:23.570\nHere's a message that says, hey this\nis about that ThunderboltSwitch here.\n\n101\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.520\nAnd that there's a listening\ncallback system that\n\n102\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.130\ngot written to at some point, right?\n\n103\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.560\nBut we wanna concentrate right here\non a couple of things first and\n\n104\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.700\nforemost, right?\n\n105\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.270\nSo the facility here and then also\nthe severity number or priority number.\n\n106\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.000\nThat is kinda the key that\nwe want to understand.\n\n107\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.510\nNow most of the time we're\nnot normally looking at it\n\n108\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.870\nfrom the standpoint of a host machine.\n\n109\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.589\nBut it's really right here on the router\nthat we tend to see it more often.\n\n110\n00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:59.120\nSo if I go into configuration,\nthe global configuration like this, right?\n\n111\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.708\nLog messages are being\ngenerated in the background.\n\n112\n00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:03.500\nWe're normally not seeing\nevery single one of them.\n\n113\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.000\nBut when there are changes that happen,\nfor example,\n\n114\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.570\nwhen I exit and\nI hit it a couple of times.\n\n115\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.566\nNotice right here, Cherokee, it went\nahead and it was able to show me a date.\n\n116\n00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:17.882\nNow this date, time is wrong cuz I've\nhad these routers turned off for\n\n117\n00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:18.598\na little bit of time.\n\n118\n00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:23.580\nIt says at 7 PM right here,\nand so that's not good.\n\n119\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.060\nBut notice that it also\nhas another number here.\n\n120\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.199\n&gt;&gt; That 5.\n\n121\n00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.640\n&gt;&gt; These are very important, yep.\n\n122\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.660\nSo when you start seeing this, this tells\nyou this is a system type of message and\n\n123\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.380\nit has a severity level of 5.\n\n124\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.198\nAnd now this is from the command line\nitself and noticed there's the message.\n\n125\n00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:38.900\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n126\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.855\n&gt;&gt; Cuz hey, there it is.\n\n127\n00:06:39.855 --> 00:06:42.100\nYou've configured this console and\nthe stuff.\n\n128\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.824\n&gt;&gt; So you gotta tell me, 5, how do we go?\n\n129\n00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:47.560\nScale from one to ten,\nzero being good, ten being bad.\n\n130\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.870\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the key, right?\n\n131\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.662\nAnd that's something we've\ndefinitely gotta remember and\n\n132\n00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.310\nthere's eight of them altogther.\n\n133\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.138\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n134\n00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:56.208\n&gt;&gt; And you've got to know eight.\n\n135\n00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:57.826\n[LAUGH] That's what it comes down to.\n\n136\n00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:58.405\n&gt;&gt; Not too bad.\n\n137\n00:06:58.405 --> 00:06:59.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't seem like it.\n\n138\n00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n139\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.020\n&gt;&gt; On top of all the other stuff-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n140\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.028\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just throw it in the pile.\n\n141\n00:07:02.028 --> 00:07:03.732\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It should be relatively ease.\n\n142\n00:07:03.732 --> 00:07:08.413\nSo that is what we want to take a look at,\nif I can find the right one.\n\n143\n00:07:08.413 --> 00:07:09.074\nThere we go.\n\n144\n00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:10.318\n&gt;&gt; You got something for us to look at.\n\n145\n00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:10.939\n&gt;&gt; Ido.\n\n146\n00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:11.809\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n147\n00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:12.757\n&gt;&gt; I Yep.\nSo this will help us out,\n\n148\n00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:14.184\nI didn't make it all in pretty colors.\n\n149\n00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.515\nI should have, but I did not.\n\n150\n00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:17.830\nThat way, we can see it.\n\n151\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.510\nSo there's different logging levels and\nyou got to know them.\n\n152\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.147\nIt starts off with zero,\ngoing down through seven.\n\n153\n00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:26.870\nAnd it's a little bit\nbackward from the way that-\n\n154\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.806\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I see.\n\n155\n00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:28.521\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee was saying, believe it or not.\n\n156\n00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:31.359\n&gt;&gt; It actually starts off\nthe higher the number,\n\n157\n00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:34.287\nkind of the more normal it is to a point,\nright?\n\n158\n00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:38.044\nIt just depends on the amount of\ninformation that you want to start\n\n159\n00:07:38.044 --> 00:07:39.230\noff with.\n\n160\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.870\nSo like the number 5 that we saw in\nthat router is really right here,\n\n161\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.080\nwhich is the notification itself.\n\n162\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.760\nNow everybody described it\na little bit differently.\n\n163\n00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.346\nI put them in terms that I understand.\n\n164\n00:07:49.346 --> 00:07:49.931\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n165\n00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Which is, it's unusual but\nit's not considered an error, right?\n\n166\n00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.770\nYou have informational here, which is\nof course normal operations as well.\n\n167\n00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.152\nNow the great thing is you can set these\nlogs up to log how much information you\n\n168\n00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:04.192\nwant to display.\n\n169\n00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.028\n&gt;&gt; Like a filter?\n\n170\n00:08:05.028 --> 00:08:05.896\n&gt;&gt; Yep, like a filter.\n\n171\n00:08:05.896 --> 00:08:09.130\nIf you give it a number 6,\nit also includes 5, and\n\n172\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.080\nusually higher is what\nit normally includes.\n\n173\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.612\nSo I was trying to make sure\nI was saying that right.\n\n174\n00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:19.320\nSo the higher the number, so if I have\na 5 it normally also includes 6 so\n\n175\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.030\nthat should show up too.\n\n176\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.586\nBut you can actually filter\nit down if you wanted to.\n\n177\n00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:27.159\nSo of course if you're at 0, you should\nget everything else too, but except for\n\n178\n00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:27.840\nnumber 7.\n\n179\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.600\nNumber 7 shows you everything, and\nwhen I mean everything it's normal and\n\n180\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.790\nevery detail that you can possibly\nimagine in the debugging.\n\n181\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.580\nIt really gives you so\nmuch more information and it is amazing.\n\n182\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.060\nSo when you take a look at these levels,\nif it's a level 0.\n\n183\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.100\nAnd there's something going on with\nyour machine, it probably means hey,\n\n184\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.820\nSystem Is Unstable.\n\n185\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.510\nThat means you're probably not\ngonna get a lot out of it.\n\n186\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.360\nAlerts, Immediate Action Needed.\n\n187\n00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.030\nCritical, Needs Correction Now.\n\n188\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.035\nYou can't wait to later\neven on it's Friday night.\n\n189\n00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:04.620\nIt means it's a number 2 as far as\nsecurity level need you staying like\n\n190\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.880\nerrors needs corrections,\nprobably can wait until Monday morning.\n\n191\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.656\nWarnings here take caution, so\n\n192\n00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:15.744\nin other words the system is telling\nyou I'm letting you know something.\n\n193\n00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:16.483\n&gt;&gt; Pay attention.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n194\n00:09:16.483 --> 00:09:18.288\nsomething is probably not right here.\n\n195\n00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:20.895\nAnd you need to examine a little bit more.\n\n196\n00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.779\n5 is just notifications which is normal.\n\n197\n00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.250\n6 again, more informational,\nNormal Operations.\n\n198\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.687\nSo when you see those ideas and\nthose numbers come up,\n\n199\n00:09:29.687 --> 00:09:32.245\nespecially when you're doing\nsome type of system log.\n\n200\n00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:34.695\nJust like here on the router\nlike we showed you,\n\n201\n00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:38.192\nyou'll see these different types and\nyou do need to examine them and\n\n202\n00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:40.603\nunderstand does severely\nlevel behind them.\n\n203\n00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:43.610\nNow what does feel like when\nit's actually happening?\n\n204\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.340\nThis is what feels like when you start\n\n205\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.262\ngetting-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:48.305\n&gt;&gt; Log messages that's actually\n\n207\n00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:49.030\nhappening, right?\n\n208\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.078\nSo here it is on number 6, right?\n\n209\n00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.675\nNormal Operations, yeah,\nwe'll let it work, okay?\n\n210\n00:09:54.675 --> 00:10:02.070\nNumber 5 here, if we need to,\nit's unusual okay, but not an error.\n\n211\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.742\nNot exactly an error,\nso we can call someone.\n\n212\n00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:09.590\nAnd then take caution, Low Fuel Light is\non, so always about the car here, right?\n\n213\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.835\nSo this just depends on you.\n\n214\n00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:13.524\nIf you go, all right, take caution.\n\n215\n00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:16.516\nIf you're like me you try to\ndrive on it as far as you can\n\n216\n00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:17.092\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:10:17.092 --> 00:10:17.834\n&gt;&gt; To try and get down.\n\n218\n00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:18.721\n&gt;&gt; So you're one of those people.\n\n219\n00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:19.441\n&gt;&gt; So you can see, yep.\n\n220\n00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:22.830\nSo I don't fill it up at half\nthe tank a lot of times here.\n\n221\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.795\nErrors, Needs Correction,\nCheck Engine Light is on, okay?\n\n222\n00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:30.722\nCritical, Correction Now,\ni'd fix it before it broke.\n\n223\n00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:33.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I pretty much this way happening.\n\n224\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.472\nAnd then at large, you're getting\nthose unusual messages, right?\n\n225\n00:10:36.472 --> 00:10:42.239\nThe crunchy sound that you hear,\nthat's not normal, when I stop like that.\n\n226\n00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:46.520\nWhy am I still going 50 feet\nafter pressing on the brake?\n\n227\n00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.402\nThat's not normal, stuff like that.\n\n228\n00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:51.333\nAnd then of course an emergency.\n\n229\n00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.372\nHey, that's not supposed to smoke, is it?\n\n230\n00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda one of those things where\n\n231\n00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:59.470\nyou definitely need to pay attention to\nthe idea of the severity level when it\n\n232\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.268\ncomes to regular types of Syslogs.\n\n233\n00:11:01.268 --> 00:11:04.010\nThere are really going to be helpful.\n\n234\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.930\nThe problem that you have\nwith the messages, right?\n\n235\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.998\nIs that they are goods snap shots in time.\n\n236\n00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:13.323\nIn real time this logging\nmessages really are not helpful.\n\n237\n00:11:13.323 --> 00:11:15.160\nLet me show you here.\n\n238\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.960\nSo even on this router, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.060\nAnd this is not the production router.\n\n240\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.050\nThere is a command that you\nshould never run in production\n\n241\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.380\nwhich is called debug off.\n\n242\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.600\nNotice the warning it gives you, right?\n\n243\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.340\nThis may severely impact\nnetwork performance.\n\n244\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.221\nAnd that is telling you,\nif you turn on all possible logging,\n\n245\n00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:39.144\nit's gonna hit your CPU hard.\n\n246\n00:11:39.144 --> 00:11:39.685\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n247\n00:11:39.685 --> 00:11:43.808\n&gt;&gt; Because it reports so much information\nand the hard part about this, right?\n\n248\n00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:48.426\nIt can report so much that you don't have\na chance actually type a command in, okay?\n\n249\n00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:51.474\nSo not recommended, okay?\n\n250\n00:11:51.474 --> 00:11:55.789\nSo I'm gonna actually do a no here,\nas what I'm going to do.\n\n251\n00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:01.410\nIf you're gonna do debugging of any\nkind for anything, only what you ned to.\n\n252\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.042\nSo for example, if I had\na routing process going on, right?\n\n253\n00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:08.043\nI could debug ip ospf here.\n\n254\n00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:13.881\nAnd it's for the what am I incomplete on?\n\n255\n00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:16.530\nOf course, on adjacencies.\n\n256\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.844\nUsually I do events, but\nat that point if I did have OSPF running,\n\n257\n00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:27.420\nit would only debug for\nOSPF and not everything else.\n\n258\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.469\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just by defining it and\nfiltering it,\n\n259\n00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:32.461\nthen you have less of the information\nthat the machine is to process.\n\n260\n00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:35.673\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, but the great thing is\nthat I don't have anything turned on.\n\n261\n00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:38.369\nIf I had something turned on,\nwell that would be different.\n\n262\n00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:43.094\nSo let's do this, router ospf 1,\nand then we'll give it a network.\n\n263\n00:12:43.094 --> 00:12:46.672\nAnd we'll do something\nthat I can't mess up here.\n\n264\n00:12:46.672 --> 00:12:48.613\nAt least I don't think I can mess up.\n\n265\n00:12:48.613 --> 00:12:54.277\n99, [LAUGH] 0 0,\n\n266\n00:12:54.277 --> 00:12:59.640\nand this area 0.\n\n267\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.351\nSo normally at this point\nit's gonna reach out,\n\n268\n00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:03.073\nit's gonna start trying\nto do some other stuff.\n\n269\n00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:07.407\nBut overall though, if you start to\nhave this and then another router.\n\n270\n00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:10.782\nIt's just gonna start sending that\ninformation back and forth across\n\n271\n00:13:10.782 --> 00:13:14.280\nthe screen and every detail possibly\ncan on that event that goes across.\n\n272\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.075\nSo but this one there's no\nother router there, but\n\n273\n00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:21.830\nafter a while it's gonna start\ngenerating something as it reaches out.\n\n274\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:28.086\nBut that's kind of the idea here,\nand of course for, Cisco.\n\n275\n00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:31.440\nYou wanna make sure that you\ndon't leave it running ever.\n\n276\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.097\nSo I'll just go ahead and undebug all,\n\n277\n00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:35.014\nmake sure I turn off\nall possible debugging.\n\n278\n00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:35.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n279\n00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:40.390\n&gt;&gt; But the idea of logged messages and\nthat sense on an entire system.\n\n280\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.420\nNormally you don't necessarily do that\nright here unless you're really looking\n\n281\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.050\nfor something specific\nto come across screen.\n\n282\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.498\nThe ideal way to do this, of course,\nis to take this information,\n\n283\n00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:53.526\nsend it to another computer\nthat has a Syslog server on it.\n\n284\n00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.264\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n285\n00:13:54.264 --> 00:14:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Then you examine the data and\ncorrelate it with historical data as well.\n\n286\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.177\nBe able to actually kind of compare it\nwith actual data from different times.\n\n287\n00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.149\n&gt;&gt; Just figure out what happens.\n\n288\n00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:06.217\n&gt;&gt; Figures out what happens.\n\n289\n00:14:06.217 --> 00:14:09.847\nSo as a life time shot,\nit can tell you what happen.\n\n290\n00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:13.603\nBut there's so much data that's\nnormally flowing so quickly,\n\n291\n00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:17.400\nyou're not gonna be able to\nspot it very easily at all.\n\n292\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.590\nSo don't always take the example\nhere that this is easy, it's not.\n\n293\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.306\nYou gotta know exactly how\nmuch data that you need and\n\n294\n00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:27.217\nyou gotta know what you're looking for\nas well, okay?\n\n295\n00:14:27.217 --> 00:14:32.154\nSo that kind of gives us that ability\nto take a look at access logs inside\n\n296\n00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:37.258\nof the Apache as well as the idea of\nregular system logs too here in Linux or\n\n297\n00:14:37.258 --> 00:14:38.960\nUnix II, okay?\n\n298\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.601\nOur last little bit for\nthis particular portion is\n\n299\n00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:48.144\ntalking about the use of IIS access logs,\nokay?\n\n300\n00:14:48.144 --> 00:14:53.758\nSo that for us means that we have\na Windows server that's actually up and\n\n301\n00:14:53.758 --> 00:14:54.610\nrunning.\n\n302\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.518\nAnd that's the one right here.\n\n303\n00:14:56.518 --> 00:14:58.342\n&gt;&gt; All right, our web server.\n\n304\n00:14:58.342 --> 00:14:59.598\n&gt;&gt; And we have a web server.\n\n305\n00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:02.365\nI'm gonna see if I can\ngenerate some traffic for\n\n306\n00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:04.312\nour access logs to do something.\n\n307\n00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:09.416\nLet me see if I can connect that one.\n\n308\n00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:14.674\nAlready done it once before, but let's see\nif I can some other little bit of traffic.\n\n309\n00:15:14.674 --> 00:15:15.324\nSo there you go,\n\n310\n00:15:15.324 --> 00:15:17.836\nyou know that I'm actually\nconnecting to that Windows server.\n\n311\n00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:23.265\nAnd there it is, just a basic kind of\nsaying is working type of web page.\n\n312\n00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:24.925\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nif you had developed a web page,\n\n313\n00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:27.383\nthis is what would be generated\nwhenever you were connecting.\n\n314\n00:15:27.383 --> 00:15:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis is just their default web page.\n\n315\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.386\nHopefully, that means that over on\nthe Windows side, that we now have a log\n\n316\n00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:37.159\nmessage inside the IIS application\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\n\n317\n00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:38.983\nwhere can we go to find this information?\n\n318\n00:15:38.983 --> 00:15:43.528\n&gt;&gt; Well the great thing is that is should\nappear inside of the Event Viewer,\n\n319\n00:15:43.528 --> 00:15:46.240\nis where we should go and look first.\n\n320\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.638\nSo there may be a couple things that\nwe have to do to make that happen, but\n\n321\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:52.201\nlet's go ahead and check it out and\nsee what we can do.\n\n322\n00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:56.135\nSo the great thing is, I'm just\ngonna switch on over to my server,\n\n323\n00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:59.179\nand I still had Event Viewer\nrunning from earlier.\n\n324\n00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:03.702\nYou're probably not going to end up\nfinding it inside the windows logs, but\n\n325\n00:16:03.702 --> 00:16:06.175\nit should be found inside application and\n\n326\n00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:10.650\nservice logs here and if I expand that\nout inside of Microsoft and Windows.\n\n327\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:16.530\nI continue expand that out, I should\nfind it underneath well IS logging and\n\n328\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.050\nalso of course IS configuration.\n\n329\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.348\nNow this is where mine is showing\nsomething just a little bit strange where\n\n330\n00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.755\nit showed no events had happened,\nwhich is unusual.\n\n331\n00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:28.906\nBut it does show a log size of 68\nkilobytes and is because the logs\n\n332\n00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:33.376\nfiles have been generated inside,\nbut is not showing up inside here.\n\n333\n00:16:33.376 --> 00:16:36.776\nSo it may actually take a little bit\nlonger time than we realized to make it\n\n334\n00:16:36.776 --> 00:16:38.770\nshow up inside of Event Viewer.\n\n335\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.055\nBut before we do that, let me show you\nwhere you tend to find out if logging is\n\n336\n00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:47.562\nconfigured cuz there's a couple of things\nthat are a little bit more unusual.\n\n337\n00:16:47.562 --> 00:16:49.470\nYou may find out if you go into for\n\n338\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.714\nexample, like the IS configuration\nright here at the top it tells you,\n\n339\n00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:57.760\nhey this is why this one is not\ncollecting any information.\n\n340\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.640\nIt is disabled.\n\n341\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.629\nBut let's check a couple of things to\nverify that logs are turned on and\n\n342\n00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:05.024\nthat we're ready to go.\n\n343\n00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:09.513\n&gt;&gt; Similarly to what you had explained\nto us about running it on your Cisco\n\n344\n00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.621\nequipment here you wouldn't want\nto have those logs being ran if\n\n345\n00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.609\nthey weren't really required or necessary?\n\n346\n00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.064\n&gt;&gt; Yup, but if you're running web server\nfor your company, you're probably gonna\n\n347\n00:17:20.064 --> 00:17:23.890\nwant them because that's what you're\nreally looking for is the access.\n\n348\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:29.760\nBut I've simply started here by going\nonto my ISS information manager and\n\n349\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.570\ninside of the information manager\nservices I've got a couple\n\n350\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.710\nof location that I need to\ncheck to verify some things.\n\n351\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.921\nBut I'm also going to show you\nactually where you can find the logs\n\n352\n00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:42.041\nbecause it may take,\nlike I said, some time.\n\n353\n00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:45.696\nIf you're here on the server,\nat this level,\n\n354\n00:17:45.696 --> 00:17:49.928\nof the navigation pane were\nit tells you server 02.\n\n355\n00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:55.160\nNow here underneath IIS, notice that\nthere is a logging icon right here.\n\n356\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:02.910\nAnd it is inside the details where I\ncan see that I've got one log per site.\n\n357\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.610\nI can change that configuration\nto per server if I want to.\n\n358\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.950\nFollow the standard format and the one\nthat's default as WC3 which is kind of\n\n359\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:16.220\na international type of a formatter,\na fairly recognizable standard.\n\n360\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.635\nThen you can pick the information\nthat you want logged.\n\n361\n00:18:19.635 --> 00:18:22.110\nYou can see all this information.\n\n362\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.970\nAnd you can even add in\nmore if you choose to.\n\n363\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.910\nBut that's the ones that\nthey normally turn on.\n\n364\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.010\nAnd this is where we're going to take\na look at where the log files are actually\n\n365\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.150\ngonna be stored,\nis right here inside of that location.\n\n366\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.390\nSo the great thing is it does help out\n\n367\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.360\nto at least show you where\nthose are gonna be stored.\n\n368\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.580\nIf you're not in charge\nof the entire server,\n\n369\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.450\nit may be where you have\naccess to your own website.\n\n370\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.520\nThen you can click on default website, or\nyour own website whatever it might be.\n\n371\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.100\nSelect logging and\nit's here that you can go ahead and\n\n372\n00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.000\nmanage where your own logs may\nend up being generated instead.\n\n373\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.760\nThis one is one in the same so\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n374\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.630\nBut overall though, it may take\na bit of time before those show up.\n\n375\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.047\nSo like for this one and this kind\nof lets me know something, right?\n\n376\n00:19:10.047 --> 00:19:13.710\nIt says log file- roll over to select\nthe method to create a new log file.\n\n377\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.360\nThis is scheduled for daily to run, so\nmaybe what it actually does take a little\n\n378\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.740\nbit of time before I see it show up\ninside of the applications and services.\n\n379\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.780\nNow what's normally in the log file?\n\n380\n00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.621\nSince it may take a whole day,\nwe're not gonna wait around to see that.\n\n381\n00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:30.579\n&gt;&gt; We can go directly to that UNC path.\n\n382\n00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:34.090\n&gt;&gt; We can go directly\ninto that path itself.\n\n383\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:40.289\nAnd if I can find it on\nlocal disk c Inetpub and\n\n384\n00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:44.653\nlogs, LogFiles, W3SVC1.\n\n385\n00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:46.280\nWow, that was quite a mouthful.\n\n386\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.350\nAnd notice that there are actually three\ndifferent logs that were generated.\n\n387\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.330\nNow, one of course,\n\n388\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.590\nactually two of these logs were\ngenerated from a couple of days before.\n\n389\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.380\nProbably a couple of weeks before.\n\n390\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.320\nAnd this is the one that we had today.\n\n391\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.698\nIf I open that file,\nsee if I can zoom out a little bit.\n\n392\n00:20:05.698 --> 00:20:08.370\nThen we'll kind of zoom in here.\n\n393\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.760\nTells me of course the name of\nthe actual services that are running and\n\n394\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.550\nhere's where we can start seeing some of\nthat information that we also saw a little\n\n395\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.580\nbit earlier.\n\n396\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.693\nThere's date and time and IP address.\n\n397\n00:20:22.693 --> 00:20:23.332\n&gt;&gt; Get command.\n\n398\n00:20:23.332 --> 00:20:23.902\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n399\n00:20:23.902 --> 00:20:27.883\nYou can now see the same thing that we\nsaw when we looking at the apache logs\n\n400\n00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:28.607\njust about.\n\n401\n00:20:28.607 --> 00:20:32.770\nThis one saying hey, get that webpage\nthat has that info graphic on it.\n\n402\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:41.950\nHere's the port number and here is that\nwebsite that it can go to and find.\n\n403\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.821\nSo you were able to see a lot of\nadditional information along with,\n\n404\n00:20:45.821 --> 00:20:50.496\nwell there's the actual refer that we were\ntalking about a little bit earlier right\n\n405\n00:20:50.496 --> 00:20:51.460\nhere at the end.\n\n406\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.448\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n407\n00:20:52.448 --> 00:20:53.636\n&gt;&gt; And, well look at that.\n\n408\n00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:54.569\nThere it is, Cherokee.\n\n409\n00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:56.350\nNotice 404.\n\n410\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.321\n&gt;&gt; 404, yep.\n\n411\n00:20:57.321 --> 00:20:59.191\n&gt;&gt; 404.\n\n412\n00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.640\nSo that lets you know that hey,\nthat's something wrong on our end.\n\n413\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.028\nAnd this one had a 200\nwhich also shows you.\n\n414\n00:21:06.028 --> 00:21:08.714\nLet me see if I can zoom in there.\n\n415\n00:21:08.714 --> 00:21:10.265\nIf I hit the right\nproblem that would help.\n\n416\n00:21:10.265 --> 00:21:13.359\nSo there's a 200,\nthere's a few 404 errors, and\n\n417\n00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:16.270\nthat lets you know that\neverything is good and going.\n\n418\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.820\nMaybe in a few minutes,\nmaybe in half a day for\n\n419\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.770\nall I know, those files will end up\ngetting generated inside the event viewer.\n\n420\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.244\nBut overall though, they contain the same\nmessages that we really broke down in\n\n421\n00:21:28.244 --> 00:21:29.596\nthe Apache web server.\n\n422\n00:21:29.596 --> 00:21:32.959\nSo they're not unique whether\nwe're talking about Windows or\n\n423\n00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.790\nwhether we're talking about Linux or Unix.\n\n424\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.580\nThey kind of follow the same pattern.\n\n425\n00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.600\nThat's something we should\nget use to as well.\n\n426\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Great, so that's definitely\nsomething I wanna keep an eye out for,\n\n427\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.780\nand look whenever I'm going through,\nand examining my log files,\n\n428\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.100\nand interpreting that log data.\n\n429\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.380\nSo thank you for joining us today Ronnie,\nand thank you for joining us as well,\n\n430\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.750\nwe appreciate that.\n\n431\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.640\nBut stay tuned, we do have some more\ninformation out to your way for\n\n432\n00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.530\nthis episode, we'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n433\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.613\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n434\n00:22:00.613 --> 00:22:01.517\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n435\n00:22:01.517 --> 00:22:06.808\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here in ITProTV.\n\n436\n00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:10.492\n[MUSIC]\n\n437\n00:22:10.492 --> 00:22:14.007\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:18.090\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230\nIn this episode we will be looking at\nhow to identify different data types.\n\n7\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140\nWell there's a lot of\ndifferent types of data, so\n\n8\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.640\nI'm really curious to see where\nwe're going with this one Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.973\nThank you for joining us today Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:29.413\nWhat are we gonna be looking at first?\n\n11\n00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:32.363\n&gt;&gt; Well when we start to take\na look at the idea of data types,\n\n12\n00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:36.360\nwe have to be able of course to\ngather information on our machines.\n\n13\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.290\nAnd today we're gonna begin\nwith taking a look at tcpdump.\n\n14\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.639\nIf you ever wondered how\nto kind of get started,\n\n15\n00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:46.127\nit's kind of a little bit of a primer\non getting started with tcpdump.\n\n16\n00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:50.352\nAnd then we're gonna take a look at\nthe data itself, and what it shows us, and\n\n17\n00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:54.510\nwhy we might choose to use it,\nwhich is also gonna be key for us too.\n\n18\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.640\nBut the great thing is it's\na great little utility,\n\n19\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.695\nit doesn't require you to install\nmuch additional software.\n\n20\n00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.406\nExcept for tcpdump itself and\n\n21\n00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:06.967\na few different options\nthat you have ready to go.\n\n22\n00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.518\nAnd it will help you to see\na lot of different data and\n\n23\n00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:14.770\nall the different data types\nthat are out there too.\n\n24\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.760\nSo that's where we are going to begin.\n\n25\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We also have a lot of\n\n26\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.980\nother tools that are available to us.\n\n27\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.730\nAnd we need to able to understand what we\nmight actually be looking for in that.\n\n28\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.510\nAnd hopefully as we have time,\n\n29\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.540\nwe'll be able to show all of the actual\ndifferent types of data that you are able\n\n30\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.500\nto see, once you learn how to use the\ndifferent utilities that are out there.\n\n31\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.300\nBut we're gonna focus in on kind of\nthe Linux ones at the beginning, but\n\n32\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.632\nreally tcpdump, and\nthen we're gonna go Cisco-centric.\n\n33\n00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:48.380\nHeavily Cisco-centric,\nin just about everything else that we do.\n\n34\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.660\nSo that is kind of where we\nare starting out with host security.\n\n35\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n36\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's go and take a look\nat my machine as we get started here.\n\n37\n00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.330\nThat way it will help us out.\n\n38\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.170\nThe way that we begin with tcpdump, right,\n\n39\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.230\nis to understand what it really does for\nus.\n\n40\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.780\nIf you use something like Wireshark,\nit essentially does the same thing.\n\n41\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.780\nI'm not gonna say it does everything\nexactly the same, but it gives us that\n\n42\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.480\nability to do packet sniffing,\nis what tcpdump really allows us to do.\n\n43\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.890\nWhen you start to use it, then,\nyou might be wondering, well,\n\n44\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.510\nif I can install Wireshark,\nwhy would I use tcpdump?\n\n45\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.090\nThat's a good question to have, and\nit's a good one to think about.\n\n46\n00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.750\nWith Wireshark, there is still\na level of complexity there that goes\n\n47\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.300\nbeyond just saying, I can run the tool and\nget all the information.\n\n48\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.660\nUnderstanding all of the filters that\nare available inside of that is amazing.\n\n49\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.910\nIf you're really good at it, you'll\nactually be able to do a lot with it,\n\n50\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.490\nbut if you're not that good at it,\nyou won't be able to do a lot with it.\n\n51\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.510\nSo here though, with tcpdump,\nwhat you're gonna see is,\n\n52\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.770\nif you can understand and learn just a few\nof them, it is a really powerful tool\n\n53\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.550\nto show you the same type of information\nas what you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n54\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.150\nBut it's gonna be displayed a little\nbit differently, not as colorful.\n\n55\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.270\nBut definitely one that gives us a pretty\ngood amount of information that we need.\n\n56\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.910\nSo when we get started with tcpdump.\n\n57\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.260\nIt is possible in your Linux install,\nof whatever distro that you have,\n\n58\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080\nit might not be available.\n\n59\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.670\nSo that means of course\nyou'll need to go and\n\n60\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.110\ninstall it from a package\nmanager of some sort.\n\n61\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.100\nI'm running the Debian,\nI've already installed it,\n\n62\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.080\nbut let's make sure that we\nunderstand where we go to get this.\n\n63\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.020\nIt's always important that you\nknow where to go to do this.\n\n64\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.800\nRemember that for us, a lot of time,\nif your user is not actually going\n\n65\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.780\nto be the elevated privilege or the admin\nfor this, it may kind of balk at you.\n\n66\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.490\nBut here inside of Debian it is @get.\n\n67\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.097\nOops, if I can spell it.\n\n68\n00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:50.939\nInstall.\n\n69\n00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.212\n&gt;&gt; tcpdump.\n\n70\n00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:55.190\n&gt;&gt; And then tcpdump here.\n\n71\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520\nAnd notice it's says, no, you can't do it.\n\n72\n00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.110\nUnable to unlock\nthe administration directory.\n\n73\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n74\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.500\nthis time I might, can I do it with sudo?\n\n75\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.300\nI could, but more than likely,\nlet's see if that actually works too.\n\n76\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.360\nSo sudo, or sudo, I should say,\n\n77\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.750\napt-get install tcpdump,\nit might balk at me again.\n\n78\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.350\nAnd now it says, hey,\nall right you're running this.\n\n79\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.025\nDo you have the super secret password,\nwhich I do.\n\n80\n00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:28.500\nAnd now it says, look Ronnie,\n\n81\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.440\nyou didn't even add yourself to the\nsudoers file, so you can't even do that.\n\n82\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.960\nSo I have to kind of actually login as\nthe actual administrator or the superuser.\n\n83\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.653\nAnd now,\nI can do the apt-get install tcpdump.\n\n84\n00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:47.710\nOnce it installs you're perfectly fine.\n\n85\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.384\nAnd from that point you'll have\nthe ability to use that tool.\n\n86\n00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo remember to check all that.\n\n87\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.230\nI know it sounds easy.\n\n88\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.860\nIf you're already in the Linux world.\n\n89\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.064\nIf you're like me and\nyou come from really a Windows background,\n\n90\n00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:02.380\nit talk a little bit of\ntime getting used to.\n\n91\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.480\nAnd even this would have been frustrating\nlike, why can't I install this?\n\n92\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.930\nAnd why get all this silly\nmessages it gives me?\n\n93\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.330\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] silly to me, but\nit doesn't necessarily mean it, so.\n\n94\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.400\nBut what I'm trying to get out is,\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n95\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.055\nSo for those of you that are switching\nover and the Cisco cyber security you\n\n96\n00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:24.560\ngotta have be good at both, Windows as\nwell as in any type of Linux addition.\n\n97\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.940\nWe're showing you at least most\nbasic commands to get you there.\n\n98\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.970\nOkay.\nAll right, so once we have this up and\n\n99\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.185\nrunning, the easiest command to run\nin the world is just simply tcpdump.\n\n100\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.562\nNow once we do so, you'll actually\ntake a look and notice it says,\n\n101\n00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:42.142\nhey verbose suppressed.\n\n102\n00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:47.040\nWe can use a couple of these if one,\n-v or -vv.\n\n103\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.288\nvv or double v here for\nfull protocol decoding.\n\n104\n00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:54.110\nAnd now it's starting\nto realize something,\n\n105\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.840\nhey there's a lot of data coming through.\n\n106\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.190\nAnd this does it on a per interface basis,\nis what it does.\n\n107\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.090\nThe default one, of course, it actually\ngoes and says, look I'm looking for\n\n108\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.790\nthe very first interface and that's\nwhat it will begin to capture data on.\n\n109\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.520\nSo that is what you're starting to see.\n\n110\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.250\nThere's a lot of data\nthat is coming across.\n\n111\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.200\nThe link that you're\nactually seeing here and\n\n112\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.560\nit will continue to actually run and\nrun and run.\n\n113\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.810\nYou add in some more traffic,\nit becomes a little bit more unusual.\n\n114\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.620\nOkay so, I've talked for just a few\nseconds now and I'm going to stop this.\n\n115\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.587\nAt least I think I'm gonna stop this.\n\n116\n00:06:29.587 --> 00:06:33.000\nTry to stop it, there we go.\n\n117\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.240\nSo it was probably what,\n10, 15, 20 seconds.\n\n118\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.440\nBut notice right away it went ahead and\ncaptured about 1,482\n\n119\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.140\npackets here received by\nthe actual filter itself.\n\n120\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.576\nSo it was able to do that,\n85 pockets captured here.\n\n121\n00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:54.600\nAnd then, about 13,091 of them drop and\n\n122\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.880\nI didn't even use any other modifier,\nanything else that I needed to.\n\n123\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.270\nSo it can give you a tremendous\namount of information that you need.\n\n124\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.245\nBut there's couple comments that we need\nto go before we examine the data that\n\n125\n00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:10.020\nwe're actually seeing up here.\n\n126\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.760\nAnd you're starting to see it\nactually looks pretty hefty here.\n\n127\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.910\nAs you go through some of it,\nyou might be able to recognize.\n\n128\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.580\nSome of you might be wondering,\nwhat in the world is that coming about?\n\n129\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.840\nAnd we're starting to see, actually,\n\n130\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.140\na lot of other information\nfrom the network itself.\n\n131\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.930\nSo you will end up seeing a lot of that.\n\n132\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.840\nOne of the things that you can do to help\nyou at the very beginning, is tcpdump, and\n\n133\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.390\nI always have to remember that.\n\n134\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.424\nThen I can specify the particular\ninterface if I wanted to.\n\n135\n00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:42.140\nF0, that's the only one that\nI have on this computer.\n\n136\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.240\nThat will limit you to\nthat one interface too.\n\n137\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.510\nYou might find out that you\nhave multiple network adapters.\n\n138\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.544\nIf you do, make sure you pick the one\nthat you're really trying to capture on,\n\n139\n00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:57.993\nand this is what will help you to at\nleast get that basic information.\n\n140\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:01.845\nBy default, tcpdump looks at the first and\n\n141\n00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:05.805\ncaptures only the first 96 Bytes of data,\n\n142\n00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:10.920\nalong with the header information as well,\nokay?\n\n143\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.400\nSo that's what it captures by default,\non older versions of it, it used to,\n\n144\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.510\nI think only the,\nI don't know why 87 sounds right.\n\n145\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.090\nBut I could be wrong it's probably 64, but\nthat's what it normally captures is 97\n\n146\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.820\nbytes a data is what it\nreally captures here.\n\n147\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.260\nAnd if you want that to be more specific\nor you want to capture the whole\n\n148\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:41.100\nthing instead, what you choose to do is to\nadd in a size option, which is right here.\n\n149\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:47.910\nAnd if you wanna capture the entire\nof a TCP packet, you will do 15, 14.\n\n150\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.547\nSo this will capture the entire frame or\nnot frame,\n\n151\n00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:55.270\nyeah pretty much the entire\nframe itself instead and\n\n152\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.768\nthat you can go through all information\nthat becomes a lot more information,\n\n153\n00:09:00.768 --> 00:09:05.439\nso this is a bit faster when you let\nit do the default that needs to.\n\n154\n00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:08.792\nAll right, so what is the information\nthat we looking at up here.\n\n155\n00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:11.250\nWell, I already did a previous cut first.\n\n156\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.900\nWe're gonna break this down a little bit,\nso\n\n157\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.270\nthat we can tell what it\nis that we're looking at.\n\n158\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.553\nAnd then we'll go back and we'll run\na few more with a few different options.\n\n159\n00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:18.548\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n160\n00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:21.050\n&gt;&gt; Is what we'll do here.\n\n161\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.190\nSo let me see if I can find my,\nthere it is.\n\n162\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:30.260\nLet me move that back into,\nere we go, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.500\nSo here is just a random capture\nthat I did the other day.\n\n164\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.200\nSo this is just a random sampling of the\ndata and it was running the same command\n\n165\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.230\nhere, which is at TCP dump\nwith the I option at zero and\n\n166\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.950\nwhat it did here is all the information\nI captured, my eyes began to cross\n\n167\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:55.540\nonce I started hitting 7:30 at night I\nwas like, my gosh look at all this data.\n\n168\n00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.690\nI have to pour through this to\nactually figure out what we need.\n\n169\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.140\nThey're not short number right?\n\n170\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.540\nThere are some IP addresses in here,\nwhich we recognize.\n\n171\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.680\nAnd that seems easy enough.\n\n172\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.970\nBut look at this sequence\nnumber over here.\n\n173\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.280\nAre you joking?\n\n174\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.250\nThat's actually a sequence number.\n\n175\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.650\nThe Window itself.\n\n176\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.512\nThe Window size is pretty big.\n\n177\n00:10:16.512 --> 00:10:17.960\n&gt;&gt; 14,600.\n\n178\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and then you even have a value of\nsomething else and may be coming through.\n\n179\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.620\nAnd notice look there's another\nsequence number and they are gigantic.\n\n180\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.990\nYou start seeing this stuff and\n\n181\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.530\nyou're wondering,\nhow the heck does that really break down?\n\n182\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.970\nNope, let's take a look\nwhen we start to see this.\n\n183\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.370\nSo here I've kinda made a little bit\nmore colorful so that we can see some of\n\n184\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.200\nthe information that we're likely to\nsee and need to know about, right.\n\n185\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.870\nEverything that you capture inside of\nTCP dump can be broken down like this.\n\n186\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.060\nAt the very beginning, you have a\ntimestamp, and this really gets detailed.\n\n187\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.634\nNotice this goes from about 7:30 at night,\n30 seconds,\n\n188\n00:10:56.634 --> 00:11:01.900\n0.591513, a fraction of a second.\n\n189\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.660\nThat is pretty detailed.\n\n190\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.969\n&gt;&gt; Pretty accurate, yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n191\n00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:05.478\n&gt;&gt; In terms of the fraction of a\n\n192\n00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:06.130\nsecond here.\n\n193\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.760\nSo, it knows how to count to that\nparticular point that it needs to.\n\n194\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.530\nDepending on the machine you may\nnot see this protocol at all.\n\n195\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.610\nBut most of the newer\nones you probably will.\n\n196\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.530\nSo on older versions,\nyou may not see it, just says.\n\n197\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.900\nAnd the reason why I say expect\nit to really only capture TCP, so\n\n198\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.720\nit just says, it's just TCP data.\n\n199\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But here it goes IP,\n\n200\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.810\nso it can capture just about anything.\n\n201\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.280\nNotice you have a kind of\nconcatenation of things, right?\n\n202\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.580\nSo the very beginning of course\nis the source address itself,\n\n203\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.740\nnotice it changed it to a DNS name.\n\n204\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.430\nError.\n\n205\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.250\nSo it says look, I can resolve names.\n\n206\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.810\nI can do this.\n\n207\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:50.260\nSo it's able to take the name our\nreport out name tells me the local port\n\n208\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:57.660\nthat it is on and then, noticed the\ndestination address and the port number.\n\n209\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.000\nSo it was able to do\na weird inversion thing.\n\n210\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.750\nRight?\n\n211\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.960\nIt does DNS here, but\ngives me a port number here.\n\n212\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.450\nAnd then for the destination, it says,\nlet me report the IP address, and\n\n213\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.140\nlet me just go ahead and\nname the protocol instead.\n\n214\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n215\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.180\nI'm not saying that it does\nthat all the time, but\n\n216\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.410\nat least in my example\n&gt;&gt; This is also a key element of what you\n\n217\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.171\nsee too.\n\n218\n00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:20.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n219\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.820\n&gt;&gt; And of course there are flags.\n\n220\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.910\nWell, remember that in TCP\nas far as you and I know and\n\n221\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.340\nas far as the world knows, right, there's\na three way handshake that goes on.\n\n222\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.930\nThis is about that one section\ninside of the TCP header,\n\n223\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.600\nthat has those different flags.\n\n224\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.190\nFlags, generally,\nyou'll actually see like an R,\n\n225\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.900\nor a P, or an S, or an F.\n\n226\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:51.640\nThe S is for SYN, and then the R is for\nRESET, P is for PUSH, F is for FIN.\n\n227\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.120\nThe one thing that you don't get\nhere is the idea of an ACK-Flag and\n\n228\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.970\nthat is because it actually\nhappens afterwards.\n\n229\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or you see the information too.\n\n230\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.570\nWhat if you see a period?\n\n231\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.230\nA period says I didn't capture any\nflagged information at this point.\n\n232\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.590\nAnd it just sent an acknowledgement.\n\n233\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.160\nYou also have windows size.\n\n234\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.410\nSometimes, you'll see link size as well.\n\n235\n00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:21.039\nUnderneath here, I tried to help us out\njust a little bit more by making sure\n\n236\n00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:26.025\nwe focus in correctly on some of this\nstuff that we are really gonna need to\n\n237\n00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:30.802\npay attention to because everything\nthat's behind us is about TCP.\n\n238\n00:13:30.802 --> 00:13:34.725\nThat means that a normal path of\nthe communication that when we have two\n\n239\n00:13:34.725 --> 00:13:36.255\nmachines communicating,\n\n240\n00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:39.868\nsynchronizing to communicate it\nhas to go through what, send.\n\n241\n00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:41.686\nSend ACK, ACK, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:45.730\nIt has to before anything can happen.\n\n243\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.980\nWhat if you start seeing like,\nsend but no ACKs.\n\n244\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.340\nWhat if you start seeing stuff like that?\n\n245\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.070\nThat is what can start telling\nyou that things might be wrong.\n\n246\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.840\nWhat if you start seeing the idea of\nsequencing which is very important part of\n\n247\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.710\ntcpip and the sequence is off or else,\nyou start seeing unusual sequencing?\n\n248\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.160\nIf that happens, then something else\nis also going to be wrong as well.\n\n249\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.230\nSo, focus on, on the areas I\nhave also circled out here too.\n\n250\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.140\nIt try to help us all a little bit\nwhen you start and take a look.\n\n251\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:25.020\nOn those flags,\nI guess I could put it up here and\n\n252\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.150\nthat would make it a little bit easier for\nus to see.\n\n253\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.920\nMake sure you understand that that's\nwhat those elements are about and\n\n254\n00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.180\nwhich part of the process\nyou're taking a look at.\n\n255\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.550\nAnd then down here in the sequencing\nnumber you have to be able to verify this,\n\n256\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.620\nof whether or not the sequence number is\nright for this particular entry here.\n\n257\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.760\nNow, Cherokee,\nlooking at just some numbers here, right?\n\n258\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.180\nAnd if you're experienced with it you\nknow how to do it, but if you're not,\n\n259\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.170\nthat's what we wanna go through so that\nyou know whether or not this is right.\n\n260\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n261\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.300\n&gt;&gt; You need to be able to verify whether\nor not this sequence number is okay.\n\n262\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.503\nAnd, Cherokee, if you're good at math,\nthis is a fine.\n\n263\n00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:06.290\n&gt;&gt; Great. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But if you're like\nme, first time you're looking like,\n\n264\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.250\nhow in the heck am I going to figure\nout that that sequence number is right?\n\n265\n00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.600\n197, what in the world is that?\n\n266\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.090\n&gt;&gt; The ratio, so\nwe're talking about division?\n\n267\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.470\n&gt;&gt; You don't even have to do division,\nis simple addition.\n\n268\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.920\nThere's a couple of things to that\nyou have to pay attention to, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n270\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.740\n&gt;&gt; Notice that there's\na number right here at the end\n\n271\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.190\nwhich is the link of the packet.\n\n272\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n273\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.510\nNotice the ack here, and\nnotice, look at this.\n\n274\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.150\n197.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm extending past that length, so\n\n275\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.610\nthat seems a little unusual.\n\n276\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're not exactly\nextending past the length here.\n\n277\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.550\nSo what is happening here\nis that this is indicating\n\n278\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.570\nthat this is actually the first\nsequence in the SYN, SYN ACK, etc.\n\n279\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.900\nSo this is the very first one.\n\n280\n00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.226\nThis one right here is the first one.\n\n281\n00:15:54.226 --> 00:16:01.224\nWell, the length of this entire thing\nthat the client 02 is what 196 bytes.\n\n282\n00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:03.145\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH] I did less time and\n\n283\n00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:07.670\nlook at the number, nine or 22 packets\nis what I usually got captured here.\n\n284\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.200\nHere's the next number\nI'm expecting to see.\n\n285\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.370\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So what they do is they take 196,\n\n286\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.821\nthey don't say, I'm expecting\nto see a one, they say, what?\n\n287\n00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:18.386\nI'm expecting to see this\nnumber when you send it back.\n\n288\n00:16:18.386 --> 00:16:18.979\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n289\n00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Which is 197, okay.\n\n290\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.900\nSo if you get a number like 200,\nthen you realize something.\n\n291\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.963\n&gt;&gt; Someone may be trying to\nhijack into your network, yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:28.963 --> 00:16:30.485\n&gt;&gt; Very good, see?\n\n293\n00:16:30.485 --> 00:16:31.923\nThere he goes.\n\n294\n00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:35.338\nThere, Cherokee Boose, TCP dump expert.\n\n295\n00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:36.508\nTake it over, Cherokee.\n\n296\n00:16:36.508 --> 00:16:38.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:40.284\n&gt;&gt; No, but just kind of realize, right?\n\n298\n00:16:40.284 --> 00:16:42.408\nI know it seems a little bit difficult,\nright?\n\n299\n00:16:42.408 --> 00:16:45.210\nWhen you start looking at this,\nyou go, Ronnie, are you joking me?\n\n300\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.590\nNo, Cherokee is exactly right.\n\n301\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.960\nYou start to take a look at\njust some simple things, right?\n\n302\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.062\nThe length and the acknowledgement, well,\n\n303\n00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:55.505\nthat should help us out to\nbe able to determine that.\n\n304\n00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:59.040\nYou're saying, Ronnie,\nI'm gonna call you on that.\n\n305\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.503\nI don't think that that's right, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:00.503 --> 00:17:05.030\nWell, let's take a look here as\nfar as the sequences go, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.776\nSo we're gonna use bigger numbers\nat this particular point.\n\n308\n00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.228\n&gt;&gt; All right, a larger sample.\n\n309\n00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.097\n&gt;&gt; Yep, a larger sample.\n\n310\n00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:12.240\nNow let's take a look here.\n\n311\n00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.110\nSo I've went ahead and\ncircled the information.\n\n312\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.500\nThis is gonna take a little bit more\ntime for us to kind of focus in here.\n\n313\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.567\nNow, they do have some other\nnumbers that are here,\n\n314\n00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:24.486\nbut I'm really looking at\nthe sequence number, right.\n\n315\n00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:26.182\nThat's pretty much all I'm looking at.\n\n316\n00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:31.071\nSo if I take 246 and I have this at number\n\n317\n00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:35.800\nhere which is right here, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.960\nSo, now what number am I\nactually expecting to see\n\n319\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.460\nwhen you start here, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.420\nSo, when you start to take a look\nat all this information and\n\n321\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.970\nwhat's happening, this one.\n\n322\n00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.740\nLet me make sure I'm\ntelling you right on this.\n\n323\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.010\nSo, notice that this one is\nactually a little bit different.\n\n324\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.940\nI may be telling you backward here.\n\n325\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.560\nThey took 3511 and\nthey took the length here.\n\n326\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.690\nThey ignored the sequence of the act and\nnotice this is actually the same thing.\n\n327\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:12.730\nBut if you add in 3511 plus 246 that is\nthe number we are trying to determine.\n\n328\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.520\nSo let me see if I can\nbring up the calculator.\n\n329\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.600\n&gt;&gt; I'm already working on it here, 3757.\n\n330\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.220\n&gt;&gt; 3757, so in this one, right,\nafter the initial acknowledgement,\n\n331\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.110\nyou don't have to worry about that\ncuz this number is not gonna change.\n\n332\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.544\nIt's just saying hey, look,\nI'm acknowledging that.\n\n333\n00:18:27.544 --> 00:18:32.201\nBut now notice that the length itself\nis now starting to increase, right?\n\n334\n00:18:32.201 --> 00:18:36.507\nSo go ahead and add 3757 plus 56.\n\n335\n00:18:36.507 --> 00:18:37.483\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n336\n00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:41.326\nThat should be 3,813.\n\n337\n00:18:41.326 --> 00:18:43.045\n&gt;&gt; 3,813.\n\n338\n00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:43.683\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n339\n00:18:43.683 --> 00:18:47.827\n&gt;&gt; And then, add 42 to that.\n\n340\n00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:50.545\n&gt;&gt; 3,855.\n\n341\n00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:52.529\n&gt;&gt; 3,855.\n\n342\n00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:57.591\nSo the initial one, it does take\ninto account the acknowledgement.\n\n343\n00:18:57.591 --> 00:19:02.491\nBut after that point all you need is\nthe length and the sequence number.\n\n344\n00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:04.871\nSo I was like, why didn't I\nactually circle acknowledgement?\n\n345\n00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:08.791\nBecause I realized that a pattern was\ncoming after what started to happen here.\n\n346\n00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:09.499\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n347\n00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:14.095\nthis one kind of lets you know that\nthat's how you can verify that.\n\n348\n00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:18.040\nIf you can take look at, in a string, just\nlike this, this is one after the other.\n\n349\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.330\nSo here it is.\n\n350\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n351\n00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.780\n&gt;&gt; One after the other,\nyou can start seeing the patterns.\n\n352\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.660\nSo if you miss something in between,\nright.\n\n353\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.280\nIf something disappears right\nhere in the middle, and\n\n354\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.432\nyou're like, hey what happened there?\n\n355\n00:19:31.432 --> 00:19:33.067\nOr it's wrong as you start adding it up.\n\n356\n00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:36.331\nThen you start knowing that\nsomething else is modified,\n\n357\n00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:40.148\nsomething else has changed here\nthat you need to pay attention to.\n\n358\n00:19:40.148 --> 00:19:45.930\nSo just make sure that you take a little\nbit of time and run through that TCP dump.\n\n359\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.219\nAnd get some of that information,\nand start to see if you can scan and\n\n360\n00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:50.446\nspot some information.\n\n361\n00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.316\n&gt;&gt; Find those patterns.\n\n362\n00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:51.955\nGot it.\n\n363\n00:19:51.955 --> 00:19:53.012\n&gt;&gt; It really is helpful.\n\n364\n00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:54.945\nAnd it really is something that,\n\n365\n00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:59.444\nas a cyber security technician that\nyou're gonna be looking at a lot of logs.\n\n366\n00:19:59.444 --> 00:20:01.731\nYou're gonna be looking at a lot\nof data that comes across.\n\n367\n00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:04.599\nAnd you're trying to spot\nthose unusual patterns.\n\n368\n00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:07.478\nRight here,\nthis is a normal pattern, right?\n\n369\n00:20:07.478 --> 00:20:10.613\nSo after the beginning where it\nactually does that acknowledgement,\n\n370\n00:20:10.613 --> 00:20:12.482\nnotice everything else it ignores that.\n\n371\n00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:15.380\nWhich I probably should have said but\nI didn't remember it.\n\n372\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.428\nSo here's sequence plus the link and\nnotice it automatically generates that\n\n373\n00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:21.866\nnext sequence number\nit's expecting to see.\n\n374\n00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:25.381\nSo it is a key aspect of\nsomething that we need\n\n375\n00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:29.087\nto be at least fairly\nfamiliar with as we go on.\n\n376\n00:20:29.087 --> 00:20:29.772\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n377\n00:20:29.772 --> 00:20:30.329\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n378\n00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:32.488\nSo let's take a look at\nsome other information.\n\n379\n00:20:32.488 --> 00:20:37.713\nThat's kind of the big key thing\nalong with some of the commands here.\n\n380\n00:20:37.713 --> 00:20:42.524\nBut we do need to focus in on some of\nthe additional commands that can really\n\n381\n00:20:42.524 --> 00:20:43.620\nhelp us out too.\n\n382\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:53.020\nSo we already talked about the size of the\npackets that we can capture with TCP dump.\n\n383\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.920\nNow we wanna add in a few\nother elements too.\n\n384\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.698\nIf you need this to be faster,\n\n385\n00:20:57.698 --> 00:21:02.053\nwell getting rid of these names is\nprobably going to be a big help as well.\n\n386\n00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:03.632\n&gt;&gt; You mean for the DNS translations?\n\n387\n00:21:03.632 --> 00:21:04.445\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n388\n00:21:04.445 --> 00:21:05.676\n&gt;&gt; For the DNS translations.\n\n389\n00:21:05.676 --> 00:21:07.185\nSo here I can just do a -n,\n\n390\n00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:11.520\nstart noticing some of these\nnames that are actually up here.\n\n391\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.510\nAnd I'm gonna also do what we\ncall an upper case S here, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.668\nCuz I wanna see the sequence numbers.\n\n393\n00:21:18.668 --> 00:21:20.666\nThat's always important to me.\n\n394\n00:21:20.666 --> 00:21:25.184\nSo now when I do this, now notice\nthat the names have disappeared.\n\n395\n00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:25.835\n&gt;&gt; Strictly IP addresses.\n\n396\n00:21:25.835 --> 00:21:28.307\n&gt;&gt; And look at how much more data\nis coming through now, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:28.307 --> 00:21:28.900\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n398\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.720\n&gt;&gt; So if it needs to be faster you\ncan simply do something like this.\n\n399\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.718\nAnd now the names aren't getting\n[INAUDIBLE] look I'm even seeing\n\n400\n00:21:35.718 --> 00:21:37.365\nUDP traffic coming across as well.\n\n401\n00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:41.488\nSo there's some information\nthat you can take a look at.\n\n402\n00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:43.113\nAll right, so just very quickly.\n\n403\n00:21:43.113 --> 00:21:47.362\n[LAUGH] That generated and\ncaptured 275 packets compared to 85,\n\n404\n00:21:47.362 --> 00:21:49.930\nI think I had less time there.\n\n405\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.700\nWhy, I didn't have to\ndo the name resolution.\n\n406\n00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.321\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n407\n00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:55.543\nit was able to generate\nthe information a lot quicker too.\n\n408\n00:21:55.543 --> 00:21:58.662\nNow if you wanna get even\nmore detailed than this,\n\n409\n00:21:58.662 --> 00:22:01.419\nyou can continue to add additional things.\n\n410\n00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:06.814\nSo let's say that what I\nwanted here was to also add\n\n411\n00:22:06.814 --> 00:22:11.961\nin the ethernet as well,\nso here, let's see.\n\n412\n00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:17.170\nNow, you might be wondering,\nlook at this thing go crazy, right.\n\n413\n00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.630\nLook what's happening now.\n\n414\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.420\nIt is going nuts.\n\n415\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.997\nAnd the reason why is,\noops, I better stop that.\n\n416\n00:22:21.997 --> 00:22:24.700\n[LAUGH] I did less time.\n\n417\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.330\nAnd look at the number, nine or 22 packets\nis what actually got captured here.\n\n418\n00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.130\nAnd none of them dropped by\nthe kernel at this point.\n\n419\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.630\nBut take a look here, Cherokee.\n\n420\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.360\nNotice something unusual\nabout these addresses?\n\n421\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.480\nAbout this address?\n\n422\n00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Layer two.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's all layer two data too.\n\n423\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.210\nSo you actually have layer two,\nand some of them, of course,\n\n424\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.440\neven still have the layer three\ninformation going across them as well.\n\n425\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.887\nSo you can see a lot of data but sometimes\nyou can see too much data as well.\n\n426\n00:22:53.887 --> 00:22:54.513\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n427\n00:22:54.513 --> 00:22:58.844\n&gt;&gt; But you can also end up seeing,\nwell, not any data that you want to.\n\n428\n00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:03.173\nSo sometimes you actually\nget some where you don't see\n\n429\n00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:06.122\nanything that you want to go across.\n\n430\n00:23:06.122 --> 00:23:09.550\nBut overall, though,\nyou have this information where, and\n\n431\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.740\nI can't remember the actual command.\n\n432\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.285\nI wish I could.\n&gt;&gt; So you can just basically\n\n433\n00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:16.338\ncustomize it to make sure that depending\non if it's an urgent type situation.\n\n434\n00:23:16.338 --> 00:23:18.152\nYou can get whatever you need on the fly.\n\n435\n00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:21.726\n&gt;&gt; Right, but it is that combination\nof things that you're taking a look at.\n\n436\n00:23:21.726 --> 00:23:24.795\nIf you don't want to see port names,\nin other words,\n\n437\n00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:27.879\ninstead of what we saw at the beginning,\nthat https.\n\n438\n00:23:27.879 --> 00:23:30.387\nYou can do a double lower case nn.\n\n439\n00:23:30.387 --> 00:23:34.346\nDouble nn like that.\n\n440\n00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n441\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.910\n&gt;&gt; And that will also say,\nI'm not going to do port names.\n\n442\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.570\nWe're just going to do numbers too.\n\n443\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.350\nIt makes it even faster.\n\n444\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.730\nYou name it, it's all about seeing the\namount of data that you have available.\n\n445\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.482\nBut some of the other interesting filters,\nat least for us, right,\n\n446\n00:23:49.482 --> 00:23:52.016\nis gonna have to do with\nthe ports themselves.\n\n447\n00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:55.994\nSo let's say that we're gonna\ndrop the name resolution,\n\n448\n00:23:55.994 --> 00:24:00.634\nwe're gonna still continue to take\na look at the sequence numbers.\n\n449\n00:24:00.634 --> 00:24:01.248\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n450\n00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:03.938\nI wanna add in a port number of 443.\n\n451\n00:24:03.938 --> 00:24:11.360\nNow that I have something like this,\nI can then go to the browser.\n\n452\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.981\n&gt;&gt; And generate some HTTP traffic?\n\n453\n00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep, generate some traffic,\n\n454\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.680\nand you start seeing other\ntraffic flowing through there.\n\n455\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.765\n&gt;&gt; Or HTTPS?\n\n456\n00:24:21.765 --> 00:24:22.284\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n457\n00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.000\nAnd now, there we go.\n\n458\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.359\nWe've got some HTTPS traffic\ngoing across as well.\n\n459\n00:24:31.048 --> 00:24:35.380\nSo there, even more and\nmore traffic is now coming across.\n\n460\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.146\nAnd that is now filtering by using HTTPS,\ntoo.\n\n461\n00:24:38.146 --> 00:24:40.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nstill looks like a lot of information.\n\n462\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.140\nIs there a way that we can\neven filter it further and\n\n463\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.000\njust identify the communication.\n\n464\n00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.900\nFor one device to another, and\nthen even specify it by protocol.\n\n465\n00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.720\n&gt;&gt; There's definitely a lot of that,\nright.\n\n466\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.895\nSo even by the protocol\njust like we showed you,\n\n467\n00:24:53.895 --> 00:24:56.580\nwhere it can be an overwhelming\namount of information,\n\n468\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.500\njust like what we've\nbeen emphasizing here.\n\n469\n00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.140\nBut the fact is, more than likely we need\nit to one particular location instead.\n\n470\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:08.865\nSo here, we start off the same way\nwith TCP dump if I can spell it.\n\n471\n00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:11.319\nThen we're gonna do our options here and\n\n472\n00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:14.510\nI'm gonna tell to drop\nthe name resolution.\n\n473\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.510\nI still wanna see the sequence\nnumbers as well and\n\n474\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.220\nthen I can list a destination\nthe abbreviation for that is DST.\n\n475\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.415\nAnd now I need the IP address if\nI can remember one, two, four.\n\n476\n00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:32.376\n[CROSSTALK] 249.106 of ITProTV.\n\n477\n00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:36.276\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick on the course library.\n\n478\n00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:40.020\nHopefully generate a little\nbit more TCP traffic.\n\n479\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.580\nAnd then I'll click one more\nplace here on the plans and\n\n480\n00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.040\npricing just to add in a little bit.\n\n481\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.230\nSo that should be enough, and now you're\nstarting to see more traffic flow, but\n\n482\n00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.670\nthis time as we do so\nI can stop the traffic.\n\n483\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.260\nSo I didn't capture a lot, but notice\nit went down to about 23 packets, but\n\n484\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.950\nevery single one of them now is limited,\nand\n\n485\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.320\nnotice it adds in the port\nnumber at the end.\n\n486\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.150\nIt did'nt look like it, it looks like\na fifth octet is what it looks like here.\n\n487\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:09.841\n&gt;&gt; Like a socket or something.\n\n488\n00:26:09.841 --> 00:26:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's exactly what it's doing\nhere, is showing us that information.\n\n489\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.460\nSo now you're actually starting\nto see the information and\n\n490\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.330\nit's coming across this way.\n\n491\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.520\nSo, you can limit all the way\ndown to what you generally need.\n\n492\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.750\nI know that for me,\nall the way out to ITProTV's website.\n\n493\n00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.900\nI'm really only connecting by 443,\n\n494\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.360\nand I was able to show just about\neverything that we needed to show as well.\n\n495\n00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.127\nSo, doing that, being able to limit\nit down you can even do a particular\n\n496\n00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:40.756\nsource to a destination if you wanted.\n\n497\n00:26:40.756 --> 00:26:41.560\n&gt;&gt; To really define that well.\n\n498\n00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep, to really kind of limit it\ndown to the traffic in between.\n\n499\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.790\nBut it also means that you have\nto either be on that machine or\n\n500\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.750\nyou have to have some way\nof capturing the data\n\n501\n00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.240\nas it's flowing through that\nparticular device as well.\n\n502\n00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.500\nSo you might not run it on\nevery single desktop but\n\n503\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.000\nthere are ways you can do it\njust like with Wireshark.\n\n504\n00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.810\nYou can plug a hub into\nthe middle of that.\n\n505\n00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.933\nIf you had the ability you can do\nthe idea of some of the things that we're\n\n506\n00:27:07.933 --> 00:27:09.560\ntalking about with port mirroring.\n\n507\n00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.727\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There's name,\n\n508\n00:27:10.727 --> 00:27:13.350\nthere's different ways that\nall this stuff can be done.\n\n509\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.670\nBut just kind of realize that it does\nrequire a little bit of setup to do.\n\n510\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.140\nAnd once you learn a few of these commands\n\n511\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.810\nyou'll be able to kinda see what exactly\nyou're looking for, and spot that.\n\n512\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.130\nMake sure you pay attention\nto those sequence numbers.\n\n513\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.878\nI know it sounds a little bit strange,\nbut remember you can do this.\n\n514\n00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:31.934\nYou can take a look at the output\nas strange as it may look.\n\n515\n00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:37.740\nIt can really help you out to get that\npoint where you're going all right.\n\n516\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.960\nI know that there's\nsomething missing here, and\n\n517\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.670\nbe able to spot when there is bad traffic\ngoing on, even just as simple as this.\n\n518\n00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.607\nWireshark, big help, but\nhere you can get quicker and more direct.\n\n519\n00:27:49.607 --> 00:27:53.047\nAnd you really don't need a lot,\nyou really don't have to understand\n\n520\n00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:56.030\na lot about the product\nitself to get it working.\n\n521\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.200\nIt really as simple as just\nadding some command line tools.\n\n522\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.650\nYou'll gonna get a ton\nof analysis out of it.\n\n523\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's probably\ngonna be a big hurdle there.\n\n524\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.842\nJust memorizing and well even just\nunderstanding those syntax for\n\n525\n00:28:08.842 --> 00:28:10.315\nthis line face here for\n\n526\n00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:14.315\nour Linux systems if you're not, already\nfamiliar with the Linux environment.\n\n527\n00:28:14.315 --> 00:28:17.195\nBut thank you for showing us that\ninformation, because now we have another\n\n528\n00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.450\ntool that we can use to go ahead and\nidentify that traffic.\n\n529\n00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.568\nAnd thank you so much for tuning in\ntoday and watching this show with us.\n\n530\n00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:28.692\nBut stay tuned because we do have some\nmore Cisco Cyber Security headed your way.\n\n531\n00:28:28.692 --> 00:28:31.650\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this show.\n\n532\n00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.329\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n533\n00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:34.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n534\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.386\n&gt;&gt; See you next time right here ITPRO.TV.\n\n535\n00:28:36.386 --> 00:28:44.617\n[MUSIC]\n\n536\n00:28:44.617 --> 00:28:45.650\n&gt;&gt;

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.010\nWelcome to your Cisco Cyber Security\nfundamentals series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.530\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.070\nThis is actually a part II\nfrom a previous episode\n\n6\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.440\nwhere we were identifying data types.\n\n7\n00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.530\nWith us today in studio is we have\nMr Ronnie Wong to help us with this topic.\n\n8\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.850\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back on the\nshow as we continue on taking a look at\n\n10\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.500\nall this idea of identifying\ndifferent data types.\n\n11\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.230\nWe've really taken a look at\nusing something like tcpdump,\n\n12\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.190\nin previously another episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.740\nWe'll also use Wireshark to really help\nus to get a fairly descent picture\n\n14\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.360\nof different packets and\ndifferent information.\n\n15\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.170\nBut there's a lot more data for us to\nglean especially from different devices\n\n16\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.800\nthat we're gonna encounter as\ncyber security specialists.\n\n17\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.840\nAnd this time we need to be\nable to examine what some\n\n18\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.270\nof the data is that we normally\nget from these devices.\n\n19\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.510\nSo that we can identify them and\nbe able to say,\n\n20\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.770\nall right I know exactly where I need\nto go to get some of this information.\n\n21\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.418\nSo that is what we are going to take a\nlook at right here from the very beginning\n\n22\n00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:13.781\nto understand what it is that we're\nactually going to need to see, and\n\n23\n00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:16.631\nwhat things are actually for\nus inside of an advantage, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.990\nwe've got a lab set up to help us do that.\n\n25\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.910\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, let's go ahead and\nget started.\n\n26\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.840\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n27\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.620\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n28\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.830\nAnd I've actually connected into a very\ngood Cisco lab that gives me access\n\n29\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.460\nto multiple different devices, likely\ntypes of data that you'll encounter and\n\n30\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.250\nthat you'll also need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n31\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.430\nSo do pay attention here.\n\n32\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.080\nYou might not have access to this later on\nif you don't already have a Cisco account\n\n33\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.280\nthat you can use.\n\n34\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.290\nSo it means you do need to pay attention\nvery closely as we get through this.\n\n35\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.590\nSo on this machine,\nthis is just a workstation, and\n\n36\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.120\nI'm gonna infect this thing\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n37\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.250\nThere's a couple of different\nways to try and help us.\n\n38\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.070\nAnd we're gonna have\ndifferent devices come up and\n\n39\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.710\nshow us that it's monitoring information\nand we need to see how that is reported.\n\n40\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.350\nThat's pretty much the goal and\nthe idea of what we need.\n\n41\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, did I hear you say\nwe're gonna infect this machine?\n\n42\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.620\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna infect this machine.\n\n43\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.041\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're gonna do and\n\n44\n00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.647\nwe're gonna actually just use some\nsimple scripts that were written and\n\n45\n00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:11.471\nthat help us out here.\n\n46\n00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.792\nBut this should kind of at least show\nyou some of the information that we have\n\n47\n00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:15.850\navailable.\n\n48\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.338\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n49\n00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.969\nOkay, so let's say that here it is,\nsimple workstation and\n\n50\n00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.318\nthis is Bob's computer here.\n\n51\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:27.000\nAnd I've got email on Bob's computer and\nso I'm mimicking Bob of course.\n\n52\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.540\nAnd right now let's say that one\nof the first emails that comes in,\n\n53\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.650\nis something like this one.\n\n54\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.680\nThis particular email\nright here is looks like.\n\n55\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.982\nLook a got a trip to Vegas awaits me.\n\n56\n00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo,\n&gt;&gt; That looks great as I scroll down here,\n\n57\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.730\nit says for September and\neverything looks good, win a trip.\n\n58\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.160\nI should absolutely try and win this trip.\n\n59\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.800\nAnd then of course there is\nsomething like this that pops up and\n\n60\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.550\nthat looks pretty good.\n\n61\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.530\nIt says look MY for awards, MGM resorts.\n\n62\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.180\n&gt;&gt; Sign me up.\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n63\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.050\nYeah, sounds like a good idea.\n\n64\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800\nAs I hover over this though,\nI wanna kind of zoom in so\n\n65\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.040\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n66\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.924\nI'm going to scroll down over here\nto the lower left hand corner.\n\n67\n00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:08.575\nAs I hover over it,\nI don't know if you can see that or not,\n\n68\n00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:10.430\nCherokee in the lower left hand corner.\n\n69\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.285\nYou start to see something here,\nwhich it says,\n\n70\n00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:17.680\ninternetbadguys.com, is\nwhat it actually says.\n\n71\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.410\n&gt;&gt; And so you know that this is a phishing\nscam of all the things in the world.\n\n73\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.940\nThat we have available to us.\n\n74\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.120\nThis one right here is a phishing scam.\n\n75\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.470\nNow this computer is connected\nout to the internet, so\n\n76\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.840\nof course it would be a bad idea for\nme just to click that link.\n\n77\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.540\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n\n78\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.750\n&gt;&gt; And I did it.\n\n79\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.500\nI clicked that link and there we go.\n\n80\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.167\nBut notice that because I'm actually\nbehind the system that has already been\n\n81\n00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:47.399\nprotecting me, I can see right away\nthat right here on this individual\n\n82\n00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:52.050\nmachine has been covered by something\nthat we call Cisco umbrella.\n\n83\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.140\nAnd it already noticed that this was some\ntype of phishing threat that happened.\n\n84\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.695\nSo if I actually have sent\nthis user out in the world and\n\n85\n00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:03.230\nhe wasn't connected to the VPN even.\n\n86\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.690\nBut he'd already been a part of\nthe system, it still blocks and\n\n87\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.940\nprotects that system, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.460\nSo it does tend to work\nin a way in that sense.\n\n89\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.110\nNow, sometimes though,\n\n90\n00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.610\nwe always warn people of course\nnot to anything like this.\n\n91\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.094\nYou don't wanna click on\nsomething like that to do that.\n\n92\n00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n93\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.570\nBut we also tell them don't\nconnect through the internet hotel\n\n94\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.960\nconnection without going through the VPN.\n\n95\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.860\nSo, I can connect here using\nthe AnyConnect which is essentially\n\n96\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.980\nmy VPN client.\n\n97\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.370\nMake sure I run that connection.\n\n98\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.189\nAnd establish a connection\nback into my home network.\n\n99\n00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:48.539\nAnd now once I am connected in,\nthen we could browse out to the internet,\n\n100\n00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.190\nwe can get our email, we can do all that,\nI've already downloaded the email for\n\n101\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.408\nus that we're gonna use.\n\n102\n00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:56.297\nBut let's say that it just\ncame in like this, so\n\n103\n00:04:56.297 --> 00:05:00.927\ninstead of it being already on the\ncomputer, I wouldn't have connected and\n\n104\n00:05:00.927 --> 00:05:04.400\nI downloaded this email for\nus and then I run it again.\n\n105\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.226\nWell, the great thing is regardless\nof whether inside or outside,\n\n106\n00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:13.002\nif this particular system had already\nbeen connected before, it doesn't matter.\n\n107\n00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:16.406\nYou'll actually end up seeing here\nwhere it says, look, it was gonna go to\n\n108\n00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:20.150\nthe internetbadguys but notice this time,\nit says, hey, it's blocked again.\n\n109\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.440\nSo either way, connected or disconnected.\n\n110\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.470\nIf you have a product like the Cisco\nUmbrella which is kinda over all threat\n\n111\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.085\ndetection and everything that system that\nremoving to, that's what you'll end up\n\n112\n00:05:32.085 --> 00:05:35.950\nwith and you'll be ale to see\ninformation we'll come across.\n\n113\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.780\nAt least for the end user he'll\nget a warning in that way.\n\n114\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.900\nBut for me, if I'm administrating this,\nI'd go to my machine and\n\n115\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.850\ninside of my machine I would connect\nin what's called that Cisco FMC\n\n116\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.900\nwhich is the Fire Power Management Center\nand I would log right in.\n\n117\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.890\nAnd inside,\nlet me see if I can proceed here.\n\n118\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.320\nI, of course, had already logged in, and\n\n119\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.100\nnow it's actually telling\nme I need to log in again.\n\n120\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.672\nI had already seen this.\n\n121\n00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:06.790\nSo at this point,\nif I can actually get logged back in here,\n\n122\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.120\nyou'll notice it gives\nus a ton of information.\n\n123\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.160\nNow this product is so\n\n124\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.710\nbig that we're not gonna do it justice\nif we're trying to show you everything.\n\n125\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.470\nBut we do have another Cisco\ncourse that's available,\n\n126\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.935\nI think actually hosted by Todd Lammle and\nDon Pezet.\n\n127\n00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:25.340\nSo it's a great course right there\njust because of those two names.\n\n128\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.150\nBut the very fact is you can\nsee a lot of information.\n\n129\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.910\nBut the nice thing about this,\nis it's so well-rounded.\n\n130\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.650\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n131\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.570\nIf I've suspected something\nlike that's been happening,\n\n132\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.630\nI can go to the analysis\ntab which is right here.\n\n133\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.560\nOops.\nAt least I think I can.\n\n134\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.900\nAnd then once the analysis\ntab loads up for\n\n135\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.140\na moment, I can go over here to Users and\nselect User Activity.\n\n136\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo it actually not only tracks\nthe idea of an individual connection,\n\n137\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.730\nbut it can even track an individual\nuser is what we can see here.\n\n138\n00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.520\n&gt;&gt; And not just locally.\n\n139\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.840\nAs you showed us, it was a VPN connection\nas well, so that's pretty cool.\n\n140\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n141\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.680\nSo here you can see where the way that it\nworks is that we're assigned this idea of\n\n142\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.600\na security group tag, and\nthen put it in the right group.\n\n143\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.410\nAnd now we can see the information.\n\n144\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.190\nIt actually knows exactly\nwho's connecting in as well as\n\n145\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.830\nthe IP address of the different\ndevices that are connecting in to.\n\n146\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.780\nSo we can spot just a lot of information\nby using some system like this to help us\n\n147\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.130\nout just at the very beginning to make\nsure that we have everything that we need.\n\n148\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.341\nThe other thing that I may want to\ntake a look at as well, of course,\n\n149\n00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:40.948\nis gonna be underneath Connections and\nSecurity Intelligence events.\n\n150\n00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:45.750\nSo let's see if I can get to that.\n\n151\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.917\nAnd in\nthe Security Intelligence Events here,\n\n152\n00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.471\nlet's see,\nit hasn't actually reported in yet.\n\n153\n00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.046\nSo hopefully in a few moments here, we\nmay end up seeing where it actually does\n\n154\n00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:56.028\nreport that something has happened here.\n\n155\n00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:58.360\nThat it was able to\ndetect a phishing scam.\n\n156\n00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.705\nBut if it doesn't, there's no big deal\nbecause it might just take a moment for\n\n157\n00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:03.023\neverything to get updated, or\n\n158\n00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:06.390\nI've cleared out the records at\nsome point that I shouldn't have.\n\n159\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.430\nBut just kind of realize that you'll\nalso see information like this if it\n\n160\n00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.140\ndoes relate to a security event,\njust like what we were showing you.\n\n161\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.760\nSo it's very possible to just\nget some good information\n\n162\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.120\nby simply doing something like this.\n\n163\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.970\nOkay?\n\n164\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.524\nNow the other thing of course, that can\nhappen then for a regular end user is\n\n165\n00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:28.643\nthat not only are they fooled by\nan attack like something like this,\n\n166\n00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:30.181\nwhich is fairly common.\n\n167\n00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:33.185\nWhere it is a phishing scam,\nthere are other things and\n\n168\n00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:35.745\nit's all due to social engineering, right?\n\n169\n00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:38.955\nSo this is social engineering attempt,\nphishing but\n\n170\n00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:41.145\nhere is one that's really common.\n\n171\n00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:45.245\nHere it is somebody requested a new\npassword for your Facebook account.\n\n172\n00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:49.575\nSo it's says, hey Bob you should\nactually change your password or\n\n173\n00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:51.738\nyou can do this right here.\n\n174\n00:08:51.738 --> 00:08:54.290\nAnd I hover that changed password,\n\n175\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.620\nsee if I can scroll down a little bit and\nhover it.\n\n176\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.100\nNotice in the left hand corner again, I\ndon't get Facebook dot com with something.\n\n177\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.630\nI should just get an IP address which\nshould lead to something a little bit\n\n178\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.530\nstrange telling me it is not a good thing.\n\n179\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.343\nNot every end user knows that, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:10.343 --> 00:09:12.720\nSo if every end user doesn't know that.\n\n181\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.080\nIf I go ahead and\nclick change the password,\n\n182\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.750\nI may think at this point here\nthat's gonna lead me to Facebook.\n\n183\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.705\n&gt;&gt; A legitimate website yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:24.801\n&gt;&gt; It should lead me to Facebook to\nallow me to change the password but\n\n185\n00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.690\nnotice it's taking me a long time.\n\n186\n00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.030\nNow it could be that it's\nredirecting me somewhere.\n\n187\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.420\nI don't really know.\n\n188\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.950\nExactly what's happening here, because the\nattacker doesn't tell me what's going on.\n\n189\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.620\nBut at this point, look at MS.\n\n190\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.150\nIt's just going and\nit's going and it's going, but\n\n191\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.090\nit's eventually going to time out for\nus is what's gonna end up happening.\n\n192\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.763\nAnd this is by design, and\n\n193\n00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:50.644\npart of that system that we definitely\nneed to examine from this point here.\n\n194\n00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:54.936\nWhich is to take a look at\nthe idea of using the WSA,\n\n195\n00:09:54.936 --> 00:10:01.750\nthe web security portal, what we have\navailable through Cisco as well.\n\n196\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.800\nSo it did try to lead me somewhere, but\n\n197\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.150\nit didn't take me where it\nwas expecting me to go.\n\n198\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.925\nI have now made this connection so we need\nto take a look at that information too.\n\n199\n00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:14.035\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n&gt;&gt; If I go back into the management\n\n200\n00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:17.958\nconsole and this time I can see it\nfrom a couple of different instances.\n\n201\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.568\nI'm gonna select the Cisco content\nsecurity manager instead and\n\n202\n00:10:22.568 --> 00:10:24.420\nthen I'm going to log in.\n\n203\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.990\nOnce I log in, this is a single\nmanagement interface for the WSA, for\n\n204\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.830\nour Web Security Appliance, and for the\nESA, our Email Security Appliance as well.\n\n205\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.180\nAll I have to do is come\nhere to where it says Web.\n\n206\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.045\nAnd inside of Web of course there's\nsummary information that you can\n\n207\n00:10:47.045 --> 00:10:50.545\ntake a look at, but we're not so worried\nabout a lot of the summary information.\n\n208\n00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:54.395\nIt's information that you expect\nto find such as proxy summaries,\n\n209\n00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:56.605\ntraffic monitors, you name it.\n\n210\n00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:59.925\nThese are things that may be\nof some significance to us but\n\n211\n00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.425\nthey're summary events.\n\n212\n00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:06.115\nWhat I want though,\nis under reporting, and web tracking.\n\n213\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.160\nSo I select reporting and web tracking\nit gives me of course the ability to\n\n214\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.110\nfilter all the traffic that's\nbeen connecting to the web.\n\n215\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.425\nAnd I have the ability to filter down\nby the time, or an IP address or\n\n216\n00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:25.805\na user, a particular website if I want to,\nand any transactions.\n\n217\n00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:31.075\nLet's say that Bob's particular\nuser name is called manager, and\n\n218\n00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.015\nthen I click search.\n\n219\n00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:37.836\nAnd in a moment we'll actually see all\nof the actual web connections that\n\n220\n00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:39.733\nthe manager has been involved in.\n\n221\n00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:46.440\nSo let's scroll down here,\ni should now be able to see.\n\n222\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.370\nHere's every connection that the manager\nhas also been involved in right here too.\n\n223\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.440\nSo in this instant here, you can see date,\nyou can see connections,\n\n224\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.660\nyou can see anything that goes across.\n\n225\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.260\nAnd this is important for you, right?\n\n226\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.830\nYou still have that email.\n\n227\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.100\nYou can track it down to that one\nparticular email address that it\n\n228\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.700\nwas showing.\n\n229\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.626\nAnd then hopefully of course continue\nto follow it through there and\n\n230\n00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:13.169\nyou can actually see that this particular\ncomputer has been updating like crazy.\n\n231\n00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:18.381\nBut that's some other information that you\ncan see so in a very neat instance here,\n\n232\n00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:22.940\nyou can actually find something\nlike that out very quickly.\n\n233\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.730\n&gt;&gt; So running once I am able to look at\nthis information what can I do with it?\n\n234\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.980\nCan I take that IP address and\nmaybe my mail server go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.439\nblock that kind of communication or\njust my firewall settings.\n\n236\n00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:37.290\nOr do I need to contact Cisco and and\nhelp how to do this or what next?\n\n237\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Yah, that's all due to the idea once\nyou get the idea you do need to act on.\n\n238\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.554\nBut at this point we need to be able\nto at least be able to see what we're\n\n239\n00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:45.790\nlooking for.\n\n240\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.139\nSo understanding the correlation\nbetween getting something like this,\n\n241\n00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:51.198\nand somebody saying,\nyeah I got this email.\n\n242\n00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:55.758\nAnd you tell them don't delete it, but\nthen you examine it and you hover over it,\n\n243\n00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:59.080\nand you look for\nthe IP address that shows up here.\n\n244\n00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.240\nYou go back and you find it and\n\n245\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.470\nthen yes you spark some type of action\nin the intrusion prevention system\n\n246\n00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.030\nthat's available to you to do some\ntype of response at that point.\n\n247\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.910\nSo regardless of which one it is that's\nwhat you'll end up seeing as you start to\n\n248\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.060\ncontinue on and\nsee some of the information.\n\n249\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.240\nSo of course there are other\nthings that can happen.\n\n250\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.535\nLet's say that, one after the other,\nthis particular types of attacks.\n\n251\n00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.035\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're just really unlucky.\n\n252\n00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:26.147\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; They are all email.\nYeah,but it does happen, right.\n\n253\n00:13:26.147 --> 00:13:27.007\nSo all these don't look,\n\n254\n00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:29.624\nthey're not outrageous.\nThey're not something you go, no,\n\n255\n00:13:29.624 --> 00:13:30.644\nthese looks.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n256\n00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Too fake.\n\n257\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.475\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, yeah.\nToo fake.\n\n258\n00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:35.905\nLook, even the Apple logo.\n\n259\n00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:39.745\nWho doesn't trust the Apple logo\nright there, and you're ready to go.\n\n260\n00:13:40.815 --> 00:13:44.622\nSo here, it says there's an account\nupdate tool that's available.\n\n261\n00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:45.595\n&gt;&gt; How convenient.\n\n262\n00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:46.705\n&gt;&gt; How convenient.\n\n263\n00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:49.790\nOf course,\nI'm gonna click on that then when you do,\n\n264\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.958\nyou should end up seeing\nthere's a message like this.\n\n265\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.741\nThat says hey, I couldn't save that\nbecause the source file could not be read\n\n266\n00:13:57.741 --> 00:13:59.667\nas what does actually saying.\n\n267\n00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:02.250\nNow it might be what is that all about?\n\n268\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.050\nAnd again as part of this goes protection.\n\n269\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.100\nWhen it read the email it said, whoa,\nwait a minute, there's something in here.\n\n270\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.845\nThey really don't like I can\nactually see the source file.\n\n271\n00:14:11.845 --> 00:14:13.990\nSo something else going on.\n\n272\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.570\nAnd I take a look at this name right here.\n\n273\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:23.340\nThat doesn't look like any name but I know\nlower case hos cpital YBE, you name it.\n\n274\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.458\nThere's a lot of fishy information\njust in the notification.\n\n275\n00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:27.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not even connective.\n\n276\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not even close to anything\nthat I would ever think about downloading.\n\n277\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.440\nBut at this point, right If it were\nanybody else they might go well\n\n278\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.280\nwhat's the harm let me go ahead and\ndownload it.\n\n279\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.323\nWell you know what the harm is it could\nbe running something a little bit more\n\n280\n00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:42.062\nthan we realize.\n\n281\n00:14:42.062 --> 00:14:43.580\n&gt;&gt; Sinister.\n\n282\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.430\n&gt;&gt; But the great thing is it normally\nappears right over where you see\n\n283\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.970\nthe download button, download box there\nbut if I click OK, both of them disappear.\n\n284\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.890\nAnd that is done by default.\n\n285\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:59.170\nIt knows that it can track the information\nthat it needs by just doing that.\n\n286\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.700\nSo all these things that we're talking\nabout, that we're looking at, right?\n\n287\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.557\nThese are actually things that\nthe different environments and\n\n288\n00:15:06.557 --> 00:15:10.049\nthe different types of intrusion\nprevention systems and\n\n289\n00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:13.772\ndefense systems that we have\nare actually holding in place.\n\n290\n00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:18.640\nAnd keeping the bad guys from getting\nany further than this particular email.\n\n291\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.220\nOkay, now let me go and click on\nback on my administration machine.\n\n292\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.550\nAnd then select the email\nappliance this time.\n\n293\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.310\nAnd same thing here with\nthe email appliance.\n\n294\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.310\nOnce we have this we can\ngo to message tracking.\n\n295\n00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.010\nAnd select that idea of\nemail tracking there.\n\n296\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.380\nIn a moment it should give the same thing,\n\n297\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.720\nwhere I get a box of saying\nwho's email are we tracking.\n\n298\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.759\nSo notice it didn't only just\ntake a look at a single email.\n\n299\n00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:51.369\nAnd now when I start realizing\nthat the manager has had\n\n300\n00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:54.864\na lot of different fishy looking email.\n\n301\n00:15:54.864 --> 00:15:55.854\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What is this link doing?\n\n302\n00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhat in the world is going on here.\n\n303\n00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.409\nBut I can go back through and\nI can start scanning for\n\n304\n00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:03.570\nevery message that has\ngone to the manager.\n\n305\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.160\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n306\n00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.220\n&gt;&gt; And then you can start taking a look,\n\n307\n00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.680\nthat there may be some\ninformation in here.\n\n308\n00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.540\nSo let's say the one that we were taking\na look at was this support one here.\n\n309\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.210\nI can click on show details,\nand I can scroll down, and\n\n310\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:21.240\nI can start seeing a couple of different\nthings here that may be available.\n\n311\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.020\nAnd if this one actually had some type\nof infection, but this one says hey,\n\n312\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.275\nit was scanned by a virus malware,\nand is clean so let's find for\n\n313\n00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:32.350\nits delivery and whatever it did.\n\n314\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.880\nNow, the reason why is because what it'd\ndo is it found it and it went ahead and\n\n315\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.220\njust stopped it from\ngetting on to the machine.\n\n316\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.240\nBut you start seeing that there's\na bunch of different information.\n\n317\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.330\nAnd the more that we go into this,\nwe might end up finding the very\n\n318\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.540\nfact that there is some malicious mail\nout there that we can then go all right,\n\n319\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.330\nwe know that something else is\nhappening in any of these and\n\n320\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.240\nthat's the same thing with the rest\nof what we're talking about here\n\n321\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.580\nis that you actually are able to see more\nand more of these types of attacks go on.\n\n322\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.000\nAnd there are systems here.\n\n323\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.930\nSo notice that it showed me every email,\nand even the details.\n\n324\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:05.710\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n325\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.180\nyou might be able to also see where\nthey have been previously infected.\n\n326\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.460\nLet me see if I can find out here.\n\n327\n00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.870\nI believe there is one as well.\n\n328\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Ronnie, what was the name\nof this security solution?\n\n329\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.040\nI know you had mentioned [CROSSTALK].\n\n330\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the ESA, which would be\n\n331\n00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:24.360\nthe Email Security Appliance\n&gt;&gt; Thank you\n\n332\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.150\n&gt;&gt; Is what this one would be and\n\n333\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.820\nhere is one that I did spot and let me see\nlike I zoom in, you can see there it is,\n\n334\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.650\nthe term is malicious at this point.\n\n335\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.100\nSo all of this if you start having more\nand more pattern like this, then you start\n\n336\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.340\nto realize there is more that needs to be\ndone here as far as email solutions go.\n\n337\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.790\nSo it is a lot of information for\nus when we start to take a look.\n\n338\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.370\nAnd all of this of course works together\nin a combination of multiple events\n\n339\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.220\nthat we have in place.\n\n340\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.220\nNow, I didn't do the last one yet\n\n341\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.850\nbecause last one takes a little bit of set\nup which we have to be able to do right\n\n342\n00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.720\nhere live time as we do it and the reason\nwhy is because we're actually going to\n\n343\n00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.800\ninfect our machine with a zero day virus-\n&gt;&gt; Fun\n\n344\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're doing, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.650\nYeah, that's actually something\nwe;re going to take a look a and\n\n346\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.950\nsee if we can do it.\n\n347\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.530\nSo, the great thing is for\nus to do this, right?\n\n348\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.430\nI need to go ahead and\nlauch this zero-day phishing email here.\n\n349\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.180\nAnd once it's doing that,\nit's actually generating one.\n\n350\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.410\nSo remember that the idea\nof all these attacks,\n\n351\n00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.010\nit really bases itself off of hash values.\n\n352\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.600\nAnd this one is generating a fresh hash\nvalue that should not have existed before.\n\n353\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.080\nAnd once we get that started, I should be\nable all go to the work station over here.\n\n354\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.310\nAnd close the tabs right now.\n\n355\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:50.060\nClose out of this email and\nlet me go and send a new email.\n\n356\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.670\nSo, there's one that was previously run,\nhere's is new one and\n\n357\n00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.480\nso note is urgent this caps so the\noriginal message right sent from Apple.\n\n358\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.030\nImportant information\nleft in your account.\n\n359\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.540\nNobody bit.\n\n360\n00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.630\nIn other words,\nthe system did not, it caught it.\n\n361\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.370\nIt said, I'm not even going to worry\nabout doing anything like this.\n\n362\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.680\nNow it's saying, action required,\naction required here.\n\n363\n00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.550\n&gt;&gt; All caps.\n\n364\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.180\n&gt;&gt; All caps.\n\n365\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.800\nThat makes it even more important,\nof course.\n\n366\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.820\nThis one tells you now, hey,\nsomething has happened here.\n\n367\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.550\nYour credit card breached\nsomething like that.\n\n368\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.232\nSo you, of course, want to download that.\n\n369\n00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:27.828\nAnd as you start to take a look this\ntime though, notice this one is a little\n\n370\n00:19:27.828 --> 00:19:31.706\nbit even more kind of upfront about-\n&gt;&gt; It's in half the planet.\n\n371\n00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Dot VM.\n\n372\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.370\nSo you know that something is\na little bit more fishy on this one.\n\n373\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.396\nWe'll click on the update tool [SOUND] and\n\n374\n00:19:41.396 --> 00:19:45.053\nthis time notice that I\ndidn't get the warning.\n\n375\n00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:50.580\nSo it was Cisco that said I\ndon't even recognize this.\n\n376\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.660\nWhy?\nBecause it's brand new.\n\n377\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.220\nI just generated it on the other machine.\n\n378\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.690\n&gt;&gt; Hence, the term zero day attack.\n\n379\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, zero day attack.\n\n380\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.430\nIt's not recognizing it.\n\n381\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.340\nThere's no hash value that matches this\nthing that means I can save the file.\n\n382\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.144\nAnd now, I've just saved that particular\nhack right on my machine here.\n\n383\n00:20:09.144 --> 00:20:13.919\nAnd in that machine, let me make sure\nI close out the right thing here.\n\n384\n00:20:17.974 --> 00:20:18.773\nMinimize it.\n[NOISE] How many\n\n385\n00:20:18.773 --> 00:20:20.339\ntimes I opened this thing up?\n\n386\n00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:22.510\nAll right.\n\n387\n00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.040\nI saved it right here.\n\n388\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.560\nAnd there is of course my download file.\n\n389\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.770\nWhat does any regular user would\ndo once they realize that?\n\n390\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.100\nMy credit card information\nhas been hacked, so I run it\n\n391\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:40.880\nI have now just infected this machine with\na Zero-Day virus, is what I've done here.\n\n392\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.420\nNow, once I do something like this, this\nparticular virus is a little bit unusual.\n\n393\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:53.700\nIf I go right click on the Task Manager,\nand bring that up I can see this running.\n\n394\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.440\nAll right,\nhere it's not doing anything but\n\n395\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.030\nit is doing something at the same time.\n\n396\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.990\nIt is listening for\na connection to be made.\n\n397\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.430\nSo this is going to open\nup an opportunity for\n\n398\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:12.410\nit to connect back to whoever\noriginated the actual file here.\n\n399\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:17.160\nAnd that will then give somebody access to\nhis system which may then be a launchpad\n\n400\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.450\nto get access to everything else\ninside of my network as well.\n\n401\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.340\nSo, here on this profile and\neverything else that comes in, well,\n\n402\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.870\nit's just waiting for that connection.\n\n403\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.040\nSo, let's make the connection happen.\n\n404\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.250\nNow, this is going to take just\na little bit of time here.\n\n405\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.990\nSo we'll talk everything that\nwe've done up in this point.\n\n406\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.370\nI'm gonna launch the Exploit.\n\n407\n00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.610\nIt says hey, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n408\n00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.350\nSo now,\nit's actually taking the time to generate\n\n409\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.300\nsomething like it's actually\nan active connection.\n\n410\n00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.810\nBut it can take up to a minute to do so.\n\n411\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.160\nAnd we're just gotta\nkind of let it run here.\n\n412\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So in the background, right,\n\n413\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.440\nlet's make sure that we've kind of\nunderstood everything that we've seen\n\n414\n00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.430\nso far.\n\n415\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.620\nAnd that way hopefully it'll pass\nthe time as we start seeing this, and\n\n416\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.570\nit'll generate here in a moment, okay.\n\n417\n00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.420\nSo in the very beginning, right,\nwe took a look at the very fact\n\n418\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.760\nthat we could click on a link which\nis just a regular phishing scam.\n\n419\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.950\nAnd we can see that just by default,\nright, Cisco says I can stop this.\n\n420\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.030\nThis is no big deal whether we're\nconnected through the VPN or\n\n421\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.430\nwhether we're not.\n\n422\n00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.970\nIf I happen to connect back in that\nnetwork and download the rest of my emails\n\n423\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.150\nand there is some type of infection there,\nwhether from clicking on a link and\n\n424\n00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.970\ntrying to go somewhere else or\nwhether it's not working, I actually have\n\n425\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.030\nprotection all set up, everything is\nactually doing everything that we need.\n\n426\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.310\nSo all those systems are set up but\n\n427\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.870\nthen we're able to go into each one of\nthose monitoring systems to see that we\n\n428\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:45.380\ndon't only have to worry about spotting\nthat one, we actually can spot everything.\n\n429\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.080\nSo, it gives us that ability of what\nwe call that full-content discovery.\n\n430\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.890\nAnd this is an important part of\nunderstanding cybersecurity, right?\n\n431\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.320\nIs that not only do we need to know every\nmachine that we're going to be protecting,\n\n432\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.820\nnot only do we need to know about\nevery application that is running but\n\n433\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.920\nwe need to know about all the data that\nwe possibly can be able to spot and\n\n434\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.770\nsee in our networks,that way we can\nactually be able to do something about it.\n\n435\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.070\nAnd that's a part of\neverything that we have but\n\n436\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.690\none of the things that we can\nprotect ourselves very easily.\n\n437\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.730\nWithout a system like this,\nit's zero day attacks.\n\n438\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.760\nZero day attacks are designed to\nbe before anything can spot it,\n\n439\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.600\nand there's no database for it.\n\n440\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.180\nSo it's right here, and let's tell you,\nI'll show what it actually says here.\n\n441\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.980\nThe attacker took over Bogs machine,\nattempted to pivot off of it\n\n442\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.010\nby launching an exploit against a web\nserver inside the corporate network.\n\n443\n00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.256\nAt this point,\nBogg's machine has been quarantined,\n\n444\n00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:43.985\nkick off the corporate network\nVPN by the threat containment and\n\n445\n00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:48.542\nthere's something that is called the treat\ngrid and was able to do analysis and\n\n446\n00:23:48.542 --> 00:23:51.533\nevaluate it and\nkick us off the corporate network.\n\n447\n00:23:51.533 --> 00:23:53.372\nSo what does that mean?\n\n448\n00:23:53.372 --> 00:23:55.694\nIt means it disconnected\nthe VPN right away and so no,\n\n449\n00:23:55.694 --> 00:23:57.816\nyou're not actually doing\nanything like this.\n\n450\n00:23:57.816 --> 00:24:00.274\nWe're not gonna allow\nanything like that to happen.\n\n451\n00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:03.294\nSo now it's disconnected but\nat the same time,\n\n452\n00:24:03.294 --> 00:24:07.070\nit's taken this machine that\nwe connect that in to the VPN,\n\n453\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.040\nit's quarantined it and\nit's changed the security attack.\n\n454\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.430\nSo let me see if I can do that here.\n\n455\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.300\nSo now you actually see right here on\nthis system it disconnected the VPN.\n\n456\n00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.490\nLet me go ahead and click connect here,\nand we'll connect back in and\n\n457\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.955\nmake sure that we can get access in here.\n\n458\n00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:36.940\nAnd once I get access back in now\nI'm connected to the network,\n\n459\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.894\nnotice the is still running,\nso it means I am connected and\n\n460\n00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:46.770\nI have an active zero day\nthreat going on right now.\n\n461\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.120\nAnd everything is kind of,\nokay are we really going to do this?\n\n462\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.240\nYes, we are really going to do this.\n\n463\n00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.800\nLet's take a look at how the actual system\n\n464\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.080\nhas responded t this point\nonce we get this here, okay.\n\n465\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.800\nSo I go back to\nthe administration machine.\n\n466\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.290\nBringing up back my\nCisco Firepower Management.\n\n467\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.280\nThere's a couple of things\nwe can take a look at.\n\n468\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.730\nI can go to Files and select File Events\nbecause this was a file that was run.\n\n469\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.720\nI can spot files that were\nrun on the computer that I'm\n\n470\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.520\npart of the management console too.\n\n471\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.000\nSo it gives me that ability to do so.\n\n472\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.980\nAnd right here you can see,\nnow here's the one I did earlier.\n\n473\n00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.980\nAnd I was able to block\nthe malware cuz it identified it.\n\n474\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.860\nBut notice this one.\n\n475\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.670\nIt says disposition unknown.\n\n476\n00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.740\nAnd it has to make a lookup\nback to the threat grid here\n\n477\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.400\nto be able to identify that.\n\n478\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.821\nIf I click on the table view We can see so\nit actually says look,\n\n479\n00:25:42.821 --> 00:25:47.098\nI think something has happened and\nnow you can see a little bit more.\n\n480\n00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:50.528\nSo right now it says it needs to\ndo this threat grid evaluation,\n\n481\n00:25:50.528 --> 00:25:54.669\nwhich may take longer time than we have,\nbut you can see where it says, hey,\n\n482\n00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:58.652\nthe sending country is from China but\nlets take a look at my receiving IP.\n\n483\n00:25:58.652 --> 00:26:04.450\nAnd If I click on that little computer,\nI can now see, at\n\n484\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.710\nleast here in a moment, that there it is,\nthere's a couple of different events.\n\n485\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.530\nIt says,\nSecurity Intelligence Event right here.\n\n486\n00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.990\nA command and control connection was made.\n\n487\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.484\nSo it says that, The host itself\nmaybe under remote control.\n\n488\n00:26:22.484 --> 00:26:27.350\nThe impact, the host was attacked and\npotentially vulnerable.\n\n489\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.940\nSo it really did bring on\na couple of different situations\n\n490\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.650\nas you start to see everything going on.\n\n491\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:39.750\nSo you can really see so\nmuch as you start to look through here.\n\n492\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.650\nAnd see so much more information\nif I go to Captured Files.\n\n493\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.390\nI'll see if this one shows up, as well.\n\n494\n00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.320\nAnd notice right here,\nthis one it says very high.\n\n495\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.470\nI go to table view of\nthe capture file which give us\n\n496\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.730\na more expanded view of\nthe information that we see.\n\n497\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.090\nI can now take a look at the very last\none which is this one at the top,\n\n498\n00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.780\nwhich has not yet been disposed of.\n\n499\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.610\nIf I scroll over to the right,\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n500\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.440\nis where it says, Analysis Complete.\n\n501\n00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.380\nIf I don't have that analysis complete\nthen I can't do anything, but\n\n502\n00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.440\nthen I can go to where it says,\nVery High Under Threat Score and\n\n503\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.560\nthen we can take a look at\nthe Dynamic Analysis here.\n\n504\n00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.210\nAnd now you can see that here's the report\nand here's the processes that it run.\n\n505\n00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n506\n00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.910\n&gt;&gt; And everything else in between.\n\n507\n00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.120\n&gt;&gt; At this point in time, you might wanna\nhave a little bit of retraining for Bob.\n\n508\n00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] there's no doubt.\n\n509\n00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.140\nNow this is where you go into\nthe remediation stage, okay?\n\n510\n00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.360\nThe good thing is, this machine has\nnow been quarantined on it's own.\n\n511\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.800\nIts connection, even though you think hey,\nit's connected in.\n\n512\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.060\nIt can do anything that it wants to.\n\n513\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.160\nIf I go back to the workstation and\n\n514\n00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.710\nI launch a browser,\nnotice what it brought me to, okay?\n\n515\n00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.920\nSo it doesn't even give a chance for\nhim to go anywhere else.\n\n516\n00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.954\nIt says nope, until you get remediated,\nwe're not even letting you get through.\n\n517\n00:28:05.954 --> 00:28:09.674\nOnce you take the steps to remediate,\nthen it gives you that ability but\n\n518\n00:28:09.674 --> 00:28:13.270\nthat's a lot of data that you can take\na look at by using something like\n\n519\n00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.502\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Console,\n\n520\n00:28:15.502 --> 00:28:18.850\nas well as some of those other\ndevices that we have in place.\n\n521\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.850\nBut you do need to know where\nto go to find that information.\n\n522\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.610\nSo make sure you watch this\nparticular episode again, and\n\n523\n00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.190\nif you have access to\nit make sure you go and\n\n524\n00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.840\ninvestigate, and know where you're\ngonna find some of that information.\n\n525\n00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie that was a pretty\ncool tool that we have available,\n\n526\n00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.030\nif you do have that available for you.\n\n527\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.660\nIf not, in the previous episode\nwe saw another option for you.\n\n528\n00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.580\nBut

00:00:11.768\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:15.207\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.120\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.370\nIf you've been following along you'll\nknow that this is actually a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.750\nWe meet it all the way to\na part three at looking and\n\n8\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050\nidentifying different types of data.\n\n9\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.540\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.000\nThank for being with us today Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback as we continue on taking and\n\n12\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.530\nlook at the idea of different data types.\n\n13\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.700\nIt's very important that we do start\nto understand that Cyber security\n\n14\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.370\ndoes have fundamental of course grounding,\n\n15\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.640\nright in analysis in taking\nlook at the different data.\n\n16\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.690\nAnd what we're gonna take a look today\nof course is just going over net or\n\n17\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.280\nlocal net flow again.\n\n18\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.730\nI just wanna make sure\nI said that right for\n\n19\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.230\nsome reason that was not coming\nout from my head correctly.\n\n20\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.370\nSo we wanna take a look at\nof course is net flow data.\n\n21\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.740\nWe start talking about the idea\nof using net flow data.\n\n22\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.478\nWhat we're trying to do is\nunderstand the flow of the data.\n\n23\n00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:11.970\nNo, how does that different from just\nregular packets of data that come in?\n\n24\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.220\nWell, it's really not a lot different\nfrom the packets that come in except for\n\n25\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.760\nthe fact that flow can indicate that\nthe connection has been made and\n\n26\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.586\nthat there are all kind\nof grouped together.\n\n27\n00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:26.280\nSo in other words, we can see the grouping\nof packets that really belong together,\n\n28\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.020\nand the reason why stuff\nlike this is important,\n\n29\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.950\nis because it reveals several things\nthat are really helpful for analysis.\n\n30\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.950\nFor example, with net flow data,\n\n31\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.890\nwe can take a look at identifying traffic\ntypes of bottlenecks that can happen.\n\n32\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.270\nIn other words,\nwhat is causing the bottleneck?\n\n33\n00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.380\nIt's not the fact that I'm\nsending out an email or two.\n\n34\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.520\nBut it may be the fact that Cherokee's\nsitting at her desk streaming Netflix.\n\n35\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.210\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n36\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.980\nAnd watching her entire series of\nwhatever she's choosing to watch\n\n37\n00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.570\nhour after hour after hour.\n\n38\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.680\nWe might be able to find that.\n\n39\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.010\nAnd we find that through using\nsomething like the flow data, right?\n\n40\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.170\nSo it can help us to do that.\n\n41\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.430\nWe can also find out what\nparticular applications\n\n42\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.370\nare also causing the flow happen as well.\n\n43\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.710\nSo we can take a look and\nbe able to say, hey,\n\n44\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.060\nthis application is constantly\nmaking that particular connection.\n\n45\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.900\nAnd all that traffic seems to belong\nto that one application that could\n\n46\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.060\neither indicate bad coding of some sort or\nmalicious coding or it could indicate\n\n47\n00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.180\nsomething else that may be going on with\nthat one particular type of program.\n\n48\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.510\nWe can also identify what usage\nof the bandwidth that we have.\n\n49\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.810\nSo for example again,\nif we go back to the Netflix idea right?\n\n50\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.670\nIt might not just be that one series but\n\n51\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.380\nit may be how much of our band\nwidth does it consuming as well.\n\n52\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.925\nSo, it helps us to be able to\nidentify all of that as well.\n\n53\n00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.960\nWe'll track number of packets\nthat will go across a connection\n\n54\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.150\nas well as bites transmitted,\nthe different packet sizes.\n\n55\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.270\nYou name it.\nThere's a lot of different aspects of\n\n56\n00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.880\nnet flow data that really can help us,\nespecially when we run into issues\n\n57\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.420\nlike the idea of low bandwidth or\nsomething like that,\n\n58\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.720\nwhen you actually have a fairly\ndecent bandwidth type of connection.\n\n59\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, this seems like a method in which\nwe're accumulating a lot of information.\n\n60\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.390\nSo I'm curious to see how it is going to\nbe represented, if we're gonna be looking\n\n61\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.460\nat in a statistical fashion,\nin a chart based fashion.\n\n62\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.640\nSo let's take a look.\n\n63\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe nice thing is you can do both, right?\n\n64\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.440\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n65\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.930\n&gt;&gt; In using net flow,\nthere are third party vendors out there,\n\n66\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.940\nwith applications that they use,\nthat will say hey,\n\n67\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.920\nI can take whatever net flow data you send\nto me, and I can take that information and\n\n68\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.810\nsend it, and\nmake you see it in the form of a report.\n\n69\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.900\nWe can look at statistical information or\nI can take them\n\n70\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.790\nstatistical information and chart it\nyou if you need to so you can see it.\n\n71\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.390\nNow you might be wondering why,\nwell, why would you give us both?\n\n72\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.230\nWell, remember that, for us, right?\n\n73\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.116\nMaybe looking at\nthe statistical information,\n\n74\n00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:59.430\nif you're actually analyzing the data,\nwe can spot transparently easily.\n\n75\n00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.330\nBut decision makers don't tend\nto look at a table of data grid.\n\n76\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.020\nI can spot that threat right away.\n\n77\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.170\nNow, some of them are, but if you're like\nme, and you don't really pay attention to\n\n78\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.770\nall the details, well,\nthen a chart really help you out.\n\n79\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.760\nSo there are third party vendors out\nthere that can help you to do that.\n\n80\n00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.910\nAnd usually these particular\nvendors when you buy their product\n\n81\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.550\nThey will give you most detail and\nemploy the best thing for the board.\n\n82\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.777\nI don't want to call anybody specifically\nbut a lot of the utilities out there\n\n83\n00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:30.975\nthat say, ph, we can treat you\nthe NetFlow data for free.\n\n84\n00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.650\nIt kinda gives a nice summary\nview of everything but\n\n85\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.816\nreally not pinpointing any one thing and\nthat's where NetFlow data is as really\n\n86\n00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:41.070\ngood where you can use folder to\npinpoint what you need to see.\n\n87\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.420\nBut we're not even going to take\nit at that particular approach.\n\n88\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.460\nWe're just going to use a simple capture\nin Wireshark to show that net flow data\n\n89\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.390\ncan be caught by an application, and\nthen we can take that application data and\n\n90\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.280\nsend it somewhere else.\n\n91\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.560\nSo we need to do the analysis of all\nthe packets that we see as well.\n\n92\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.470\nWe're also going to see the router itself,\nwhere we see this statistical type of\n\n93\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.730\ninformation In that way we can also\nstart spotting information too.\n\n94\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.250\nBut for us to do that, it means we\nhave to set up for it as well and\n\n95\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.460\nwe're about to do that.\n\n96\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.780\nBut before I get started in\nthe set up of using NetFlow,\n\n97\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.640\nwe need to talk how do we identify\nflow and what does it mean\n\n98\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.960\nwhan we start identifying the idea\nof the traffic flow that goes on.\n\n99\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.880\nNormally, this means that there's\ncharacteristics to every single packet of\n\n100\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.960\ndata that we have.\n\n101\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.690\nAnd when we start doing that,\nwhere do the characteristics lie?\n\n102\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.490\nWell, they lie within the header of all\nof the packets that are coming across\n\n103\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.710\nthe interface.\n\n104\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.830\nThat means that if you're capturing\ndata on interface, it can take a look at\n\n105\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.990\nall of the traffic that's going by no\nmatter how fast it is hopefully and\n\n106\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.700\nbe able to capture all\nthe data that's there.\n\n107\n00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.440\nBut NetFlow, though, samples this data.\n\n108\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.780\nIt may say, look I need you to sample\nthis at every five frames that come in,\n\n109\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.680\nor every 20 frames that come in,\nor whatever it might be, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.450\nSo you're gonna need to do something\nlike that if you choose that.\n\n111\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.810\nWe're just gonna show the capture\nof a small portion of it,\n\n112\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.330\nbecause you understand\nthe concepts here overall.\n\n113\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.570\nBut there's also a couple of\nthings that we need to know.\n\n114\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.640\nSo let's make sure you understand.\n\n115\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.840\nThere's particularly when you start\ntalking about flow of data, there's seven\n\n116\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.860\npieces of matching information that we\nnormally find in terms of flow data,\n\n117\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.740\nand that's kinda the key.\n\n118\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.210\nWhen we start talking about all of the\ndata that essentially belongs together in\n\n119\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.290\na grouping of some sort,\n\n120\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.040\nhowever we choose to, it normally\nincludes a course source and IP Address.\n\n121\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.110\nMakes sense right?\n\n122\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.590\nSource to the desk, source to the desk\nnation and desk nation back to the source.\n\n123\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.770\nThat's our flow data that we have.\n\n124\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.910\nWe also include, of course,\nsource and destination port numbers.\n\n125\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.950\nMakes sense because,\nthat's involved in a connection, as well.\n\n126\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.040\nNormally, the layer three\nprotocol type usually\n\n127\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.740\nis going to be IP in today's day and age.\n\n128\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.223\nAnd, of course, type of service bits or\nbites that we have there, and\n\n129\n00:06:53.223 --> 00:06:56.310\nthen there's also, of course,\nan interface index, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.980\nAnd the interface index is about\nof course whether is an e-grass or\n\n131\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.798\nin grass that can't remove other word,\nin grass or\n\n132\n00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:06.881\ne-grass type of interface that were\ntract in the information on as well.\n\n133\n00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.750\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\nthat just means inbound or outbound?\n\n134\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.495\n&gt;&gt; That's all it means.\n\n135\n00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:13.953\nYeah, and we're using those particular\ncharity because that's a NetFlow\n\n136\n00:07:13.953 --> 00:07:16.670\nterminology that they end up using.\n\n137\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.160\nWhen you have those packets essentially\nyou'll have all matching information,\n\n138\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.890\nthat's when the Cisco router\nof NetFlow is configured.\n\n139\n00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.590\nIt says, that data belongs together and\nI should monitor that, or\n\n140\n00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.560\nI should take a look at that\ninformation as a whole, and\n\n141\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.310\nthen statistically market or be able to\ncache a bit of that information to do so.\n\n142\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.380\nNow, you do have to be careful,\ncuz you can't overwhelm NetFlow\n\n143\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.670\nif you don't have fast enough\nconnection to do this.\n\n144\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.900\nSo normally what you do is you take all\nthat data, and you do a lot of the cache.\n\n145\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.088\nBut this is why it's important,\nthat if you're gonna analyze that, right.\n\n146\n00:07:51.088 --> 00:07:54.721\nThat you're actually gonna send it off\nto another machine to analyze it, so\n\n147\n00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.177\nwe need a destination of\nwhere that's going to go.\n\n148\n00:07:57.177 --> 00:08:02.052\nThe only last caveat that I have here that\nI wanna make sure that you understand\n\n149\n00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:04.305\nis for any good analysis to happen.\n\n150\n00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:09.650\nWe are not gonna do any example of good\nanalysis I know, it is sad but it is true.\n\n151\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.530\nThey recommend at least\ncapturing five minutes of data.\n\n152\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.150\nOkay?\n\n153\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.400\nSo don't do what I'm gonna do, which is to\ncapture out 30, 40, maybe a 100 packets.\n\n154\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.530\nRight?\n\n155\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.850\nWait for about five minutes, make sure\nyou get good flow data going across that\n\n156\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.890\ninterface to capture what you need,\nand that's kind of the key here.\n\n157\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.060\nThat is a good basis of analysis,\nand you do that day after day,\n\n158\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.050\nor you do it one day a week or whatever\nit might be on the intervals here, and\n\n159\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.900\nthat way you can capture and start seeing\n\n160\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.880\nthat type of trending information\nthat you're really looking for.\n\n161\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.713\nA single network capture, reveals\nsome info that one point at a time.\n\n162\n00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:47.685\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Remember five minutes later,\n\n163\n00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:51.175\nyour traffic patterns could be\ncompletely different and so\n\n164\n00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:54.956\neven though it might be that and\nagain I'm picking on Cherokee.\n\n165\n00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:56.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She was able to watch the show for\n\n166\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.859\nfive minutes one day.\n\n167\n00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:00.650\nAnd it did take up a lot of\nconsiderable amount of bandwidth.\n\n168\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.830\nBut let's say that the next six days\nshe doesn't watch the show at all.\n\n169\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.490\nSo it doesn't tell you\nthat there's a trend,\n\n170\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.460\nit tells you Cherokee clicked\non Netflix five minutes one day.\n\n171\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.925\nAnd that's not really cause,\nthat's an intermittent thing.\n\n172\n00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:15.143\nBut what we're looking for\nare those things that really do spot and\n\n173\n00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:18.220\nhelp us to identify the idea\nof trending information.\n\n174\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.190\nAnd that flowed out and\nreally help us to do that.\n\n175\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.980\n&gt;&gt; And it already kind of\njust comes down to that whole\n\n176\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.820\nconcept of troubleshooting, right?\n\n177\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.580\nI mean you think about your\nincreasing your samples size there.\n\n178\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.555\nBut then if you have in terms.\n\n179\n00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:33.135\nProblem, you wanna check\ndifferent types of days, or\n\n180\n00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:37.175\neven if it's an annual kind of business,\nsometimes you might notice\n\n181\n00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:40.445\ndifferent seasons, different types\nof traffic and things like that.\n\n182\n00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:44.715\nSo yeah, just getting a larger picture,\na better sample, a better window there.\n\n183\n00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:45.985\n&gt;&gt; And you have to, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:50.625\nBecause the idea of just getting a small\nsampling at different times of day and\n\n185\n00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.180\ndifferent things, It's not gonna really\nbe helpful because you're now comparing\n\n186\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.190\napples to oranges and\nit really is different.\n\n187\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.850\nSo make sure you are consistent.\n\n188\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.689\nBut at least five minutes of data flow is\nwhat is recommended from Cisco if you're\n\n189\n00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:05.517\ngonna use something like net\nflow to capture the data here.\n\n190\n00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:06.111\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n191\n00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:09.470\n&gt;&gt; So let's show you, let me at least\ntell you what I have set up here, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.460\nI've got sitting right beside me an actual\nCisco Router and I'm plugged into it.\n\n193\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.900\nAnd my only Internet connection\nis actually plugged on that and\n\n194\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.960\ngoing out to directly connected\nto the Internet itself.\n\n195\n00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.880\nAlso the web server sitting on\nanother network adaptor, so\n\n196\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.730\nthat my two machines are on\ndifferent networks as well, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.320\nBut there's also of course\nconnecting out to the Internet too.\n\n198\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.900\nSo, I can capture flow data\nbased off of one interface.\n\n199\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.820\nAnd that's what I need to do.\n\n200\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.640\nI wanna capture all the data\nthat's actually connecting my two\n\n201\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.230\nnetworks together.\n\n202\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.400\nAnd the one that's actually coming\ninbound for my particular network inside.\n\n203\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.050\nSo my internet traffic coming inbound\nhas pretty much the one that I'm really\n\n204\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.970\nlooking for.\n\n205\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.610\nNot so much to the other one, not so\nmuch to this one but just that one.\n\n206\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.940\nSo that's what we're gonna set up this\nrouter to do, is to capture net flow data.\n\n207\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.160\nSo that then we can see it.\n\n208\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.157\nWe're gonna take a look at it then in\nterms of capturing data with [INAUDIBLE].\n\n209\n00:11:04.157 --> 00:11:07.610\nAnd then we're also gonna look\nat the statistical information\n\n210\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.645\nwhich apparently is tongue tying me today.\n\n211\n00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:10.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n212\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.540\nwe're gonna take a look at that as well.\n\n213\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.590\nAnd hopefully that's a great demo for you.\n\n214\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.480\nTo be able to understand\nwhat we're gonna see.\n\n215\n00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.950\nSo let's take a look at my machine here.\n\n216\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.340\nAnd this will get us started,\nat least I hope it will.\n\n217\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.210\nAnd we're gonna begin some\nconfiguration for net flow.\n\n218\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.910\nSo as soon as I go into\nthe global configuration mode,\n\n219\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.800\nI've gotta do a couple of things\nto get this thing ready, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.200\nSo, the great thing is you\ndon't have to do a lot, but\n\n221\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.678\nyou do have to at least know part\nof this configuration to do this.\n\n222\n00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:44.660\nIP flow export and the first thing I'm\ngoing to do is tell us the destination.\n\n223\n00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:51.703\nWhich is gonna be my IP address and\nI hope I've got the right which is 102.\n\n224\n00:11:51.703 --> 00:11:56.140\nNow there's a very important piece of\ninformation I need to add here at the end.\n\n225\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.570\nWhich is the specific port number for\nnet flow data.\n\n226\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.000\nAnd thus can 2055 that's\nthe default port number.\n\n227\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.700\nThat is the one that just about\neverybody on the planet uses, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:15.120\nTechnically there is another one that is\n996 I think, if I remember correctly.\n\n229\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.710\nI think that's actually the right one,\n996 is the other one.\n\n230\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.230\nI was trying to think I had just\nlooked it up right before the show and\n\n231\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.856\nI can't remember right now anymore but,\nmake sure you at least do that.\n\n232\n00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Without that\n\n233\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.170\nis not gonna do anything for you.\n\n234\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.507\nIt'll send traffic there\ndon't get me wrong but\n\n235\n00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:34.822\nyou won't know exactly how to\nactually say this belongs to NetFlow.\n\n236\n00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:35.516\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n237\n00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:36.492\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n238\n00:12:36.492 --> 00:12:39.110\nSo that is the first thing that we need.\n\n239\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.510\nThe other thing of course is the version.\n\n240\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:48.010\nIP flow export version.\n\n241\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.400\nAnd there's three different versions,\n\n242\n00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.140\nwe're simply gonna use\nthe latest version here.\n\n243\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.090\nThe latest version is designed to\nhave also integrated with the latest\n\n244\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.840\napplications that are out there and\navailable for us.\n\n245\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.790\nSo it can capture as much of\nthe data that it needs to or\n\n246\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.470\nas little of the data that needs to.\n\n247\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.100\nSome of the earlier versions of course\nwould give you chunks of the information,\n\n248\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.940\nbut just kinda realize we're just gonna\nuse the latest one because that's just\n\n249\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.090\nthe latest one and it kinda helps.\n\n250\n00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.420\nNow the problem that we have is now\nthat we're sending it all to Wireshark,\n\n251\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.510\nWireshark does not know\nwithout knowing how the setup\n\n252\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.840\na NetFlow data works is not gonna be able\nto capture and report it in any form.\n\n253\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.670\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nsetup what we call a template and\n\n254\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.420\na different rate of capture\nis what we're going to do.\n\n255\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n256\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.240\nSo we have to actually have these\ncommands in here as we do this and\n\n257\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.520\nmake sure that I type it in correctly.\n\n258\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.348\nI wanna make sure that\nI don't do this wrong.\n\n259\n00:13:42.348 --> 00:13:46.590\nSo IP flow-export, and\n\n260\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.110\nI need to call out a template that\nwe're going to use and the options.\n\n261\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.090\nSo using this,\nI'm gonna tell it on this template.\n\n262\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.080\nThat it's to capture every five\nframes is what I'm going to do.\n\n263\n00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.270\nIt's not exactly a long time, but you can\ndo this all the way up to, I think, 255 or\n\n264\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.500\nmaybe even higher.\n\n265\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.300\nLet me actually check that out for sure.\n\n266\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.890\n600.\n\n267\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.190\nSo I was wrong.\n\n268\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.894\nSee.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n269\n00:14:10.894 --> 00:14:15.110\n&gt;&gt; The default though,\nyou see is every 20 packets.\n\n270\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.410\nOkay.\nThat's what you have.\n\n271\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.650\nI don't know why 600, but\nyou could do that if you chose to.\n\n272\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.835\nNow, the other one is almost\nexactly identical here,\n\n273\n00:14:25.835 --> 00:14:29.113\nwhich is the refresh rate itself.\n\n274\n00:14:31.853 --> 00:14:33.070\nAnd let's see, yep.\n\n275\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.920\nSo it's the same thing,\nI just wanted to make sure there.\n\n276\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.380\nSo another refresh rate of 5.\n\n277\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo what am I saying here?\n\n278\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.930\nI'm saying when we capture it,\n\n279\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:45.230\njust a regular capture itself,\non the template we need the options.\n\n280\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.590\nEvery option is gonna be\nrefreshed every five packets.\n\n281\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.560\nAnd then on the template itself it's\ngonna be refreshed every five seconds.\n\n282\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.060\nSo it doesn't seem a lot different but on\nthe template, right, the overall template,\n\n283\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.450\nthere's fine, so we're saying, hey look\nalso at the same time every option that\n\n284\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.730\nWireshark is set up to capture,\nalso every five packets.\n\n285\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.470\nMake sure that,\nthat information gets updated too.\n\n286\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.870\nStatistically, as well as what you\nactually see on the screen too.\n\n287\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.640\nSo it gives you a ton of information\nif your doing this, alright!\n\n288\n00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.410\nNow do you have to set that up?\n\n289\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.740\nYou have to at least set\nup the template part.\n\n290\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.290\nBut first rate we can leave\nat 20 if we want to, but\n\n291\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.430\nif you do you'll probably gonna wait\nat least five minutes before you ever\n\n292\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.560\neven see any information come across.\n\n293\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.370\nBut doing that 5 here,\nit'll give us probably 5.\n\n294\n00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.210\nI think it's what it will give\nus cuz we're not gonna do it for\n\n295\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.390\ntoo long is what we're gonna do.\n\n296\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.442\nSo, now that we have that one is set up.\n\n297\n00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:49.238\nWe need to also make sure, of course,\nthat we set up the source that we are,\n\n298\n00:15:49.238 --> 00:15:55.218\nnot the source, the interface that\nwe're having the ingress traffic from,\n\n299\n00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:57.611\nso that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n300\n00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:59.422\nI couldn't remember what\nI was gonna do here.\n\n301\n00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:01.570\nInterface.\n\n302\n00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.863\nAnd this gonna be gigabit 0/1 and\n\n303\n00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:10.033\nthat is my interface that's\nfacing the Internet here.\n\n304\n00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:13.180\nAnd I need to run the command here.\n\n305\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.046\nAnd there's two different\ncommands that you can run.\n\n306\n00:16:15.046 --> 00:16:19.940\nThere's IP route-cache flow.\n\n307\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.950\nThis is the command that's been used for\na long time and\n\n308\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.100\nthis one normally just turns it on and\nsays all right, you're ready to go.\n\n309\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.220\nAnd it will capture all of the data.\n\n310\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.601\nIn version 15, okay, what it does is\neven if it sees this one right here,\n\n311\n00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:36.611\nyou'll see it will report it differently,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:39.593\nSo it actually uses IP flow ingress or\nsomething,\n\n313\n00:16:39.593 --> 00:16:43.030\nI believe is the one that\nit ends up using instead.\n\n314\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.640\nBut I can still use the old one if I want\nto and that's exactly what I did here.\n\n315\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.350\nSo, I can set that one up.\n\n316\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:56.351\nAnd I can also go into interface 0/0 and\n\n317\n00:16:56.351 --> 00:17:00.639\nthis is gonna be for my other IP\n\n318\n00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:05.794\naddress that I have on this router.\n\n319\n00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:08.205\nAnd I'm gonna tell it\nto do the same thing.\n\n320\n00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:16.374\nSo on every interface that\nI want it to capture, oops.\n\n321\n00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:20.050\nOkay, it just needed the cache.\n\n322\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.110\nI couldn't remember.\n\n323\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.592\nSo on every single interface\nthat I want to do that,\n\n324\n00:17:23.592 --> 00:17:26.990\nmake sure I was doing that right here,\nyes, okay.\n\n325\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.247\nThat I want to capture data on,\non that one router,\n\n326\n00:17:31.247 --> 00:17:35.510\nI need to set up that cache flow or\nroute cache flow.\n\n327\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.870\nI'm not gonna be able to say\n[CROSSTALK] or IP route cache, yes.\n\n328\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.280\nI don't know why it's doing that to me.\n\n329\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.830\nBut you just set it up that\non every other interface.\n\n330\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.830\nThe good thing is I've already told\nit where's going to flow to, right.\n\n331\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.357\nWhich is to me right here.\n\n332\n00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n333\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.170\n&gt;&gt; So you have that option.\n\n334\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.280\nEverything is pretty much\nset up at this point.\n\n335\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.620\nNow there was other older\nones that you could do 12 and\n\n336\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.690\nearlier 12.4 and earlier I think,\nwhere you can also set up a source.\n\n337\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.590\nAnd that's just saying hey,\n\n338\n00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.700\nwhat do you want the source IP to be\nreported as, that's sending it to you.\n\n339\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.480\nSo that's all it's gonna do.\n\n340\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.310\nWe're not gonna worry about that one for\nright now, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.959\nOnce that is all set up, just want to make\nsure I included all the commands here,\n\n342\n00:18:17.959 --> 00:18:19.876\nlet me show you what\nit does on the router.\n\n343\n00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:27.490\nSo I'm just gonna scroll through\nthe running config here.\n\n344\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.850\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthis one right here.\n\n345\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.960\nAnd let me see if I can show\nyou what's really important,\n\n346\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.300\nwhich is gonna be right through here.\n\n347\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.960\nSo notice it changed my\nparticular flow data.\n\n348\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.670\nSo I said ip flow ingress.\n\n349\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.290\nNow the other one, it decided not\nto put it on, I don't know why, for\n\n350\n00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.830\none reason or another, so\nit's probably not gonna capture this one.\n\n351\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.700\nSo I might actually have\nto initialize instead\n\n352\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.460\nip flow ingress on the subinterface.\n\n353\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.140\nThe newer version may just say,\nI don't do subinterfaces with the old one.\n\n354\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.920\nSo instead, it actually just set out.\n\n355\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.910\nI'll change it here but\nI won't put it on this one, so\n\n356\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.531\nI'm not gonna worry about it for\nright now cuz you kind of get the idea.\n\n357\n00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:10.435\nAnd I'm gonna scroll down and\n\n358\n00:19:10.435 --> 00:19:15.319\nlet's take a look at the other IP flow\ndata information which is right here.\n\n359\n00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:19.900\nAnd this is where we saw the information.\n\n360\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.320\nThe version number, the refresh rates and\nthe destination it's going to.\n\n361\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.490\nSometimes if you dont see the data,\nremember this number, it's very clear,\n\n362\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.670\nvery important that you remember this,\nright?\n\n363\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if the configuration is\n\n364\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.690\nincorrect here just with one number,\nflow data is not gonna be captured.\n\n365\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.780\nSo that might be an indication hey,\nflow data is not being captured.\n\n366\n00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.338\nWhat do you see here on the screen that\nindicates that something is not right.\n\n367\n00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:48.690\n&gt;&gt; 2055.\n\n368\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.540\n&gt;&gt; 2055, maybe it.\n\n369\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.330\nSo just kind of a hint there but\nyou might see something unusual like that.\n\n370\n00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.192\nSo just realize that those\nare kind of the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n371\n00:19:58.192 --> 00:20:05.220\nNow in theory, everything is working and\nset up to work, so let's take a look too.\n\n372\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.030\nSo there's a couple of verification\ncommands that we can run.\n\n373\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.798\nI'm gonna get out of this.\n\n374\n00:20:12.992 --> 00:20:18.460\nShow ip cache flow.\n\n375\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.610\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].\n\n376\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there you go.\n\n377\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.330\nSo here it is,\nhere's some statistical information here\n\n378\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.020\nthat you start to see that right\nnow even on the interface itself.\n\n379\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.270\nIt is capturing statistical\ninformation right here.\n\n380\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.615\nAbout the size of the packets that\nare coming in all way through here.\n\n381\n00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.720\nYou also can see that it's\ngot a switching cache and\n\n382\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.740\nthe size the bytes that were reported.\n\n383\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:48.480\n7 active flows, a lot of inactive flows,\n49 added, you name it.\n\n384\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.050\nThere's even subflows that it can capture.\n\n385\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.530\nAnd of course,\nbased on the different protocols.\n\n386\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.180\nSo you'll see that there's some and\nthen off course, details underneath.\n\n387\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.910\nSo notice all of these IP addresses, now,\nCherokee, I didn't set any of these up on\n\n388\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:08.120\nthe source address at all, but you can\nsee they're coming in from the Internet.\n\n389\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.360\nAll that is coming in according to net\nflow data is what we're seeing, okay.\n\n390\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.858\nSo there's one that we can also see there.\n\n391\n00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:22.030\nShow ip flow export is another one.\n\n392\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.670\nAnd on this particular one,\n\n393\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.920\nI'm just verifying that I have\nthe proper destination here.\n\n394\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.840\nAnd I may need the source as well,\nso we'll see.\n\n395\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.070\nI may actually have to go back and add\nthat in if it doesn't show us anything.\n\n396\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.850\nBut notice it says 71 flows\nexported in 16 udp datagrams.\n\n397\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.510\nNow I probably should've turned on\nWireshark, but we'll turn it on and\n\n398\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.420\nstill see some information\ncapture here on the moment.\n\n399\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.910\nBut we wanna just try a couple of\nthings as we do so, all right.\n\n400\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.680\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\n\n401\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.230\nlet me initiate Wireshark here and\ngo to this other desktop.\n\n402\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:01.999\nType in Wireshark, make sure I\nconnect to the proper interface\n\n403\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:10.650\nand now the Wireshark data is starting\nto capture the information and the data.\n\n404\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:15.380\nSo we can try and create some flows,\nsuch as going out to a website and\n\n405\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.344\nI'll just choose ITProTV,\nthat seems to be logical for us.\n\n406\n00:22:18.344 --> 00:22:20.968\nTo actually be able to make a connection.\n\n407\n00:22:20.968 --> 00:22:24.739\nAnd we'll click-on the course\nlibrary here just for a moment.\n\n408\n00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:29.040\nAnd there's our On Air button, just\nlike what you're actually seeing here.\n\n409\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.950\nSo that should be enough of something\nlike that for us to connect to.\n\n410\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.821\nI can also of course,\nI just close that out,\n\n411\n00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:43.680\nconnect to my default web server.\n\n412\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.140\nAnd you can see there it is.\n\n413\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.190\nThere's my default web server just for\ntesting,\n\n414\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.050\nI don't have anything\nelse running on there.\n\n415\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.560\nBut there's other things that we can also\ndo at the same time on this machine.\n\n416\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.572\nWhich is if I open up\nanother console here.\n\n417\n00:23:00.572 --> 00:23:06.219\nInstead, let's see [INAUDIBLE]\n\n418\n00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:12.080\nping 10.0.46.101.\n\n419\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Was that your web server?\n\n420\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.090\n&gt;&gt; Should be.\n\n421\n00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.726\nDid I not, it was 101, wasn't it?\n\n422\n00:23:19.726 --> 00:23:21.311\n[LAUGH] Let me check.\n\n423\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.710\nThat may have been my web server.\n\n424\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.350\nNow it's not accepting pings of course.\n\n425\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.007\nThat would be funny.\n\n426\n00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:33.160\nWhat did I actually type\ninto the web server, yeah?\n\n427\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.730\n&gt;&gt; 101.\n\n428\n00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's unusual,\nbut that's enough.\n\n429\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.520\nSo I'm just trying to\ngenerate some traffic,\n\n430\n00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.700\nthat's all I'm trying to do, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.550\nAll right, so\nnow that we have that, let's go and\n\n432\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.270\ntake a look at our Wireshark information.\n\n433\n00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.117\nAnd we will close out or stop the capture.\n\n434\n00:23:49.117 --> 00:23:53.293\nAt this point, it's simple, we need\nto add in a filter to see of course,\n\n435\n00:23:53.293 --> 00:23:54.875\nthe NetFlow information.\n\n436\n00:23:54.875 --> 00:23:58.396\nAnd that filter is called\ncflow inside of Wireshark.\n\n437\n00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:01.667\nRemember that I didn't go out and\ndownload the special free program,\n\n438\n00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.570\nI didn't do anything like that.\n\n439\n00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.300\nI just said Wireshark pretty\nmuch tells us whether or\n\n440\n00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.220\nnot we're capturing the information.\n\n441\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.010\nAnd the longer then let it go, you can see\nthat it did start to actually refresh and\n\n442\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.690\nto start to give me some more information.\n\n443\n00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.990\nRight here, at the very beginning,\n\n444\n00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.810\nyou'll see it talks about\nthe template that it actually chose.\n\n445\n00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.760\nAnd there's also some other\ninformation that you see right here,\n\n446\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.840\nwhich is,\nit captured a total of 28 different flows.\n\n447\n00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.776\nNow, you're looking at this and\ngoing, well,\n\n448\n00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:34.659\nthe source is just saying that one\nIP address, and that's because it's\n\n449\n00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:37.369\nthe interface IP address that it\ncaptured it on, and that's fine.\n\n450\n00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:39.553\nBut notice down here in the details,\n\n451\n00:24:39.553 --> 00:24:43.005\nthis is where you start actually\nseeing the information,\n\n452\n00:24:43.005 --> 00:24:47.806\ndon't worry about all the details up\nthere, but pick whichever one you want to.\n\n453\n00:24:47.806 --> 00:24:54.063\nAnd now notice that underneath our layer\nfour data, we have Cisco NetFlow and\n\n454\n00:24:54.063 --> 00:24:59.756\nIPFIX and now you can see that here\nis the version nine that we told you.\n\n455\n00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:06.850\n28 counts, you're still not seeing\nthe idea of what 28 flows of traffic.\n\n456\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.670\nHere's one, and that is for the data\ntemplate that everything else is following\n\n457\n00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.550\nand then the other 27 flows\nare listed right here.\n\n458\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.176\nIf I wanted to see some of\nthe information, I can click on this.\n\n459\n00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:25.262\nAnd now remember what we talked\nabout as far as the flow data.\n\n460\n00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:29.592\nSource and destination address,\n\n461\n00:25:29.592 --> 00:25:35.540\nprotocol, source and destination ports.\n\n462\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.750\nThere is the type of service bit here.\n\n463\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:44.970\nAnd you also, of course the interface,\nmaybe it's not in here.\n\n464\n00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.280\nBut you can actually start\nseeing that information.\n\n465\n00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.440\nNow you can see what actually connected\ninto the router's interface that I have\n\n466\n00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.800\navailable to us.\n\n467\n00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.490\nIt really does help us to see what\nwe're actually taking look at here.\n\n468\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.990\nAnd here's another one.\n\n469\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.620\nThis one is from looks\nlike a DNS address here.\n\n470\n00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.840\nI can see this,\nI can also see the packets that were set.\n\n471\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.008\nI can scroll down through here and\nlook at the idea of all of these different\n\n472\n00:26:15.008 --> 00:26:18.846\nones to try and\nspot the information that I'm looking for,\n\n473\n00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:22.299\nthe rest of this looks like\nDNS packets right now, and\n\n474\n00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:27.595\nI'm just taking a look at the source\naddress, it's at least three through five,\n\n475\n00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:31.408\nor from DNS 7, another DNS one,\n8, it's another one.\n\n476\n00:26:31.408 --> 00:26:34.530\n&gt;&gt; You don't have any evidence\nagainst my Netflix watching there?\n\n477\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Not so far.\nThere you go.\n\n478\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:40.901\nYou can see that you can spend some\ntime taking a look at each one of\n\n479\n00:26:40.901 --> 00:26:45.521\nthese flows here, and\nthis one caught three, here's six,\n\n480\n00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:49.344\nhere's 29, 28, 12, five, ten, 15.\n\n481\n00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:52.938\nAnd this was a capture of\nall that data now from this,\n\n482\n00:26:52.938 --> 00:26:56.617\nthis is where another\napplication could take this and\n\n483\n00:26:56.617 --> 00:27:01.700\ndisplay it as a chart, display it\nas the information that you want.\n\n484\n00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.540\nAnd you can see of course then that\nstatistical information that we also saw\n\n485\n00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.530\non the router itself.\n\n486\n00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.950\nThe combination of everything really\ngives you a good overall feel, and\n\n487\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.610\nunderstanding, of data as it goes\nacross and what could be eating up\n\n488\n00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:22.120\nyour network bandwidth or of course\napplications that are actually connecting,\n\n489\n00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.200\nwhatever it might be NetFlow data\npretty much helps us to do all that.\n\n490\n00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.870\nDon't over look it, as an order protocol\nbut still has a lot to give you\n\n491\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.160\nwhen it comes down to taking a look\nat the different types of data.\n\n492\n00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI think just getting accustomed to it and\n\n493\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.110\ngetting used to syntax, and\nsifting through all the information\n\n494\n00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.200\nis going to probably be the biggest\nchallenge with using this tool but\n\n495\n00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.450\nit does provide us with a lot\nof really great information.\n\n496\n00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.570\nRonnie, do we have any\nother final thoughts or?\n\n497\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThere is one other piece of information\n\n498\n00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.660\nthat we need to talk about, and I was\ngoing to include this into the previous\n\n499\n00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.080\nepisode but since I forget, this is\na great place to add it in as well.\n\n500\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.470\nWe're just talking just briefly\nabout stateful firewalls and\n\n501\n00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.850\nthe type of data that\nwe normally see there.\n\n502\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.890\nRemember that for us,\n\n503\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.100\na stateful firewall it means what is\nit only going to allow to connect?\n\n504\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.930\nOnly traffic that we have\ninitiated from the outside,\n\n505\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:18.480\nfrom our trusted side to the untrusted and\nback in.\n\n506\n00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.710\nWe do not normally allow for\n\n507\n00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:25.300\nuntrusted data to make an initial\nconnection back into our network at all.\n\n508\n00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.130\nNormally what you see here is kind\nof neat and the very fact that\n\n509\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:34.650\nyou know that the traffic that got in,\nexcept it was invited in.\n\n510\n00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.940\nAnd that is a big indication of something,\nand\n\n511\n00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.350\nnormally is a big indication of anything\nelse social engineering is what it's\n\n512\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.110\nnormally a big indication of, that\nthere's a compromise to our systems, or\n\n513\n00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.650\nthere's an indication that there's some\ntype of faulty rule that's in place.\n\n514\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.170\nBut as far as different data that goes,\nwhat we have on the firewall itself of\n\n515\n00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.160\ncourse is logging information and\nusually that deals with of course time and\n\n516\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.830\nstatistical information\nas well as source and\n\n517\n00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.020\ndestination of where that data comes in.\n\n518\n00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.940\nWe can only explore some of\nthe information in the traditional type of\n\n519\n00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.020\nthe header information\nthat we are looking at but\n\n520\n00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.580\nwhat we don't see there is\ncontent information itself.\n\n521\n00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.070\nJust like in Netflow the state\nof firewall only allow us to see\n\n522\n00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.990\nthe previous connections that\nwhere called upon to make but\n\n523\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.470\nit doesn't see everything that\nmay hit the outside interphase.\n\n524\n00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.660\nIt just says yeah, I didn't make\na connection to you from the inside.\n\n525\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.230\nI don't know who you are, I'm closing\nthe door in your face right now.\n\n526\n00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.100\nThat's pretty much the way that it goes.\n\n527\n00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.600\nBut just realize that it is just\nbasic firewall technology and\n\n528\n00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.080\nwe already talked about it a bit,\nearlier on in one of our episodes.\n\n529\n00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.820\nIt's just a reminder that you're\nnot gonna get all the details for\n\n530\n00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.130\nanalysis that you want off of stateful\nfirewalls, a lot of times, but\n\n531\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.330\nthe combination of things all together.\n\n532\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.090\nAlong with all the tools that we've\nmentioned in the other two parts of this\n\n533\n00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.680\nshow will really help to round\nout those skills for you.\n\n534\n00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie.\n\n535\n00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.990\nI know we did make it to that full\nthree parts here, that three episodes.\n\n536\n00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.360\nBut that's all right,\nits a lot of really good information.\n\n537\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.610\nStayed tuned guys because we do have some\nmore Cisco cybersecurity information\n\n538\n00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.200\nheaded your way.\n\n539\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.300\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n540\n00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.890\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n541\n00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n542\n00:30:14.660 -->

00:00:11.781\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n\n4\n00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n5\n00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.780\nyour Cisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.840\nIn this episode we will be\nlooking at ways to describe\n\n8\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.550\nnetwork system monitoring data.\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.330\nThere's a lot of different information\nthat we can compile through different\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.510\ntypes of systems.\n\n11\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.870\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nbreak that down for you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.260\nWith us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong\nin studious to cover this topic.\n\n13\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.680\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on to see more in terms of\n\n15\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.530\nunderstanding the realm of cyber security\nand talking about NSM, all right.\n\n16\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730\nAnd if you took a look at the lower third,\nand you're like, what the heck is NSM?\n\n17\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.950\nIt is network security monitoring\nis what we have here, and\n\n18\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.660\nwe wanna make sure that we understand that\nwe're talking about the types of data that\n\n19\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.260\nwe really are looking to capture when we\nstart doing network security monitoring.\n\n20\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.790\nIt's not enough just to have everything\nin hand, even though it helps,\n\n21\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.600\nwe need to understand what it is that\nwe're specifically looking for and\n\n22\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.535\nalso of course just understand that the\nreason why we look for it a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:22.010\nSo, we're not gonna get super in depth\ninto it, this is an introduction to\n\n24\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.190\nthe concept itself of what we call\nnetwork security monitoring and\n\n25\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.660\nthe different types of data that's\navailable, and there are several types\n\n26\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.800\nthat we need to be aware of and\nmake sure you know these terms.\n\n27\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.100\nThat's the key for this one when it comes\ndown to getting an exam focus ready.\n\n28\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you might also hear this term\nSIEM systems for security, information,\n\n29\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.200\nand event management, and essentially\nthat's what we'll be talking about here.\n\n30\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440\nJust another way to word it, another term\nthat you might hear out in the field.\n\n31\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's go ahead and\nget started here and\n\n32\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.340\nwe'll talk about some of the major\nterms that you're generally going\n\n33\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.990\nto have to encounter, and\nthen also end up understanding as well.\n\n34\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.180\nSo the first one that we want to take\na look at here, is on the exam objectives,\n\n35\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.370\nwhat they call the idea here\nof full packet capture, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.740\nFull packet capture.\n\n37\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.720\nCherokee, I think it's self explanatory,\n\n38\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.140\nwhat do you think that that means,\nwhen you talk about full-packet capture?\n\n39\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380\nJust off the top of your head,\njust hearing that term?\n\n40\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I had to guess, I would assume\nthat it means capturing all the individual\n\n41\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.970\npackets that are traversing my network and\nflowing across my systems.\n\n42\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.570\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of the key and\n\n43\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.380\nthe idea of understanding that we're\ncapturing everything that we possibly can.\n\n44\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.520\nNormally, when we do a total full\ntype of network capture here we're\n\n45\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.710\ntalking about capturing all\nthe network traffic from, of course,\n\n46\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.220\na source to the destination, or\na destination back to the source.\n\n47\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.020\nWhatever it might be, we want the full\namount of information that we can get, and\n\n48\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.090\nunlike what we normally see inside of\nWireshark which can capture everything\n\n49\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.580\nthat we have available to us, it\nnormally just reports to us just a small\n\n50\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.300\nportion of what we're talking about\nas well, and the same thing with TCP.\n\n51\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.370\nLet me show you what I'm talking about\nokay, so let's go to my machine here,\n\n52\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.530\nand open, let me bring up Wireshark, as we\ntake a look at Wireshark here I'm gonna\n\n53\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.290\nlaunch this up and just do a couple of\npacket captures here just for a moment.\n\n54\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.250\nWe'll bring up ITProTV again as my\nsite to just generate some traffic,\n\n55\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.350\ncuz I know it goes across well,\nwherever it goes, and\n\n56\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.020\nyou see it starts spitting out traffic\nall over the place is what it does.\n\n57\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.940\nI'm gonna stop that capture.\n\n58\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.950\nMost of the time when I start to\ntake a look at the data itself,\n\n59\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.500\nI'm only looking at a portion\nof what I'm looking at, right?\n\n60\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.950\nSo up here at the top, is really\njust basic summary information, and\n\n61\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.480\nthat gives me just a little piece.\n\n62\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.860\nIt doesn't matter which\none that I'm talking.\n\n63\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.760\nI get source, destination, time,\nlength, protocol, info, you name it.\n\n64\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.290\nGreat, but a nice little summary.\n\n65\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.570\nAs I want to take a look at the header\ninformation, which really is what helps me\n\n66\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.290\nto guide my packet from where ever\nit's from to where ever it's going,\n\n67\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.480\nthen I can even see all the details\ninside of my header information as well.\n\n68\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.330\nBut if I want to look at everything,\nit's down here that you\n\n69\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.510\nstart looking at every detail of that,\nexcept what we don't have,\n\n70\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.900\nwhich of course is whatever the payload\nof that data is going to be.\n\n71\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.490\nSo in this instance here,\nyou can see some of the information, but\n\n72\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.890\nyou don't tend to see a lot of it, and\nit's only right here do you start to get\n\n73\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.590\nthe idea that there is some application\ndata behind that secure socket layer, and\n\n74\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.490\nthat there's actually other information\nthat's available right here for\n\n75\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.560\nyou where you can start\nseeing that data come across.\n\n76\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.460\nBut that's kind of what you start to see\nhere, is that you might be able to see\n\n77\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.270\na little bit of it, but you don't\nget to see all of it overall, okay?\n\n78\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.630\nSo for us to start seeing everything\nthough, we may also have to turn to\n\n79\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.120\nanother utility,\nlike TCP Dump is what we'd have to do.\n\n80\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.149\nSo let's go ahead and\nchange over to that machine as well.\n\n81\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.390\nSo, here on my, the BN machine, I'm gonna\nclick on Applications &gt; Accessories,\n\n82\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.020\ngo down to my terminal so\nI can launch TCP Dump.\n\n83\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.320\nNow, because I know that TCP Dump really\ndoesn't show me anything when I'm running\n\n84\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.504\nas me, I'm going to make sure I log\nin as of course the root user itself,\n\n85\n00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:32.790\nor himself, I should say.\n\n86\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.720\nSo I'm going to type in this\ncommand to show everything,\n\n87\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.020\ntcpdump, if I can spell it.\n\n88\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.230\nThen I need to add in some options here.\n\n89\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.850\n&gt;&gt; I think we got an m instead of a p.\n\n90\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's all right.\n\n91\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Tcp, there we go.\n\n92\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.640\nYep, tcpdump, yeah,\nthat would have stopped it as well.\n\n93\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.830\nSo my typing skills are legendary on here,\nbad.\n\n94\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.040\nSo I'm gonna do this double n here.\n\n95\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.390\nThe nn gives me the ability of course to\nessentially say don't do name resolution\n\n96\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.940\non any of the source and\ndestination addresses as well as\n\n97\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.600\non the port numbers for the second net,\nis what we're taking a look at here.\n\n98\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.150\nAnother thing is gonna be a couple of\nv's here, is what I'm going to do, and\n\n99\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.390\nthis idea of course is saying,\nhey I want you to be verbose,\n\n100\n00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.200\nalong with this I have the X I'm going\nto add in which is a capital letter X,\n\n101\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.980\nlet me zoom in so that we can see it.\n\n102\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.550\nI can say,\nhey report X as well as binary or\n\n103\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.110\nwhatever you can report,\nmake sure I do that.\n\n104\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.050\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, you're really\ncustomizing what you want this system\n\n105\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.925\nto do here with this particular search?\n\n106\n00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:40.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, at least that's what I\nthink I'm doing, let's put it that way.\n\n107\n00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the S, of course,\n\n108\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.450\nmeans I'm gonna also include in sequence\nnumbers, and then the lower case s for\n\n109\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.000\nthe size.\n\n110\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.420\nNow because I want to capture\nthe entire packet of data\n\n111\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.230\nI'm going to specify\nthe largest size as I can.\n\n112\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.750\nWhich is gonna be 1514, and\n\n113\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.510\nif I typed in everything correctly, that\nmeans that I've copied my notes correctly.\n\n114\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.020\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.010\nWe'll start seeing the data come through\nand notice it's got alpha-numeric,\n\n116\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.820\nit's got hex values, it's got\ndecimal values, it's got binary, and\n\n117\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.540\nthis is all of the data that is coming\nthrough just by me doing this, right?\n\n118\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.400\nSo you take a look at that, compared\nto here, you should see where I can\n\n119\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.930\nstart seeing some of the information,\nnow you have this hex value here.\n\n120\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.840\nBut I'm really not getting everything,\n\n121\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.780\nnow, I'm starting to get some of it,\nright?\n\n122\n00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.320\nBut compared to this where I'm getting\neverything that's flowing across right now\n\n123\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.155\non the screen, is very detailed, and\nthis is capturing every bit of that\n\n124\n00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:39.820\n1514 bytes of data that's going across for\neverything that's coming across here.\n\n125\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.760\nSo this will give you\nthe full ability to then\n\n126\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.590\nlater on as you capture this information,\nto break this down a little bit later, and\n\n127\n00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.060\nthen to pull out only\nthe information that you need.\n\n128\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.930\n&gt;&gt; So if we needed to go ahead and\nexport this information,\n\n129\n00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.500\nwe do have the ability to and\nwe could even perhaps send it to someone,\n\n130\n00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.040\nlet's say if I wasn't familiar with\nbeing able to analyze this information.\n\n131\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.339\nBut I mean, that's the goal here, but\nstill, I have that ability to do so\n\n132\n00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:04.044\nif I needed to?\n\n133\n00:08:04.044 --> 00:08:05.844\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo just like you have in Wireshark,\n\n134\n00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:08.979\nwhere you can save it, you can also\ntake this and export it into a file.\n\n135\n00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:10.397\nThen examine it later on.\n\n136\n00:08:10.397 --> 00:08:11.500\nThat's really what you want to do.\n\n137\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.700\nYou don't want to try and\ndo analysis live time on this data.\n\n138\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.750\nIt's not going to be very helpful to\nyou or anything else that you're doing.\n\n139\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.690\nSo make sure you understand\nat least the basics here\n\n140\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.560\nof getting something like\nthis done if you need to.\n\n141\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.550\nThe great thing is whether you use\ntcpdump or whether you use wireshark\n\n142\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.360\nthere are ways you can configure wire\nshark to show you the same thing and\n\n143\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.310\nto show you more.\n\n144\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.780\nJust wanted to show you a couple\ndifferent tools here to help you out.\n\n145\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.430\nA lot of times in the background\nwire shark is using\n\n146\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.450\nTCP dump really to get a lot of\nthe information to you anyways.\n\n147\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.150\nBut at least here though you have the\nability to do that type of full capture\n\n148\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.620\nthat we were talking about.\n\n149\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Perfect,\nnow what about the actual session data\n\n150\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.580\nabout that communication\nthat is happening.\n\n151\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, when you start talking about\nsession data, right, we wanna make sure\n\n152\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.710\nthat we also capture the information\nabout the conversation itself.\n\n153\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.450\nEverything that comes across our\ninterface is not necessarily useful.\n\n154\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.090\nNor is it necessarily helpful.\n\n155\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.060\nIt again creates that big gigantic\nhaystack when you're only looking for\n\n156\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.710\na small amount of things.\n\n157\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.710\nSession data helps us to\nestablish to conversation and\n\n158\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.970\nwe maybe looking to a specific type\nof conversation between end points.\n\n159\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.560\nThen when we do that what\nare we really looking for.\n\n160\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.850\nWe're not really talking\nabout all the data.\n\n161\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.940\nSo we're not talking about the data\npayload that we're looking at.\n\n162\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.852\nWe're really trying to say,\n\n163\n00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:32.650\nall right, where is the call data\nthe details of how this call was set up.\n\n164\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.920\nEverything else that we actually have,\nmaking sure that we include who, when and\n\n165\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.720\nhow of the call data that\nwe have available as well.\n\n166\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.200\nAnd how much data was\nsent across the link.\n\n167\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.400\nThis can help us to establish time.\n\n168\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.270\nIt can help us to establish\nhow long that particular\n\n169\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.440\nconversation took place as\nyou're transferring files.\n\n170\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.390\nYou name it.\n\n171\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.800\nAnd it can tell you based,\nguessed on that.\n\n172\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.360\nBASE your GUESS on that information.\n\n173\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.320\nI don't know why I couldn't say that.\n\n174\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.130\nIt may actually show you gigs of data\nwere transferred off of your system.\n\n175\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.370\nOr maybe just several bytes of data\nwere transferred off of your system.\n\n176\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.000\nAll this can help as well.\n\n177\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.680\nOnce you actually\nunderstand the sending and\n\n178\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.080\nthe two end points involved\nin that conversation.\n\n179\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.510\nSo in session data itself, we're pretty\nmuch not looking at the entire thing.\n\n180\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.750\nWe're only looking at that one session.\n\n181\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.329\nThe way that we do that in\nWire Shark is fairly simple.\n\n182\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.580\nI can come in here and I can,\nlet's just say this one.\n\n183\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.650\nNotice I have a lot of them where\nthe source and destination are the same.\n\n184\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:41.690\nIf I right click here, I can come\ndown here to follow the TCP Stream\n\n185\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.460\ninformation and now I can actually\nstart seeing that stream.\n\n186\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.290\nNow the great thing is all this\nis kind of limited in this way.\n\n187\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.950\nBut then we can use that as a filter to\nmake sure that we're only filtering out\n\n188\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.370\nthat information between\nthe ones that we want to.\n\n189\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.790\nSo this one is only in stream 14 here.\n\n190\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.520\nAnd each one actually does give you that\nability to break that down a little bit\n\n191\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.930\nmore as you choose to apply that\nto whatever you need to as well.\n\n192\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.410\nSo here again, it's actually broken\ndown a little bit more in that way.\n\n193\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.450\nSo, it's all that information\nthat we're looking for.\n\n194\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.520\nIf you can get into it to actually find\nsource and destination, and how that call\n\n195\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.960\nwas set up, that is gonna be key for\nthe information that you're looking for.\n\n196\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.540\nThe other thing of course is transaction\ndata that we need to have in placed.\n\n197\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.480\nNow, this is where it got\na little bit tricky and\n\n198\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.640\ntrying to make sure that we\nunderstood what was talking about.\n\n199\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.700\nWhen I think about transactions I always\nthink about some like pay the card\n\n200\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.710\nindustry type of transactions.\n\n201\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.500\n&gt;&gt; Likewise.\n\n202\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Point of sales and stuff like that.\n\n203\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.900\nBut here in network security monitoring\nright the regular types of security\n\n204\n00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.700\nmonitoring we're really looking for\nthe transaction logs.\n\n205\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.760\nIn other words what has\nactually occurred between\n\n206\n00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.470\nthe application is what\nwe're really looking at.\n\n207\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.280\nSo did the application generate\nsome type of specific record\n\n208\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.470\nfrom the traffic that was sent or\nthat was received as well.\n\n209\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.350\nGives us a better understanding then\nof making sure that we understand what\n\n210\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.110\nthe request and what the replies\nactually were between the end points.\n\n211\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.250\nSo not only can we actually\ntell with session data.\n\n212\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.450\nThe nature of the call and how long\nsomething actually ended up taking here\n\n213\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.060\nthe transaction data really tells\nus hey what was actually requested.\n\n214\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.490\nAnd what was actually sent across and\nthe timing and\n\n215\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.650\neverything else that was also there\nthat may help us to pin point more and\n\n216\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.130\nmore details in terms of that\none particular transaction.\n\n217\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.800\nYou will see you data like this and\n\n218\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.660\nnormally this requires another system that\ncan kind of help you out a little bit\n\n219\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.930\nmore, but\nnormally that's what we're looking for\n\n220\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.640\nas we're trying to figure out, you know\n&gt;&gt; What has transpired.\n\n221\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nWell essentially what did,\n\n222\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.860\nnot only would did transpire here right\nBut where are those records kept.\n\n223\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.440\nAnd then that way we make sure we actually\nunderstand what transpired between those\n\n224\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.590\ntwo end points is also a key.\n\n225\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, what about statistical data.\n\n226\n00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Regular statistical\ndata of course is unusual.\n\n227\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.870\nThe very fact is we like\nthe idea of statistical data, but\n\n228\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.170\nmost of us rarely take a look\nat a lot of statistical data\n\n229\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.270\nbecause it's overwhelming in terms of the\nsheer numbers that we're talking about.\n\n230\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.780\nAnd that's because it also\nreports it in terms of bytes.\n\n231\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.680\nIt reports it in terms of conversations,\nTCP, you name it.\n\n232\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.340\nThere's a ton of different data for us.\n\n233\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.940\nBut this type of traffic\nthough normally gives us,\n\n234\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.680\nof course, everything about our network\nthat we really want, as far as this\n\n235\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.320\nperformance goes, when we're looking\nat statistics more than anything else.\n\n236\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.290\nWe can find the number of bytes in a file,\nhow much network data, start and\n\n237\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.370\nend times.\n\n238\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.980\nNormally, we can find all of\nthat information for us too.\n\n239\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.710\nSo the great thing is there's another\noption right here inside of WireShark\n\n240\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.100\nto help us out So on my screen, we'll\ngo ahead and take a look at these two.\n\n241\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.880\nAnd as here, depending on what you're\nlooking for, I can select statistics and\n\n242\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.760\nnow look at all of the examples that\nyou have that you can go by and\n\n243\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.680\nsee some of the different\nthings that may be happening.\n\n244\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.120\nUsually, something that's fairly\nsimple Such as packet counter here.\n\n245\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.020\nAnd there are some just basic statistics\nthat you can end up seeing here.\n\n246\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.990\nTotal responses, packets,\nnow I didn't do a lot on this machine.\n\n247\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.560\nBut that way, you can break it down if\nyou really have a busy type of network.\n\n248\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.820\nLet's see what types of\ntraffic is going on there.\n\n249\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.810\nTLS here so like that, and\nI can analyze or statistics again,\n\n250\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.970\nand see,\ncan I see other information, yeah.\n\n251\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.680\nYou can go ahead and take a look and\n\n252\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.390\nsee if there's anything,\nstatistics on all directions.\n\n253\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.920\nEven some like this can kind of be\nvery helpful about what IP addresses\n\n254\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.590\nare essentially dominating.\n\n255\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.076\nSo you can see like here, 52.\n\n256\n00:15:01.076 --> 00:15:04.590\nWhatever that is, 52.84.125.232, is sent.\n\n257\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.500\nWell, look at that, 345 out of what.\n\n258\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.320\n&gt;&gt; A lot more than the other types\nof IP addresses you have listed.\n\n259\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and right here,\nyes, you see whoo.\n\n260\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.100\nThat's pretty hefty when you start\ntalking about the percentage here.\n\n261\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.650\nA little bit over 50% of my\ntraffic It has, right here-\n\n262\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.060\n&gt;&gt; So by learning these tools, Ronnie,\n\n263\n00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.560\nwe can just use them to help us be\nmore efficient by quickly identifying\n\n264\n00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.210\ninstead of having to research and\nnot knowing where to go to look for them.\n\n265\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.870\nJust, it's really just about\ngetting familiar with them.\n\n266\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.280\n&gt;&gt; No doubt that this\nis more than helpful.\n\n267\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.870\nEspecially when you have a lot of\nmachines trying to figure out where\n\n268\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.970\ninformation's coming from,\nand where it's going.\n\n269\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.660\nThe other one is kind of the opposite of\nwhat we call full content of the data,\n\n270\n00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.720\nwhich is what we call off course\nthe extracted content itself.\n\n271\n00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.045\nWhen we talk about extracted content,\nthis is wierd,\n\n272\n00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:01.937\nbecause you might think it's just\na portion of the full content.\n\n273\n00:16:01.937 --> 00:16:05.703\nBut to a point everything that we've\ntalked about is a portion of the full\n\n274\n00:16:05.703 --> 00:16:06.268\nconcept.\n\n275\n00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:07.407\n&gt;&gt; Extracted, yeah.\n\n276\n00:16:07.407 --> 00:16:10.728\nBut overall though,\nwhen you talk about extracted data,\n\n277\n00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:15.510\nyou talk about files, images, and\nmedia transmitted between computers.\n\n278\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.810\nBut this time, we're not really\nlooking at the destination and\n\n279\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.790\nsource IP information or\nMAC addresses, or even the protocol.\n\n280\n00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:28.380\nWe're really trying to see what\nthe information itself really looks like.\n\n281\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.491\nAnd this is where you would follow that\nstream data that we already looked at.\n\n282\n00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.478\nAnd you're really looking for\n\n283\n00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:37.309\njust the basics of what was\nactually transmitted overall.\n\n284\n00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:38.814\n&gt;&gt; And looking at the sequence numbers and\n\n285\n00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:41.788\nthings like that to identify the types\nof conversations or communications.\n\n286\n00:16:41.788 --> 00:16:42.357\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:42.357 --> 00:16:43.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's\n\n288\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.920\npretty much just about it\nas far as extracted data.\n\n289\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.840\nAnd then lastly,\nalert data is kind of the weird one, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.780\nSo everything else happens naturally in\nthe course of just a transmission here.\n\n291\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.130\nAlert types of data is a response, right?\n\n292\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.860\nSo when something is\nactually made an alert,\n\n293\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.060\nit means that a decision has been\nmade to send some type of alert.\n\n294\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.960\nOne IP address takes over 50%.\n\n295\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.820\nI'm pretty sure you can say hey,\n\n296\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.244\nthere's a lot of traffic going on between-\n&gt;&gt; That warrants\n\n297\n00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:09.866\nsome kind of acknowledgement.\n\n298\n00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:11.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, acknowledgement.\n\n299\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.188\nAnd that means a system's in place that\nsaid, if this rises to that level,\n\n300\n00:17:15.188 --> 00:17:16.865\nlet me go ahead and send an alert out.\n\n301\n00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:18.206\n&gt;&gt; Like a quota.\n\n302\n00:17:18.206 --> 00:17:23.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does tend to be\nmore of a quota type of decision here.\n\n303\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.947\nSo this is when something like this\nsends you information which means, hey,\n\n304\n00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:31.426\nlevels are higher than what we\nexpect them to be, so much so\n\n305\n00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.430\nthat the system is notifying me.\n\n306\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.257\nAnd that generally of course indicates\nsome other problems that may exist as\n\n307\n00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:38.010\nwell, okay.\n\n308\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.400\nSo, overall, though, those are kind of the\nbasic forms of the traffic that we have.\n\n309\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.714\nSo we had full packet capture, okay,\nsession data, transaction data,\n\n310\n00:17:47.714 --> 00:17:51.720\nI'm trying to make sure I'm\nremembering all of them.\n\n311\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.740\n&gt;&gt; Statistical data,\nextracted content, and alert data.\n\n312\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.650\nSo, Ronnie, why do we need all\nthese different ways to look and\n\n313\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.710\nview this information?\n\n314\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.550\nWhat's the point?\n\n315\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, the point is the very fact\nthat you've gotta understand something.\n\n316\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.790\nAttackers know how to get\naround our traditional ways of\n\n317\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.190\ndetecting intrusions a lot of times, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.279\nSo in other words,\nyour intrusion detection signatures today,\n\n319\n00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:17.260\nI'm not saying that they don't work, but\nmost of the people that are sophisticated\n\n320\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.580\nenough today,\nthey know how to get around them.\n\n321\n00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.160\nAnd in that sense,\nyou gotta worry about that.\n\n322\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.527\nAnd so the only way for you to deal with\nthat is to find out all the data that's\n\n323\n00:18:25.527 --> 00:18:28.890\ngoing across your network and\nbe able to know what you're looking for.\n\n324\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.966\nAnd this is where it begins.\n\n325\n00:18:29.966 --> 00:18:33.260\n&gt;&gt; So you're kind of finding\na perfect marriage of\n\n326\n00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.390\nutilizing an automated system\nplus that human intelligence,\n\n327\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.110\nto kind of really just be at\nthe top of your game here, right?\n\n328\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.680\n&gt;&gt; It really does begin that way, right?\n\n329\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.450\nYou have to.\n\n330\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.280\nYou have to begin with\nunderstanding something that,\n\n331\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.840\nlook, my regular protection methods,\nyou don't think that way.\n\n332\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.040\nYou always think from the standpoint,\nsomebody's gonna get into the system, so\n\n333\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.410\nwhat do I need to do?\n\n334\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.250\nIf they know how to bypass that,\nwhat do I need?\n\n335\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.330\nI need to be able to find\na way to track it, to find it.\n\n336\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.230\nAnd the one thing that they can't get\naround is leaving traces of information\n\n337\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.970\neverywhere across your systems.\n\n338\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.784\nSo if you can pull out everything,\nokay, and figure out and\n\n339\n00:19:07.784 --> 00:19:09.980\npull only the information\nyou need from that,\n\n340\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.010\nthen that's gonna help you\nout as far as an attack goes.\n\n341\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.890\nAnother thing, of course,\nis after the attack.\n\n342\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.900\nBeing able to analyze\nthe data itself is also key.\n\n343\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.660\nIt's what we call some type of\nretrospective analysis is what we're\n\n344\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.770\ntalking about here.\n\n345\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.190\nThe very fact is,\nlearning from our past mistakes or\n\n346\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:29.200\nlearning from past intrusions may help us\nto detect it faster and easier next time.\n\n347\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.200\nSo it is a kind of repetitive process, but\nis an important process for us as well.\n\n348\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.800\nSo do make sure that you\nunderstand that too, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.260\nNetwork security monitoring\nsystems are also important.\n\n350\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.009\n&gt;&gt; Are there any drawbacks to looking\nat all this information, Ronnie?\n\n351\n00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, always.\n\n352\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.680\nOkay, like anything else, right,\neverything has a cost to it.\n\n353\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.438\nThe more monitoring you do,\nthe more that you run Wireshark,\n\n354\n00:19:50.438 --> 00:19:52.450\nthe more that you do stuff, right?\n\n355\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.620\nIt taxes certain systems out\nif you have to turn things on,\n\n356\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.950\nif they have to be diverted\ninto other components here.\n\n357\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.865\nYou gotta realize that it\nrequires manpower, you name it.\n\n358\n00:20:01.865 --> 00:20:03.110\nThere are certain things here.\n\n359\n00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.410\nThe other thing that also impacts us a\nlot, and anything that I've shown you here\n\n360\n00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.110\ntoday, is the ability of NAT,\nright, network address translation.\n\n361\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.780\nIt obfuscates who's actually\nreally connecting to what.\n\n362\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.800\nSo you don't really know if\nyou're getting a true source\n\n363\n00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.460\naddress sometimes, or if you're not.\n\n364\n00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:26.490\nSo NAT can actually impact and obfuscate\nsource and destination addresses too.\n\n365\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.135\nThe higher the volume of\ntraffic that you monitor.\n\n366\n00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:34.690\nIf you're saying, I want every single\nbyte of data for a year to be captured.\n\n367\n00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.690\nSheesh, that's a lot of data, okay.\n\n368\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.840\nOn a busy network, it's incredible.\n\n369\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.510\nAnd it can overwhelm certain types of\nnetwork security monitoring platforms.\n\n370\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.840\nAnd you've got to be aware of that too,\nokay.\n\n371\n00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.890\nThe other thing of course\nis your particular\n\n372\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.360\nsecurity policies that are in place.\n\n373\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.130\nRemember, just because you\ncan monitor everything,\n\n374\n00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.850\ndoesn't mean you should\nmonitor everything.\n\n375\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.240\nBecause some people really\ndo have privacy concerns.\n\n376\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.410\nDepending on what state or\nwhat country you're living in,\n\n377\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.360\nyou gotta know the rules and\nregulations for that as well.\n\n378\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.500\nIt may not be acceptable that you monitor\nevery single bit of data coming from\n\n379\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.270\nmy personal computer,\neven though I'm using your network.\n\n380\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n&gt;&gt; It actually depends on\n\n381\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.450\nwhatever policies are in place and\nregulations are in place too.\n\n382\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.310\nSo monitoring here, great to do.\n\n383\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.290\nBut hopefully that means everything else\nis in place for you to be able to do so.\n\n384\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.050\nNormally, for us, it's just understanding\nthat we have the ability to do so.\n\n385\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.040\nAnd always look at it from the standpoint,\n\n386\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.980\nsomebody could have\ngotten into the systems.\n\n387\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.170\nAnd that's where you start off with\nunderstanding that this is why we need\n\n388\n00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:38.798\nall the data.\n\n389\n00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:39.509\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n390\n00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:43.060\nWell, it looks like we were able to\ngo ahead and cover our checklist,\n\n391\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.050\nthe topics we needed to.\n\n392\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.150\nDo you have any final thoughts here,\nRonnie?\n\n393\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.070\n&gt;&gt; No really additional thoughts, itself.\n\n394\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.880\nBut just make sure that you pay attention\n\n395\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.930\nthose particular types of\ndata that we have to catch.\n\n396\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.130\nAnd understand at least a summary of them.\n\n397\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.688\nWe may have gone a little bit overboard\nin trying to show you everything, okay.\n\n398\n00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:05.880\nBut overall, though, you need to\nunderstand that in basic types of network\n\n399\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.800\nsecurity monitoring, here is the types of\ndata that you are going to be looking for.\n\n400\n00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.150\nAnd don't overlook that,\ncuz it can be very easy to overlook that.\n\n401\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.439\nAnd at least on the exam, get a few\nquestions wrong, just by not knowing.\n\n402\n00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:21.210\n&gt;&gt; By not looking at those details.\n\n403\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.209\nBecause sometimes you can find some really\ngood information within those really\n\n404\n00:22:25.209 --> 00:22:26.217\ntiny details, so.\n\n405\n00:22:26.217 --> 00:22:27.810\n&gt;&gt; And then security monitoring.\n\n406\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.590\nYou've got to know how to do it all.\n\n407\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.410\nSo we just kinda at least\ntalked to you about it.\n\n408\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.049\nWe didn't show you anything really in\ndepth here on security monitoring.\n\n409\n00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:37.111\nBut just be aware that\nit's all out there and\n\n410\n00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:39.191\nit's available to you to learn more about.\n\n411\n00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, perfect, thank you Ronnie.\n\n412\n00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.820\nAnd that you so much, ladies and\ngentlemen, for joining us today.\n\n413\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.680\nBut stay tuned,\n\n414\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.290\nwe do have some more Cisco cybersecurity\nfundamentals information headed your way.\n\n415\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.100\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n416\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n417\n00:22:51.930 -->

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.415\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.295\nIn this episode,\nwe will be describing monitoring context.\n\n8\n00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:25.075\nWith us today we have with us\nMr Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.675\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:27.285\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.685\nhaving me back as we continue on\nin our cybersecurity fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:34.610\nIt is really for\nus now moving into the realm of context.\n\n13\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.120\nWe've already taken a look at where we\ncan get information from different device\n\n14\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.140\nsystems that are designed for monitoring\nlike the Next Generation IPS events and\n\n15\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.170\nsomething like\nCisco's FirePOWER Management Center,\n\n16\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.710\nwe can always get events\nout of those things.\n\n17\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.580\nWe've also talked about, of course,\nnetwork security monitoring before.\n\n18\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.130\nWe talked about using statistical data and\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.830\nwe understand that there's a lot of\ninformation that we need to gather.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.060\nBut we also need to know how to\nactually get access to that data,\n\n21\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.490\nas well, especially on devices and\non some of those different things\n\n22\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.530\nthat we have to be monitoring and\nwhat we're really looking for.\n\n23\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.050\nSo, we're gonna jump in to not only some\nof the devices but some of the different\n\n24\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.230\ntechnology and how do we actually see that\ntechnology working inside of our systems.\n\n25\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.390\nSome of them we'll just talk about but\nsome of them we'll actually show here.\n\n26\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.570\nSo in that way we can make sure we\nunderstand what we're taking to look at.\n\n27\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.110\nSo the very beginning,\nwe're gonna start off fairly simply,\n\n28\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400\nwhere just about all Cisco security\nkinda has its fundamental root,\n\n29\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480\nwhich is the idea of access control lists.\n\n30\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.820\nI was about to say context control list.\n\n31\n00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.230\nBut access control list is where\nwe're beginning here, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.690\nSo when it comes down to\naccess control lists,\n\n33\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.210\nthe difficult thing for\nthe Cyber Ops CCNA, right.\n\n34\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.190\nAs you go in this,\n\n35\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.440\nit really doesn't require that you have\na background in networking at all.\n\n36\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.330\nWe do a little bit of a networking review\nat the very beginning of this series\n\n37\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.670\nto make sure that you have at least\nthe foundational concepts down.\n\n38\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.580\nIt doesn't really jump into\nthe idea here of being able to see\n\n39\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780\nthings like access control lists or\nNetwork Address Translation,\n\n40\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.660\nhow that's configured and\nwhere you go and do some things.\n\n41\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.310\nWe do show you a little bit of it.\n\n42\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.140\nBut overall though, just kind of realize,\n\n43\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.950\nwe need to understand some\nof those fundamentals there.\n\n44\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.610\nSo that's where we're gonna start.\n\n45\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670\nNow when we start talking\nabout access control,\n\n46\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.760\nit's now Cherokee, if you kinda remember,\naccess control lists are really\n\n47\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.980\nsomething that we have two\ndifferent flavors of them.\n\n48\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.960\nOne's called standard and\nones called extended.\n\n49\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.660\nDo you remember the difference by chance?\n\n50\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Something to do with parameters being\ndefinitive but I don't know exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.242\n&gt;&gt; No that's fine, that's a great\nplace for us to review this then,\n\n52\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.864\nbecause it really does help\nout when we start to look and\n\n53\n00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:48.982\nwe start seeing information that comes in.\n\n54\n00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:52.312\nSo remember that with\nStandard Access Control List, okay,\n\n55\n00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:55.610\nit only takes a look at\nthe source IP address, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.080\nIt doesn't care where you're\ntrying to connect to.\n\n57\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.530\nIt doesn't care what traffic\nyou're trying to send.\n\n58\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.410\nIt doesn't care what protocol your using.\n\n59\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.410\nYou name it, It doesn't care at all.\n\n60\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.630\nIt just says, look,\nI'm gonna use that source IP address and\n\n61\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.720\nthere's two factors here.\n\n62\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.580\nI'm either gonna permit it or\nI'm gonna not.\n\n63\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.000\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n64\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.580\nSo it doesn't care beyond that point.\n\n65\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.910\nWhen we set that access control\nlist up inside the router,\n\n66\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.030\nwe also have to have step number two\nwhich is top apply it to an interface.\n\n67\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.460\nSo we create the control list on the\nrouter, but then we pick an interface and\n\n68\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.560\nwe say, all right on this interface,\nI am either going to block\n\n69\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.270\nthis source address or I'm going to permit\nthe source address to go through it.\n\n70\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.971\nSo normally,\nwhen you start to do this, right,\n\n71\n00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:41.980\nat the very beginning you\nhave to at least know that.\n\n72\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.253\nThe other thing that you need to know is\nusually by default, when you create one\n\n73\n00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:50.884\nof these standard access control lists,\nyou have a limitation in terms of numbers.\n\n74\n00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:55.370\nAnd that's number one through 99,\nis what it normally is.\n\n75\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.700\nSo, anything like that,\nthat's the one that you can make.\n\n76\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.930\nNow, or actually,\nmaybe one through a hundred.\n\n77\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.520\nLet's take a look at my router here, and\n\n78\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.260\nthat will help us out a little bit,\nall right.\n\n79\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.710\nSo let me see,\nif I can get access in here.\n\n80\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.380\nAnd we'll make a configuration, so let's\nsay I'm gonna create a access control\n\n81\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.350\nlist, which is gonna be access-list,\nand now here's the listing here.\n\n82\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.620\nSo I was right one through 99.\n\n83\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.320\nI don't know why I\nthought it was 100 here.\n\n84\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.290\nBut one through 99 that gives you\nthis Standard Access Control List,\n\n85\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.280\nand this is only based\non source IP address.\n\n86\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.100\nSo that is key.\n\n87\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.196\nIf you start seeing an access list and\nthen a number behind it that begins with\n\n88\n00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:39.492\n100 going through 199, that of course\nwill be the extended access list.\n\n89\n00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:40.470\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n\n90\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.290\n&gt;&gt; And this one though,\nactually does depend on source and\n\n91\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.100\nIP address but\nas well as protocol too, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.779\nSo this one will allow me to actually\npermit or deny based on both source and\n\n93\n00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.481\nIP address, and\nbased on the idea of the protocol as well.\n\n94\n00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.951\nNow there's a whole bunch of other\nones that are listed here, but\n\n95\n00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:03.852\nat this point those are kind\nof the two basic ones that we\n\n96\n00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:06.970\nwant to make sure that we\npay attention to, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.370\nSo if we have that in mind,\nwe can really kind of tell a lot.\n\n98\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.980\nSometimes what you'll end up seeing,\n\n99\n00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.540\nof course, is it will be\na result of something, right?\n\n100\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.620\nSo let's say, for example,\nthat Ronnie as an end user,\n\n101\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.720\nsays that what he wants to do is,\nhe wants to go out to ITProTV,\n\n102\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.170\nyou'll probably see I'm pretty\nloyal to our site here.\n\n103\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.100\nAnd so\nI don't tend to use any other example.\n\n104\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.910\nBut notice that it's not connecting.\n\n105\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.622\nWell, normally of course that\nmeans that the end user will go,\n\n106\n00:05:34.622 --> 00:05:36.200\nwhy isn't it connecting?\n\n107\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.450\nBob over there is connecting.\n\n108\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.290\nCherokee is able to connect.\n\n109\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.140\nBut Ronnie is not able to connect.\n\n110\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.440\nWell, that could be many things.\n\n111\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.750\nBut overall though, let's say that you\nsuspect it's an access control list.\n\n112\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.700\nOn how can you prove that,\nis what we want to do.\n\n113\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.561\nSo we can go into the router then.\n\n114\n00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:55.884\nAnd then do a show.\n\n115\n00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:59.012\nOops, show ip\n\n116\n00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:04.120\naccess-list and then you can see that\n\n117\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.390\nthere's two different access control list\nthat have been set up on this one machine.\n\n118\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:16.455\nAnd I would simply need to find out\nRonnie's IP address which is 10.0.47.100\n\n119\n00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:22.876\nand I can tell that right now it says\na deny statement It's matched 982 times.\n\n120\n00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, have you been trying to\nthe ITPro site that many times?\n\n121\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.055\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n122\n00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:28.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to it, yes,\n\n123\n00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:30.820\nyou start seeing, now,\nthis is actually saying what?\n\n124\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.160\nIt doesn't really matter\nabout the destination, right?\n\n125\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160\nSo this is my machine just\nconnected to the internet and\n\n126\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.605\nevery time that something is trying to\nget through that interface is saying,\n\n127\n00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:43.960\nnow you have this IP address I'm\nnot gonna allow it to get through.\n\n128\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.810\nThat's all it's really saying here.\n\n129\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.160\nSo, It's kind of neat and\nthe very fact that you can verify and\n\n130\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.840\nyou can prove it was\nsomething just this simple.\n\n131\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.702\nOkay, is being able to actually\nmatch something like that up,\n\n132\n00:06:55.702 --> 00:06:56.844\nwhere it's doing this.\n\n133\n00:06:56.844 --> 00:07:02.090\nNow, notice the other one here,\nwhich is an extended access list.\n\n134\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.410\nAnd on this one it says,\n\n135\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.930\nhey, I'm permitting something\nto go through instead.\n\n136\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you might have already\ncovered this, so don't shoot me here,\n\n137\n00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.020\nbut are we talking about level two or\nlevel three addressing?\n\n138\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.370\nBecause if you're receiving\nyour IP address dynamically and\n\n139\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.200\nwe set a rule based upon\nyour IP address to block\n\n140\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.710\nyou from going to a certain website, well,\nwhat happens if you get a new IP address?\n\n141\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, it would actually not apply,\nthen, right?\n\n142\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.160\nSo it's fairly simple here,\nthat if my address changes, and\n\n143\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.270\nit can,\nif I'm doing dynamic IP addressing,\n\n144\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.400\ndefinitely we would end up where\nthis rule would no longer apply.\n\n145\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.090\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n146\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Now what happens, though,\nif it no longer applies, right?\n\n147\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.750\nOkay, so let's try this.\n\n148\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.340\nLet's do this very thing here and\nsee what happens.\n\n149\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.920\nSo I'm just on a simple machine.\n\n150\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.261\nAnd we'll come in here to my.\n\n151\n00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.330\nOoh, I don't have to go there.\n\n152\n00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.419\nI just need to go into\nmy Network Preferences.\n\n153\n00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:57.998\nAnd we'll take a look\nat this one connection.\n\n154\n00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:02.070\nAnd there is the connection\nthat I have available to us.\n\n155\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.531\nNow, let's see if I can change that.\n\n156\n00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:15.508\nSo now, if I change this to Manually,\n10.0.47, and we'll just give it a number.\n\n157\n00:08:15.508 --> 00:08:18.561\nOkay, I don't know which one,\nwe'll do 115 instead.\n\n158\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.107\nSo what I told you is that that\nrule should not actually apply.\n\n159\n00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:25.778\nSo I'll go ahead and hit Apply here.\n\n160\n00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:29.310\nIt shows me that I am still connected,\nI see the little green dot.\n\n161\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.030\nSo I know that I can get out there.\n\n162\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.730\nSo, what do you think, Cherokee,\nshould I'll be able to connect or not?\n\n163\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.445\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif I believe what you just told me,\n\n164\n00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:39.634\nthen now that you have a different IP\naddress, you should be able to connect.\n\n165\n00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:40.553\nThat's my thought.\n\n166\n00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.037\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see.\n\n167\n00:08:42.037 --> 00:08:42.802\nNo.\n\n168\n00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:43.791\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n169\n00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.530\nNow, when you start going,\nwhy didn't that connect?\n\n170\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.081\nWell, that's something you definitely\nneed to pay attention to as well.\n\n171\n00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.261\nBecause you don't know enough about this\nlist just from seeing this here, okay.\n\n172\n00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:58.819\nThe reason why you don't know enough about\nit is that at the end of every single\n\n173\n00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:01.767\naccess control list,\nwhether it is an extended or\n\n174\n00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:06.630\nwhether it's actually a standard,\nthere is an implicit deny rule.\n\n175\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.450\nSo is this actually matching up something?\n\n176\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.501\nWell, let's try and\nsee if we can take a look at that.\n\n177\n00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:15.672\nSo I'm gonna do a show run on this router.\n\n178\n00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:18.876\nAnd now I'm gonna look for\nthe access control list.\n\n179\n00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.721\nSometimes you have to\nkind of scroll through.\n\n180\n00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:25.320\nAnd here I can see the access list itself.\n\n181\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.190\nNow, when you start to take a look at that\nlist, you go, okay, what's the big deal?\n\n182\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.470\nThat's exactly what you type in.\n\n183\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.280\nBut remember that even though it actually\nlooks like a single entry on this,\n\n184\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.150\nit's really two entries\nbecause of that implicit deny.\n\n185\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.525\nThere's actually an implicit right after\nthis that says access-list 1 deny any,\n\n186\n00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:44.044\nis what it actually is.\n\n187\n00:09:44.044 --> 00:09:45.947\nNow, can I make that happen?\n\n188\n00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:47.085\nLet's see.\n\n189\n00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:51.985\nI do a config access-list 1,\n\n190\n00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:56.810\nand I can go ahead and do that.\n\n191\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.033\nI can say I want to deny any.\n\n192\n00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.840\nAnd this time I'm gonna\nenter in the word log.\n\n193\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.370\nNow, let's do show run again.\n\n194\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.360\nLet me get all the way down here\ntoward the end where we saw the access\n\n195\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.870\ncontrol list.\n\n196\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.820\nAnd now we'll see something else.\n\n197\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.750\nSo notice this is still access list 1, but\n\n198\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.410\nnow I've also put in\na second entry to log this.\n\n199\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.610\nAnd by doing this, it gives me that\nability now to be able to say,\n\n200\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.160\nhey, look, I'm gonna create this\nlog entry for this machine or for\n\n201\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.380\nanything that says, hey,\nit's trying to connect.\n\n202\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.060\nThat's gonna block this rule.\n\n203\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.408\nSo let me try this again, ITProTV.\n\n204\n00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:37.788\nSo now close out.\n\n205\n00:10:37.788 --> 00:10:38.867\nIt says that.\n\n206\n00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:40.983\nNow, if we go back to the router,\n\n207\n00:10:40.983 --> 00:10:45.149\nit was not really happy with what\nI'm doing here, that's fine.\n\n208\n00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:50.595\ndo show ip access-list.\n\n209\n00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:52.546\n&gt;&gt; We should see that\ninformation now in the log.\n\n210\n00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:56.000\n&gt;&gt; And\nnow notice that it says right there.\n\n211\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.280\nSo sometimes you've gotta remember that.\n\n212\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.135\nNow, this is not always something good,\nright?\n\n213\n00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:04.500\nDon't always log every single deny,\ncuz that can fill up very quickly.\n\n214\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.189\nBut just make sure that you\nunderstand that it is still there and\n\n215\n00:11:07.189 --> 00:11:09.176\nthat's something that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n216\n00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:11.323\nAnd if you're not sure, turn it on.\n\n217\n00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:15.530\nBut then in the end here, you wanna, oops.\n\n218\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.805\nLet me see if I can\nactually get back there.\n\n219\n00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:24.691\nNo access-list 1.\n\n220\n00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:32.796\nAnd this is gonna be any,\nor, yeah, deny any.\n\n221\n00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:36.900\nAnd just take that away and\nnow it will do it, okay.\n\n222\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.720\nSo now it's saying, hey,\nlook I'm denying this.\n\n223\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.410\nIt's showing me the logs and\neverything else that's going on.\n\n224\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.860\nSo I am still not permitted to go in.\n\n225\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.845\nNow, if I wanted to make sure that\nthis address could go in, right,\n\n226\n00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:52.876\nI would do access-list 1 and\nthen I would permit any.\n\n227\n00:11:57.068 --> 00:11:59.940\nAnd it's the order of\nthis list that matters.\n\n228\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.584\nIt depends on where that permit\nany landed here in this series.\n\n229\n00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:11.960\nSo now I got rid of one, and now I can\nactually allow for anything to go through.\n\n230\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.055\nSo, this time,\nlet's see if now I can get through.\n\n231\n00:12:18.055 --> 00:12:18.845\nOops.\n\n232\n00:12:18.845 --> 00:12:19.751\nLet me see here.\n\n233\n00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.553\nMaybe I didn't,\nthe DNS server, that's right.\n\n234\n00:12:22.553 --> 00:12:25.956\nIt was complaining about\nthat earlier here.\n\n235\n00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:27.036\nLet me just remove it.\n\n236\n00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:34.370\nThat way we can get rid of that.\n\n237\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.000\nAnd now hopefully everything is done.\n\n238\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.415\nUnless I have messed up here.\n\n239\n00:12:38.415 --> 00:12:41.173\nI was trying to make sure.\n\n240\n00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:49.554\nAll right, well,\nwhy isn't that working here?\n\n241\n00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:52.560\nI don't think I put in a DNS address,\ndid I?\n\n242\n00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.888\nThat could be my fault.\n\n243\n00:12:53.888 --> 00:12:55.250\n&gt;&gt; When you went to manual there.\n\n244\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me see.\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's check.\n\n245\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.423\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me see here.\n\n246\n00:12:58.423 --> 00:13:00.316\nI bet you that is all my fault.\n\n247\n00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:07.319\nI didn't put in a DNS server,\nthat's probably why.\n\n248\n00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:17.073\n&gt;&gt; So, you're just gonna be using 8.8.8.8,\nthat's a Google public DNS server.\n\n249\n00:13:17.073 --> 00:13:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep, just going ahead and\nloading it in here.\n\n250\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.390\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n251\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.870\nHopefully everything else will now work.\n\n252\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's check it out.\n\n253\n00:13:27.768 --> 00:13:28.557\n&gt;&gt; Give it a moment.\n\n254\n00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:29.428\nThere we go.\n\n255\n00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:30.995\nWe're now able to get back in.\n\n256\n00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:31.738\n&gt;&gt; That's what it was.\n\n257\n00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:35.115\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it was just me messing up,\nforgetting to put in a DNS server,\n\n258\n00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.170\nwondering why it wasn't working.\n\n259\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.270\nBut now I have that same address,\neven though I took out that initial one.\n\n260\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:41.770\nSo this time.\n\n261\n00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:50.527\nIf I go back in,\naccess-list deny 10.0.47.100.\n\n262\n00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:56.031\nI forgot a 1 here.\n\n263\n00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:57.831\nThere we go.\n\n264\n00:13:57.831 --> 00:14:01.870\nThat should kind of eliminate that\nfirst address like we had it.\n\n265\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.575\nBut I might have, this is another thing\nthat you also have to pay attention to.\n\n266\n00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:10.092\nThe order of these is what I\nwas trying to get at, as well.\n\n267\n00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:12.739\nSo sometimes the order\nof this information.\n\n268\n00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:18.630\nSo now it actually replaced that\nany that I had put there instead.\n\n269\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.758\nBut usually when you\nstarting putting them in,\n\n270\n00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:24.389\nthey would normally start at the very top\nof the list and they work their way down.\n\n271\n00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:26.374\nAnd that's something you've\ngotta pay attention to as well.\n\n272\n00:14:26.374 --> 00:14:31.894\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying here is just that\nthe specific rules that are listed higher\n\n273\n00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:37.900\non this list have a higher precedence, so\nthey kind of override any preceding rules.\n\n274\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.725\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not that they're preceding,\nright, it's the very fact that they're\n\n275\n00:14:40.725 --> 00:14:42.662\nhigher on the list,\nthey're gonna get processed first.\n\n276\n00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n277\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.924\nwhatever the first matching one is,\nthat's the way it's gonna work.\n\n278\n00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:48.246\nBut just kind of pay attention there,\nright.\n\n279\n00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:51.353\nIf you're taking a look and\nyou're wondering why things are blocked,\n\n280\n00:14:51.353 --> 00:14:52.854\nand you're on the router itself,\n\n281\n00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:55.596\nmake sure you know how to get to\nthese access control lists, and\n\n282\n00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:58.950\nat least verify that information\nthat you have ready to go, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.100\nSo that will help you to view that too.\n\n284\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.100\nNow, the other one that we're also\ngonna take look at is of course what\n\n285\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.480\nwe call network address translation and\n\n286\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.830\neven port address translation is\nwhat we want to get to as well.\n\n287\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.166\nNetwork address translation and\nport address translation,\n\n288\n00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:20.273\nvery important in the process of\neverything that we do when we're connected\n\n289\n00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:24.957\nin an internal network that's using\nprivate IP addresses, RFC1918 addresses,\n\n290\n00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.997\nand then we're connecting\nout to the public internet.\n\n291\n00:15:27.997 --> 00:15:30.462\nWithout the network address\ntranslation service,\n\n292\n00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.653\nyou're not going to be able to get out,\nokay.\n\n293\n00:15:32.653 --> 00:15:36.421\nSo, unless you only have one device,\nwhich normally is your router.\n\n294\n00:15:36.421 --> 00:15:40.218\nAnd you're going to be using that as your\nstandalone desktop every single day.\n\n295\n00:15:40.218 --> 00:15:42.494\n&gt;&gt; And not even home networks\nonly have one device nowadays.\n\n296\n00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.060\n&gt;&gt; It would be hard to find one.\n\n298\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.650\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty harsh to be\nable to find one here, okay?\n\n299\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.912\nSo when we start talking\nabout the idea of NAT,\n\n300\n00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:53.630\nthere's really two versions that\nare called out on the exam specifically.\n\n301\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.090\nAnd that is what we call static NAT,\n\n302\n00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.430\nwhich is a one-to-one\nnetwork address translation.\n\n303\n00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.426\nYou have a single public IP address.\n\n304\n00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:04.164\nYou have a single private IP address, and\n\n305\n00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:06.590\nthat's the one that\nthey normally call out.\n\n306\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.025\n&gt;&gt; But, Ronnie wouldn't I have to purchase\nadditional IP address from my ISP if I\n\n307\n00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:11.855\nwanted to use a one to\none ratio like that?\n\n308\n00:16:11.855 --> 00:16:13.354\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif you have more then one device, yes.\n\n309\n00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n310\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you have more then one device,\n\n311\n00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.170\nyou definitely would.\n\n312\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.940\nBut not necessarily.\n\n313\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.310\nAnd the reason why is because\nif you're using Static, yes.\n\n314\n00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.894\nIf you had everybody on the inside and\n\n315\n00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.415\nyou needed everybody to have\ntheir own public IP address.\n\n316\n00:16:28.415 --> 00:16:31.408\nYou definitely would\nhave to purchase more.\n\n317\n00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:35.899\nBut there is something that we call\nNAT Overload in the Cisco world.\n\n318\n00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:39.110\nBut technically everybody else\ncalls it port address translation.\n\n319\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.800\nAnd Cisco is moving to\nthat terminology as well.\n\n320\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.490\nWhich we can take a single public\nIP address and overload it.\n\n321\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.198\nIn other words, make it actually be\nable to link to more than one internal\n\n322\n00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:54.059\nprivate IP address as well.\n\n323\n00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:56.772\nSo when you start seeing\ninformation like this,\n\n324\n00:16:56.772 --> 00:17:00.950\nyou need to be able to see where you end\nup finding this type of information.\n\n325\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.982\nSo let's take a look at my router,\nand when we take a look here,\n\n326\n00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.178\nnow I don't have a lot\nof devices plugged in.\n\n327\n00:17:06.178 --> 00:17:12.321\nI have my laptop, so\nit's not gonna show a lot here,\n\n328\n00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:19.080\nbut show IP NAT translations\nis where it begins okay.\n\n329\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.740\nSo show IP NAT translations and\n\n330\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.790\nyou can see right here where\nit actually does translate.\n\n331\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.560\nAnd this is what you're looking for.\n\n332\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.505\nIf your table is not filling up or\n\n333\n00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:32.406\nif there's nothing it tells you\nNAT is not functioning, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:33.300\nIt's pretty much what it tells you.\n\n335\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.820\nAnd if it's not functioning\nnobody's connecting out.\n\n336\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.520\nOkay, now, this is fairly dynamic here.\n\n337\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.260\nAnd, you'll see, that there are a lot\nof connections that my machine had been\n\n338\n00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.660\nmaking, or the router has been making.\n\n339\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.410\nAnd then, there is ip nat statistics,\nwhich I can't spell.\n\n340\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.570\nAnd, this is also something else\nyou want to be able to note too.\n\n341\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:03.370\nNotice the total active translations\n51 dynamic translations, no static.\n\n342\n00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:08.030\nIf you're expecting a static translation,\nshould be there.\n\n343\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.060\nIf you're not expecting it,\n\n344\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.190\nwell, you definitely don't want to see\nthat, is what you want to take a look at.\n\n345\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.000\nAlso included in this,\nwill help you out in the configuration.\n\n346\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.676\nUsually the most missed part of NAT\n\n347\n00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:26.065\nconfiguration is gonna be right here,\nokay?\n\n348\n00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:30.230\nNAT, just like access control list,\ntakes two parts, right?\n\n349\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.312\nIn access control list, remember\nyou create the access control list.\n\n350\n00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.660\nAnd then you have to apply it to\nthe interface, with NAT, the same thing.\n\n351\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.616\nYou create the NAT rule that\nyou actually wanna create.\n\n352\n00:18:39.616 --> 00:18:43.190\nAnd normally actually do\nthat in two parts as well.\n\n353\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.656\nWhere you create a rule and\nthen you create the NAT statement itself.\n\n354\n00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:53.430\nAnd then you have to say which interface\nis facing your outside network.\n\n355\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.330\nAnd then which interface\nis your inside network.\n\n356\n00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.250\nAnd notice right here\nI have two interfaces.\n\n357\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.540\nOkay, so\nthis one gives me two sub interfaces.\n\n358\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.280\nI can have as many\ninterfaces as I want to.\n\n359\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.490\nThat will translate itself in that\none single public IP address.\n\n360\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.990\nSo this will give you\nthat information as well.\n\n361\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.010\nOkay, so it gives you that\nability to see this information.\n\n362\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.750\nSo that we can make some\nuse of it as we need to.\n\n363\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.780\nSo, Cherokee,\nthere's also a big discussion there.\n\n364\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.280\nWhat do you think?\n\n365\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.360\nIs NAT a security implementation or\nis it not?\n\n366\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.810\n&gt;&gt; I think it could be because you're\nconcealing the identity of those internal\n\n367\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.860\nIP addresses, web server for instance.\n\n368\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.550\nAnd maybe you want it to be accessible.\n\n369\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.750\nBut you don't want that IP address to\nbe known by others on the internet.\n\n370\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, everybody has\nthis discussion on whether or\n\n371\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.810\nnot it really is security or not.\n\n372\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.090\nOkay, and this is big and it's been\nbrewing for years and years and years.\n\n373\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.810\nOkay, so, depending on who you talk to,\nsome people say,\n\n374\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.880\nno there's no security involved.\n\n375\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.930\nThe only thing it's doing\nis taking your address.\n\n376\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.746\nTranslating into this other address,\nwhat big security isn't?\n\n377\n00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:06.987\nBut you're obfuscating at the least here,\nright,\n\n378\n00:20:06.987 --> 00:20:09.722\nthe number of devices you have internally.\n\n379\n00:20:09.722 --> 00:20:14.610\nAnd that's kind of the most basic\nform of what you can do there as\n\n380\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.970\nfar as the number of IP addresses go.\n\n381\n00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.260\nAt least you don't expose\nthat to everybody else.\n\n382\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.433\nSo in Cisco world,\nespecially on the cybersecurity exam,\n\n383\n00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:30.278\nthey do list it underneath the idea\nof security monitoring context.\n\n384\n00:20:30.278 --> 00:20:30.907\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n385\n00:20:30.907 --> 00:20:35.809\n&gt;&gt; So don't, even though you might have\nyour personal qualms about is NAT really\n\n386\n00:20:35.809 --> 00:20:39.318\na security context that I've\ngot to worry about, yes.\n\n387\n00:20:39.318 --> 00:20:42.953\n[LAUGH] Okay, so-\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it goes into that concept\n\n388\n00:20:42.953 --> 00:20:46.281\nof every little tiny thing that you\ndo just adds to the overall security.\n\n389\n00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:49.854\nBecause it's not like a light switch\nthat we can just flip on and say, hey,\n\n390\n00:20:49.854 --> 00:20:50.720\nI'm secure now.\n\n391\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.810\nIt's all these little tiny things\nthat really add up in my opinion.\n\n392\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.340\n&gt;&gt; It really is, but it is something\nthat most of us will have to get\n\n393\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.180\npast if we want to go on the exam here.\n\n394\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.760\nYeah, as far as security goes,\n\n395\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.920\nit really doesn't provide any\nexact gigantic barrier, right.\n\n396\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.020\nBut it is doing something.\n\n397\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.560\nIt is separating out a public\nnetwork from your private network\n\n398\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.380\nin the technology itself.\n\n399\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.430\nBut if you read on the internet,\nyou open up a blog and say,\n\n400\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.810\nis NAT a security device?\n\n401\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.344\nAnd you'll see, no, no, no, no.\n\n402\n00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.836\nBut you'll still see some that\nwill call it out and say,\n\n403\n00:21:21.836 --> 00:21:23.544\nit's absolutely a security device.\n\n404\n00:21:23.544 --> 00:21:27.690\nAnd I thought, well,\nmaybe that's just an outlier, right?\n\n405\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.260\nThe guys that are calling this out,\n\n406\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.430\nthey're just really not up\nto date on the equipment.\n\n407\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.160\nBut Steve Gibson, right?\n\n408\n00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.748\nOne of the guys on Security Now.\n\n409\n00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:36.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:21:36.453 --> 00:21:40.647\n&gt;&gt; He absolutely has an entire web\npage devoted to NAT as security.\n\n411\n00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:44.708\nSo he's not the only stand\nout that's out there.\n\n412\n00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:48.444\nBut that's a pretty big name for\nme to toss out there and say,\n\n413\n00:21:48.444 --> 00:21:52.470\nSteve Gibson refers to it as\na security implementation.\n\n414\n00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.490\nAnd he even mentions something that most\nof us in networking really don't like\n\n415\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.160\nwhich is double NATing.\n\n416\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.140\nAnd he says, no,\nthat's the greatest thing in the world.\n\n417\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.250\nMost of us, we cringe because we're NATing\noutside and then we're NATing inside.\n\n418\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.089\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen if you think if you have any kind of\n\n419\n00:22:08.089 --> 00:22:10.698\ntranslation like IP version 4 to 6.\n\n420\n00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:11.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n421\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.642\n&gt;&gt; And then you got all\nthese other confusions but\n\n422\n00:22:13.642 --> 00:22:16.100\nreally that's where that\nterm obfuscation comes in.\n\n423\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.305\n[LAUGH] Right, Ronnie?\n\n424\n00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:19.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what ends up\nhappening more than anything else.\n\n425\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.063\nSo just kind of realize that even\nthough your personal preferences here\n\n426\n00:22:23.063 --> 00:22:24.770\nare NAT is not a security device.\n\n427\n00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.125\nOn a Cisco exam think about it as one.\n\n428\n00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:33.126\nAnd for us understanding this context\nright here of being able to see whether or\n\n429\n00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:36.180\nnot it's working correctly\nis going to be key.\n\n430\n00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.472\nIf you want to implement another layer\nin terms of the defense and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n431\n00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:43.500\nNAT is included in one of those\nlayers in terms of security.\n\n432\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.560\nSo don't exclude it as a possible\n\n433\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.620\nimplementation of another\nsecurity layer as well.\n\n434\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.180\nSo it is a part of something\nthat I was kind of hesitant.\n\n435\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.530\nI even kind of almost don't\nknow if it is or isn't,\n\n436\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.280\nafter reading up on who still\nconsiders this security.\n\n437\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.505\nAnd I was kind of surprised myself\nwhen that article popped up.\n\n438\n00:23:04.505 --> 00:23:07.770\nAnd I was reading it and I was like,\nit makes some pretty good points.\n\n439\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:12.380\nBut Steve has always made good\npoints on his security stuff.\n\n440\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.710\nSo I'm not gonna say that that's\nanything that I should just dismiss\n\n441\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.020\noff hand here and square that it's not.\n\n442\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.310\n&gt;&gt; We got a comment in the chat.\n\n443\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.210\nSteve, the explainer in\nchief as Leo calls him.\n\n444\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:24.980\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it.\n\n445\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.780\nThat man knows, if he's explaining it,\nit's because he thinks it's important.\n\n446\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.095\nAnd so\nI definitely don't wanna doubt that.\n\n447\n00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:34.980\nBut just take a grain of salt.\n\n448\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.598\nEven if you go,\nI can't believe that this is here, and\n\n449\n00:23:38.598 --> 00:23:44.122\nyou hesitantly click on that and you go,\nI cringe by clicking on it, do it anyways.\n\n450\n00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.908\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n451\n00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:47.113\n&gt;&gt; Just swallow your pride for a moment.\n\n452\n00:23:47.113 --> 00:23:48.984\n&gt;&gt; It's a point, right?\n\n453\n00:23:48.984 --> 00:23:51.060\nOr whatever that point ratio is there.\n\n454\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.807\n&gt;&gt; And you should be able to get through.\n\n455\n00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:55.693\nSo, if it wasn't listed as\npart of the exam objectives,\n\n456\n00:23:55.693 --> 00:23:59.858\nI wouldn't even have considered it or even\nbrought it up the very fact, but it is.\n\n457\n00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:00.645\n&gt;&gt; Well that's what we're here for.\n\n458\n00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:01.306\n&gt;&gt; It's actually part\nof the exam objectives.\n\n459\n00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:01.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n460\n00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:02.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n461\n00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.010\nwe want to make sure that we\ndo cover that completely.\n\n462\n00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.341\nNow there are a lot more different\ncontexts for us to consider.\n\n463\n00:24:08.341 --> 00:24:09.703\nBut at least for now,\n\n464\n00:24:09.703 --> 00:24:14.870\nthose are kinda the two big ones that\nwe've seen just based off of the router.\n\n465\n00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.840\nBut there's plenty more for\nus to talk about.\n\n466\n00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.430\n&gt;&gt; There really is, Ronnie, and\nthat will bring us into our next episode.\n\n467\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.656\nWe're gonna continue looking at different\ntypes of monitoring contexts because\n\n468\n00:24:23.656 --> 00:24:25.021\nwe really got to see a couple here.\n\n469\n00:24:25.021 --> 00:24:26.920\nBut don't go anywhere.\n\n470\n00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.300\nWe have a lot more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n471\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.000\nFor this show, I'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n472\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.030\nAs your show host,\nmy name is Cherokee Boose.\n\n473\n00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n474\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.570\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:24:38.327 --> 00:24:44.583\n[MUSIC]\n\n476\n00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.157\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:11.823\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:15.492\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.188\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:21.827\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nnotice that this is a part two where we\n\n8\n00:00:21.827 --> 00:00:24.720\ncontinue to describing monitoring context.\n\n9\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.570\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.090\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue on taking a look at\n\n12\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.840\nthese different types of context\nthat we really need to make sure\n\n13\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.190\nthat we are monitoring within our\nown networks to take a look at.\n\n14\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.000\nAnd the reason why is because,\nif we are trying to protect our systems,\n\n15\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.600\none of the things that I've said\nthroughout the entire series,\n\n16\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.980\nis you have to know about every\ndevice that you are in control of.\n\n17\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.380\nYou need to know about every application\nas well, and at least then a minimum,\n\n18\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.360\nthe people that are also using those\ndevices, bare minimum in terms like\n\n19\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.290\nusername and passwords, so that way you\nhave some identity to that as well.\n\n20\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.310\nSo if you don't know about any of those or\nall of them,\n\n21\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.840\nright, it means that there is,\nat least in your vision, right,\n\n22\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.030\na security exposure that you\ndon't want it to be there.\n\n23\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.650\nIn other words, something you can't see,\nsomething you don't know about, but\n\n24\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.311\neven if you know an event you\ncan't tie it back to anything.\n\n25\n00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.272\nSo that's what we're talking about,\n\n26\n00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:25.480\nis the context in which we\nfind information as well.\n\n27\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.510\nSo one of those context that we're\nbringing up of course is the idea of\n\n28\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.230\nestablishing tunnels.\n\n29\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.100\nNormally when we start talking about\nthe idea of tunneling technology we're\n\n30\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.630\nnormally talking of course about using VPN\nconnections is what we're normally talking\n\n31\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.890\nabout here, and we want to make sure we\nunderstand what are we taking a look at?\n\n32\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.080\nWell first and foremost,\nas we talk about VPN connections,\n\n33\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.380\nyou gotta make sure that\nthey are connected.\n\n34\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.100\nOn the end user side,\nif it's just a remote access type of VPN,\n\n35\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.940\nend users can tell very quickly whether or\nnot they are connected because\n\n36\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.750\nthey'll either be able to get access to\nthose devices that they normally do, or\n\n37\n00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.990\nfrom an outside network they won't\nbe able to get access to them.\n\n38\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.450\nBut if you're establishing a site to\nsite connection though, that's when you\n\n39\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.630\ncan start monitoring it a little bit\neasier and a little bit better here.\n\n40\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.050\nBecause you can actually see on\nend point devices, especially,\n\n41\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.620\nwhere you initiate that tonal connection\nfrom whether the device is connected,\n\n42\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.370\nhow long it's been connected for,\nand whether or\n\n43\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.280\nnot it's actually doing\neverything that's supposed to do.\n\n44\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.130\nSo, that is what we normally monitor for.\n\n45\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.617\nSo, I wanna make sure\nthat we're monitoring for\n\n46\n00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:38.390\nthe connectiosn being made as well as\nthe tunnel being up, it's up time.\n\n47\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.970\nIf you have a tunnel that continuous\nto drop and come up, drop and come up,\n\n48\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.080\nyou got to know stuff like that,\nand you've gotta go in there and\n\n49\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.870\ninvestigate why something like that\nis happening as well, and then even\n\n50\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.120\nperformance is another potion of it too,\nwhere you're also monitoring that as well.\n\n51\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, I mean if you think about\nit, you might have some end users who\n\n52\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.890\ndon't connect as frequently as others who\nare really saturating that VPN connection.\n\n53\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.100\nSo by monitoring who's connecting?\n\n54\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.310\nHow long are they connected for?\n\n55\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.120\nWhat the stability is\nof that communication?\n\n56\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.900\nYou can make some judgment calls as to,\n\n57\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.610\nhey maybe I need to go ahead and\nchange the way things are configured or\n\n58\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.280\nsetup a different type of\nconfiguration for certain end users.\n\n59\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.140\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna find that this\nhappens more often then you realize,\n\n60\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.020\nespecially when the companies don't\nuse the exact same type of device.\n\n61\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.330\nSo for example, I've set up a networks\nacross a couple of different states here,\n\n62\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.700\nfairly simply right?\n\n63\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.190\nWe had ASA at one hand and over on the\nother hand I set up an ASA as well, and\n\n64\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.510\nwe brought up a VPN tunnel connection.\n\n65\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.450\nWell it's simple, right?\n\n66\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.910\nIf I'm the one that set up both sides,\nthe configuration and\n\n67\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.414\nthe ability to set everything\nup looks identical, right?\n\n68\n00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:51.770\nSo, whether I establish one right here\nwhere I am and then went to a remote\n\n69\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.250\noffice somewhere else in another state,\nI'm just really configuring the mirrored\n\n70\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.330\nconfiguration on the other end, and once\nthat's done, it's actually ready to go.\n\n71\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.270\nIt's even better if they\nwould've sent me the device and\n\n72\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.480\nthen I could've tested it out by plugging\nit directly in to another network, and\n\n73\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.260\nthen I could actually verify that\nthe tunnel was up and working anyway.\n\n74\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.650\nWhere it becomes more difficult is\nwhen you start to change technologies.\n\n75\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.660\nSo, for example, when we decided here\nto move to a different technology than\n\n76\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.640\nthe ASA, but we still had ASAs in other\nplaces that we work still working on.\n\n77\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.570\nSo to bring up tunnel\nconnections between my ASA and\n\n78\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.640\nmy other non-ASA device,\nit was a little bit more challenging, and\n\n79\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.990\nthose configurations can\nget mixed up a little bit.\n\n80\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.350\nSo, you need to explore and\n\n81\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.860\nsee how those things are performing to\nmake sure everything is performing okay.\n\n82\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.900\nNormally, they work fine but\n\n83\n00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.480\nsometimes you will find that\nthere's a little bit of caveat.\n\n84\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.210\nThere's a little bit of trickiness\nto some of the stuff working.\n\n85\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.630\nSo just be aware that as far as\nmonitoring these tunnel connections go,\n\n86\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.600\nthat is what we're normally looking for.\n\n87\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.370\nNow, where do you normally find that?\n\n88\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.510\nThere's no one Cisco command that's\ngonna show you activity like that.\n\n89\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.020\nMore than likely, it's gonna be at\nthe end point device in the application,\n\n90\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.340\nthe management application, that they\nhave open and available to you, and\n\n91\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.200\nyou'll normally just go and search for\nthat tunnel connection, and\n\n92\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.320\nit normally brings you up to that\nspot where you can see whether or\n\n93\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.870\nnot the connections are being made, and\nall the details in those connections, and\n\n94\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.980\nthey're logged and everything else too.\n\n95\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.430\nSo that's what you're playing around with,\nI shouldn't say playing around with,\n\n96\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.110\nsetting up, making sure that\neverything's actually working.\n\n97\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.800\nBut tunnel connections\nare a very important part of\n\n98\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.830\neverything that we do today so\nmake sure you do keep an eye on those and\n\n99\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.330\nunderstand that you've got\nto check those things out.\n\n100\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.000\nMost of the management consoles\nusually bring them up fairly easily\n\n101\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.085\nin a little graphic as far as\nlike a summary page goes, and\n\n102\n00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:55.610\nit normally turns it green or\nred a lot of times telling you whether or\n\n103\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.810\nnot the connection's good, or whether the\nconnection is down, whatever it might be.\n\n104\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.250\nSo it makes it very easy for you to go,\nI need to check that out if it's red and\n\n105\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.826\nthen you go on and you find out what the\ndetails are, whether it's the other side\n\n106\n00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:09.000\nthat's not responding, or\nwhether it's your end not responding.\n\n107\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.500\nThose are also key details\nthat can help you out too.\n\n108\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, next upon our list we have\nTor, and this one kind of thrown me for\n\n109\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.590\na loop here Roney.\n\n110\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.220\nI'm kind of surprised to see\nthis as a Cisco objective.\n\n111\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.990\nSo, exactly how are we gonna be using\nthis in our business environments and\n\n112\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.260\nhow would we gonna monitor?\n\n113\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're not gonna be using\nit in your business environment, and\n\n114\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.280\nthat's the weird thing, right?\n\n115\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.780\nIs that if you tend to see this inside\nof your business environment that's\n\n116\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.340\nnormally an indication that somebody\nelse is using your environment for\n\n117\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.980\nsomething that they shouldn't be.\n\n118\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.650\nNow, not always, right?\n\n119\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.160\nSomebody could have a legitimate.\n\n120\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.700\nI'm joking!\n\n121\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.570\nI don't have a clue.\n\n122\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More than likely,\n\n123\n00:06:43.434 --> 00:06:45.320\nsomebody does out there have\na legitimate purpose for using it.\n\n124\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.104\nWell, that's what I was wondering.\n\n125\n00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.185\nLike, why would we be\nwanting this on our networks?\n\n126\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:48.769\nBut no.\n\n127\n00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:50.700\nSo they're specifically saying here, and\n\n128\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.521\nwhat you're understanding like\nhow I thought this is strange,\n\n129\n00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.460\nwe don't want to see this type of\ntraffic within our environment.\n\n130\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you shouldn't.\n\n131\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.180\nYou should not.\n\n132\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.660\nOkay, so in other words you\nshould not be able to see this.\n\n133\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.470\nNow, that's the hard part is you normally\nare not gonna be able to see tour\n\n134\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.870\ntraffic on your network unless you\nhave something like an intrusion\n\n135\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.340\nprevention system that is designed\nto spot traffic like this, and\n\n136\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.350\nthe reason why, is that Tor itself\nis designed to mimic HTTP traffic.\n\n137\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.670\nI mean, it really is HTTP, HTTPS,\n\n138\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.020\nit really can mimic that traffic,\nand do what it needs to.\n\n139\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.500\nIf you have a particular application\nthat you're using though,\n\n140\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.440\nit can also end up doing that for you too.\n\n141\n00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.225\nBut normally a lot of times when you\nend up seeing this on your network,\n\n142\n00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:40.980\nsomebody is probably using Tor itself to\nstart running some type of what they call,\n\n143\n00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.830\nC2 type of attack.\n\n144\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.890\nAnd that is a command and control\nattack where they're using that and\n\n145\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.721\nthen they have command and control of one\nparticular machine on your network, and\n\n146\n00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.608\nthey're using that as a point of entry for\nthem.\n\n147\n00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:58.494\nThe way that, and\nI said HTTP but I was wrong,\n\n148\n00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:02.380\nit was just HTTPS Tor\nitself runs on HTTPS, or\n\n149\n00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.184\nlooks like it, I shouldn't say runs on it.\n\n150\n00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:08.390\nIt runs on the same port as HTTPS.\n\n151\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.670\nSo it mimics it very well.\n\n152\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.790\nMost of us when we take\na look at our firewalls,\n\n153\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.590\nwe tend to allow HTTP traffic to come in,\nor HTTPS traffic to come in, or\n\n154\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.719\nport 443, and that's all we think about.\n\n155\n00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:26.830\nBut remember that what we can do is\nthat we can hide packets within packets.\n\n156\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.460\nSo if your firewall doesn't do what\nwe call a deep packet inspection,\n\n157\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.340\nit can say yeah this says port 443 and\nallow even tor traffic to come in.\n\n158\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.780\nSo we're probably not\ngonna block port 443.\n\n159\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.990\nSo, at that point that means you\nhave to have some other system then,\n\n160\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.600\nthat kind of puts in place here of what\nyou're really allowing to come in and\n\n161\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.150\nwhat you're not allowing to come in,\nas well.\n\n162\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.420\nSo this goes into your monitoring,\nas well as your access control list,\n\n163\n00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.420\nor firewall rules, to try and\nprevent as much of this as you can.\n\n164\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.006\nNow remember that once you start doing\nsomething like this, right, is not easy.\n\n165\n00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:06.708\nIt requires constant monitoring because,\nif you start blocking the TCP port 443 for\n\n166\n00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.865\nTor and\nyou figure out how you could of that well,\n\n167\n00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:13.965\nit would instead just jump on over and\nstart using other ports.\n\n168\n00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:17.580\nIt tries to maintain the connection\nthe way that it does.\n\n169\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.500\nSame thing with peer to peer networks too.\n\n170\n00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.150\nIt does the same thing.\n\n171\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.040\nSo, you do have where something\nlike this is possible.\n\n172\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.870\nBut it's not easily done.\n\n173\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:32.807\nBy using regular monitoring tools,\neven Wireshark can capture some of it.\n\n174\n00:09:32.807 --> 00:09:36.791\nBut you gotta be able to go all right,\nwhy is this TCP port 443, and\n\n175\n00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:41.537\nthen look beyond the port number and start\nactually looking at the information and\n\n176\n00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:44.010\nwhere it's destination is going to go.\n\n177\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.460\nBut most of us are not gonna sit\nin front of Wireshark every day,\n\n178\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.120\nand that's why we need some type\nof network monitoring system\n\n179\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.310\nthat's out there to\nhelp us out to do that.\n\n180\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.810\nSo once again, we have to depend on\napplication to see the context and\n\n181\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.090\nwhether or not Tor is involved\nin our network somewhere\n\n182\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.390\nis what we're trying to spot here, okay.\n\n183\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.042\nSo if you see it,\n\n184\n00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:06.078\nit's more than likely not something\nthat you want on your business network.\n\n185\n00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:10.281\nBut if there's a legitimate reason for it\nyou need to go and ask that user, why it's\n\n186\n00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:14.244\non your network, or somebody else is in\nthe know of why they actually said yes,\n\n187\n00:10:14.244 --> 00:10:16.924\nthis is a great thing to\nallow on our network, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n189\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.490\nusually you find kind of some pretty\nsketchy connections on those networks.\n\n190\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.590\nSo that's why I couldn't think of\na legitimate purpose either, so.\n\n191\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.250\n&gt;&gt; No, you're right.\n\n192\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.501\nThe very fact is 90% if not 99% of it,\nis for anonymizing,\n\n193\n00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:36.630\nhiding your identity\nacross those connections.\n\n194\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.770\n&gt;&gt; And what happens when you do that?\n\n195\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.532\nYou kind of lose your morality, right?\n\n196\n00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:42.719\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and well, and you also end up,\nif you're hiding that, you're telling\n\n197\n00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:47.162\nsomebody on your own network that you're\nsupposed to be monitoring, I don't want\n\n198\n00:10:47.162 --> 00:10:49.571\nyou to monitor me, which is again kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n199\n00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:50.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n200\n00:10:50.474 --> 00:10:52.300\n&gt;&gt; That's what it comes down to.\n\n201\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.450\nSo I don't really see any\nreal super legitimate use for\n\n202\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.330\nit inside of a business network.\n\n203\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.720\nI can't guarantee you that there\nisn't because I don't know\n\n204\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.480\nevery single network that's out there.\n\n205\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.330\nBut overall though, it's not normal\ntraffic, that we expect to see.\n\n206\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330\nAnd it's probably not acceptable use\nof anybody's personal computer to do\n\n207\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.430\nso either.\n\n208\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.062\nSo just kind of be aware of policies\nlike that, that are in place as well.\n\n209\n00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:16.739\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n210\n00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:20.750\nthe next one on our list has got\na little bit of that complexity as well.\n\n211\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.350\nI'm not sure in which direction they're\ngoing here when we look at encryption\n\n212\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.380\nin a contextual sense.\n\n213\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.790\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n214\n00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start to\nsee the idea of encryption,\n\n215\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.540\nit's very difficult to know what\nthey're really looking for.\n\n216\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.260\nBut the very fact is,\nyou might actually be looking for\n\n217\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.570\nsomething just as simple as this.\n\n218\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.400\nCertain types of traffic from certain\ncomputers should always be encrypted.\n\n219\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.580\nAnd then other types of traffic.\n\n220\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.160\nIt doesn't matter whether\nthey're encrypted or not.\n\n221\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.130\nNow, who the heck makes that decision?\n\n222\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.930\nAnd that's key, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.950\nWe've also mentioned that in\nthe context of all security, right?\n\n224\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.800\nThat one of the foundations\nof good solid security\n\n225\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.910\nis somebody classifying that data.\n\n226\n00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.620\nIn other words, you and I are not trying\nto go, that should be classified or that\n\n227\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.740\nshouldn't be classified, or that should\nencrypted or that shouldn't be encrypted.\n\n228\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.840\nWhoever owns that data should\nalready make that decision so\n\n229\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.780\nthat way we can be aware of\nit as we're monitoring, as\n\n230\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.770\ntraffic is coming off of Ronnie's computer\nand it's supposed to be going here.\n\n231\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.000\nIs supposed to be encrypted?\n\n232\n00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.810\nWell, if I know something that's saying\nin my network, all traffic internal,\n\n233\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.350\nit doesn't have to be encrypted.\n\n234\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.990\nBut traffic leaving my\nnetwork should be encrypted.\n\n235\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.270\nWell, that's when you start\nmonitoring the traffic again and\n\n236\n00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.640\nseeing what makes it to your outside port.\n\n237\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.960\nAnd whether or not all of that\ndata traffic is encrypted or not.\n\n238\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.660\nOkay, so it could be something\nas simple as that, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.620\nIt could be something as complex, okay,\nas trying to insure that, you know,\n\n240\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.310\npublic and private key exchange are 100%\nencrypted during this whole time as well.\n\n241\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.083\nI don't know which way to take this when\nwe go to the exam portion except to say\n\n242\n00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:03.782\nthat you just got to be aware that at\nsome point right that if you're suppose\n\n243\n00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:06.415\nto be using encryption it should be used.\n\n244\n00:13:06.415 --> 00:13:10.704\nYou shouldn't just say I'm not gonna\nuse because I choose not to use it.\n\n245\n00:13:10.704 --> 00:13:15.616\nAnd that's what it comes down to, is that\nas far as the context goes that's where it\n\n246\n00:13:15.616 --> 00:13:19.056\ncomes into the context of\nbusiness as well as networking so\n\n247\n00:13:19.056 --> 00:13:21.650\nthat we can monitor and see it.\n\n248\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.033\nAnd it's supposed to be encrypted,\n\n249\n00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:25.273\nthen we should see a lot of\nencrypted traffic going across.\n\n250\n00:13:25.273 --> 00:13:26.802\nIf it's not we should go to\nlook right into the pathways.\n\n251\n00:13:26.802 --> 00:13:31.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's not just Ronnie saying,\nHIPPA, schmippa.\n\n252\n00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:34.110\nTotally discretionary, I don't like\nto encrypt my network traffic.\n\n253\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.110\nNo, it's abusing your policies and\n\n254\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.340\nmonitoring tools to\nenforce that encryption.\n\n255\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, there is no doubt.\n\n256\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.271\nSo, so along with the idea of Tor,\n\n257\n00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:48.238\nthere of course is another type of-\n&gt;&gt; Questionable.\n\n258\n00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:51.641\n&gt;&gt; Questionable type of communications\nthat we have which is gonna be\n\n259\n00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:54.580\nthe peer-to-peer type of\nnetwork communications.\n\n260\n00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.650\nHave you ever used anything like this?\n\n261\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.530\n&gt;&gt; I've looked a long time ago,\nbut it was nearly a decade,\n\n262\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.439\nso I think things have changed since\nthe good old days of Napster and so forth.\n\n263\n00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:05.519\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n\n264\n00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.280\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that\nthey really changed much.\n\n265\n00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.370\nThey've just gotten a lot more popular and\na lot less in the spotlight anymore.\n\n266\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.530\nAnd this idea here, right,\n\n267\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.990\nis that you're not really relying a lot of\ntimes on a centralized control mechanism.\n\n268\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.120\nIt's just whoever actually comes online.\n\n269\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.930\nLong as you're running that application\non the ports that they're running,\n\n270\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.360\nthey can connect to each other so\n\n271\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.440\nthat they can exchange information\nthat they choose to exchange.\n\n272\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.650\nThat's pretty much what it comes down to.\n\n273\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.365\nWell, inside your network\nwhy are you running that?\n\n274\n00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:40.193\nIt's not that it's not possible,\nit's not that it's impossible to run it,\n\n275\n00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:43.170\nit's just that you want to\nknow why this is there.\n\n276\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.900\nMost of the time for us,\non this type of scenario.\n\n277\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.362\nWe're trying to exchange information in\nunusual way where we're not really saying,\n\n278\n00:14:51.362 --> 00:14:53.387\nhere's where you should go and get it.\n\n279\n00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:56.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're just setting kind of a list.\n\n280\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.050\nThere's possibilities where you can\nget portions of this file from and\n\n281\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.370\nthen bring it all back together.\n\n282\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.288\n&gt;&gt; But the problem with that is it's such\nan unorthodox method that there's not any\n\n283\n00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:10.773\nkind of central administration on those\nsites where no one is scanning and\n\n284\n00:15:10.773 --> 00:15:15.208\nchecking for any kind of malware or\nany kind of backdoor so I don't know.\n\n285\n00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:16.192\nThat's another tough one.\n\n286\n00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:18.370\nYou might just wanna go ahead and\nprohibit it altogether.\n\n287\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's possible, right?\n\n288\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.630\nBut some of the things that you can look\nfor will help reveal this one, unlike Tor.\n\n289\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.810\nBecause Tor is completely\nanonymizing everything.\n\n290\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.390\nYou can try protocol based\nanalysis if you wanted to.\n\n291\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.370\nRemember that most of the time\nwhen people are using this,\n\n292\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.720\nthey probably downloaded a software\nlike what you're talking about Napster,\n\n293\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.240\nLimeWire, whatever other\nones that are out there.\n\n294\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.878\nWhen I was, I don't know how long ago\nthat was, that was a long time ago.\n\n295\n00:15:43.878 --> 00:15:45.360\nWhen I was thinking about it,\nI was like, yeah,\n\n296\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.900\nit's probably been at least ten\nyears since I've thought about it.\n\n297\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.150\nBut overall though, those are just\napplication that people run.\n\n298\n00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.377\nIt's like, run this application.\n\n299\n00:15:53.377 --> 00:15:56.435\nLook at that, somebody has this file,\nand you were able to connect,\n\n300\n00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:57.981\ndidn't even have to do anything.\n\n301\n00:15:57.981 --> 00:16:02.085\nWell, those applications run off\nspecific default ports a lot of times.\n\n302\n00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:05.158\nAnd that works just fine, so\nthat way you can go, all right,\n\n303\n00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:08.610\nI'm gonna block this if I needed to,\nto make that happen.\n\n304\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.280\nBut peer-to-peer networks are,\n\n305\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.340\nagain, very tricky because\nthey've advanced over the years.\n\n306\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.600\nThey say look, if you don't allow that to\nconnect in I'll connect over port 25 or\n\n307\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.610\nport 80 instead, well,\nnone of us are gonna block port 80 and\n\n308\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.370\nport 440 or 425-\n&gt;&gt; 443, and yeah, for our email.\n\n309\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.770\n&gt;&gt; We're just not gonna do it.\n\n310\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.760\n&gt;&gt; 425, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just not gonna do it.\n\n311\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.600\nSo that can be good but\n\n312\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.400\nit can also kind of fail you if\nyou're doing something like that.\n\n313\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.450\nSo the key here then, is that you may\nthink of the idea of blacklisting and\n\n314\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.450\nwhitelisting\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n315\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.650\n&gt;&gt; To have to help you out,\nas far as monitoring these systems.\n\n316\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.200\nOnce you start realizing, like look, we're\nblacklisting all these things in my biz\n\n317\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.012\nnetwork, there's 15 sites that everybody\nneeds to go to, we'll whitelist those.\n\n318\n00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.950\nAnd if you have to go somewhere else,\nnotify me and\n\n319\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.680\nI'll make a judgment on whether or\nnot I'll allow them to come in.\n\n320\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.980\nThat's probably one of\nthe more secure ways to do it.\n\n321\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You can also try the idea of protocol\n\n322\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.580\nanalysis as well.\n\n323\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.140\nWhen you start talking about\nthe idea of protocol analysis,\n\n324\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.900\nwhatever protocol is using,\nthe problem is that over time, and\n\n325\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.010\nover periods of time, Peer-to-peer\nnetworkers have gotten smarter and\n\n326\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.060\nthey've not said, here's the base code and\nwe're never gonna change it.\n\n327\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.240\nThey just continue to evolve.\n\n328\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.650\nOnce they figure out they're being caught,\nthey just change the coding.\n\n329\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.590\nSo it may be effective for a little while,\nit's not gonna be effective forever.\n\n330\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.120\nSo what is your last kind of,\ncouple of analysis to check?\n\n331\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.820\nWell you can base it on your own host or\nClient individual systems instead.\n\n332\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.830\nAnd this means that what you're doing,\ninstead of monitoring the tour and\n\n333\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.342\nthe peer-to-peer stuff,\n\n334\n00:17:44.342 --> 00:17:46.790\nis that your monitoring internal\nchanges on your own network.\n\n335\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.640\nYou have a client machine that essentially\ngenerates a hash of what it is and\n\n336\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.230\nthen as you do this throughout the day and\nyou start taking those types of\n\n337\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.740\ninspections or analysis on those systems,\nwell, you go and see if somebody's\n\n338\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.640\nmodified the registry, and you go and see\nif somebody's added in stuff that they're\n\n339\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.540\nnot supposed to be added in, when you're\ndoing those internal types of scans.\n\n340\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.130\nSo that's another possibility.\n\n341\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.770\nBecause peer to peer networks,\nthey love changing stuff.\n\n342\n00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.610\nAnd if they're malicious,\nthey love changing a lot of stuff.\n\n343\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.100\nSo that can also be a helpful.\n\n344\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.310\nBut when it comes down to the end,\n\n345\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.570\nit comes down to behavioral analysis,\nis kind of the key.\n\n346\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.480\nThis one, is actually going to be,\ntrying to detect of course,\n\n347\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.130\nthe different way that the connections\nare made and this is actually better for\n\n348\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.260\nus as what we would have available, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.500\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, do we have any other\noptions when we're looking at this,\n\n350\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.170\ntrying to identify this\npeer-to-peer communication?\n\n351\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.605\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've kind of almost\nexhausted every option, right?\n\n352\n00:18:45.605 --> 00:18:47.090\nWe've talked about the idea of ports.\n\n353\n00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.670\nWe've talked about the protocol.\n\n354\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.220\nWe've talked about monitoring end systems.\n\n355\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.510\nAnd that seems just about everything but\nthere is another possibility that you\n\n356\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.710\nhave, which is to start\nmonitoring the behavior of\n\n357\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.010\nthe types of things that you're\nlooking for in a peer-to-peer network.\n\n358\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.750\nAnd this means that you have to understand\nthe process of how that connects.\n\n359\n00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.190\nSo, you taking a little bit of time,\nand going all right,\n\n360\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.590\nlet me figure out how peer-to-peer\nnetworking works at the very beginning,\n\n361\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.920\nand then realizing what\nprocess it takes to connect,\n\n362\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.050\ncan kind of establish a pattern of\nbehavior for you that now you can go,\n\n363\n00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.820\nif I start seeing this information, then I\ncan detect it a little bit easier, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.940\nAnd that's probably kind of the key.\n\n365\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.230\nThe protocols themselves, even though\nthey might change the internal working so\n\n366\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.740\nthat you can identify them,\nmost of the time though,\n\n367\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.710\nthey're not changing the entire network\nto say this is how you connect.\n\n368\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.270\nThey're pretty much saying how\nyou connect is how you connect,\n\n369\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.770\nwhich is the normal standard\nprocedure on the connection.\n\n370\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.810\nSo using some type of behavioral\nanalysis then can make\n\n371\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.960\nsure that you're not dependent upon any\none application port or protocol itself.\n\n372\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.700\nAnd that might be the most\neffective way to do it.\n\n373\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.560\nIt's also the way that takes you\nthe longest to do it as well.\n\n374\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.850\nBut if you're going into cyber security,\nunderstanding the nature of whether we\n\n375\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.080\ntalk about malware or whether we're\ntalking about something like this or Tor,\n\n376\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.290\nit really is key that you have a good\nunderstanding in the background, and\n\n377\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.500\nthis point just a fundamental one.\n\n378\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.297\nBut hopefully all of this is spurring\nyou to go, let me learn more about Tor.\n\n379\n00:20:18.297 --> 00:20:20.250\nLet me learn more about\npeer-to-peer networks.\n\n380\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.630\nSo that you can understand the basic\nfunctioning and how that's connecting.\n\n381\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.860\nThen that way,\nwhen you have it appear on your network.\n\n382\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.790\nYou go, all right, so here's what it\nnormally does and how can I stop that?\n\n383\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.920\nHow do you think about preventing\nthat type of connection to go on.\n\n384\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.540\nAnd that's kind of a key aspect\nin terms of cyber security and\n\n385\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.890\nmonitoring that we would really like for\nour brains to accept instead.\n\n386\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.230\n&gt;&gt; That's really it.\n\n387\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.310\nTrying to understand how something\nworks so that we can mitigate and\n\n388\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:50.280\ndefend upon the way that those functions,\nprotocols, communications are transpiring.\n\n389\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.750\nBut we do have a couple\nmore that we need to cover.\n\n390\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.620\nNext up on our list is encapsulation.\n\n391\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we start talking about\nthe nature of encapsulation, right,\n\n392\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.670\nthis is kind of more\ndifficult to spot because\n\n393\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.270\nwe're saying we're taking protocols and\nputting them inside of protocols.\n\n394\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.280\nSo for example,\n\n395\n00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.310\nIP version four, or IP version six,\nexcuse me, inside of IP version four,\n\n396\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.600\nright now if you're not actually running\nIP version six or you are and you're still\n\n397\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.510\nconnecting out to the internet,depending\non your portion of the internet,\n\n398\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.890\nyou might find out that they're running\nthat inside of IP version four.\n\n399\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.780\nAnd then at the other end it's\ndecapsulating it pulling it out\n\n400\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.410\nof IP version four so that IP version\nsix can be explored in that way.\n\n401\n00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:38.910\nIn Cisco land we always talk about\nthe idea of 802.1 Q encapsulation as well.\n\n402\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.320\nAnd this is what we also use in\ntrunking to ensure that we can\n\n403\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.296\nkeep traffic separated out by those\ntagging numbers that we want.\n\n404\n00:21:46.296 --> 00:21:51.580\nSo all this encapsulation is pretty much\njust standard protocols that we tend to\n\n405\n00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.190\nuse throughout our entire network so that\nwe can make the connects that we need too.\n\n406\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.460\nWell encapsulation traffic\nis not very easy to spot.\n\n407\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.110\nNow, on one system it is, okay.\n\n408\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.180\nBut if you're trying to capture\nit on something like, let's say,\n\n409\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.650\nacross a trunk device,\n\n410\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.800\nmost of the time if you're something like\nspam it's probably not going to work.\n\n411\n00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.410\n&gt;&gt; What about port numbers?\n\n412\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, port numbers tend to come\nacross when you can see that.\n\n413\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.940\nBut encapsulation though, it's really more\nabout the whatever protocol that we're\n\n414\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.640\nactually using to say, this is how it\nworks on this portion of our system, and\n\n415\n00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.060\nthen on your portion of the system we'll\ndecapsulate it and let you use it instead.\n\n416\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.930\nSo here, we have to be able to take\na little bit of time and figure that out.\n\n417\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.100\nRight?\nSo,\n\n418\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.380\nmost of the time you can use wireshark.\n\n419\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.860\nYou can try and use the idea of\nport monitoring or port mirroring.\n\n420\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.120\nI can't say it right.\n\n421\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.390\nWhat Cisco of course calls span\nto help you out to do this.\n\n422\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.962\nIf you do so you have to have a lot of\nyour devices that are running a ton of\n\n423\n00:22:52.962 --> 00:22:57.590\nencapsulation and\nyou'll end up seeing that if you use trunk\n\n424\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:01.667\nto make the connections most of the time\ntrying to capture data on trunk and\n\n425\n00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:05.070\nthen going to mirroring, it just\ndrops all that encapsulation stuff.\n\n426\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.070\nIt really just sends you\nthe bare bones that it needs to,\n\n427\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.740\nto make sure that you\nunderstand what's going across.\n\n428\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.378\nBut usually it drops things like BPDUs,\nall of your port aggregation\n\n429\n00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:20.460\ntypes of things, virtual trunking\nprotocol, dynamic trunking protocol.\n\n430\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.840\nAll these protocols are really\nencapsulation types, is what they are.\n\n431\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.210\nAnd they essentially get dropped, but\n\n432\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.080\nif you need to see them, there are certain\ncommands that you can run with\n\n433\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.020\nport mirroring that will\nallow you to do that as well.\n\n434\n00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.420\nAnd then sometimes you can try instead,\nwhich would probably be better,\n\n435\n00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.970\nis to do a true capture by\nputting in a network tap and\n\n436\n00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.330\ngetting everything on that network tap.\n\n437\n00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.724\nThat would probably expose everything\na lot more than just a port or a span or\n\n438\n00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:51.862\nport mirroring,\ncuz that can drop a lot of traffic and\n\n439\n00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:55.527\ncreate a lot of re-transmissions\nthat are going on your end.\n\n440\n00:23:55.527 --> 00:23:58.770\nSo you may not get consistent information\nif you're just doing port mirroring and\n\n441\n00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.903\ndoing something like this.\n\n442\n00:23:59.903 --> 00:24:00.909\nBut it is possible So\n\n443\n00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:04.593\njust realizing capsulation is another\nthing we have to pay attention to.\n\n444\n00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:07.210\nIs it running, is kind of the key.\n\n445\n00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.650\nAre we using proper encapsulation\nbetween those devices?\n\n446\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.160\nWhen the key,\nespecially if you're trunking, right, and\n\n447\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.060\nusing something like router on a stick.\n\n448\n00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.010\nYou don't have .12 turned on,\non one end but you have it turned on,\n\n449\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.090\non the other end, it's not gonna work.\n\n450\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.076\nSo making sure those two end\ndevices are encapsulated correctly.\n\n451\n00:24:23.076 --> 00:24:26.408\nThe same is true over\nserial aligns as well.\n\n452\n00:24:26.408 --> 00:24:30.873\nIf you have one end set at HDLC and the\nother end set at point to point protocol,\n\n453\n00:24:30.873 --> 00:24:33.970\nthose are mismatched in encapsulations.\n\n454\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.600\nSo you do have to at least know that and\n\n455\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.260\nbe able to spot information\nlike that on your devices too.\n\n456\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.450\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwhen we look at load balancing,\n\n457\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.300\nwhat approach are they taking\nin this context to you, Ronnie?\n\n458\n00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.000\nHow should we be monitoring our\nload balancing configurations?\n\n459\n00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.590\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthis is probably one of the trickier ones,\n\n460\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.430\njust like the idea that we talked\nabout in terms of encryption.\n\n461\n00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.655\nIt's hard to know what\nthey're really looking for\n\n462\n00:24:58.655 --> 00:25:01.883\nas far as load balancing\nbeing a security context.\n\n463\n00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:03.368\nSo what do you think, Cherokee,\n\n464\n00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:05.660\ndo you think load balancing\nis a security context?\n\n465\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:07.990\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n466\n00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:12.860\nI think it is a defense mechanism\nto defend against a type of\n\n467\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.460\ndenial of service.\n\n468\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.979\nSo you're not really concealing anything,\nyou're just providing redundancy to\n\n469\n00:25:19.979 --> 00:25:23.154\ngive your company that up time\nthat they're looking for.\n\n470\n00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:26.011\n&gt;&gt; Well believe it or not,\nthat is a form of security.\n\n471\n00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:27.385\nWe talked about-\n&gt;&gt; Availability.\n\n472\n00:25:27.385 --> 00:25:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Availability, yeah,\nis pretty much the key.\n\n473\n00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.110\nSo load balancing is not the security in\nthe standard sense that we think about,\n\n474\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.570\nright, which is defending and\n\n475\n00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.330\nprotecting our networks against\nthings like malware and stuff.\n\n476\n00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.886\nBut it is defending against attacks if\nyour attack prevents a denial of service,\n\n477\n00:25:44.886 --> 00:25:46.615\nif I could prevent that.\n\n478\n00:25:46.615 --> 00:25:49.440\nLoad balancing is one of the more\neffective ways to do that.\n\n479\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.471\nLet's take a look at my diagram so\n\n480\n00:25:51.471 --> 00:25:55.181\nthat we understand the context\nhere that we're looking at.\n\n481\n00:25:55.181 --> 00:25:58.950\nSo I just set this up as a simple\nof diagram as I possibly could.\n\n482\n00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.480\nLet's say that I have two of\nthese web servers here and\n\n483\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.370\nthey're all ready to go for\nwww,itprotvdemo.com.\n\n484\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.040\nAnd if I'm using something like this,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n485\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.070\nWhat normally happens in\na regular response from anybody,\n\n486\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.520\nso let's say it's an attacker coming in.\n\n487\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:23.767\nHe might go ahead and he might hit this\nsystem over here, which is perfectly fine.\n\n488\n00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:28.290\nNow, he makes that type of attack, well,\n\n489\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.690\nthat does the load balancer do?\n\n490\n00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.850\nWell, at this point, nothing.\n\n491\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.370\nAs this continues on, I'm\n\n492\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.670\ngonna try some way to duplicate this.\n\n493\n00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.030\nSo it goes overwhelming here.\n\n494\n00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.696\n&gt;&gt; So, what you're doing is, you're\nsimulating multiple connections to try,\n\n495\n00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:50.787\nand indate, what is that, web server 01.\n\n496\n00:26:50.787 --> 00:26:52.867\nBut, guess what, we have web server 02,\n\n497\n00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:55.550\nthat's allowing our end\nusers to still connect.\n\n498\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n499\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.330\nSo, when you start to take\na look at something like this,\n\n500\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.460\nthis is what normally happens.\n\n501\n00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.740\nWith the single web server eventually\nthat web service is not gonna be able\n\n502\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.050\nto respond to everybody so it's gonna\nappear at least to a portion of people,\n\n503\n00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.530\nyour service is down,\nyou can't do business.\n\n504\n00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:10.730\nWhatever it might be.\n\n505\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.390\nSo this is not good, whatever it might be.\n\n506\n00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.250\nSo this is not something we really\never want to see end up happening, but\n\n507\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.610\nit does happen.\n\n508\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.598\nNow, let me see if I can do this.\n\n509\n00:27:22.598 --> 00:27:24.698\nI have to do that again, don't I?\n\n510\n00:27:24.698 --> 00:27:26.733\n&gt;&gt; So if we set up a load balancer, and\n\n511\n00:27:26.733 --> 00:27:30.244\nwe configure something like even\na type of a round robin, so\n\n512\n00:27:30.244 --> 00:27:34.972\nmaybe every other connection, or depending\non how that traffic is flowing in.\n\n513\n00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:39.347\nThe more machines we have, and\nspread across like if we have an array of\n\n514\n00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:42.983\ndifferent machines,\nthen that's just gonna go ahead and\n\n515\n00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:45.951\nincrease the stability\nof those connections,\n\n516\n00:27:45.951 --> 00:27:50.284\nrather than letting us be vulnerable\nto these types of connections.\n\n517\n00:27:50.284 --> 00:27:54.591\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there comes a point,\ndepending on how load balancing is set up.\n\n518\n00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:58.830\nWhether it's round robin or whether it's\nsomething else, that what it might be is\n\n519\n00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.017\njust simple as, hey, there's a threshold\nlimit over here on web server 0-1.\n\n520\n00:28:03.017 --> 00:28:06.643\nAnd after that threshold limit is hit,\nthe load balancer says, hey,\n\n521\n00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:09.590\nredirect traffic over here instead.\n\n522\n00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:16.010\nSo if we do something like this it will go\nahead and start redirecting everybody else\n\n523\n00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.700\nthat may be at that particular threshold\nhere to start sending down this way.\n\n524\n00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:28.336\nAnd to make that\nconnection happen instead.\n\n525\n00:28:28.336 --> 00:28:33.030\nSo that way it really does help\nus out to be able to do that.\n\n526\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.790\nWhere it is spreading\nout to the point where,\n\n527\n00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.620\nwhat it does now is actually evens out\nthe load, depending on what's happening.\n\n528\n00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.917\nWhether this attack is successful or not.\n\n529\n00:28:41.917 --> 00:28:46.910\nIt is able to distribute that attack\nacross both of those servers.\n\n530\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.140\nSo it can really help balance that out and\n\n531\n00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.970\nkeep us running as far as\na regular attack goes.\n\n532\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.974\nNow, the problem that we have is simple,\n\n533\n00:28:53.974 --> 00:28:56.740\nload balancers don't just\nhelp out in terms of attacks.\n\n534\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.690\nThey can help out at times\nwhen there are attacks.\n\n535\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.968\nSo we normally consider\nthat high traffic spikes.\n\n536\n00:29:02.968 --> 00:29:07.300\nIf it's just one time, no big deal,\nload balancer handles it very quickly.\n\n537\n00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.880\nBut one of the true tests of load\nbalancing, is not only just over\n\n538\n00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.370\na particular spike or some kind of denial\nof service attack that can happen, but\n\n539\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.800\nalso, is it actually what we call\ndurable in its way of doing it.\n\n540\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.950\nSo in other words, is the configuration\nsomething that really is easy and\n\n541\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.780\nactually works all the time.\n\n542\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.970\nSo Cherokee had mentioned the idea of\nRound Robin type of load balancing here\n\n543\n00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.870\nwhere it's the first one and then second\none and then comes back to first one,\n\n544\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.680\nsecond one again, and\nkeeps distributing the traffic like that.\n\n545\n00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.450\nWell, that's actually a good form of\nload balancing in terms of durability.\n\n546\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.270\nBecause we're not say,\nhit a threshold limit and\n\n547\n00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.220\nthen at the threshold limit,\nload balancer says, oops.\n\n548\n00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:52.190\nLet me start sending traffic over here and\nkinda letting this guy go,\n\n549\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.960\nall right, I'll handle what I can but\neverybody else needs to go over here.\n\n550\n00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.640\nThe idea here of round robin, right, says\none here, one here, one here, one here.\n\n551\n00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.330\nIt distributes it over time, and\nthat way you never get that idea\n\n552\n00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:11.140\nthat Web01 here is gonna feel\nlike it's met its threshold.\n\n553\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.730\nIt should be distributing\nthe balance between them and\n\n554\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.060\nthat's something else\nthat can also happen too.\n\n555\n00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.590\nAnd of course,\n\n556\n00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:22.370\njust regular types of attacks that go on\nby trying to do a denial of service or\n\n557\n00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:27.620\noverwhelming types of whatever, might\nbe reverse types of denial of service.\n\n558\n00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.240\nYou name it, there's tons of\ndifferent things that can happen.\n\n559\n00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.040\nBut load balancers are really good at\nbeing able to go, Look, on that attack,\n\n560\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.190\nyeah it will just follow rules or it will\nset threshold or it will do anything.\n\n561\n00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.946\nBut overall though it really is\na form of some type of security, but\n\n562\n00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:46.780\nnot in the traditional\nsense of stopping a virus.\n\n563\n00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.040\nNot in traditional since of\ndoing anything like that.\n\n564\n00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.640\nSo once you have something like this,\nright, well what do you do?\n\n565\n00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.660\nWell, most of us instead of even doing\nthis anymore on our own on-site,\n\n566\n00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.460\nwe're gonna host everything in\nthe cloud is what we're gonna do.\n\n567\n00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.050\nAnd by kind of the way that they set it up\nin cloud environments, is they're ready to\n\n568\n00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:08.540\ndo unload balancing whether or\nnot you care about them doing it or not.\n\n569\n00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.415\nWhen you spin up servers, it really helps,\n\n570\n00:31:10.415 --> 00:31:13.063\nbecause they're also dealing\nwith the same conditions too.\n\n571\n00:31:13.063 --> 00:31:17.400\nSo always realize that there are other\ncontexts that we don't think about.\n\n572\n00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.450\nThere really is a security context and\nthese are things that we also have to\n\n573\n00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.750\nmonitor to see if we have to change it or\nnot.\n\n574\n00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.370\nAnd that's kind of the key here.\n\n575\n00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.090\nThere's a lot of these different contexts,\nbut\n\n576\n00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.720\nthose are at least the few that we have\nto make sure that we cover right here.\n\n577\n00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.720\n&gt;&gt; You're right, Cisco did give us a lot\nof different context to look at and\n\n578\n00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.990\nunderstand.\n\n579\n00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.850\nIn this episode alone,\nwhat did we look at?\n\n580\n00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:42.851\nWe looked at Tunneling, encryption, peer\nto peer, encapsulation and load balancing.\n\n581\n00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:45.219\nBut it's a great place\nto really get started so\n\n582\n00:31:45.219 --> 00:31:49.106\nyou can understand the different types\nof traffic and then understand why or\n\n583\n00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:51.640\nwhy not you would want\nthem on your networks.\n\n584\n00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.220\nSo thank you Ronnie for\nexplaining that to us today.\n\n585\n00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.610\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen so much for tuning in.\n\n586\n00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:58.360\nBut stay tuned,\n\n587\n00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:03.090\nwe do have additional Cisco Cybersecurity\ninformation headed your way.\n\n588\n00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.710\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n589\n00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.080\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n590\n00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:06.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:16.966\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:21.497\nIn this episode, we will be\ndescribing different types of next\n\n9\n00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:25.180\ngeneration intrusion\nprevention system events.\n\n10\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.269\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.910\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.020\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on taking a look at more\n\n13\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.860\nCisco cyber security.\n\n14\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.440\nWe're really starting to get towards where\nwe need to take a look at some different\n\n15\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.120\nattacks on some different events here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.880\nBut we still need to focus in on some\nof the different things that we have to\n\n17\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.180\nreally be able to understand and\n\n18\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.640\nsee inside of our network especially\nas more traffic is coming in.\n\n19\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.402\nSo that's what we're gonna be\ntaking a look at today as well.\n\n20\n00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:52.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so specifically,\n\n21\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.330\nwe have our intrusion prevention, next\ngeneration intrusion prevention systems.\n\n22\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.914\nThey're logging and hopefully preventing\nthese types of attacks as we see malicious\n\n23\n00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:03.004\ntraffic coming in.\n\n24\n00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.750\nBut what type of events should we\nreally be on the look out for?\n\n25\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down\nto thinking about of course\n\n26\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.110\nnext generation intrusion\nprevention systems.\n\n27\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.830\nIt really takes a moment here for\n\n28\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.600\nus to just kind of go, all right what\nmakes it next generation, right?\n\n29\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.350\nCompared to the old intrusion prevention\nsystems that we've had in the past.\n\n30\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190\nIntrusion prevention systems\nessentially are online devices,\n\n31\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.410\nor inline devices I should say, which\nstop an attack from really occurring.\n\n32\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.361\nIn other words, whatever the target is,\n\n33\n00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:35.060\nit's not gonna get affected by the attack\nbecause it's stopped right there.\n\n34\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.185\nAnd that's normally all we really cared\nabout in the past was just saying,\n\n35\n00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:41.490\nall right, we've got a device in place and\nthat we need it stopped.\n\n36\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370\nBut the problem with\nthat is fairly simple.\n\n37\n00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.190\nEven though we stopped it, we don't know\nmuch more about what's actually happened.\n\n38\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.770\nWho's it actually targeted against,\nwhat was going on.\n\n39\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.610\nYou name it at the time that\neverything else was happening.\n\n40\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.520\nSo the next generation types of\nintrusion prevention systems,\n\n41\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.000\nlike what we're gonna take a look in here,\nare designed around three principles.\n\n42\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.010\nFirst and foremost the idea of prevention.\n\n43\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.530\nThat sounds good, right?\n\n44\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.680\nStopping something before the attack\ncan happen, it tries to do that\n\n45\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280\nby using regular source definitions\nlike what we would normally think of.\n\n46\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.850\nSame time, it takes a look at\nlive time attacks as well and\n\n47\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.300\nwhat it's trying to do is actually give\nmore exposure to those types of events.\n\n48\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.059\nIn other words,\nshowing us what actually is happening and\n\n49\n00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.056\nwhat's been happening inside\nyour networks if you needed to.\n\n50\n00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:33.161\nAnd then lastly, of course, if there is an\nattack that goes on, we also want to take\n\n51\n00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:36.916\na look at a retrospection idea, the\nability to take all that information and\n\n52\n00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:41.280\ngather it together to analyze it, so\nthat we can be better prepared as well.\n\n53\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.210\nSo inside of Cisco's version of\ntaking a look at next generation\n\n54\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.440\nintrusion prevention systems, it means\nwe need to at least be familiar with\n\n55\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.710\nsome of the events that\nwe're really looking at.\n\n56\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.640\nMost of us that are working at\na small to medium sized business,\n\n57\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.330\nwe've kind of been locked out of this\nparticular level of equipment and\n\n58\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.600\nit's not because that there's a certain\nlevel that you have to get to,\n\n59\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.470\nit's just that the equipment\nis insanely expensive.\n\n60\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo to actually be able to buy\nthe intrusion prevention system,\n\n61\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.430\nto be able to add on all those features\nthat give you everything that you need to,\n\n62\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.750\nit requires a bit of an investment\nthat small to medium businesses go\n\n63\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.720\nI don't know if I can really afford it.\n\n64\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.420\nBut even so, right, it also means\nthat on the cyber security exam, they\n\n65\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.500\nstill expect you to at least know some of\nthe events that you're looking for and we,\n\n66\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.630\nof course, are going to use Cisco's\nequipment to help us to find those out.\n\n67\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.090\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat different events such as\n\n68\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.710\nconnection events that we talked about,\nintrusion events.\n\n69\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.590\nWe're going to talk about events that\nalso happen on the end point as well,\n\n70\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.670\nin other words, host events that go on.\n\n71\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.940\nNetwork discovery, as well as even net\nflow and why that data fits into this\n\n72\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.640\nidea of everything that we're\ntaking a look at as well.\n\n73\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.060\nSo, the great thing is,\n\n74\n00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.090\nI have access to one of these next\ngeneration intrusion prevention systems.\n\n75\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.120\nBut this is a caveat that I\nhave to throw in there, right?\n\n76\n00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.850\nSo, what we're actually\ngoing to take a look at,\n\n77\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.740\nit's gonna seem very similar to something\nwe looked at earlier in our series,\n\n78\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.662\nwhich is going to be the Cisco\nFirepower Management Center, right?\n\n79\n00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:16.845\nThere a particular management\nconsole that really is\n\n80\n00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:20.320\nabout defending the network\nin live time active threats.\n\n81\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.430\nIt does everything that's possible here.\n\n82\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.670\nThe intrusion prevention system\nthough is called FireSIGHT.\n\n83\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.140\nIt's not that much of a difference.\n\n84\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.790\nIf you take a look at the interface and\n\n85\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.630\nyou take a look at the previous\nepisode where we did this and\n\n86\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.120\nif it's close enough together cuz I\ncan't even remember when we did it.\n\n87\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.973\nIt wasn't too long ago.\n\n88\n00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:39.190\nBut when you actually look at it, like\nwait a minute, that's the same thing that\n\n89\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.430\nI looked at in another episode and\nit is and it isn't, okay.\n\n90\n00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.470\nIt's very similar in\neverything that it looks like.\n\n91\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.020\nBut the idea here is that this one\nreally does plug in to those intrusion\n\n92\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.530\nprevention systems from Cisco,\nthe 4,000 series types of events or\n\n93\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.410\nsystems that they have instead of\nsomething like the advance fire power,\n\n94\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.900\nfire walls that you see the ASAs\nthey talk about as well.\n\n95\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.490\nSo that's what we're gonna be looking\nat and we would just want to show you,\n\n96\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.680\nmake sure that you know what it is\nthat you're normally looking for\n\n97\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.560\nwhen you open up an intrusion\nprevention system,\n\n98\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.070\nespecially a next generation one and\na take look what you have in place.\n\n99\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.740\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my system here.\n\n100\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.520\nAnd this will give us access\nto the Cisco FireSIGHT,\n\n101\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.570\nwhich is directly connected, of course, to\nthat next generation intrusion prevention\n\n102\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.030\nsystem and right way I clicked\non the Analysis tab here.\n\n103\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.300\nAnd on this context explorer,\nit at least gives us an overview or\n\n104\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.110\na summary of all the things\nthat you can pretty much see.\n\n105\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.320\nAnd it really is a good summary of\ninformation that can help us out.\n\n106\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.160\nSo right at the beginning here,\nnotice that it actually has traffic and\n\n107\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.820\nintrusion events over just a time period.\n\n108\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.630\nNow the reason why I'm pointing that out\nis I wanna make sure that we can see\n\n109\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.620\neverything here.\n\n110\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.130\nThere's a blue line that you see and\nof course there's a red line.\n\n111\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.506\nThe red line represents, of course,\nintrusion events that go on.\n\n112\n00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:09.884\nThe blue line represents the amount\nof traffic that we have, so\n\n113\n00:06:09.884 --> 00:06:11.873\nwhat are we normally worried about?\n\n114\n00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:15.804\nIf we're worried about intrusions,\nI can essentially go, all right,\n\n115\n00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:21.050\nright here is an event on February 10th\nand there's 74 events that have happened.\n\n116\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.250\nBut at this point in time, notice I can\ncompare that to the amount of traffic\n\n117\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.180\nin which the traffic really wasn't bad.\n\n118\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.350\nIt was about 3 megabytes of traffic.\n\n119\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.030\nSo I'm trying to make sure I look at\nthat 3 kilobytes to megabytes, yep.\n\n120\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.680\nSo it says 3 million kilobytes, or\nkilobits or traffic, excuse me,\n\n121\n00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.510\nmaybe bytes, I can't really tell exactly.\n\n122\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.610\nSo in this instance, you can compare and\n\n123\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.070\ngo, hey, look, when I had less traffic,\nmore events seemed to be occurring.\n\n124\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.460\nIs there a time when that\nactivity does matter?\n\n125\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.980\nSo, this can give you at least a very\nquick idea of what's going on the heaviest\n\n126\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.960\ntraffic, notice that my events were\nreally fairly low by comparison.\n\n127\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.000\nThen as I scroll down, notice this\nnext section here that gives me\n\n128\n00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.210\nindications of compromise as I zoom in\nhere on the indications on compromise.\n\n129\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.480\nLet me see if I can scroll back there.\n\n130\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.880\nNotice this nice pie chart and\n\n131\n00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.910\nit gives us two different rings,\nis what it gives us, right.\n\n132\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.630\nWe notice that we can actually\nsee a threat has been detected.\n\n133\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.240\nYou can also see how it's broken\nit down across all the systems\n\n134\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.990\nthat are currently being\nmonitored here as well.\n\n135\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.270\nSo here are certain threats.\n\n136\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.604\nHere's the impact ones, impact two and\nhere another one is the fire amp,\n\n137\n00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:43.596\nthe advanced malware protection and\nyou can continue to go around and\n\n138\n00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:48.519\nyou can see individual types of\nintrusion events that have gone on.\n\n139\n00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:51.229\nAnd if you go into this inner ring,\ntry and\n\n140\n00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.880\nsee if I can hover over it\nto bring what I wanted to.\n\n141\n00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.670\nNotice that this one shows you\nmalware has been detected here.\n\n142\n00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.037\nAnd if you wanted to you could drill in\neven further to show you those malware\n\n143\n00:08:03.037 --> 00:08:07.420\nevents as you needed to over on the right\nhand side Indications by the host.\n\n144\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.980\nSo every individual device that\nI'm monitoring on my network or\n\n145\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.140\nmy particular subset of different things\nthat are going on I can tell that this one\n\n146\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:24.750\nIP address has 13 indications that, hey,\nsome type of intrusion event has gone on.\n\n147\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's what that term Cisco\nis referencing here as far as indications,\n\n148\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.025\na type of event.\n\n149\n00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yep.\n\n150\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.620\nThat's what you're actually\nstarting to see is that, hey,\n\n151\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.790\nthere's some indication that\nthe systems have been compromised here.\n\n152\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; As I continue to scroll on through,\n\n153\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.440\nof course we can even see breakdown.\n\n154\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.020\nRemember that right here on\nthe network information and\n\n155\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.580\nwe'll see even a little bit further, and\nwe're not gonna go through everything, but\n\n156\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.620\nyou'll see at least some of this.\n\n157\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.370\nI can see the breakdown by the operating\nsystems, so on this network I have\n\n158\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:59.750\neverything ranging from Vista to Windows\n2000, to Windows 7 to Windows NT.\n\n159\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n160\n00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Apparently is still\nrunning on this one.\n\n161\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.520\nAnd there's a lot of other devices.\n\n162\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.770\nThe effect of all these other\nsmaller devices of course today\n\n163\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.080\nare due to the BYOD market more than\nanything else that you're starting to see.\n\n164\n00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.170\nAnd then even the amount of\ntraffic that is going on per\n\n165\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.910\nsource device as well in the connections.\n\n166\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.120\nYou name it we can even go by user.\n\n167\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.160\nI can even see that one particular\nuser here which is Kim Abercrombie.\n\n168\n00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:35.630\nYep, she is using a lot of traffic\njust about 69 mbs of traffic.\n\n169\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.010\nThat's pretty hefty.\n\n170\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.110\nLet's see all right, let me scroll\non down just a little bit more.\n\n171\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.690\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthe connections by the control actions and\n\n172\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.980\nSNL status.\n\n173\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.610\nBut notice that there's\neven protocol events.\n\n174\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.330\nAnd of course,\napplications that we can see.\n\n175\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.960\nSo on my network,\nI can scroll down here and\n\n176\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.420\neven see some of the different\ntypes of traffic.\n\n177\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.420\nOf course, HTTP is by far the most\npredominant traffic that I have\n\n178\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.000\navailable by risk and application.\n\n179\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.280\nIn the center here,\nokay, intrusion events.\n\n180\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.780\nSo here, it's saying, hey,\nvery low in terms of it's intrusion.\n\n181\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.390\nNow you go into medium and\nthen of course even higher.\n\n182\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.940\nThere's potential little tiny, sliver of-\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty impressive Ronnie-\n\n183\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of-\n\n184\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we didn't have something like this\n\n185\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.110\nbefore, then you know a lot of people\ndidn't, a lot of people couldn't afford\n\n186\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.710\nthis, and then being able to look at\nsomething at this detailed level.\n\n187\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.190\nIt's pretty impressive.\n\n188\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is just the summary.\n\n189\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.843\nThat's the weird thing.\n\n190\n00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:34.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the summary of the information.\n\n191\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.940\nThat we're really taking a look at.\n\n192\n00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.350\nSo as I scroll on down through here,\n\n193\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.450\nthis is where it becomes a little bit\nmore towards the cybersecurity site.\n\n194\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.280\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n195\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.240\nAll that information should feed in to\nhelping us understand a little bit more,\n\n196\n00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.910\nbut notice that this one is\ncalled security intelligence.\n\n197\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:56.760\nSecurity intelligence by category I can\nsee different number of attackers, and but\n\n198\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.910\nI'm trying to see if I can, if I scroll\nout too much, I can't see it at all.\n\n199\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.840\nControl and command, there, there we go.\n\n200\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.670\nThese are different bots that\nare happening on the network.\n\n201\n00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.310\nThis one, I hear, is a Tor exit node,\nthat's existing wow,\n\n202\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.810\nright inside of my system here.\n\n203\n00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.690\nSomething is suspicious here.\n\n204\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.585\nThat's an unusual category where\nyou see the term suspicious.\n\n205\n00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:18.618\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then open relay.\n\n206\n00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:26.230\nHere's a type of attack that's gone spam,\nopen proxy connections, malware.\n\n207\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.780\nSo these are things that should\nmake you kind of aware of things.\n\n208\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.460\nThat go all right, so what are some of\nthe things that we're taking a look at.\n\n209\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.950\nNow, once you actually discover\nwhat it is that you really want.\n\n210\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.190\nAnd I'm trying to zoom back in and\nfocus us back on the entire thing\n\n211\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.000\nis we wanna take a look at the idea\nof connection events just briefly.\n\n212\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.230\nIf I come up here to the top I select\nConnections notice I have Events and\n\n213\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.350\nI have Security Events.\n\n214\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.300\nI'm just gonna select regular\nevents at this point and\n\n215\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.060\nthis provides us details on connections.\n\n216\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.970\nThat are pretty much made throughout\nevery system that I am monitoring.\n\n217\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.910\nI can see those connections,\nactive connections that are going on.\n\n218\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.990\nSo first packet and\nlast packet, and the time.\n\n219\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.898\nWhether the action was allowed, or whether\nthere was a block or a block with a reset.\n\n220\n00:12:16.898 --> 00:12:20.570\nYou name it, there's actually quite\na bit of information we can see\n\n221\n00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.450\nscrolling over to the right a little bit.\n\n222\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:29.940\nAnd get down here so I can scroll on\nover to the right using the scroll bar.\n\n223\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.820\nYou can even see some of the zones\nthat it actually went through as far\n\n224\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.920\nas different security zones.\n\n225\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.380\nThe port that I was trying to use and\nevent the URL.\n\n226\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.280\nSo, these are regular types of events that\nwe normally would just say, all right.\n\n227\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.890\nThat just shows us traffic going by and\n\n228\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.790\nthat's no big deal whether it was\nstopped or not, we couldn't help that.\n\n229\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.300\nBut if I select connection and\nsecurity intelligence events.\n\n230\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.320\nThis gives me categories of how\nthis is gonna be treated, or\n\n231\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.630\nat least I think it does, okay there\nit goes it'll just take a moment.\n\n232\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.300\nAnd as here,\nit looks exactly identical, but\n\n233\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.870\nif I scroll over to the right again,\nkind of have to zoom out a little bit.\n\n234\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.750\nAnd then, if I scroll in.\n\n235\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.910\nNotice, right here, I have an additional\ncategory that talks about security\n\n236\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.390\nintelligence category,\ncommand and control, attackers.\n\n237\n00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.350\nOpen proxies, bogons,\ntour exit nodes, attackers.\n\n238\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.870\nYou name it.\nHere's spam down here at the bottom.\n\n239\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.850\nThere's responding country.\n\n240\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.380\nThere's a lot of details\nthat we can find out\n\n241\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.750\njust from taking a look\nat that information.\n\n242\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.460\nAnd now we can do a further examination.\n\n243\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.240\nSource port center connecting in,\ndestination ports, you name it.\n\n244\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.280\nThere is a lot of\ninformation that we can use\n\n245\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.930\nto really help us to be a bit more secure.\n\n246\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.860\nSo the connection of us are fairly Nice to\nhelp us to know if things are still going\n\n247\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.010\non right now and whether or not it's\nconsidered a threat or not at this point.\n\n248\n00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.900\nOf course right next to the idea\nof connection types of events\n\n249\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.610\nis going to be intrusions too, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.540\nSo when you take a look at this idea of\nintrusions notice that there are events.\n\n251\n00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.940\nWell, that's an intrusion event.\n\n252\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.130\nThat makes sense.\n\n253\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.330\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick here on the intrusion event and\n\n254\n00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.350\nin a moment,\nhopefully everything is switching over.\n\n255\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.950\nAnd you can see where it changes its focus\nhere to where it says intrusion event.\n\n256\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.900\nWell, it's here I'm going to switch\nthis table view of the events\n\n257\n00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.440\nto give us a little bit\nmore detailed information.\n\n258\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.620\nIt does show us the message and\nas well as the priority and\n\n259\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.940\nclassification of the intrusion\nthe way that Cisco has this tied in\n\n260\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.440\nto their overall security\nintelligence system via Talos.\n\n261\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.220\nI can't actually pronounce it.\n\n262\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.210\nAnd this one gives us a little bit more.\n\n263\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.760\nNotice, it gives the impact number.\n\n264\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.670\nAnd of course,\n\n265\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.050\nall of the other additional information\nthat we would normally expect to see.\n\n266\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:06.190\nAlong with the message\nthat it's providing.\n\n267\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.240\nHow it's been classified.\n\n268\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.120\nSo, Potential Corporate Policy Violation.\n\n269\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Well, how the heck would I know that.\n\n270\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.500\nBut this system knows it.\n\n271\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.040\nAttempted attack information, or\nan attempted information leak,\n\n272\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.610\nto somebody attempted\na privileged escalation here.\n\n273\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.300\nYou can see where this really does\nshow you a lot more information,\n\n274\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.320\nwhen you start to take\na look at the idea of this.\n\n275\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.140\nThere's a lot of insight that you're\ngaining from looking at the information.\n\n276\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.990\n&gt;&gt; And just looking at that one\nparticular event where it says it's\n\n277\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.430\na potential policy violation.\n\n278\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.980\nThat's kind of telling because we're\nreally seeing it being used in a corporate\n\n279\n00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.150\nenvironment like Ronnie had said.\n\n280\n00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.655\nNot necessarily a good solution due to the\ncost for maybe a smaller Implementation,\n\n281\n00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:56.531\nbut remember you also want to\nkeep in mind that you're being\n\n282\n00:15:56.531 --> 00:16:01.440\ntransparent with your end users as well or\nyour employees so that you know.\n\n283\n00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.736\nThey know that they're being monitored\nthis is not something you'd want to use,\n\n284\n00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:08.860\nnot a tool you would want to on\na network other then your own.\n\n285\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.410\nI think we've mentioned this before but\nyou just want to be sure you're falling\n\n286\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:17.230\ninto that proper realm and you're not\nover stepping your boundaries in any way.\n\n287\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's no doubt\nthat you can overstep and\n\n288\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.790\ndo things that you're not suppose to do.\n\n289\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.660\nWhen you take a look at events like this.\n\n290\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.340\nBut the very fact is each one\nof these different categories,\n\n291\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.810\nI thought I could right click something\nbut it didn't lead us anywhere.\n\n292\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.600\nMost of these also have like\na help file associated with them.\n\n293\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.870\nSo if I select it, let's see if it gives\nme the information I was looking for here.\n\n294\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.410\nThat really kind of let's you know,\n\n295\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.580\nhey here's more details on what\nthis potential classification is.\n\n296\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.690\nBut this one just led me to the priority\nby the classification instead.\n\n297\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.785\nSo, you will see some of\nthese will have additional\n\n298\n00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:56.987\ninformation such as the icons\nthat have them lit up.\n\n299\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.780\nAnd now in the moment,\nlet's see if that shows up for us here.\n\n300\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.870\nAnd that gives us more and more detailed\ninformation, the impact, the attack,\n\n301\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:15.710\nthe intrusion, whether it was successful,\nand you can see something just like this,\n\n302\n00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.200\nwhich lets you know that\nthis is pretty bad, right.\n\n303\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.980\nSays impact intrusion event successful and\nit was on the admin account as well.\n\n304\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.047\nSo you can see where it says, admin and\nthen also on the user an exploit kit,\n\n305\n00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:34.553\nMalware C&amp;C got connected,\nthis machine is essentially owned by\n\n306\n00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:39.640\nsomebody else not even my company anymore,\nis what we would end up seeing.\n\n307\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.500\nNow, from that point, right, does it mean\nthat it hasn't been taken care of yet?\n\n308\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.270\nNo, it doesn't necessarily mean that.\n\n309\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.730\nThe entire system joined together, right,\nwith all those other things that we have\n\n310\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.140\nin place, in the Cisco FirePOWER,\nis probably already been taken care of.\n\n311\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.150\nBut this gives us that event, right, so\nthat we can log it and so that we can\n\n312\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.690\nhave the information and do analysis\nbased on this later on as well, right.\n\n313\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:08.550\nSo, there is a lot of information from\nthe intrusions as well as the connections,\n\n314\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.890\nthat really show us that.\n\n315\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.140\nWell, what happens once you get to that\npoint where you find a particular host?\n\n316\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.340\nWell, that means we can come up\nhere to where it says, hosts.\n\n317\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.410\nFrom this point,\nwe can also select what host events.\n\n318\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.460\nHost events are end point type of events\nusually allow us to also be able to see\n\n319\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.810\ndifferent, of course, the devices that are\nconnecting and how many different devices.\n\n320\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.980\nBut then if I go up to Host and\nIndications of Compromise,\n\n321\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.460\nthis was that summary of information\nthat we were looking at earlier.\n\n322\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.610\nWe also can be able to see this by the\nhost itself or at least I think we can.\n\n323\n00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.390\nAnd it's right here where I can\nsee the Indication of Compromise.\n\n324\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.145\nI'm gonna go to this Table View.\n\n325\n00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:56.928\nIt's always easier to go to the Table View\nbecause this one is kind of summarized and\n\n326\n00:18:56.928 --> 00:19:01.500\nthen, now I can see by the IP address,\nwhat has happened here?\n\n327\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.870\nMalware detected,\nthreat detected in a file transfer,\n\n328\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.500\nthe host encountered, well, malware.\n\n329\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.000\nIt's pretty detailed.\n\n330\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.250\nWhen did we first see it?\n\n331\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.470\nWell, right here and\nthen at this particular time as well.\n\n332\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.020\nLast time we saw it.\n\n333\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.030\nYou name it, you can go back through and\nyou can start seeing some different ones.\n\n334\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.040\nSo this idea of the command and\ncontrol connected.\n\n335\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.330\nSecurity intelligence event,\nnotice it tells us that right here.\n\n336\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.370\nThe host may be underneath\na remote control at this point.\n\n337\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.450\nSo somewhere it's called back home and\nits now made that connection back in.\n\n338\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.740\nThere's a lot of different things that\nwe have to very much pay attention to.\n\n339\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.610\nThis gives us the live time analysis as\nwell as what has happened in the past\n\n340\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.180\nwhen we start to take a look there too.\n\n341\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.370\nNow one of the key categories\nis not as easily found here\n\n342\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.050\nis going to be what we call\nNetwork Discover Events.\n\n343\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.330\nSo this is one of those hidden ones\nas much as everything else we've seen\n\n344\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.890\nup here, very much at the top.\n\n345\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.620\nThis one is done underneath Policies.\n\n346\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.067\nSo if I go to Policies,\n\n347\n00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:08.580\nnow you'll see that the bar underneath\nshows us a lot of menu options.\n\n348\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.224\nLet me see if I can click on it,\nand while it's loading its page,\n\n349\n00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:15.732\nyou can see that there's a lot of\ndifferent ways that we can set\n\n350\n00:20:15.732 --> 00:20:19.640\nup policies, and\nthis is how we control the access, right?\n\n351\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.090\nSo getting in here, making policies,\n\n352\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.930\nis pretty much that\nprevention side of things.\n\n353\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.100\nWhereas the analysis side is saying,\nlet me just get all the information and\n\n354\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.620\nthen I can do the analysis.\n\n355\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.500\nWe haven't talked anything about doing an\nreal prevention because a lot of what we\n\n356\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.170\ndo as cybersecurity is gonna\nbe analyzation more than\n\n357\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.260\ntrying to set up all the policies but\nthat can be included in there.\n\n358\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.570\nRight here,\nwhen we start sending a Policies,\n\n359\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.470\nnotice that there is Network Discovery.\n\n360\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.980\nSo right here is of course all\nof our network discovery events.\n\n361\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.470\nThe network discovery events include\nusers as well as networks and\n\n362\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.620\neven whatever is under advanced here.\n\n363\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.230\nThat's what we wanted to take a look at.\n\n364\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.980\nNow this is not saying, I'm going to\ngo ahead and discovery everything.\n\n365\n00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.460\nIt's saying how you are setting\nup policies to do discovery.\n\n366\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.410\nThe reason why this is important is\nbecause even though it can do it\n\n367\n00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.400\non it's own, as long as you have\nthose systems managed underneath,\n\n368\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.840\nyour entire security cloud from Cisco,\neverything is great.\n\n369\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.460\nBut you also have devices that\nhave this ability to report\n\n370\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.740\nmore detailed information and\nif I scroll on down to the bottom,\n\n371\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.810\nnotice right here,\nI can add in NetFlow Devices.\n\n372\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.007\nWe've already talked about\nNetFlow a couple of times.\n\n373\n00:21:25.007 --> 00:21:25.858\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n374\n00:21:25.858 --> 00:21:30.589\n&gt;&gt; In the entire series, but it really\ndoes give us that connection information\n\n375\n00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:34.250\nbetween endpoints that we may\nwant to have in place as well.\n\n376\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.570\nSo as long as I have devices that have\nNetFlow, I can start gathering even more\n\n377\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.970\ninformation that feeds into my system for\neven more analysis to happen.\n\n378\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.290\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, instead of us switching\non over to a separate utility,\n\n379\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.970\nI can just go to a one stop shop and\nhave all of my information in one location\n\n380\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.740\nwhich kind of makes it easier for\nthe admins and the security professionals.\n\n381\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.840\n&gt;&gt; It really does it allows us to take\nevery thing that NetFlow can give.\n\n382\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.600\nAnd then add it into this system without\nhaving to also get another third party\n\n383\n00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.120\nutility that just translates\nthe NetFlow into something graphical.\n\n384\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.732\nIt can all do it in one particular place,\nhere.\n\n385\n00:22:09.732 --> 00:22:12.760\nSo NetFlow events really do help and\n\n386\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.960\nreally do end up adding in more and\nmore to the analysis side.\n\n387\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.300\nEverything that the IPS can really do,\nthe next generation IPS can do.\n\n388\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.910\nSo there's a lot of this where\nyou do have to pay attention\n\n389\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.860\nto where things are located.\n\n390\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.300\nYou do have to make sure that you\nunderstand that you can find out\n\n391\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.190\na lot of information.\n\n392\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.720\nAnd as much as I like these\ndifferent views, the great thing is,\n\n393\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.170\nyou don't really have to know every\nsingle of them but for the sake\n\n394\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.610\nof completeness on the exam you do have to\nknow at least what they're about, right?\n\n395\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:50.305\nConnections in Cisco FirePOWER and\nFireSIGHT essentially are really\n\n396\n00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:55.335\nNetFlow events,\nI mean that's what they really are, okay.\n\n397\n00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:57.260\nNow it doesn't mean that\nthey're using NetFlow, but\n\n398\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.905\nthey're NetFlow like events and\nif you really want a true NetFlow data,\n\n399\n00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:04.865\nwe go ahead and set a policy and\nwe pull in that NetFlow.\n\n400\n00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:09.420\nBut it is doing essentially that, so\nthe terminology is a little bit different,\n\n401\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.830\nwhereas we would specifically say net\nflow when we're dealing with a router.\n\n402\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.320\nHere inside a FireSIGHT and FirePOWER it\nis really all these connections that we\n\n403\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.340\nhave available and that's gonna give us\nthe information that we want to, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.200\nSo make sure you understand,\nwe can normally look for\n\n405\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.308\nconnection events to prove that we\nare having those connections go on.\n\n406\n00:23:28.308 --> 00:23:31.575\nWe also wanna look at intrusions\nas well as from the host,\n\n407\n00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:34.400\nthe indications of compromise\nthat have happened.\n\n408\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.760\nAnd then lastly also remember we want to\ntake a look at Network Discovery events,\n\n409\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.290\nwhich also give us the ability\nto find NetFlow information too.\n\n410\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:47.330\nSo and take and look at all that,\nmost of us, I hate to say it,\n\n411\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.620\nwe're probably not gonna be\ndoing that on a daily basis.\n\n412\n00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.220\n&gt;&gt; It would be nice to\nhave this tool though.\n\n413\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.870\n&gt;&gt; It would be nice and\nit would be incredible, right.\n\n414\n00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.530\nBecause this is one of the most advanced\ntools that are out there in the world.\n\n415\n00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.270\nAnd it's great, it's something\nthat you really want to get into.\n\n416\n00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.010\nBut we're not setting up anything, so\n\n417\n00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.235\nwe kind of give you a very you\nknow 50 thousand foot overview.\n\n418\n00:24:08.235 --> 00:24:10.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you want to learn more about this\n\n419\n00:24:10.928 --> 00:24:14.980\nmake sure you check out the Cisco SSFPS or\nwhatever it was.\n\n420\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.790\nUse to be called Sourcefire, right?\n\n421\n00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.155\nSo there's a Sourcefire IPS show\nthat we have that Todd Langley and\n\n422\n00:24:21.155 --> 00:24:24.410\nDon Posett hosted, make sure you check\nthat out if you wanna learn more about\n\n423\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.770\nhow to set up stuff like this.\n\n424\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.940\nIt really is the way that\nthose big companies and\n\n425\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.290\nsuper large companies\nare gonna be working.\n\n426\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.360\nSmall to medium companies,\nyou'll kinda have to deal with the fact of\n\n427\n00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.960\nintrusion prevention\nsystems that are out there.\n\n428\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.780\nBut on the exam,\nthey do call out this next generation.\n\n429\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.220\nAnd that usually applies of course then,\nto the Cisco stuff.\n\n430\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.560\nAnd you just have to know that,\nyes, I can see those events.\n\n431\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.720\nWhat particular device\nwould help me to do that.\n\n432\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.520\nNext generation firewall, next\ngeneration intrusion prevention system.\n\n433\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.580\nConvention events next generation\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n434\n00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.970\nCan you still see them in\nthe firewall thing too?\n\n435\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.180\nAbsolutely.\n\n436\n00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.540\nBut remember especially if we are looking\nfor, what, the systems that are doing\n\n437\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.960\nthe analysis and the monitoring, that’s\nwhat we're really looking at is those two.\n\n438\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.230\nSo very easy to get confused but\n\n439\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:21.025\nif they give you FirePOWER if they give\nyou FireSIGHT make sure you know that\n\n440\n00:25:21.025 --> 00:25:25.075\nthose are the events that normally we're\nlooking for in terms of cybersecurity.\n\n441\n00:25:25.075 --> 00:25:28.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really just sounds like we\nneed to know the different types of tools\n\n442\n00:25:28.482 --> 00:25:31.263\nand solutions that are available for\nuse within our network.\n\n443\n00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.032\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So understanding them,\n\n444\n00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:36.077\nnot necessarily being an expert\nat every single tool but\n\n445\n00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:40.697\nthis is a great way to go ahead and\nget prepared for that certification exam.\n\n446\n00:25:40.697 --> 00:25:43.775\nSo thank you so much, Ronnie, for joining\nus today and explaining these topics.\n\n447\n00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:47.187\nAnd thank you so much, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in today.\n\n448\n00:25:47.187 --> 00:25:47.927\nBut stay tuned,\n\n449\n00:25:47.927 --> 00:25:51.777\nwe have more Cisco Cybersecurity\nfundamentals headed your way.\n\n450\n00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:54.667\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n451\n00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:55.447\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamental series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.860\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.060\nIn this episode,\nwe will be looking at protocols,\n\n9\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.430\nin which we need to monitor to\nmaintain the security of our networks.\n\n10\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730\nWith us today, we have Mr Ronnie Wong\nto cover these topics.\n\n11\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.360\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.210\nAs we continue on, taking look at,\n\n14\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.600\nwell, some of the different things that\nwe have to be aware of in cyber security.\n\n15\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410\nWhen we first begun in terms of cyber\nsecurity, we'll no longer just talking\n\n16\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.900\nabout monitoring the host systems,\neven though that's a part of it, right.\n\n17\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.060\nAnd monitoring network traffic,\nand that's a part of it as well.\n\n18\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.420\nWe have to be willing also to\ntake a little bit of time, and\n\n19\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.120\ntalk about some of the individual\nprotocols that we really need to take\n\n20\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.770\na look at when we start to\nexamine our networks here for\n\n21\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.720\nthe possible or the potential\nidea of breaches that happen.\n\n22\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.100\nSo we're going to examine really about\nfour or five, actually probably six or\n\n23\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.510\nseven different protocols.\n\n24\n00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.550\nI would say four or five, but we'll kind\nof group them together in the way that we\n\n25\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.700\nneed to, but\nwe'll talk about DNS just briefly.\n\n26\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.860\nWe're also going to take a look at NTP.\n\n27\n00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.990\nWe're gonna take a look at the mail\nprotocols just briefly as far as POP3 and\n\n28\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.480\nSMTP and IMAP and we'll group them\ntogether in the email is what we'll do and\n\n29\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.520\nthen of course the overwhelming protocol\nthat most of use, HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n30\n00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.010\nI want to make sure that we\nunderstand that each one of those,\n\n31\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.680\nthere are vulnerabilities to them,\n\n32\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.410\nthere are things that we actually have to\nknow, and what are we really looking for\n\n33\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.930\nwhen we start to talk about\nmonitoring different protocols.\n\n34\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.280\nSo, that is where this episode is\ngoing to take us when we begin,\n\n35\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.230\nhere, and it's very important\nthat we understand that, right.\n\n36\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.300\nSo, we're focusing in on the big ones.\n\n37\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.040\nBut remember that in every single\nnetwork you may also end up using\n\n38\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.660\nproprietary types of applications that\nmay even have their own protocols that\n\n39\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.670\nyou need to be aware of, and so you need\nto do a little bit of investigation, and\n\n40\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.800\nprobably some research on those protocols,\nand whether or\n\n41\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.210\nnot you also find vulnerabilities in\nthose too, and what you also have to do.\n\n42\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.000\n&gt;&gt; For sure, Ronnie.\n\n43\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.850\nI don't think we're able to actually be\nvery successful in protecting our network.\n\n44\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.440\nSo if we don't understand how they work,\n\n45\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.470\nbecause the attackers understand how they\nwork, and they're going to exploit those\n\n46\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.890\nvulnerabilities within the underlying\nprotocols throughout our network.\n\n47\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.320\nSo I think this is a great place\nto go ahead and take a look.\n\n48\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.560\n&gt;&gt; It really is so let's begin\nwith kind of the most pervasive\n\n49\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080\nprotocol which we tend to use every day.\n\n50\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.010\nOn our networks which is gonna be of\ncourse DNS to domain name system.\n\n51\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.484\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee,\n\n52\n00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:50.890\nas far as using DNS where do we find\nDNS in use inside of our networks?\n\n53\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.960\nJust about everywhere right?\n\n54\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.860\n&gt;&gt; Everywhere,\ninternally on our local area networks and\n\n55\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.060\nacross the entire internet, so globally.\n\n56\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you think about it.\n\n57\n00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.820\nWe name our individual host machines, as\nfar as desktop computers go, our servers\n\n58\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.180\nhave DNS names, or fully qualified domain\nnames, even our networks themselves.\n\n59\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.540\nThey're actually a registered\ndomain space in itself.\n\n60\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.810\nWhen we connect across the network even\nthough some of us might have that amazing\n\n61\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.040\nmathematical ability to connect\nto every single address by IP.\n\n62\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.690\n&gt;&gt; If you're some kind of spawn because\nI sure can't remember all of those.\n\n63\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of us are gonna\nchoose a name instead and so\n\n64\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.160\nthis is one of these protocols that\nwe should be very much monitoring,\n\n65\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.740\nbecause this is not only a great\nprotocol that everybody uses, but\n\n66\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.810\nits also a protocol that can\nbe easily exploited too, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.670\nSo taking advantage of is kind of\nunusual but it's the same thing, right?\n\n68\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.210\nThat you have to be aware of when\nyou connect to a computer by name,\n\n69\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.720\nare you really connecting to that computer\nthat you think that you're connecting to?\n\n70\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.780\nSo it is very important for\n\n71\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.640\nus to take a look at some of\nthe things that DNS really helps us do.\n\n72\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.960\nSo, for example, like,\nin Active Directory, right?\n\n73\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.140\nThe very fact is, without DNS, we really\ndon't have a hope of actually even using\n\n74\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.380\nActive Directory effectively at all.\n\n75\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.170\nSo it's very important that we\nunderstand the use of this protocol, and\n\n76\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.760\ntake a look at what it does, and\nwhat it can do, potentially, right?\n\n77\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.250\nSo, if you can control DNS inside of\nyour network, that's a good thing.\n\n78\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.890\nKeeping it secure inside of your network,\nis a great and wonderful thing.\n\n79\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.270\nYou do not want to expose your DNS records\n\n80\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.000\nto anybody that shouldn't\nhave access to them.\n\n81\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.600\nCherokee what might be the potential\ndanger, if I said I don't\n\n82\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.450\ncare that somebody gets access to my DNS\nrecord, what could end up happening?\n\n83\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Well of course if you think about it,\nour DNS records are zoned,\n\n84\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.070\nthey're just compiled in\nessentially a database.\n\n85\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.920\nSo if I'm able to access that database,\nI can manipulate that information and\n\n86\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.540\nessentially poison those records,\n\n87\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.940\nso I could, Jeez there's all\nsorts of things that I can do.\n\n88\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.010\nI could, Ronnie, tell you for\n\n89\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.510\ninstance that your default gateways IP\naddress is no longer that IP address.\n\n90\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.170\nIt now is associated with my MacBook here.\n\n91\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.240\nSo now all that traffic going\nthrough that, what you think,\n\n92\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.300\nis the default gateway,\nis really traversing my laptop.\n\n93\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.763\nI'm checking out what you are doing,\nthen I try to blackmail you, and\n\n94\n00:05:17.763 --> 00:05:20.180\nI mean that's just, that's pretty bad.\n\n95\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.940\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n96\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.670\nIt is a system like this\nright that really is so\n\n97\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.870\nhelpful to every human that\nworks on your network.\n\n98\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.250\nBut to the attacker,\n\n99\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.280\nthey can exploit it in many ways just\nlike what Cherokee was telling us about.\n\n100\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.680\nIf you were able to get access to my DNS\nzone, the database in which everything is\n\n101\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.000\nstored in, when I say everybody is going\nto point here to list to a file server,\n\n102\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.820\nwhat if instead I point them to my own\nfile server instead by changing the name\n\n103\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.560\nand then changing the IP address of where\nit goes to I point them too a directory or\n\n104\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.610\nto, not a directory, a server,\nthat I want them to go to and\n\n105\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.770\nthey start downloading, the stuff,-\n&gt;&gt; False information.\n\n106\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.540\nExactly.\n&gt;&gt; That I want them to download from.\n\n107\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.730\nSo it's very important that we understand\nhow powerful this protocol can really be.\n\n108\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.980\nSo as easy as it is, and\n\n109\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.140\nas nice as DNS makes our networks,\nit also particularly then,\n\n110\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.580\nalso gives us a vulnerability\npoint that we have to worry about.\n\n111\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.570\nAnother potential factor here is if\nsomebody is able to take over my own DNS\n\n112\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.410\nnamespace it can now be a launch place for\na botnet also to be able to take over and\n\n113\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.020\nthen start spamming a bunch\nof other places as well.\n\n114\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.330\nYou name it, a lot of things can end up\nhappening here where we not only poison\n\n115\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.780\nthe DNS records that are actually out\nthere, but now also become, of course,\n\n116\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.360\na part in aiding in to somebody\nelse's malicious activities.\n\n117\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.210\n&gt;&gt; I know, and we've talked about this\nbefore and Ronnie even in a previous\n\n118\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.620\nepisode, I'm sure we'll talk a little bit\nmore about different types of attacks, but\n\n119\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.570\nyou think about not only could\nit effect one organization.\n\n120\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.880\nBut think about the entire East Coast\nat the end of last year with dying DNS.\n\n121\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.040\nThat was a huge problem and\nit was all based around DNS\n\n122\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.300\ntype of distributed denial of service\nin attack with the DNS service.\n\n123\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, somewhere in mid-October for\nthose that are watching this a little bit\n\n124\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.600\nlater on, in mid-October of 2016, the\nentire East Coast of the United States,\n\n125\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.830\nthe Internet portion,\nreally got taken down by\n\n126\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.830\ndenial of service attack really against\nDNS is what ended up happening.\n\n127\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.360\nSo it is very powerful in some\nof the things that it can do so\n\n128\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.210\nwe need to monitor these\nprotocols inside of our network so\n\n129\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.890\nwe understand what it is that\nwe're dealing with, right?\n\n130\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.670\nSo understanding it's importance is\nprimary and key, but now we need to take\n\n131\n00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.150\na moment here and talk about well what\nis it that we begin to look for, okay.\n\n132\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.030\nWell one of the things\nthat we want to try and\n\n133\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.004\nspot with using something like DNS is\nwhat we call a malformed query okay.\n\n134\n00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:53.764\nNow when we start talking about a\nmalformed query this is normally gonna be\n\n135\n00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:58.926\na query that doesn't come in the normal\npackage or the normal sending message.\n\n136\n00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:00.259\nThat happens, right?\n\n137\n00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.798\nSo whenever a query is made, remember\nthat there's a process to the query and\n\n138\n00:08:03.798 --> 00:08:05.450\neverything else that's going on.\n\n139\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.020\nBut when there's a malformed one,\none that doesn't look normal to DNS,\n\n140\n00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.010\nthat is when you start to have\nto worry a little bit more.\n\n141\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.746\nThe reason why, is that this may actually\nindicate that somebody is trying\n\n142\n00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:22.440\nto attack the DNS server when they\nstart hearing malformed queries.\n\n143\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.510\nThe reason why is that you set up the DNS,\n\n144\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.780\nyou know what the queries are supposed\nto be, you know what's going on.\n\n145\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.010\nBut then you can end up\nsending malformed information.\n\n146\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.440\nAnd by doing something like that, right,\nit means that DNS doesn't know exactly how\n\n147\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.600\nto handle it, even though it's supposed\nto be on that particular port and\n\n148\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.170\neverything else that's happening.\n\n149\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.490\nSo you've gotta make sure\nthat you pay attention to\n\n150\n00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.350\nthe way that this DNS stuff is\nworking when you start to do that.\n\n151\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.000\nSo malformed queries are a bad one.\n\n152\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.500\nAnd how do you spot stuff like that?\n\n153\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.790\nWell, on your DNS server you start\nto open up something like Wireshark.\n\n154\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.360\nAnd then inside of Wireshark,\n\n155\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.630\nas it flows by, you can actually\nhave malformed packets come in and\n\n156\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.150\nin the description or in the info\nit says malformed packet, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.334\nThat's what it comes down to or\nmalformed query.\n\n158\n00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:07.598\nYou should be able to spot those and\n\n159\n00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:12.400\nthat is indicative that DNS is being\nattacked at some point in time.\n\n160\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.250\nSo be very careful with\njust something like that.\n\n161\n00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:20.537\nThat's a very useful tool, but\nyou're looking for information like that,\n\n162\n00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:24.846\nthat really can be causing or\nat least the indication, right,\n\n163\n00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:29.346\nthat you are having an attack that\nis beginning to happen, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:32.200\nSo that's one of\nthe branches that we can do.\n\n165\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.310\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if we take a look\nat protecting our DNS servers.\n\n166\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.630\nThat's great, but\nwhat about our local machines, or host, or\n\n167\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.580\nendpoint systems or\nlike my laptop for instance?\n\n168\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.259\nWhat if someone were able\nto compromise my system?\n\n169\n00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:49.622\nWould there be a way that they could\nmodify my local DNS cache information\n\n170\n00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:50.750\nas well?\n\n171\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthere's definitely that possibility.\n\n172\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.050\nBut we not only need to\nthink about that for\n\n173\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.150\nthe end user system,\nas far as just the local cache goes.\n\n174\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.840\nEven though that can be extremely bad but\nalso something that we normally\n\n175\n00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.140\nforget about in today's networking world,\nwhich is of course, the host file itself.\n\n176\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.070\nThe host file usually is\nthere from way decades ago.\n\n177\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.470\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I almost forgot about that guy.\n\n178\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and has lived there forever.\n\n179\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.300\nBut when you think about the process\nof the way that DNS resolves things,\n\n180\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.420\nat the very beginning, it really does\ntake a look in that host file itself, and\n\n181\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.650\nit can find entries in there.\n\n182\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.810\nWhen it doesn't find entries,\n\n183\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.560\nit then takes a look at the process and\ngoes on and eventually finds a DNS server.\n\n184\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.384\nSo on every individual machine, if you\nwanted to be able to take advantage of\n\n185\n00:10:33.384 --> 00:10:37.237\nthat, you could get access to someone's\nmachine on that network, right?\n\n186\n00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:42.480\nAnd they could poison either the host\nfile itself or that resolver cache.\n\n187\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.430\nAnd that idea is fairly simple.\n\n188\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.479\nThey take the IP address of something\nthat they want you to get to.\n\n189\n00:10:48.479 --> 00:10:51.713\nAnd then they take a well known or\nfairly common DNS name and\n\n190\n00:10:51.713 --> 00:10:53.470\nthey attach that there.\n\n191\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.940\nThey flush out the cache on your system.\n\n192\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.780\nAnd what happens when you go to try and\nresolve it?\n\n193\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.490\nIt looks in that host file first.\n\n194\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.470\nSo then they can redirect you off of that.\n\n195\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.920\nAnd so that is another possibility.\n\n196\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.700\nSo you always have to inspect that.\n\n197\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.424\nThe great thing is most systems\ntoday really don't tend to use those\n\n198\n00:11:09.424 --> 00:11:12.440\nfile process any more but\nyou can still make it happen.\n\n199\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.036\nAnd if you don't believe me, go and look\non your host file system and you take just\n\n200\n00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:21.570\na regular Windows computer, modify\nthe host itself, put in an IP address.\n\n201\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.902\nAnd I used to do this all of the time\nas an example, is I would actually get\n\n202\n00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:30.685\nthe public IP address of something that\nwould be silly like mileycyrus.com.\n\n203\n00:11:30.685 --> 00:11:37.339\nAnd then I would actually put\nin a URL like www.espn.com.\n\n204\n00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:40.476\nAnd I would do that to\nsomebody's computer and\n\n205\n00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:44.827\nclear out their cache cuz I knew\nthe guy always wanted to go ESPN.\n\n206\n00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:49.290\nAnd what it would bring him to is\nmileycyrus.com each and every time, so\n\n207\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.180\nthat's something that you can do.\n\n208\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.960\nNow that's a funny thing, but remember,\nthat an attacker may take that\n\n209\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.250\na little bit more seriously, and\ntake you to some malicious site instead.\n\n210\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Exactly Ronnie, and aside from\nmaliciousness and nefarious purposes, or\n\n211\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.053\nplaying a prank on someone.\n\n212\n00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:11.837\nThere's really not a huge use for\nthat host file in today's modern society.\n\n213\n00:12:11.837 --> 00:12:15.260\nWe have a lot better ways to\nblock certain types of traffic.\n\n214\n00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.032\nI think I've only legitimately\nhad to use that one time.\n\n215\n00:12:18.032 --> 00:12:22.577\nAnd that was a very unusual situation\nwhere a small business owner had\n\n216\n00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:25.880\nincorrectly registered\ntheir DNS information.\n\n217\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.280\nSo it was just like a work around for\n\n218\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.360\ntheir machines until they\ncould get that fixed.\n\n219\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.489\nBut sometimes just know\nthat it's available, but\n\n220\n00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:33.480\nyou really don't want to\nmess with it too much.\n\n221\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nyou do have to protect everything.\n\n222\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.810\nBut in taking a look at\nstrange queries like that\n\n223\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.570\nis an indication that\nsomething else has happened.\n\n224\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.060\nIf you know that everybody else\nis resolving correctly, but\n\n225\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.960\nyou go to that one machine that's not.\n\n226\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.510\nWell then, that pinpoints you that you\nshould be working on that one machine.\n\n227\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.500\nSo it should limit you then, to the DNS\nresolver cache on that machine or\n\n228\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.730\nthat host file.\n\n229\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.646\nBut in all seriousness, right, that is\nsomething that you have to be aware of.\n\n230\n00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.572\nBecause if they can take over one machine,\n\n231\n00:13:02.572 --> 00:13:06.157\nyou've gotta realize that that means\nthey have access inside of your network,\n\n232\n00:13:06.157 --> 00:13:09.380\nwhich may lead to other\nproblems in other systems too.\n\n233\n00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.320\nAnother thing you also\nwant to be careful of,\n\n234\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.770\nespecially if you're monitoring\nnetwork traffic here with DNS\n\n235\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.800\nis that it really does,\nwhen you need to resolve names, right?\n\n236\n00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.460\nThat it is normally going to resolve\nnames to domains that you know,\n\n237\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.690\nwhich is usually yours, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.939\nIf you now start to see traffic\nthat is trying to resolve names but\n\n239\n00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:34.147\nit now goes out to a strange DNS name\nthat you're not sure why it's doing that.\n\n240\n00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:37.299\nThat's normally another indication\nthat is something else is\n\n241\n00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:40.780\nhappening with the DNS protocol\nthat shouldn't be there.\n\n242\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.250\nSo sometimes you do get queries\nwhere they're actually sent out to\n\n243\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.110\nanother domain that's already\na maliciously registered domain and\n\n244\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.360\nit now resolves instead.\n\n245\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.810\nWhat it's saying is, I am answering this.\n\n246\n00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.150\nYou put in whatever you want to.\n\n247\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.708\nYou put in I'm going to cisco.com and\n\n248\n00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:59.210\nI'm gonna give you the IP address\nthat I really want you to go to.\n\n249\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.358\nSo if it is doing some of that,\nyou've got to be able to understand,\n\n250\n00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:04.643\nas you start looking\nthrough those DNS records.\n\n251\n00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:08.688\nMake sure you know who's actually\nresponding then to your DNS queries,\n\n252\n00:14:08.688 --> 00:14:12.610\ncuz it's going to be very important\nthat you understand that.\n\n253\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.280\nSo you want to make sure\nthat you're looking out for\n\n254\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.275\nwhat we've talked about so far.\n\n255\n00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:21.629\nMalformed queries, when you actually do\nhave a query, and the DNS server thing.\n\n256\n00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.137\nYeah, it's a query.\n\n257\n00:14:23.137 --> 00:14:24.550\nI don't know how to answer it.\n\n258\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.445\nThat's pretty bad, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:30.120\nBut then, when you are taking a look at\nDNS records as they're flowing through,\n\n260\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.550\nand you're taking a look at Wireshark.\n\n261\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.864\nAnd you go, why is this going\nto InternetBadGuys.com to\n\n262\n00:14:35.864 --> 00:14:37.990\nresolve this DNS query?\n\n263\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.510\nWell, that should be another indication\nthat something else is compromised\n\n264\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.740\nin that system, as well, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.730\nSo there are different things that can\nhappen when you start to do that, so\n\n266\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.760\nyou wanna monitor at least that.\n\n267\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.310\nYou also wanna pay attention to something\nthat we technically call an amplification\n\n268\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.963\nattack, too.\n\n269\n00:14:53.963 --> 00:14:59.001\nAn amplification attack is\nwhen we get an abnormally\n\n270\n00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:04.540\nlarge response from a query\nthat we end up sending.\n\n271\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.090\nSo it can be something like this,\nwhich is really kind of unusual, right?\n\n272\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.621\nSo your DNS query,\nlet's say, is 200 bytes,\n\n273\n00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:14.450\nI don't even know how big\na DNS query really is.\n\n274\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.070\nSo it's only so much but there is a point\nin which it could actually respond back\n\n275\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.810\nto you and send so much information\nback that you're getting an abnormally,\n\n276\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.860\nI'm not gonna be able to say,\nabnormally large response that comes back.\n\n277\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.970\nAnd that's essentially the system saying,\nyeah, I know you're sending that, but\n\n278\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.230\nI'm just gonna send you everything\nelse that I want to send you as well.\n\n279\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.160\nAnd that could indicate that\nsomewhere along the line,\n\n280\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.160\nsomething has now hijacked your\nparticular DNS server, too.\n\n281\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.399\nBecause they're now changing it,\nthey're modifying, they're tweaking it.\n\n282\n00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:51.145\nThey're doing something to it that's now\njust sending you more than what should\n\n283\n00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:52.341\nalso be done, too.\n\n284\n00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.622\nYou can also, of course,\n\n285\n00:15:53.622 --> 00:15:57.186\nget a high volume of traffic that\ncomes back with really fast switching.\n\n286\n00:15:57.186 --> 00:16:01.289\nSo you might find out that the DNS\nresponses that you're getting,\n\n287\n00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:03.270\nthe TTL that's on those.\n\n288\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.670\nNow instead of being whatever the time is,\nfive minutes, it's down to 30 seconds.\n\n289\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.300\nAnd you're not only getting it from\none IP address or two IP addresses,\n\n290\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.840\nyou're getting it from a whole subnet of\nIP addresses which also may indicate that,\n\n291\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.810\nhey, something is taken over and\nyou're now hitting a botnet or a spam bot\n\n292\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:26.310\nof some sort that's really registering you\nand changing everything up and around.\n\n293\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.210\nThese are all different things\nthat can end up happening.\n\n294\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.140\nMake sure that I'm covering\neverything that we need to.\n\n295\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.760\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\n\n296\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.940\n&gt;&gt; To think about that, and it is.\n\n297\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.590\nIt's not something that we\nthink about normally, and\n\n298\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:43.100\neven in regular security training, we talk\nabout the idea of securing the DNS server.\n\n299\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.670\nWe talk about this idea of understanding,\nwhat needs to be secured, but\n\n300\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.395\nwe don't normally get into that fact\nof what are we really looking for.\n\n301\n00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:54.240\nBut those are the kind of things\nwe're looking for so, for\n\n302\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.800\nexample, right inside of\na Microsoft Active Directory,\n\n303\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.737\nwe normally state who is gonna be\nthe start of authority, right?\n\n304\n00:17:01.737 --> 00:17:03.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Who's gonna be our authoritative\n\n305\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.780\nDNS server.\n\n306\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.550\nWell, what if your machine the sides\nis gonna resolve DNS, but doesn't check\n\n307\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:15.010\nyour authoritative DNS server,\nwell what is the potential idea there,\n\n308\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:20.290\nif it says look, I'm not even going\nto check it, the start of authority.\n\n309\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.700\nIt just kind of lets you know,\n\n310\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.850\nhey something is saying you don't\nhave to go and check with your\n\n311\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.740\nown authoritative DNS server that should\nbe able to resolve things for you.\n\n312\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.460\nYou go and find it on your own.\n\n313\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.280\nSometimes that happens normally,\nbut overall though,\n\n314\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.000\nyou wanna make sure that it follows the\nprocess through that you have set up and\n\n315\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.040\nthat you know is supposed to work, and\nnot just any process that's out there.\n\n316\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.612\nSo it's very key for us to be monitoring\nour DNS protocol for something, for\n\n317\n00:17:46.612 --> 00:17:49.552\nthose types of things\nthat we've talked about.\n\n318\n00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:54.679\nDNS hijacking again the idea of the DNS\npoisoning that may happen now form\n\n319\n00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:59.976\ntypes of queries here and unusual number\nof responses as well as changing of\n\n320\n00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:05.660\nTTL times, those are all indicative\nthat something has compromised.\n\n321\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.280\nUsing that one protocol and\nit is exploitable protocol,\n\n322\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.140\ncuz DNS is designed to be incredibly user\nfriendly and very open out to the public.\n\n323\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.730\nSo you do need to pay attention here and\nunderstand what you're looking for\n\n324\n00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.840\non this protocol.\n\n325\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.260\n&gt;&gt; I know, and it's kind of interesting,\nif you think about it,\n\n326\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.450\nwe're responsible for our local area\nnetworks and our own entities, but you\n\n327\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:34.720\nlook at companies like DimeDNS and even\nCisco, they've acquired open DNS, right?\n\n328\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.710\nSo you also have to trust that they're\nsecuring their systems as well.\n\n329\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.500\nSo, it's just something that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n330\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.230\nReally all of our services that we speak\nabout in this show, need to be monitored.\n\n331\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.160\nBut it's kind of like, what, we can't\nget rid of them because they're so\n\n332\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.070\nessential to our\nfunctionality of the network.\n\n333\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.145\nBut we just need to be aware of these\nvulnerabilities within the way that\n\n334\n00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:55.180\nthey're configured.\n\n335\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.490\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n336\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.560\nWithout doing that, right.\n\n337\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.970\nWithout understanding this process and\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n338\n00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.090\nthe only thing you can do is say,\nokay, I'm gonna do an NS lookup.\n\n339\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.920\nOr I'm gonna do a dig command and\nverify that everything is working.\n\n340\n00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.030\nWell, it can work.\n\n341\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.230\nBut it doesn't really tell\nyou much beyond that.\n\n342\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.310\nMake sure you understand\nat least that process and\n\n343\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.670\nwhy it's important that you understand\nthe nature and the process of DNS and\n\n344\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.100\nthen understand the normal working\nconditions and then you can identify what\n\n345\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.270\nis abnormal and that is when you\nstart inspecting the protocol itself.\n\n346\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.500\nSo Wire Shark can be a good\ntool at this point, too.\n\n347\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.040\nOkay?\n\n348\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.727\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, what about NTP?\n\n349\n00:19:32.727 --> 00:19:34.770\n&gt;&gt; NTP, Network Time Protocol.\n\n350\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.850\nLet's remember that everything\nthat we do in a networking day,\n\n351\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.890\nthere has to be some\nsynchronization of time, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.290\nWithout that synchronization of time,\nthings go wrong very quickly.\n\n353\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:50.640\nIn an Active Directory network,\nif my regular workstations are more than\n\n354\n00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.390\nfive minutes off from the Active Directory\ndomain controller, bad things can happen.\n\n355\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have a five minute\n\n356\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.450\noffset maximum if you're utilizing\nActive Directory because of Kerberos.\n\n357\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.230\nAnd that authentication\nmechanism says look,\n\n358\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.120\nwe need everyone to be synced\non the same page or well.\n\n359\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.220\nTechnically on the same time here so\nyou have to have it setup correctly.\n\n360\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to make sure that\neverybody is synced up on your network for\n\n361\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.250\nsomething, for some reason or another.\n\n362\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:24.000\nAnd if somebody can take over that\nidea of who's gonna provide the time,\n\n363\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.640\nwell they can cause\na serious syncing issue.\n\n364\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.060\nWhere they just change everything and now\nActive Directory completely doesn't work.\n\n365\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.983\nNobody can authenticate it.\n\n366\n00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:35.263\n&gt;&gt; The users can't log in.\nExactly, chaos.\n\n367\n00:20:35.263 --> 00:20:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so chaos can rule.\n\n368\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.620\nSo, the things that we have to worry\nabout is do you have to monitor NTP.\n\n369\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.430\nIt is in a self not a secure protocol.\n\n370\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.380\nSo, right now you can\ntake your machine and\n\n371\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.040\nyou can connect to any NTP\nserver that's out there.\n\n372\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.840\nBut remember that means you have to be\nable to validate that you're actually\n\n373\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.890\nconnecting to a real NTP server that's\nout there on the internet to do so.\n\n374\n00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.850\nAnd this is where it becomes tricky.\n\n375\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.100\nWho's actually an NTP server?\n\n376\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.930\nWell you have to do some research and\nthen not only on top of that though,\n\n377\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.980\nhow do you know you're actually\ngetting directed to the right one?\n\n378\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.410\nWhatever it might be, there are issues\nthat you have to deal with.\n\n379\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:14.030\nOne thing that NTP is really good at,\nis actually being able to do is some type\n\n380\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:19.530\nof denial of service attack based off\nof a reflection type of attack as well.\n\n381\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.540\nThe very fact is that it can reflect\nyou to wherever they want you to go.\n\n382\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.860\nAnd this is a big problem\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n383\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.430\nNTP ends up essentially\ndoing the same thing.\n\n384\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.710\nIt gives you an amplification\ntype of attack that you have\n\n385\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.800\nto worry about as well.\n\n386\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.450\nNTP messages itself, right?\n\n387\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.010\nWhen it goes and\nqueries a server isn't really big.\n\n388\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.070\nBut there are commands that can be\nissued that can return to you up to\n\n389\n00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.380\nabout 600 responses.\n\n390\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.090\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n391\n00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.180\nNow sometimes, though, because of\nthe way that NTP has worked today and\n\n392\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.360\nthat big attack that we talked\nabout in October along with DNS.\n\n393\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.660\nNTP was a big part of it because of\na command that was like this, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.220\nThere is ntpdc here -c and\n\n395\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.900\ninside of the NTP protocol itself,\nthere is a command called monlist.\n\n396\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.000\nmonlist here is command built inside of\nthe NTP protocol that says, give me a list\n\n397\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.750\nof up to 600 potential NTP servers that\nare out there available on the Internet.\n\n398\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.338\nSo, it's a list that's kept\non all the NTP servers and\n\n399\n00:22:28.338 --> 00:22:30.919\nI happen to pull one up that's near me.\n\n400\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.824\nAnd when I tried this the other day,\nit already blocks it, and\n\n401\n00:22:35.824 --> 00:22:39.283\nwe'll talk about this blocking\nmechanism here in a moment.\n\n402\n00:22:39.283 --> 00:22:42.160\n203.200, let's see if it's\nblocking it right now.\n\n403\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.240\nSo when you actually take\na look at doing this,\n\n404\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.280\nit's probably gonna time out\nfrom what I'm seeing here.\n\n405\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:46.790\nYep.\n\n406\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.710\nSo it says hey it timed out here,\nnothing was received, a request timed out.\n\n407\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.310\nAnd that is because of\nthe attack that happened\n\n408\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.510\nthat they put safeguards\nin place to prevent that.\n\n409\n00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Some of that did ruin it for\neveryone, didn't they?\n\n410\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.460\n&gt;&gt; They really did.\n\n411\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.370\nAnd the way that they do this prevention,\nand\n\n412\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.700\nthe reason why it's not\nreturning this anymore,\n\n413\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.350\nis because a single command like this\nshouldn't return to you 600 responses.\n\n414\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.360\nIt should just return the response\nthat you really need.\n\n415\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.610\nBut it is designed to do that.\n\n416\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.280\nSo there is something out there.\n\n417\n00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.421\nAnd I want to type this in,\nso that you actually know.\n\n418\n00:23:17.421 --> 00:23:24.084\nIt's called bcp 38.\n\n419\n00:23:24.084 --> 00:23:27.840\nAnd inside of that, you also want\nto make sure you know this number.\n\n420\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.812\n2827, RFC2827.\n\n421\n00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:38.140\nThat's not part of the command, don't type\nthat in, it's not gonna run anything.\n\n422\n00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.330\nBut I wanted you to see this.\n\n423\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.810\nThis is what really prevents\nthe NTP server from\n\n424\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.890\nreally getting that list and getting\nthat amplification attacks started and\n\n425\n00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.630\ndoing everything else that it needs to.\n\n426\n00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:55.030\nSo the way it does it is that the border\non your router, as you connect\n\n427\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.020\ndot to the internet, it stops this type of\nrequest from getting out to the internet.\n\n428\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.030\nSo even at the edge of your router,\nwhich mean that mine's turned on here,\n\n429\n00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:09.210\nthat says, hey you're not gonna\nsend this type of NTP query\n\n430\n00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:14.790\nout there to get all this information back\nand possibly cause some unusual traffic.\n\n431\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.130\nBut you have to be able to understand\nwhat happens when you get all that\n\n432\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.390\ntraffic coming back.\n\n433\n00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.460\nLetting you know that somebody\nhas possibly compromised\n\n434\n00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.900\nyour particular connection as well, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.710\nSo the way that you get around this,\nis authentication.\n\n436\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.420\nYou wanna make sure that you are creating\nan authenticated connection between\n\n437\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.230\nyour devices that definitely\nneed a good time source, and\n\n438\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.280\nof course wherever you\nare connecting to on the Internet.\n\n439\n00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.180\nNow, how do you do that?\n\n440\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:47.110\nWell, that depends on your resources and\nwhat you have available to you.\n\n441\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.300\nSometimes you can request it.\n\n442\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.700\nSo, you can go to, like here in the\nStates, you can go to the US Government\n\n443\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.240\nand say hey, I'd like to request\nan authenticated connection.\n\n444\n00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.560\nAnd, they make actually\nstill require it in writing.\n\n445\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.390\nIt used to be you couldn't send them\nan email, you had to send them a written\n\n446\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.700\nletter and then they would\nrespond to you or they wouldn't.\n\n447\n00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.060\nI think mine is still out there.\n\n448\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.810\nI think I sent one about ten years ago.\n\n449\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.230\nAs far I know, I have not gotten it\nback or it got tossed in junk mail and\n\n450\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.680\nI did not know what it was for.\n\n451\n00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.200\nBut you do have to realize\nthat a big part of it is that,\n\n452\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.780\nthis service really can be taken advantage\nof across the entire Internet here.\n\n453\n00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.010\nAnd here is something that stops it.\n\n454\n00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.350\nI know this is kind of\ncheesy at the same time, but\n\n455\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.750\nif you want to talk about preventing\na particular flaw in NTP, bcp 38 or\n\n456\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:39.207\nRFC 2827 is a good one to remember\nin getting this stuff down, okay?\n\n457\n00:25:39.207 --> 00:25:43.030\nInto signing your networks, remember that\neverything does need synchronization.\n\n458\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.720\nAnd that's why it's very important\nthat we understand this protocol.\n\n459\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.270\nAnd the weakness behind it is,\n\n460\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.445\nits requests can really change everything\nif you're not ready for everything that\n\n461\n00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:55.810\nit's gonna bring to you which is normally\nthat amplification attack is what happens.\n\n462\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.529\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you so much, Ronnie.\n\n463\n00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:00.350\nWe were able to cover\ntwo of our lists here.\n\n464\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.430\nThat's okay because we're gonna go ahead\nand continue on with additional episodes.\n\n465\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.390\nSo stay tuned and we'll look at some\nadditional monitoring protocols or\n\n466\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.270\nmonitoring the protocols.\n\n467\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.048\nSo thank you so much.\n\n468\n00:26:11.048 --> 00:26:14.430\nI appreciate you guys tuning in but for\nthis show, we'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n469\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.430\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n470\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:06.443\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:08.194\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.872\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.620\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.620\nThis is actually a continuation\nof a previous episode,\n\n9\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.610\nwhere we were examining different types of\n\n10\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.950\nprotocols that we really should\nmonitor throughout our network.\n\n11\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.860\nWe were able to look at DNS.\n\n12\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.985\nAnd we also saw NTP,\nNetwork Time Protocol.\n\n13\n00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:35.455\nBut we're gonna pick back up today and\nlook at some additional protocols.\n\n14\n00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:39.035\nAnd to help us with that we have,\nwell, Mr. Ronnie Wong himself.\n\n15\n00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:40.465\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.125\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\non the show as we continue on with our\n\n17\n00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.435\nCisco cybersecurity fundamentals.\n\n18\n00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:49.025\nWe are now taking a look, of course,\nat a couple of other protocols.\n\n19\n00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:51.954\nAnd we really need to make\nsure that we are examining and\n\n20\n00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:54.508\nmaking sure that we're monitoring.\n\n21\n00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:57.500\nSo even though there are many\ndifferent protocols out there,\n\n22\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.830\nwe're kinda hitting the kind of meat and\npotatoes of protocols that we need\n\n23\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.310\nto ensure that we are taking\na serious look at monitoring.\n\n24\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.830\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nwe need to start talking about, of course,\n\n25\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.080\nemail protocols is what\nwe need to talk about.\n\n26\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.460\nAnd we're gonna kind of\njust lump them in together.\n\n27\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.930\nI'm gonna call them email protocols.\n\n28\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.780\nBut of course, there is SMTP, which is one\nof the oldest protocols that's out there.\n\n29\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.580\nAnd POP3 or POP,\npost office protocol, and, of course,\n\n30\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.790\nIMAP, the Internet messaging\naccess protocol as well.\n\n31\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.960\nI'm trying to remember all\nthe acronyms for them.\n\n32\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.188\nBut, yeah, those particular protocols,\nright, for us,\n\n33\n00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:36.152\nthey really represent email-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n34\n00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:37.580\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to it.\n\n35\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.310\nSo Cherokee, true or false, a system or\n\n36\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.690\na network could be compromised by email,\nwhat do you think?\n\n37\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Definitely true.\n\n38\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely true,\n\n39\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.960\nand this is why we want to take\na look at those protocols, right?\n\n40\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440\nIn the background of all\nof our email programs,\n\n41\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.660\nit's really these three\nprotocols that tend to be run.\n\n42\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.340\nAnd that's operating in the system and\neverything else that we have.\n\n43\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.520\nAnd so when it come down to it,\nit's kind of there.\n\n44\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.520\nIt's at the bedrock and\n\n45\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.720\nfoundation of where our networks\nreally do have its foundation.\n\n46\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.310\nThe very fact is there's really\nonly two things inside of\n\n47\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.090\nour network here at ITProTV and just about\nevery other network that I've worked on.\n\n48\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.050\nBut if you want to hear people scream and\nyell there's only two things, one-\n\n49\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.730\n&gt;&gt; Mail server,\n\n50\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.360\nI'm gonna guess here, that seems right.\n\n51\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.550\nMail server and printer.\n\n52\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.728\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:30.410\nIf you wanna hear people scream\nimmediately, it's gonna be printing,\n\n54\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.930\nif they can't print something.\n\n55\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.437\nAnd then when they print it out\nit always amazes me, right,\n\n56\n00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:37.110\ncuz usually it's just an email and\nit's two lines long.\n\n57\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.480\nAnd it's like, I can't print.\n\n58\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.330\nAnd then when you finally\nget the printer working, and\n\n59\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.050\nyou're like,\nthat's what you wanted to print?\n\n60\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.190\nAre you joking me?\n\n61\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.650\nBut it's usually that,\nand then of course, email.\n\n62\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.240\nI definitely missed an email, right?\n\n63\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.697\nDidn't get an email, or\nthat email is supposed to-\n\n64\n00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:52.728\n&gt;&gt; It could have been $10 million,\n\n65\n00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:54.902\nthe sale that I missed because of you.\n\n66\n00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:59.765\n&gt;&gt; And so this particular protocol itself,\nthe email, is something we definitely want\n\n67\n00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:03.670\nto make sure that, of course,\neverybody gets their emails.\n\n68\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.940\nBut we monitor, especially for\n\n69\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.660\nattacks, because it is one of those\nsystems that we may go, really, emails?\n\n70\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.330\nIs that something we\nreally need to monitor?\n\n71\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.500\nWell, yeah, you definitely do.\n\n72\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.230\nSo much so, remember that Cisco\nwent ahead and bought a complete,\n\n73\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.370\nentire company way back a while ago,\nokay, called IronPort.\n\n74\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.690\nAnd it was really based off of their\nability to do email security for\n\n75\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.401\nabout $900 million.\n\n76\n00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:29.628\nI mean, 900 million.\n\n77\n00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:30.754\n&gt;&gt; I can't even fathom.\n\n78\n00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:33.662\n&gt;&gt; I know, and that was really for\ntheir email product, and\n\n79\n00:03:33.662 --> 00:03:36.160\nthat's pretty much what it was about.\n\n80\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.140\nBut you know, that's how important it\nis that we're able to understand how\n\n81\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.870\ncomprehensive the protection for\ne-mail really needs to be, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.020\nWell, for us, though, in terms of\nunderstanding about cybersecurity,\n\n83\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.110\nwe've gotten to understand because\nit's such a central part and\n\n84\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.440\nthe lifeblood of communication within\nmost networks, it means we need to take\n\n85\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.970\nthis a little bit more seriously than\nthe mocking that I just did with it.\n\n86\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.490\nPlease don't do that.\n\n87\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.668\nEspecially when the guy prints it\nout immediately and you're like,\n\n88\n00:04:05.668 --> 00:04:07.656\nyou didn't really need to print that out.\n\n89\n00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:09.263\n&gt;&gt; Especially if that\nguy signs your checks.\n\n90\n00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's really a bad one when that happens.\n\n91\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.740\nBut just kinda remember that\nthis is stuff that really is,\n\n92\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.960\nthe good thing is it's intuitive so\nwe're not going to hammer it to death.\n\n93\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.142\nWell, I say that,\nI probably will hammer it to death.\n\n94\n00:04:22.142 --> 00:04:26.050\nBut just kind of remember that we need\nto understand it is an important part.\n\n95\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.760\nSo just when you go, it's email,\ndon't have to worry about it.\n\n96\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.020\nWe should actually worry about\nit a little bit more, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.120\nSo let's that a look at the idea of\nsome of the different things that we\n\n98\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.460\nhave to worry about as far\nas email protocols go.\n\n99\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.640\nSo Cherokee,\n\n100\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.270\nlet's talk about this idea of where\npeople normally get email attacks from.\n\n101\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.040\nWhere does it normally happen?\n\n102\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.701\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\nI don't know if you mean geographically or\n\n103\n00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.075\nthe execution method.\n\n104\n00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:56.116\nBut I would say geographically a lot of\nthose scam type of emails do generate from\n\n105\n00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:58.970\nNigeria, which would be\na form of social engineering.\n\n106\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.690\nLike hey, you've inherited $1 billion.\n\n107\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.570\nJust send me all of your\naccount information.\n\n108\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.240\nOr alternatively, it might come from\nactually just the attachments that have\n\n109\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.415\nbeen sent with that e-mail,\nis another technique.\n\n110\n00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nwhen you start thinking about it,\n\n111\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.935\nthe very fact that we actually\nhave to monitor these protocols.\n\n112\n00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:24.290\nWe've got to actually figure out where\nthe email messages may stem from,\n\n113\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.200\nsuch as what you were talking about here.\n\n114\n00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.366\nEspecially that Nigerian email\nscam that's been going on now for,\n\n115\n00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:29.967\nI'm going to assume 20 years,\nas far as I know.\n\n116\n00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:30.751\n&gt;&gt; Forever.\n\n117\n00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.929\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n118\n00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:35.649\nyou also have to think about what it\nis that they're attaching to that,\n\n119\n00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:40.310\nthat's getting into your system and\nbypassing security that you might have.\n\n120\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.990\nSo when an email, of course, is sent from\nsomebody that's unknown and gets into your\n\n121\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.440\nsystem, the problem is not that it's\nsent and it gets into your system.\n\n122\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.870\nI know that sounds strange, right?\n\n123\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.380\nIt shouldn't be there.\n\n124\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.640\nSo something should block it.\n\n125\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.550\nBut even if it got through,\nit's probably relatively\n\n126\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.790\nokay as long as nobody clicks on that and\nruns that attachment.\n\n127\n00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.550\nYou're probably still fine without\nhaving to worry about it too much.\n\n128\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.300\nSo it really is something that we have to,\nagain, think about here.\n\n129\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.620\nSocial engineering is one of those things\nthat even though it's not heavily involved\n\n130\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.020\nin the protocol itself,\nit is about protecting the protocol, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.440\nIt is about taking a look and going hey,\nthat thing got onto my network.\n\n132\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.980\nSo what do I need to monitor and\n\n133\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.100\nwhat do I need to actually take\na look at to help us do this?\n\n134\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.880\nNow monitoring the protocols themselves\nas far as POP or SMTP or IMAP,\n\n135\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.880\nright, that's not gonna\nshow us social engineering.\n\n136\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.590\nThe only thing that shows us social\nengineering is experience, okay,\n\n137\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.740\nwhen it comes down to\nthe hard facts of things.\n\n138\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.060\nIt really is, right?\n\n139\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.608\nYou have to tell the user, don't click on\nthe email that you're not expecting or\n\n140\n00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:50.351\nan attachment, excuse me,\nin an email that you're not expecting.\n\n141\n00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.655\n[LAUGH] And even if it is an email\nfrom someone you're expecting or\n\n142\n00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:57.633\nyou're expecting an email from, and\nyou're not expecting an attachment,\n\n143\n00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:02.350\ngive them a call and go hey, did you just\nsend me an email with an attachment in it?\n\n144\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.660\nI wasn't expecting one.\n\n145\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.480\nAnd they can either tell you yeah,\n\n146\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.670\nI wanted you to see this,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n147\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.565\nOr no, I wasn't actually\ndoing anything like that.\n\n148\n00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:14.355\n&gt;&gt; SharePoint,\nbecause I've even read articles where,\n\n149\n00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:20.255\neven governmental entities, someone's been\nable to get a list of some employees and\n\n150\n00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:22.780\nthen they use legitimate, and\nbanking industry as well.\n\n151\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.810\n&gt;&gt; They use legitimate names,\nsend that email.\n\n152\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.830\nSo what looks to be innocent really isn't.\n\n153\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.530\nAnd like you said, Ronnie,\njust having a keen eye.\n\n154\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.220\nBeing able to detect those things.\n\n155\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.050\nAnd then taking and\n\n156\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.040\ntransferring your knowledge to your\nend users so that they can also\n\n157\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.820\nbe aware to contact you whenever they\nspot anything that looks awry, unusual.\n\n158\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no doubt that this is\nsomething we really have to look out for.\n\n159\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.202\nThat really helps us to do that.\n\n160\n00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:53.199\nSo it goes beyond just monitoring the\nprotocol then, to also being sure that we\n\n161\n00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.593\nunderstand that they are using\nprotocols to get the information,\n\n162\n00:07:56.593 --> 00:07:58.727\nwhich brings us to the next point as well.\n\n163\n00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:02.954\nWhich is it becomes a delivery system,\nright, for malware to advance\n\n164\n00:08:02.954 --> 00:08:06.098\nitself to where it needs to go\n&gt;&gt; So, email itself.\n\n165\n00:08:06.098 --> 00:08:10.822\nOnce it gets into your system,\nit's not a worm usually.\n\n166\n00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:15.688\nIt's because there is some off wrong and\nwe've done an episode where we showed you\n\n167\n00:08:15.688 --> 00:08:20.342\nby affecting an entire system here where\nyou could use something like the Cisco\n\n168\n00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:24.680\nproducts that are out there that\nreally do block it in live time.\n\n169\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.463\nEven block zero at day is attacked\nas well, but it was an offer for\n\n170\n00:08:29.463 --> 00:08:34.953\nan ad that was in an HTML email or where\nit was a link from Facebook where they\n\n171\n00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:40.207\nwere trying to get you to change\nyour password, whatever it might be.\n\n172\n00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:44.970\nAll these, essentially tell you that the\nprotocol itself is going to be an entryway\n\n173\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.302\ninto your system to try and\ndeliver some form of malware and\n\n174\n00:08:48.302 --> 00:08:52.997\nthat's something else that we definitely\nneed to make sure that we understand and\n\n175\n00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.430\nthat we can monitor as well.\n\n176\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.005\nSo having systems in place helps, but\n\n177\n00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:02.924\nbeing able to monitor this stuff as it\ncomes across is also a good one too.\n\n178\n00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:06.121\n&gt;&gt; And really just getting a good\ngrasp on the situation right away and\n\n179\n00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.546\nnot letting it get out of hand,\nbecause a lot of those types of malware,\n\n180\n00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:12.058\nI don't know if you've\never experienced this, but\n\n181\n00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:15.540\nthey like to propagate and populate\nthrough contact lists, cuz then you\n\n182\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.790\ngot a bigger mess to deal with any you\noriginally wanted to and so forth.\n\n183\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those things\nwhere that's how you'll know it.\n\n184\n00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:26.207\nIf now all the sudden,\n\n185\n00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:31.920\nit's not that one user that has now began\nto realize something else is going.\n\n186\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.115\nNow 6 users are doing it and 12 users and\n\n187\n00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:38.258\neverybody's getting the same spam messages\nand getting sent the same spam and\n\n188\n00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:41.160\nusing the same spam messages,\nso you start seeing it.\n\n189\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.164\n&gt;&gt; About spam, Ronnie, would it be wise\nto go ahead if I had the resources and\n\n190\n00:09:45.164 --> 00:09:48.135\nsetup something like a mail\nrelay on the perimeter of my\n\n191\n00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:52.490\nnetwork to maybe filter out some of that\nspam before it even enters my network?\n\n192\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would love love to.\n\n193\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.245\nYou got to be careful there.\n\n194\n00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:00.452\nOnce you start putting in spam filters,\nyou may have to actually go in there and\n\n195\n00:10:00.452 --> 00:10:04.450\nmanually adjust it as far as\nthe aggressiveness levels of this.\n\n196\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.410\nBecause sometimes people will say,\nwhatever you put in line there,\n\n197\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.315\nCherokee, it's definitely\ncatching some of the emails,\n\n198\n00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:13.610\ncuz I was expecting five emails yesterday.\n\n199\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.553\nAnd since you've installed the spam\nfilter, can you check the spam filter?\n\n200\n00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:20.392\nYou'll be checking that spam\nfilter relatively often and\n\n201\n00:10:20.392 --> 00:10:24.950\nmore often than you think, and\nthere's ways to deal with that fact.\n\n202\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.927\nOf course, you can just turn spam\nfilter off and let it go through.\n\n203\n00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:31.780\nSometimes, we've done that before\nwhere we just didn't know which ones.\n\n204\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.821\nSo, we kind of just opened up the door for\na day or so and then closed it back again.\n\n205\n00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:40.732\nHoping that even though we've got all\nthe spam that the users ended up finding\n\n206\n00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:44.702\nthe email that they wanted, it's not\nthe greatest approach in the world, but\n\n207\n00:10:44.702 --> 00:10:48.370\nit is effective as far as getting\nall the emails, making sure.\n\n208\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.367\nBut at the same time, spam filters are\nkind of that two edged type of sword to do\n\n209\n00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:54.407\nsomething like that if you set that up.\n\n210\n00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:57.950\nSo the relay systems,\nstuff like that is really great.\n\n211\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.990\nBut normally, when you start getting\na lot of spam on your own networks,\n\n212\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:07.630\nit normally indicates some type of\ncompromise of the actual system itself.\n\n213\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.210\nSo spam and phishing, especially if you're\ngetting a lot of it, tons and tons and\n\n214\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.630\nthe same ones over again.\n\n215\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.199\nIt's probably indicating that somewhere\non your email server, something else has\n\n216\n00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:21.384\nhappened where you're probably now\nactually the spambot itself and sending\n\n217\n00:11:21.384 --> 00:11:25.907\nout more malicious or more spam types of\nemails or phishing scams than you realize.\n\n218\n00:11:25.907 --> 00:11:29.492\nSo, it may mean just\nan indication in that.\n\n219\n00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:33.903\nSo monitoring for something like more and\nmore of these messages are coming through,\n\n220\n00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:38.080\nbeing able to realize that's a part of it\nis something we need to worry about too.\n\n221\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.940\nThe other one,\nof course is just how can you tell\n\n222\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.420\nif the email server is\ncompromised is a big one?\n\n223\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.368\nSo one of those again is if your email\nserver is generating a lot more email than\n\n224\n00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:53.314\nwhat you were expecting it to generate is\na big one, but the very fact is you can\n\n225\n00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:56.579\nalways check the logs on these servers and\nthat will also help.\n\n226\n00:11:56.579 --> 00:12:00.464\nSo we're now moving in not only talking\nabout monitoring the protocols, but\n\n227\n00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:02.290\nalso the server itself.\n\n228\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.196\nSo, you need to check that out too.\n\n229\n00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:06.939\nSo don't just sit there and\ngo, okay, email's on.\n\n230\n00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:09.803\nIt's working,\nI'm never gonna have to check it again.\n\n231\n00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:10.837\nYou can leave it.\n\n232\n00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:12.035\nYou can set it and forget it.\n\n233\n00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:15.982\nBut the very fact is today's world, you've\ngotta make sure it's actually sending out\n\n234\n00:12:15.982 --> 00:12:17.687\nthe emails that you want to send out and\n\n235\n00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:20.800\nnot all the emails that everybody\nelse wants you to send out instead.\n\n236\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.510\nAnd lastly, of course,\nyou gotta think about the unintentional\n\n237\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.450\nactions that end up happening with\nemail that you're not worried about.\n\n238\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.256\nSo through a very simple protocol\nlike SMTP or POP or IMAP,\n\n239\n00:12:33.256 --> 00:12:38.554\ncan secrets be revealed inside your\norganization, proprietary information?\n\n240\n00:12:38.554 --> 00:12:40.770\nVery much so.\n\n241\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.570\nThe very fact that you might get\nan internal communication to you,\n\n242\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.920\nthat's not meant to go out to\neverybody else on the planet.\n\n243\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.590\nBut all the sudden or to everybody else in\nthe organization, but just meant to you,\n\n244\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.470\nthat's probably more realistic than\nthe idea of everybody on the planet.\n\n245\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.642\nBut instead, when you reply,\nyou don't reply back to the person,\n\n246\n00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:01.994\nyou actually hit what?\n\n247\n00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:03.156\nReply to all users.\n\n248\n00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:05.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there it is.\n\n249\n00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:07.298\nNow, whatever proprietary information or\n\n250\n00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:11.567\nsensitive information has now just been\ndistributed throughout your entire network\n\n251\n00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:14.160\neven though it wasn't meant to\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n252\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.460\nunintentional acts by\nauthorized users is a big one\n\n253\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.000\nthat this particular protocol is\ndesigned to help you propagate.\n\n254\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.164\nIt's not looking at whether or\nnot it's supposed to.\n\n255\n00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:28.842\nEmail itself, regardless of what\nprotocol you're on is really designed\n\n256\n00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:30.103\nto actually send it or receive it.\n\n257\n00:13:30.103 --> 00:13:33.139\nThat's pretty much what\nit's designed to do.\n\n258\n00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:37.515\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't really benefit anybody\nelse, but taking a look and monitoring\n\n259\n00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:42.093\nthese systems means that you have to go\nabove and beyond sometimes of just looking\n\n260\n00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:46.401\nat the basic protocol itself to seeing\nthe systems that are attached to it and\n\n261\n00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:51.047\nmaking sure that the servers themselves\nare also attached, that those are secure\n\n262\n00:13:51.047 --> 00:13:56.260\nas well as the protocols that you're using\nto try and make it as secure as possible.\n\n263\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.105\nMonitoring has to take place with all of\nthis and that's kind of the key here.\n\n264\n00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:04.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and maybe if you even just\nkeep some kind of internal website or\n\n265\n00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:06.149\nif you have an HR portal,\n\n266\n00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:10.760\nlet your end users be aware if you\nare experiencing any type of attacks.\n\n267\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.212\nKeep them up to date,\nyou might even take screenshots.\n\n268\n00:14:13.212 --> 00:14:17.556\nI remember one particular situation\nwhere it was some kind of\n\n269\n00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:22.029\ndelivery service not DHL,\njust like an off the wall service.\n\n270\n00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:25.124\nBut in businesses, you receive\na lot of packages most of the time.\n\n271\n00:14:25.124 --> 00:14:29.573\nSo, it's not uncommon and\nclick here to print your pick up label or\n\n272\n00:14:29.573 --> 00:14:33.320\nwhatever it is that they're\ntrying to get you to print.\n\n273\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.260\nSo just educate your end users and\nlike Ronnie said, monitor your systems and\n\n274\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.635\nmake sure you're aware there for\nyour email.\n\n275\n00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:42.086\nNow, what are we looking at next?\n\n276\n00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:46.750\nWe covered email, but I think we need to\ntake a look at some of our web services.\n\n277\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.007\n&gt;&gt; Yep, when it comes down to it HTTP,\nbecause that is by far,\n\n278\n00:14:50.007 --> 00:14:52.940\nprobably one of the most\npopular types of protocols,\n\n279\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.203\nprobably the most popular protocol\nthat's used out on the Internet itself.\n\n280\n00:14:57.203 --> 00:15:00.638\nAnd normally today,\nespecially in the realm of cloud services,\n\n281\n00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:05.010\nprobably one of the more popular protocols\nthat we use even internally inside of our\n\n282\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.270\nnetworks too.\n\n283\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.663\nThis is something that we should pay\nattention to as well, because it is.\n\n284\n00:15:09.663 --> 00:15:13.486\nIt's kinda the primary protocol that\neverybody on the planet uses and\n\n285\n00:15:13.486 --> 00:15:18.050\ninside of your network, you depend on\nit more and more than you realize.\n\n286\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.209\nSo with this particular protocol\nwhat you have to be aware of,\n\n287\n00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:25.339\ncuz most of us are using it even though we\ndon't know that we're doing it by simply\n\n288\n00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:29.692\nopening up the web browser, of course, and\nbrowsing to whatever website it may be.\n\n289\n00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:34.494\nWhether it's an intranet site,\nwhether it's an external partner site,\n\n290\n00:15:34.494 --> 00:15:39.680\nwhether it's just browsing out on the\ninternet and connecting with our all using\n\n291\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.240\neither HTTP, HTTPS and some version of\nthat is generally what we're doing.\n\n292\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.443\nSo MEs, if that's the majority of your\ntraffic, you've got to be willing to\n\n293\n00:15:49.443 --> 00:15:52.891\nunderstand the strengths and\nweaknesses behind that as well.\n\n294\n00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:55.960\nThe nice thing is it makes it simple and\neasy.\n\n295\n00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.185\nAll we have to do is type in the address\nbar a name that's supported by DNS.\n\n296\n00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:04.471\nAnd normally, we are off and we\nare connecting to that particular site and\n\n297\n00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:05.587\nwe are ready to go.\n\n298\n00:16:05.587 --> 00:16:07.639\nAs far access in that site.\n\n299\n00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:12.213\nBut when we do something like that we can\nreveal more information about ourselves\n\n300\n00:16:12.213 --> 00:16:13.310\nthan we realize.\n\n301\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.510\nAnd sometimes you do,\nsometimes you don't, but\n\n302\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.255\nlet me show you at least something\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n303\n00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:18.840\nOkay.\n\n304\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.510\nSo here on my screen, I went ahead and\nconnected into IT Pro TV's website and\n\n305\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:30.070\nI also want us to take a look at where\nsome information may end up appearing.\n\n306\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.433\nSo if you take a look, and I'm trying to\nget us right into the address bar here for\n\n307\n00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:35.030\na moment.\n\n308\n00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:41.250\nNow, when we take a look at this,\nwhich is gonna be our URL, sometimes,\n\n309\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.220\nespecially in older web page design,\nyou might have also seen a bunch\n\n310\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.620\nof other numbers and letters and different\ninformation right here at the end,\n\n311\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.650\nthat normally is indicating either session\ninformation or even your username and\n\n312\n00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.691\npossibly even encrypted to a point or\nobfuscated your password.\n\n313\n00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:01.370\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Well this is something\nthat you don't want to see.\n\n315\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.550\nBy actually being able to find\ninformation like that, right?\n\n316\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.520\nIt's personal information about you,\nthat gives access to this site.\n\n317\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.990\nWell, the great thing is, notice that\nwe're following good protocol here, and\n\n318\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.000\nthat even though I am logged in, and\n\n319\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.480\nI know that I've logged in,\ncuz I logged in here,\n\n320\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.170\nit's not showing me any of that inside the\nlinks that I have available to me, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.316\nSo if I click on the Course Library here,\nalready on the course library,\n\n322\n00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:35.310\nif I go here to the forums instead,\nyou'll see that it\n\n323\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.380\ndid the same thing right here\nwhere I have access to this, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.160\nSo this one again shows me nothing, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.220\nSo at the same time we need to\nmake sure that we understand that\n\n326\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.920\nwe can reveal more information\nif we're not ready and\n\n327\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.700\nunderstanding the way that\nthe protocol is now designed to work.\n\n328\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.440\nSo we still think that we're\nfollowing the old HTTP protocol\n\n329\n00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.640\nguides from 1992 and '95,\n'96, somewhere around there.\n\n330\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.120\nWell, we don't wanna do that anymore.\n\n331\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.740\nWe wanna follow the latest guides here so\nthat we don't reveal any of that personal\n\n332\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:13.010\ninformation that can be leaked out through\nthat particular system that's there, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.270\nSo it is something that we have to pay\nattention to because this is what we call\n\n334\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.340\ninformation leakage,\nthat we don't intend for that to happen.\n\n335\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.360\nWe don't intend anybody's gonna really pay\nattention to Windows gigantically long,\n\n336\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.660\nlet me see where I'd normally find stuff\nlike that, actually, that's a good one.\n\n337\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.160\nCisco is great at doing stuff like this.\n\n338\n00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:36.853\nThere we go.\n\n339\n00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:40.130\nNow notice how long this one is, right?\n\n340\n00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.930\nSo the great thing is they're not also\nnot revealing any information here but\n\n341\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.470\nyou might actually end up seeing\non some of the older websites,\n\n342\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.230\nhopefully nobody today on the internet is\nstill using it, where you get information\n\n343\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.130\nthat just looks like a string and\nalso you find a username up here in right\n\n344\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.890\nsmack dab in the middle of everything\nthat you're actually pointing at.\n\n345\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.480\nSo that's what you don't want to see.\n\n346\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.030\nYou don't actually want to\nsee anything like that happen\n\n347\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.930\nwhen you start to see this, okay.\n\n348\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:10.190\nThe other thing, of course, is realize\nHTTP itself doesn't regulate the content.\n\n349\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.600\nIt can't tell you whether it's a bad\nwebsite, whether it's a good website, or\n\n350\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.730\nanything like that.\n\n351\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.610\nOther systems around it do that, right.\n\n352\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.170\nSecurity monitoring or the idea of\nthe secure screen that you might have\n\n353\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.890\nsuch as an internet explorer,\nwhether it might be those things or\n\n354\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.440\nactually surrounding that HTTP protocol\nsaying, this is bad or this is good.\n\n355\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.120\nBut HTTP itself in this weakness,\nit doesn't have that feature available, so\n\n356\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.340\nwe have to rely on\napplications to help us out.\n\n357\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.580\nSome, hopefully not anymore, okay,\n\n358\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:47.900\nas you submit information to purchase\nsomething, or as you submit information\n\n359\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.860\nsuch as even inside of our forums, you may\nend of finding out when you make a post,\n\n360\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.640\nit actually uses what we'll\ncall a get command to do so.\n\n361\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.160\nThat's usually not a good feature, too.\n\n362\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.060\nSo if you do something, that means it's\ngonna end up showing up up here too,\n\n363\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.239\nwhere it's gonna reveal\ninformation that it shouldn't.\n\n364\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.990\nOkay?\nHeader information is a big part\n\n365\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.420\nas you go through and\nyou're examining the traffic.\n\n366\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.440\nYou wanna make sure that there are too\nthat you are not leaking any information\n\n367\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.270\nthat you don't want and of course the big\none that we always have to kind of worry\n\n368\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:24.800\nabout is can somebody by accessing\nthat URL right there, be able\n\n369\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.240\nto get access to beyond what that site\nis on that machine that it resides on.\n\n370\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.590\nSo directory traversal is a big\none that you have to worry about.\n\n371\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.990\nBut if you're following the secure\nprotocol, if you're following the way to\n\n372\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.460\na secure web server, you shouldn't have to\nworry about information like that, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.580\nLastly, on your own machines, make sure\nyou're using the correct DNS servers.\n\n374\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.040\nThat's why it's very important that\nyou understand that process of DNS,\n\n375\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.500\nas well, when you're doing this.\n\n376\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.080\nIf I'm typing this in and\nI don't have a clue who my DNS resolver or\n\n377\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.730\nwho's actually helping resolve this,\nthen I've got an issue because\n\n378\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:04.910\nit could be resolving by some\nmalicious domain that's out there.\n\n379\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.010\nAnd this may not actually be\nIT Pro TVs website for all I know, but\n\n380\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.830\nthe good thing is with that certificate,\nI'm pretty much assured of that.\n\n381\n00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.540\nBut you don't know so you need to pay\nattention to stuff like that as well and\n\n382\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.480\nof course, ultimately denial of service,\nwhich is probably the big one.\n\n383\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.070\nHTTP can't prevent a denial of service.\n\n384\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.320\nIt just can't.\n\n385\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.096\nSo in other words, the protocol\nitself is not designed for what?\n\n386\n00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:28.440\nIt's not designed for security.\n\n387\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.990\nIt's not designed for\na ton of different things.\n\n388\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.460\nIt's designed to help you to connect.\n\n389\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Overall I think it's a pretty,\nI guess, volatile or\n\n390\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.350\nmaybe a sensitive type of protocol\nanyways, because you can see\n\n391\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.932\na variety of the different types\nof attacks that can happen.\n\n392\n00:21:45.932 --> 00:21:50.380\nAnd we'll be looking a little later on\nat things like cross site scripting and\n\n393\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.300\nyou had mentioned there\nwith the DNS Poisoning.\n\n394\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.310\nSo, there really is a lot going on\nwith HTTP that you should be aware of.\n\n395\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:03.460\nSo, just like Ronnie said, pay attention,\nand implement systems that can aid\n\n396\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.670\nthat protocol itself, because inherently,\nit does nothing to protect itself there.\n\n397\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's all about\n\n398\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.950\nthe monitoring at this point, right?\n\n399\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.540\nSo, what are you looking for.\n\n400\n00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.730\nWell, these are some of the things\nthat you're looking for.\n\n401\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.140\nWhether you're talking about HTTP,\nwhether you're talking about the emailing\n\n402\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:23.720\nprotocols, or DNS,\nwhatever protocol it is that you have to\n\n403\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.680\nunderstand that you're protecting or\nthat's a big part of your network.\n\n404\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.220\nYou've got to understand what it\nis that you're really looking for.\n\n405\n00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.530\nIt is neat to say okay, I know that it\nworks, i know this is how it functions.\n\n406\n00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.660\nBut that's why you have to pay attention\nto when it doesn't function correctly.\n\n407\n00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.150\nAnd what's causing it\nis the kind of the key.\n\n408\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.990\nAnd the only way for you to learn that is\nby monitoring those particular types of\n\n409\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.530\nprotocols until you get used to going, all\nright, this is abnormal, this is something\n\n410\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.990\nthat is not good, let me now pay\na little bit more attention to that.\n\n411\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.480\nIt doesn't come if you don't monitor and\n\n412\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.530\nit doesn't happen if you don't know\nwhat you're really looking for.\n\n413\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.470\nSo at least, that is the basis here.\n\n414\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.150\nI'm not gonna tell you it's\ncomprehensive cuz it's not but\n\n415\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.002\nit at least gives you a start of something\nthat you can kind of start to go all\n\n416\n00:23:07.002 --> 00:23:09.970\nright, I need to examine that a little\nbit more because I haven't considered it,\n\n417\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:10.959\ntake a look at these things.\n\n418\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.900\nAll right.\n\n419\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.480\nDo we have any final thoughts or\n\n420\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.180\nany other protocols that we need\nto cover at this point in time?\n\n421\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's gonna be a lot\nmore on the different attacks,\n\n422\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.270\nlike what you mentioned.\n\n423\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.510\nAs far as anything goes-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n424\n00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.930\n&gt;&gt; The protocols themselves, right?\n\n425\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.110\nThis is just a small sampling.\n\n426\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.780\nThey're the ones that are called\nout just specifically by\n\n427\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.070\nthe exam objectives themselves.\n\n428\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.340\nBut it doesn't mean you should\nlimit yourself to that, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.270\nSo the more you get involved\ninto your network and\n\n430\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.730\nyou know what protocols are used out\nthere, make sure you examine that for,\n\n431\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.380\nI need to know how this works, okay?\n\n432\n00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.070\nAnd then, what are the strengths and\nwhat are the weaknesses behind it?\n\n433\n00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And what do we really need to look for?\n\n434\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.710\nAnd when you start approaching\nit from that standpoint, right?\n\n435\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.630\nThe cyber security mindset\ntakes place as saying,\n\n436\n00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.650\nThis is how somebody would\ntake advantage of this system.\n\n437\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you do have\nto think like that.\n\n438\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.380\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for.\n\n439\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:23:59.930\nYou have to.\n\n440\n00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.380\n&gt;&gt; Being able to understand how it\nworks and start thinking how would\n\n441\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.360\nI break into this system so\nyou can then build up your defenses.\n\n442\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.940\nUnderstanding those protocols is\nvery important and like Ronnie said,\n\n443\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.350\nthese are like what we covered because\nthey were called out specifically.\n\n444\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.620\nBut as we proceed to look at\ndifferent types of attacks,\n\n445\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.970\nit's also helpful to understand\nthe associated protocols there.\n\n446\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.860\nSo thank you for taking the time\nto go ahead and go through these.\n\n447\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.880\nAnd thank you so much for\nbeing with us today.\n\n448\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.810\nI appreciate that.\n\n449\n00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.810\nBut don't go anywhere,\n\n450\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:36.030\nwe do have some more Cisco Cybersecurity\nfundamentals information headed your way.\n\n451\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.790\nFor this show remember I'm\nyour show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n452\n00:24:38.790 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.050\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.630\nwe will be describing different\ntypes of security attack concepts.\n\n8\n00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.360\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.830\nWe have a lot of different concepts today.\n\n10\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.110\nRonnie thank you for joining us,\nbut where are we gonna start?\n\n11\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we start talking about\nthe idea of different attack concepts,\n\n12\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.540\na lot of times it's very easy\nto get them muddled a bit.\n\n13\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.110\nSo, what we're going to do is we're just\ngonna contrast and compare a couple of\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.950\nthem, so that we understand what it\nis that we're really talking about.\n\n15\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.750\nEspecially in the context\nof cybersecurity.\n\n16\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.810\nRemember that because you're working\nwith other networking professionals and\n\n17\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.830\nother cybersecurity professionals,\n\n18\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.890\nit means that the terminology is\ngonna be a little bit more important.\n\n19\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.510\nBecause sometimes people\ndo get very picky.\n\n20\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.550\nAnd we were just talking\nabout this before the show,\n\n21\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.070\nwhere somebody may describe\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n22\n00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.880\nAnd here's the way that they've described\ncompared to what you described.\n\n23\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540\nAnd you go, well that's what I thought\nthat I was talking about, that.\n\n24\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.808\nBut apparently you were\ntalking about something else.\n\n25\n00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.260\nWell, we wanna make sure that\nyou get on the record straight,\n\n26\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.480\nespecially when getting ready for\nthe Cybersecurity Fundamentals Exam.\n\n27\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.350\nSo, what we are going to do is we are\ngonna talk about a few of these of this\n\n28\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.470\ndifferent types of attack concepts and\nit's really true that most people will\n\n29\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.720\nkind of get a little bit\nmore confused about.\n\n30\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.320\nAnd those are the concepts we call\nvulnerabilities as well as the idea of\n\n31\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.190\nan attack surface and\nwe wanna make sure we can understand and\n\n32\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.100\nrelate what the differences\nactually is between them.\n\n33\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.370\nSo, we'll start right there where\nwe'll talk about that a little bit.\n\n34\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.670\nThen, later on we're gonna of course\ndefine the idea of privilege escalation\n\n35\n00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.870\nand what that necessarily means for\nthe attacker.\n\n36\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.417\nAnd what that means for us as well.\n\n37\n00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.220\nAnd then, we'll see a little bit more\nabout local versus remote types of\n\n38\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.300\nattacks.\n\n39\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.760\nAnd then, of course,\nwe'll just kind of describe some\n\n40\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.070\ngeneral variety attacks where we'll\njust kind of describe them briefly\n\n41\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.600\nbecause we'll probably go into them\ndeeper later on in another episode.\n\n42\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.620\nSo at this point,\nthat's what we're going to end up doing.\n\n43\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.010\nSo Cherokee, let's begin with this idea of\nwhen we talk about an attack surface and\n\n44\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.720\nwhen we talk about a vulnerability.\n\n45\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.420\nSo, when you think about\nthe idea of an attack surface,\n\n46\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.350\nwhat do you normally think about?\n\n47\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, my mind starts to think\nin the realm of risk analysis and\n\n48\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.550\nmaybe if I were doing some\nsort of planning and risk\n\n49\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.730\nassessment because I'd wanna know what\nkind of vulnerabilities my company had.\n\n50\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.220\nWhat kind of information systems would\nreally be, if they were brought down,\n\n51\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.210\nwhat could my company, what could I\ncontinue to be productive with or without.\n\n52\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.780\nSo where would that point of line be,\n\n53\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.680\nwhere I was suffering from any type of\nmajor component failures, or data loss.\n\n54\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.560\nYou got to kind of think\nof loss in that manner.\n\n55\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920\nSo, I guess that's where\nI would start to think.\n\n56\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the idea of risk\nis pretty much the key here.\n\n57\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.310\nThe very fact that when you start thinking\nabout attack surface, you're really\n\n58\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.350\nthinking about how risky is this or\nwhat is it that I have at risk for me?\n\n59\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.570\nSo, when we start to take a look\nthen in terms fo cybersecurity and\n\n60\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.060\nthe idea of attack surface.\n\n61\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.720\nWhat we're really talking about is not so\n\n62\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.500\nmuch the loss that we end up getting at\ntimes even though we do take that in mind.\n\n63\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.530\nBut what we're saying is what is\nvisible that somebody can attack.\n\n64\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.340\nIn other words,\n\n65\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.870\nwhat's the risk factor here that\nsomebody will actually get there?\n\n66\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.980\nAnd for most of the things\nthat we talk [INAUDIBLE].\n\n67\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.850\nThe larger the attack surface,\nthe more risk that we would have, and\n\n68\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.650\nthen the smaller the attack surface,\nthe less risk we would also have too.\n\n69\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.085\nYou also hear the term footprint,\nthe mark that you leave.\n\n70\n00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:45.610\nThat's somebody might take a look at and\ngo, \"that belongs to Ronnie or\n\n71\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.400\nit belongs to Cherokee\".\n\n72\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.980\nSo they're looking at the overall\nvulnerability that they have in terms of\n\n73\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.660\nhow many different ways can\nthey get into the system.\n\n74\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.930\nSo, you might also think about\nthe term exposure at that point too.\n\n75\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.470\nWhat is exposed that\nsomething is out there,\n\n76\n00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.060\nthat somebody might\nalso be able to attack?\n\n77\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.450\nSo, it's a very important concept for\nus to make sure that we grasp in hand\n\n78\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.800\nbecause when we try to provide for\ndefense, right?\n\n79\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.580\nWe know about the CIA Triad, right?\n\n80\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.170\nThe confidentiality, integrity and data\navailability, and those are always key for\n\n81\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.830\nus to think about when we\nstart implementing security.\n\n82\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.010\nBut the way that we implement security of\ncourse is, at least at the very beginning\n\n83\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.540\nin terms of prevention,\nwe talk about defense in depth as well.\n\n84\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.410\nIs very difficult to understand how\nmuch depth that you have to go into for\n\n85\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.980\nyour defense, if you don't understand\nthe concept of what your attack surface.\n\n86\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.560\nIn other words,\n\n87\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.060\nwhat is it that's actually exposed out\nthere that you have to worry about.\n\n88\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.960\nSo in that sense,\nthat's why we need to actually make sure\n\n89\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.180\nthat we understand the concept of\nthat attack surface at the beginning.\n\n90\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.670\nSo, let's take that then,\nthat idea of exposure and\n\n91\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.520\nlet's compare that to\nthe idea of a vulnerability.\n\n92\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.210\nSo, if you talk about vulnerabilities\nthen what do you think about instead\n\n93\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.590\nnow understanding a little bit\nmore about attack surface.\n\n94\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.010\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet me just make sure I understand.\n\n95\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.180\nSo, in comparison to attacked surface or\njust, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n97\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the first thing\nwhen we think about vulnerabilities,\n\n98\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.440\nI would probably think about any kind of\nsystems that weren't configured properly.\n\n99\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.360\nThat's a big one there.\n\n100\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.350\nMaybe just the default usernames and\npasswords whereas something like attack\n\n101\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.110\nsurface would be me making\na decision as a network or\n\n102\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.150\nsystem admin to choose just\na core operating system or\n\n103\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.810\nan operating system like Linux\nopposed to a full blown version of,\n\n104\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.350\na version of Windows Server 2012 or\n2016, something like that.\n\n105\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.920\nSo, when we look at the attack surface,\nby removing all that extra software,\n\n106\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.770\nI am reducing the possibility of attacks.\n\n107\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.280\nBecause one, well, those type of\noperating systems aren't as common, so\n\n108\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.040\nattackers aren't gonna be as\nfamiliar to break into them.\n\n109\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.510\nLess coding, less errors,\n\n110\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.690\nbugs and then whereas if you\nlook at the vulnerabilities.\n\n111\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.530\nThings like configuration errors, or poor\npolicies that had been put into place.\n\n112\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.120\nPoor end user training.\n\n113\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.890\nMaybe poor network design.\n\n114\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.460\nThose are going to be more of my idea\nof what a vulnerability would be.\n\n115\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.320\n&gt;&gt; And when it comes down to the idea\nof vulnerability, vulnerabilities and\n\n116\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.710\nattacks surfaces do kind of go together.\n\n117\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.940\nThe very fact that we\nhave a vulnerability,\n\n118\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.880\nwe have an attack surface,\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n119\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.340\n&gt;&gt; And the goal, of course then, of the\nattack surface is to understand how big or\n\n120\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.450\nhow much of a gaping attack\nsurface that really is\n\n121\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.540\nin comparison to the weakness itself.\n\n122\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.880\nSo, even though they do go hand in hand as\nfar as what they allow us to do though,\n\n123\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.780\nis that on the attack surface it's about\nthe amount of exposure that we have.\n\n124\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.130\nAll of us in every system that's out\nthere, we have different vulnerabilities,\n\n125\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.510\nokay, they just exist.\n\n126\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.080\nThe reason why is that they're\ndesigned by human beings and\n\n127\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.030\nhuman beings aren't generally perfect.\n\n128\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.500\nSo that means that somebody can come up\nand go, I know of a way to get into that\n\n129\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.790\nsystem or I know of an attack\nthat I think that would work.\n\n130\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.560\nAnd what they're doing is that\nthey're exposing that vulnerability,\n\n131\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.170\nthey're exposing the weakness\nto that system so\n\n132\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.790\nthat then they can take\nadvantage of that system.\n\n133\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.930\nVulnerabilities come in all forms and\nsizes, whereas attack surfaces,\n\n134\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.340\neven though they come in\nall different sizes, well,\n\n135\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.060\nthey generally actually expose more or\nexpose less of what we have available.\n\n136\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.270\nSo, thinking about the idea of the\nvulnerability as an existing weakness to\n\n137\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.120\nwhatever your system is.\n\n138\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.920\nAnd if somebody then can say, look,\nI know that there's a weakness there, and\n\n139\n00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.970\nyou might be able to see that.\n\n140\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.140\nYou might know that\nsomeone is running an old\n\n141\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.160\nWindows 2000 server\ninside of their network.\n\n142\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.840\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat that vulnerability that's there\n\n143\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.560\nis actually an attack surface for\nyou because it may be well protected\n\n144\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.270\nwith the fence in depth.With\nthe idea of defense in-depth, right?\n\n145\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.996\nYou may go, I know that there's\na system if I can only get to it.\n\n146\n00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:58.556\nBut your problem now, of course, is do\nthey have enough systems in place to block\n\n147\n00:07:58.556 --> 00:08:02.595\nwhoever the attacker is from taking\nadvantage of that vulnerability?\n\n148\n00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:06.540\nAnd if they do, well, then that\nvulnerability as much as it is a true\n\n149\n00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.323\nexisting weakness, it s attack surface is\nvery small or minimal to the point where\n\n150\n00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:14.750\nit doesn't really matter to\nyou as a vector for an attack.\n\n151\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.727\nIn other words, the path that you\nwould get in to attack that system.\n\n152\n00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:21.580\nSo in that sense, we wanna make sure\nthat we understand both of them.\n\n153\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.104\nSo, let's kinda give a scope and\na detail idea of what we're talking about.\n\n154\n00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:32.740\nAs far as vulnerabilities go,\nCherokee named a few, a bad configuration.\n\n155\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.505\nSo someone that's not very experienced at\nsetting up, let's say, for an example,\n\n156\n00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:39.470\na Cisco router or a switch.\n\n157\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.538\nThey may go ahead and\njust take it right out of the box.\n\n158\n00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:44.190\nThey implement simple\nIP addresses on them.\n\n159\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.028\nThey turn on the actual ports and they\nplug them in and they're ready to go, but\n\n160\n00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.355\nwhat they don't think\nabout then is of course,\n\n161\n00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:54.160\nhow do they secure that router that\nthey've now put into their environment?\n\n162\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.940\nWell, they don't do that.\n\n163\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.240\nIt's as simple as someone like Cherokee or\nmyself bring in a consul cable in and\n\n164\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.120\nplugging directly in that router,\nor that switch.\n\n165\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.230\nAnd just when you think, no,\nnobody would ever do that.\n\n166\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.433\nBecause in the environment I work in,\nrouters and\n\n167\n00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:12.190\nswitches are always behind a locked door.\n\n168\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.780\nOnly the people that\nhave the key can get in.\n\n169\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.587\nWell, I've worked in environments\nin which that's not been true.\n\n170\n00:09:17.587 --> 00:09:21.537\nThe very fact is I've actually even had to\nsetup an environment in which the router\n\n171\n00:09:21.537 --> 00:09:25.376\nand the switch were essentially in the\ncorner of a hallway that everybody passes\n\n172\n00:09:25.376 --> 00:09:28.065\nby, and the only thing that I\nhad in place was a rack, and\n\n173\n00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:31.412\nthey just had a curtain that actually\ncovered the front of that rack.\n\n174\n00:09:31.412 --> 00:09:36.130\nThat's all they really had and I say, you\nreally leave this out here like listen.\n\n175\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:36.638\nYeah, nobody's gonna touch it.\n\n176\n00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:38.740\nI was like, how do you know?\n\n177\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.427\nI mean, I can simply walk by just unplug\nthe cable not even know what that\n\n178\n00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:43.972\ncable is for and there you go.\n\n179\n00:09:43.972 --> 00:09:46.950\nYour network maybe down just for that.\n\n180\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.547\nBut for them, we don't worry about that.\n\n181\n00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.470\nThat's fine.\n\n182\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.770\nBut remember that if you do that,\nyour attack surface is much bigger,\n\n183\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.780\nexposing your vulnerability of\nthings like a bad configuration or\n\n184\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.970\na misconfiguration in that sense.\n\n185\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.754\nDon't forget that other\nvulnerabilities exist too.\n\n186\n00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:08.980\nUnpatched systems that reside on your\nnetwork are always vulnerabilities too.\n\n187\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.486\nAt the same time,\nthey expand your attack surface.\n\n188\n00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:14.565\nIf now you realized that there\nare unpatched systems on your network,\n\n189\n00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:16.560\nit means there are easier\ntargets out there.\n\n190\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.148\nThere's more exposure factor\nthat you have in place.\n\n191\n00:10:20.148 --> 00:10:24.566\nSomething gets too simple as\na locked door could prevent\n\n192\n00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:27.580\na vulnerability from being exposed.\n\n193\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.536\nSo you're reducing your attacked\nsurface by simply locking the door, but\n\n194\n00:10:31.536 --> 00:10:35.883\na vulnerability might be that you have a\nlock on the door, but nobody ever uses it.\n\n195\n00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:38.556\nYou tape the lock closed,\nso that nobody uses it.\n\n196\n00:10:38.556 --> 00:10:39.748\nSounds like a great idea,\n\n197\n00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:43.630\ncuz you're constantly tired of somebody\naccidentally locking the door.\n\n198\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.140\nBut at the same time, it's terrible,\nespecially if you have something secure\n\n199\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.730\nbehind that door that you\nreally need to secure.\n\n200\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.407\nSo each one of these\nsystem really are again,\n\n201\n00:10:52.407 --> 00:10:55.376\nthere helping one another\nas you start to do that.\n\n202\n00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:59.016\nNow let's talk about this idea of\nattack vulnerabilities for a moment, so\n\n203\n00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:03.005\nwe just went through a couple different\nvulnerabilities that sound very much like\n\n204\n00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:07.257\nattack surfaces, but attack surfaces tend\nto reside in three different categories.\n\n205\n00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:10.377\nThere of course are network\nattack surfaces and\n\n206\n00:11:10.377 --> 00:11:14.550\nthe idea of network attack\nsurfaces is fairly simple.\n\n207\n00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.530\nWe might think the idea of\nsecuring our DNS servers\n\n208\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.580\nmight be something we don't\never have to consider.\n\n209\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.630\nBut remember that if somebody can\ntake advantage of my DNS servers,\n\n210\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.630\nthey can really have complete access and\nthen manipulate changes\n\n211\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.880\nInside of my network without\nme even knowing about it and\n\n212\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.490\nthat's something that we want\nto be very careful about.\n\n213\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.370\nIt could be something just as simple as\n\n214\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.400\nnot actually having any secure\npasswords on your network, as well.\n\n215\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.570\nMaking sure that somebody doesn't follow,\nbecause they try to make it easy, right.\n\n216\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.192\nAt least eight characters which is great,\nbut it shouldn't be something as simple as\n\n217\n00:11:49.192 --> 00:11:51.970\none, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight.\n\n218\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:52.832\nDo people do it?\n\n219\n00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:55.357\nYes, they do, nor\nshould it be something like,\n\n220\n00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:57.940\npassword which again is fairly simple.\n\n221\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.215\nSo, it might be bad policies that\nare in place that continue to expose\n\n222\n00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:03.310\nnetwork flaws that are actually there too.\n\n223\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.600\nSo, that is an attack surface\nthat we might think about.\n\n224\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.100\nSoftware attack surfaces always come\nin forms of bugs as well, because their\n\n225\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.200\nexisting vulnerabilities and they give\nattackers a chance to examine the code and\n\n226\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.550\ntake a look at them even before they\nget on to your system and your network.\n\n227\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.510\nSo, you wanna make sure\nthat you understand that.\n\n228\n00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.922\nAnd of course, lastly,\nwe also have people attacks and\n\n229\n00:12:22.922 --> 00:12:27.858\nthis is where social engineering comes in\na bit more and that's one of the biggest\n\n230\n00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:33.110\nattack surfaces that we have to worry\nabout in terms of an attack surface.\n\n231\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.735\nBelieve it or not hacking people is\nactually much easier than hacking\n\n232\n00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:36.511\ncomputer systems.\n\n233\n00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:39.851\nThe reason why is that you can manipulate\npeople a lot easier than you can\n\n234\n00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.969\nmanipulate around rules that\nare setup by the computer that says,\n\n235\n00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:46.360\nthis is how you do it and\nit doesn't care about who you are.\n\n236\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.470\nSo, understanding the concepts\nbetween attack surface\n\n237\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.580\nversus vulnerability is something we\ndefinitely wanna make sure that we\n\n238\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.640\nkeep in our mind as we\ncontinue on here too.\n\n239\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.300\nSo Cherokee, the next one that we're\ntalking about is which one are we talking\n\n240\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.810\na look at next here?\n\n241\n00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.949\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna be looking\nat privilege escalation?\n\n242\n00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:05.652\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n243\n00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:06.317\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n244\n00:13:06.317 --> 00:13:08.471\n&gt;&gt; That is what we're gonna\nbe talking about here,\n\n245\n00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.056\nthe idea of privilege escalation.\n\n246\n00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:14.787\nThis has become a better and\nbetter security system that has\n\n247\n00:13:14.787 --> 00:13:19.244\nbeen put into place by,\nwell, pretty much everybody.\n\n248\n00:13:19.244 --> 00:13:22.880\nAt least in the last,\nI'm gonna say, decade or so.\n\n249\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.460\nIt used to be when you first\nlogged in to a Windows system and\n\n250\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.980\neven into an Active Directory network,\nit was fairly simple.\n\n251\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.492\nWhatever the privileges were,\n\n252\n00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:34.461\nyou pretty much ran as a local\nadministrator on your computer.\n\n253\n00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:36.380\nThat's pretty much what it was.\n\n254\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.320\nSo that means the whatever\nprograms are running,\n\n255\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.190\nit runs in the context of being a local\nadministrator on the computer and\n\n256\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.370\nyou might be wondering,\nwell, why the heck is that?\n\n257\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.480\nIt's bad, because that means malicious\nsoftware can get onto your computer and\n\n258\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.724\nwhen it says,\nwhy should I allow you to run?\n\n259\n00:13:51.724 --> 00:13:54.846\nWell, the reason why it's\nallowed to run is it says, well,\n\n260\n00:13:54.846 --> 00:13:56.640\nbecause I'm running as what?\n\n261\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.895\nThe local administrator on the computer.\n\n262\n00:13:57.895 --> 00:13:59.811\n&gt;&gt; I already have those rights or\nthose privileges.\n\n263\n00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:00.806\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it.\n\n264\n00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:03.165\nThe very fact that it\nalready has privileges.\n\n265\n00:14:03.165 --> 00:14:04.949\nIt says, I don't need anymore privileges.\n\n266\n00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:08.046\nHeck, I shouldn't even be having to\nask the operating system whether or\n\n267\n00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:09.900\nnot it should run or not.\n\n268\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.340\nWell, a while ago and I really experienced\nthis when Vista came on the scene\n\n269\n00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.620\nharder because that's when everybody\nmade a marketing deal out of this.\n\n270\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.670\nThe very fact that Vista asked said, no,\n\n271\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.560\nwe're not allowing anybody to run\nas the local administrator anymore.\n\n272\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.127\nYou can still do it, but you have to\njust make sure that you are local\n\n273\n00:14:29.127 --> 00:14:33.153\nadministrator by either selecting yes or\nno or by providing credentials.\n\n274\n00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:34.234\nIt made a lot of sense.\n\n275\n00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:38.932\nUnix and as well as Linux users,\nthey've been doing this all along by\n\n276\n00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:43.790\nusing pseudo or by actually having\nto elevate to the SG privilege.\n\n277\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.773\nFor the super user privilege,\nthey've been doing this for a while.\n\n278\n00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:49.503\nSo there's not actually been\nany harm that was done, but\n\n279\n00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:53.156\nthe very fact that they made\na market stomping on Windows\n\n280\n00:14:53.156 --> 00:14:58.060\nabout this really kind of brought it\nto the fore front for most people.\n\n281\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.326\nThey began to say, I hate this,\nthings like have you been using Mac?\n\n282\n00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:03.486\nIt's been happening whether or\nnot you've actually known it for a while,\n\n283\n00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.650\nyou've been using Linux.\n\n284\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.457\nIt's always been happening\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n285\n00:15:06.457 --> 00:15:10.529\nSo in this sense, the idea of privilege\nescalation is something that we definitely\n\n286\n00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:13.050\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n287\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.582\nToday, we run programs, but we're not\nactually running them as someone that can\n\n288\n00:15:17.582 --> 00:15:21.669\nhave complete and 100% access to\nthe system and that's kind of a key.\n\n289\n00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:25.386\n&gt;&gt; And so that concept, Ronnie would\nbe that from Windows perspective,\n\n290\n00:15:25.386 --> 00:15:29.922\nwhen they implemented the UAC, the user\naccount control, they're saying look, if\n\n291\n00:15:29.922 --> 00:15:34.830\na rogue piece of software were to go ahead\nand install some thing in the background.\n\n292\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.754\nThe thinking behind it is that you\nshould at least be alerted and notified,\n\n293\n00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:42.070\nhey, is this really something\nyou wanna go ahead and install?\n\n294\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.998\nYes or no kind of thing.\n\n295\n00:15:43.998 --> 00:15:46.961\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\nIt prevents then from anything that just\n\n296\n00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:51.163\ncomes on to your system that's\nan executable to run without you being\n\n297\n00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:55.293\nnotified or without you allowing it\nto happen and this has really cut\n\n298\n00:15:55.293 --> 00:16:00.165\ndown on a lot of the viruses that used to\nbe able to take over systems very easily.\n\n299\n00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:02.415\nThe caveat behind this is simple.\n\n300\n00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:06.632\nMost people that do not like that system,\nthey go in to Windows and\n\n301\n00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.600\nthey disable it, okay.\n\n302\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.630\nAnd once you disable it you can't blame\nthe system itself for not protecting\n\n303\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.610\nyou because you've pretty much told\nthe system to not act the way it needs to.\n\n304\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.800\nSo let's make sure that we understand\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n305\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.160\nSo let's come to my machine.\n\n306\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.030\nI've got a Windows machine up so\nwe can see this.\n\n307\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.950\nAnd I'm just gonna launch\nthe command prompt just for example.\n\n308\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.850\nNow this didn't take\nany privileges at all,\n\n309\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.180\nI'm able to launch the command prompt,\nable to do a few things.\n\n310\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:38.180\nBut if I wanted to run something as the\nadministrator, though, it might require me\n\n311\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.250\ninstead, to have something\nmy access like this.\n\n312\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.090\nAnd this is that user account control, and\n\n313\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.610\nthis is about defining that\nidea of privilege escalation.\n\n314\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.450\nThis is saying, hey,\nyou are about to elevate your privilege,\n\n315\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.080\nyou're about to escalate your\nprivilege here, are you sure?\n\n316\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.190\nSo if this was some type of code or\n\n317\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.060\nscript that was running in the background,\nsaid I want to infect this system.\n\n318\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.430\nFor me to do so, I need to be able to have\naccess to every file that's on the system.\n\n319\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.020\nWell, this is what it would get.\n\n320\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.790\nAnd it would wait right here, and\nnotice that the default, right?\n\n321\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.210\nIf I dont touch it at all after a while,\nit's just gonna say no.\n\n322\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.490\nSo it's not gonna allow\nthat privilege to go on.\n\n323\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:25.110\nBut if I allow for a yes, that means I\nhave accepted that responsibility and\n\n324\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.890\nnow whatever system that is, oops.\n\n325\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.830\nLet me scroll back out a little bit.\n\n326\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.010\nNow I am launched.\n\n327\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.040\nAnd I am running as the administrator.\n\n328\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.690\nAnd I can have access to\nbe able to do what I need.\n\n329\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:42.532\nNow even though Windows gives you that\noption and it's fairly right in your face,\n\n330\n00:17:42.532 --> 00:17:46.606\na lot of times if I go to let's\nsay in my Linux system here.\n\n331\n00:17:46.606 --> 00:17:51.798\nThis one is not as obvious if you haven't\nbeen inside of the Linux realm for\n\n332\n00:17:51.798 --> 00:17:53.740\na long time, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.213\nSo this is something\nelse that's also kind of.\n\n334\n00:17:57.213 --> 00:18:00.190\nSo one of the examples that we used\nthroughout the show is like TCP.\n\n335\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.950\nNotice that if I launch that, right.\n\n336\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.635\nIt says, hey look,\nthe command isn't even fowl.\n\n337\n00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:10.113\nNow I know something I installed it,\nI know it's there,\n\n338\n00:18:10.113 --> 00:18:12.220\nbut it's not found right now.\n\n339\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.070\nSo one of the things that we said\nwas what if we try to run as right.\n\n340\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.660\nAnd now it says alright\nwhat's the password?\n\n341\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.730\nLet's see what we can do.\n\n342\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.800\nNow it says, look, here's a protection\nagain and it realizes the password for\n\n343\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.200\nwhoever's logged in,\nhe's not in that sudoers file.\n\n344\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.970\nSo I'm not gonna allow that access in.\n\n345\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.270\nWell, this is what we want,\n\n346\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.280\nthe idea that privilege escalation has\nto happen is kind of a big thing here.\n\n347\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.409\nSo if I want this to go on,\nI have to actually switch users.\n\n348\n00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:49.110\nAnd then now notice I\ncan run that TCP dump.\n\n349\n00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.041\nAnd once I do that it now begins\nto run in the background and\n\n350\n00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:54.423\nif I were to send traffic\nit would continue to,\n\n351\n00:18:54.423 --> 00:18:58.770\nthere it goes, it's starting to show\na little bit of traffic come by.\n\n352\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.890\nNow you can see, that it is this type\nof thing that we have to worry about.\n\n353\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.580\nRemember that a lot of\nthe malicious programs that you and\n\n354\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.700\nI tend to think about, they normally do\nrequire some type of privilege escalation.\n\n355\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.000\nAnd that's why we want to make sure\nthat we understand this concept here.\n\n356\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.130\nMost of the time,\nwhat attackers will do, of course,\n\n357\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.310\nis try to run something that will give\nthem some type of escalated privileges.\n\n358\n00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.150\nUsually, of course,\nto the administrator of the machine,\n\n359\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.960\nnot trying to get even higher.\n\n360\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.210\nWhich is normally going to be like\nthe administrator of the network itself.\n\n361\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.360\nBut there are two different\nvarieties of this.\n\n362\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.940\nOne they call horizontal\nprivilege attacks.\n\n363\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.450\nWhich is not about getting access\nto a higher privilege level.\n\n364\n00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.990\nSometimes it's just about\ngetting access to more accounts.\n\n365\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.030\nSo, instead of me trying to compromise\nthe entire system by going higher\n\n366\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:44.770\nI just go, all right.\n\n367\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.920\nCherokee's got the same account as I do.\n\n368\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.250\nLet's see if I can just gain\naccess to Cherokee's account.\n\n369\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.100\n&gt;&gt; So you're just making\na lateral move at that point.\n\n370\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.770\n&gt;&gt; Yep, a lateral move.\n\n371\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.675\nAnd that's why they call it\na horizontal type of privilege attack.\n\n372\n00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:57.240\nThe other one, of course, is the vertical.\n\n373\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.300\nAnd this is probably the more common one.\n\n374\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.960\nWhere somebody is always\ntrying to get higher access so\n\n375\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.090\nthat they can do more on those systems and\non multiple systems at the same time.\n\n376\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.560\nSo just realize that in terms of\nprivilege attacks these are here,\n\n377\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.260\nthese are things that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n378\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.140\nAnd we have to think about at times\nbecause these attacks are fairly easily\n\n379\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.890\ndefeated if we leave the systems in place\nthat's there and one of the key things,\n\n380\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.030\nof course,\nis changing your passwords regularly.\n\n381\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.170\nInstead of an active directory network.\n\n382\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.230\nFairly easy, because normally they make\nyou change your passwords every so\n\n383\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.500\noften anyways.\n\n384\n00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.270\nBut then inside of a system\nlike the Linux system,\n\n385\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.940\non an individual box that's all up to you.\n\n386\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.220\nBut also the same thing still applies,\n\n387\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.250\ndon't stay logged in as\nthe actual super user.\n\n388\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.870\nDon't stay logged in as root.\n\n389\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.170\nMake sure that if you're running,\nthat's fine.\n\n390\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.810\nBut then after you're done with that,\nlog out, log back in as a regular user, or\n\n391\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.220\njust elevate your privileges\nonce you're actually\n\n392\n00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.014\nin that file to what you actually need.\n\n393\n00:20:55.014 --> 00:20:58.670\nMake sure you enter it in as and\nthere you go, you're ready to go.\n\n394\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.530\nBut you don't want that type of defeat\nto go on without you knowing it.\n\n395\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.450\nSo make sure that you understand that,\ntoo.\n\n396\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.550\n&gt;&gt; You want to be a little bit\n\n397\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.880\naware of whom you're giving those\nadministrative credentials out to,\n\n398\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.570\nas well, because you don't want to\nbe dolling them out haphazardly.\n\n399\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.230\nAnd the Root Account in Linux or\nAdministrative in Windows because then\n\n400\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.650\nyou're just making a larger attack\nsurface for yourself, so to speak.\n\n401\n00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.030\n&gt;&gt; That is true, the idea of account\ncontrol is a very important part,\n\n402\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.280\nespecially on privilege escalations.\n\n403\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.560\nSo that you know exactly what\nlevel of privileges someone has.\n\n404\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.260\nAnd this is the importance of making\nsure that you understand that groups\n\n405\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.250\nversus assigning individual privileges\nas an administrator, right?\n\n406\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.000\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n407\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.250\nIf you want to make sure that you\nknow exactly what every single\n\n408\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.300\nperson inside your network has as far as\nprivileges go, assigning them individually\n\n409\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.030\none at a time as long as you're able\nto track them is the way to go.\n\n410\n00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.860\nBut the easier way to do\nthis is to say all right,\n\n411\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.380\nhere's the group of Administrators East.\n\n412\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.060\nAnd you want to give them\na certain level of permissions.\n\n413\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.800\nYou create a group and you give all those\nprivileges to that particular group.\n\n414\n00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.590\nThen you just assign people to that group.\n\n415\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.790\nOr you remove them from that group.\n\n416\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.790\nAnd that automatically gives them\nthe privileges or takes them away.\n\n417\n00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.710\nAnd it's all a part of this aspect of\nunderstanding what has happened and\n\n418\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.100\nwho has actually caused this to happen.\n\n419\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.180\nSo this is one of the key things\nwhen you start seeing logs and\n\n420\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.980\nyou start seeing users\nrunning certain things.\n\n421\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.270\nWere they actually elevated\nin their privileges or\n\n422\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.730\ndid somebody actually do this?\n\n423\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.140\nWhatever it might be, and\nwe always have to take a look.\n\n424\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.134\nEspecially at weird times when you start\nseeing a lot of privilege escalation types\n\n425\n00:22:39.134 --> 00:22:40.205\nof attacks.\n\n426\n00:22:40.205 --> 00:22:43.440\nIt's normally during off hours instead\nof during the regular business hours.\n\n427\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.070\nThey could cover their tracks a lot\neasier during business hours but\n\n428\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.070\nthey're more than likely to get\ncaught during business hours too,\n\n429\n00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.020\ncuz you're monitoring it\nduring business hours.\n\n430\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, they could also be accessing\nyour system remotely, right?\n\n431\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n432\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.990\nthat brings us to our next topic here for\n\n433\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.370\nour remote exploits versus\nour local exploits.\n\n434\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.740\nSo what's the difference, Ronnie?\n\n435\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, that's kind of\nthe key here, it seems simple enough.\n\n436\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:11.520\nLocal exploits, excuse me, is something\nthat takes place locally, okay.\n\n437\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.370\nA remote exploit is something\nthat takes place remotely?\n\n438\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.540\nNo, not really,\nit's kind of strange, right?\n\n439\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.510\nSo even though the terminology seems\nsimple enough, something that we should be\n\n440\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:25.380\nable to easily walk into but\nthat definition doesn't make sense,\n\n441\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.100\nif a remote exploit takes place\nremotely somewhere else instead.\n\n442\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.590\nNote the idea's fairly simple,\n\n443\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.580\nis that you look at yourself though\nas being the attacked, right?\n\n444\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.410\nSo if there's a local exploit,\nthat means somebody was able to attack you\n\n445\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.920\nlocally on your system by gaining\naccess to that local system.\n\n446\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.720\nSame thing is the remote exploit,\n\n447\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.690\nif somebody remotely being\nable to gain access in.\n\n448\n00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.240\nSo they're on a different\nsystem connecting in.\n\n449\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.770\nNow by doing something like that, there's\na couple of different caveats here.\n\n450\n00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.196\nThe way that the local\nexploit tends to happen,\n\n451\n00:23:56.196 --> 00:23:59.726\nis that they've already been on your\nsystem at one point or another.\n\n452\n00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:03.044\nSo they might have created\nan account already on your system.\n\n453\n00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:06.491\nAnd then they take advantage of that\naccount that they've created on your\n\n454\n00:24:06.491 --> 00:24:09.994\nsystem to try and run some type of\nprivilege escalation now that they do have\n\n455\n00:24:09.994 --> 00:24:12.000\nsome rights on your system.\n\n456\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.260\nA remote exploit though, is also what\nyou call a blind exploit a lot of times.\n\n457\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.540\nWhere they're coming in from the outside.\n\n458\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.320\nThey may not have gotten access to your\nsystems before, but now they're trying to\n\n459\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.935\nfigure out what the exploit is remotely or\nblindly, before they try and take it over.\n\n460\n00:24:27.935 --> 00:24:32.080\nSo without any previous access to\nthe local system that you're on right now,\n\n461\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.930\nthey're able to do so.\n\n462\n00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.597\nAnd this is not so\nmuch necessary that you have to build.\n\n463\n00:24:37.597 --> 00:24:43.460\nDoesn't matter if it's a remote\nexploit versus a local exploit.\n\n464\n00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.680\nIn terms of the attack, well no, in\nthe end result, right, you got attacked.\n\n465\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.540\nBut it does matter in terms of\ninvestigating of what happened, right?\n\n466\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.649\nIt was local, it means somebody\ngot access to my keyboard, okay.\n\n467\n00:24:55.649 --> 00:24:58.851\nSomebody was able to get right\nthere on my computer system,\n\n468\n00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:01.340\nwas able to take advantage of that.\n\n469\n00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.950\nIt was remote, they could be sitting\nsomewhere on the other side of this\n\n470\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.850\nplanet, and really gaining\naccess to the system itself.\n\n471\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.210\nAnd that, of course,\nleads your investigation in different way.\n\n472\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.910\nLocally, I could go all right, who was\nin the room with me at the same time?\n\n473\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.033\nAnd go, Cherokee was the only\none in the room with me.\n\n474\n00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:18.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; During time I logged that\n\n475\n00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:19.273\nattack going on.\n\n476\n00:25:19.273 --> 00:25:20.272\n&gt;&gt; You got me.\n\n477\n00:25:20.272 --> 00:25:22.718\n&gt;&gt; I think I can figure\nthat one out fairly easily.\n\n478\n00:25:22.718 --> 00:25:27.343\nBut, if all of the sudden, we start\nfinding out that nobody was in the room,\n\n479\n00:25:27.343 --> 00:25:31.971\nand the last keyboard was actually\nlogged from some IP over somewhere else,\n\n480\n00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:35.440\nthen I might start\nnoticing something else.\n\n481\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.240\nMight be a little bit\ndifferent in that sense.\n\n482\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.620\nBut just kind of realize\nthat they are out there, and\n\n483\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.540\nthese types of exploits are something\nthat we have to deal with as well.\n\n484\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.810\nAll right, so we just wanna do a brief\noverview of three different types of\n\n485\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.730\nattacks and we're gonna be talking\nabout these a little bit more.\n\n486\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.239\nSo we're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime in these last few minutes here.\n\n487\n00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:53.866\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n488\n00:25:53.866 --> 00:25:54.939\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering attack.\n\n489\n00:25:54.939 --> 00:25:55.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:55.647 --> 00:26:00.470\n&gt;&gt; Phishing and\nevasion methods when it comes down to.\n\n491\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.940\nNow, of all three of those,\n\n492\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.050\nwhich one do you think is kind\nof the worst of the attacks?\n\n493\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.240\nTalk about social engineering,\nphishing or evasions.\n\n494\n00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.512\n&gt;&gt; Good question, Ronnie.\n\n495\n00:26:09.512 --> 00:26:11.885\nI think social engineering\nwould be the worst.\n\n496\n00:26:11.885 --> 00:26:15.290\nI don't know.\n\n497\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:20.188\nIt's a pre-cursor I think a lot times\nsocial engineering they're kind of\n\n498\n00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:22.140\nit's staking the joint out.\n\n499\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.051\nThey're going to see-\n&gt;&gt; Do reconnaissance type of thing.\n\n500\n00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Recon, exactly and footprinting.\n\n501\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.960\nAnd so they're going to see what,\nhow everything's set up.\n\n502\n00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.640\nWhat kind of systems you have in place.\n\n503\n00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.630\nSo maybe it's not always used for\n\n504\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.830\nmalicious purposes directly,\njust like a recon.\n\n505\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.060\nSo I don't know.\n\n506\n00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.870\nPhishing is pretty bad though.\n\n507\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.970\nFor years we've had\nthese phishing scams and\n\n508\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.540\npeople are still playing into them so\nI don't know.\n\n509\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well it's kind of strange.\n\n510\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.350\nNobody really knows which one's worse,\nbut most of them just begin with social\n\n511\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.540\nengineering when it comes down to it,\nokay?\n\n512\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.770\nThe very fact is social engineering is\na hack that really requires no technology.\n\n513\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.600\nAnd normally remember that the,\n\n514\n00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.030\neven though the ultimate target is\ngonna be a system of some sort so\n\n515\n00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.590\nthat they can gain information, the vector\nof their attack is only people, okay?\n\n516\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.256\nAnd that means they can take\nadvantage of somebody by persuasion,\n\n517\n00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:17.250\ncharm, whatever it is or even by simply\nsending them an email that says,\n\n518\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.193\nyou've won a trip to, whenever you\nwanna go and you click on that link.\n\n519\n00:27:21.193 --> 00:27:22.898\nWell, it's all social engineering.\n\n520\n00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:26.214\nThey have somehow manipulated you\ninto believing that whatever they've\n\n521\n00:27:26.214 --> 00:27:26.861\nsaid is true.\n\n522\n00:27:26.861 --> 00:27:32.880\nAnd now you have their particular way of\nthinking now embedded into your brain.\n\n523\n00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.810\nAnd that's what happens.\n\n524\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.730\nSo they are both pretty bad, but to me,\n\n525\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.580\nevasion is kind of the one that's really\ntricky because of what it says, evasion.\n\n526\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.690\nIt's avoiding the notice\nthat an attack is going on.\n\n527\n00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.213\nSocial engineering is not avoiding,\nit's kind of hiding in plain sight, right.\n\n528\n00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:50.218\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n529\n00:27:50.218 --> 00:27:52.672\n&gt;&gt; It's tricking you into believing you\nthat they're your friend, and they're not.\n\n530\n00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:53.918\nThey're an attacker, okay.\n\n531\n00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:59.045\nThe idea of phishing is hiding\nbehind an email, a lock.\n\n532\n00:27:59.045 --> 00:28:02.503\nEvasion, though, is actively saying\nyou're not going to find me.\n\n533\n00:28:02.503 --> 00:28:04.924\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; I am trying to bypass your active\n\n534\n00:28:04.924 --> 00:28:08.329\nscanning systems,\nwhatever you might have in there and\n\n535\n00:28:08.329 --> 00:28:11.760\nthey are going to bypass that someway,\nsomehow.\n\n536\n00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.153\nBy using the combination of techniques or\n\n537\n00:28:13.153 --> 00:28:14.873\ntechniques you're normally\nnot thinking about.\n\n538\n00:28:14.873 --> 00:28:17.870\nSo that they can actually move around you.\n\n539\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.199\n&gt;&gt; Stay one step ahead of you.\n\n540\n00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:19.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so\n\n541\n00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:23.531\nin this one we are gonna talk about this\na little bit more in detail later on.\n\n542\n00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:26.331\nBut just kinda realize that all of\nthese different types of attacks\n\n543\n00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:29.890\nthat we've mentioned here,\nthe different types of concepts, right.\n\n544\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:34.430\nThey really are kinds of concepts\nthat we must be familiar with.\n\n545\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.430\nAnd they're changing.\n\n546\n00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.790\nThey are morphing every day.\n\n547\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:42.470\nIt's no longer enough just to say,\nsomebody is just lying to you.\n\n548\n00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.150\nThey are lying creatively to you.\n\n549\n00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:49.197\nThey're able to convince you of things,\nthey are persuading you in ways that you\n\n550\n00:28:49.197 --> 00:28:53.201\ndon't realize and the same thing with\nphishing scams and evasion techniques.\n\n551\n00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:57.985\nThey're becoming more insidious in\nthe things that they do to get past\n\n552\n00:28:57.985 --> 00:28:59.390\nyour systems.\n\n553\n00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.857\nThey're using network\nscanners against you.\n\n554\n00:29:00.857 --> 00:29:02.590\nIs what they're doing.\n\n555\n00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.810\nThey're figuring out,\nwhat are you scanning for?\n\n556\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.460\nHow do I get around that scan,\nand they're walking around.\n\n557\n00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.610\nSo it's just like living with\na teenager is what it comes down to,\n\n558\n00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.140\nis what ends up happening.\n\n559\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.330\nAnd I'm joking, no I'm not,\ncuz I live with a teenager.\n\n560\n00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.390\nBut you kind of get this idea in this\nsystem here that all of these different\n\n561\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.654\nones, these are difference concepts.\n\n562\n00:29:21.654 --> 00:29:25.410\nThat we can't just bypass because\nwe think that they are all right.\n\n563\n00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.945\n&gt;&gt; Knowing these concepts and\n\n564\n00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:30.814\neven maybe understanding the motive\nof your attacker by having a good\n\n565\n00:29:30.814 --> 00:29:34.900\nunderstanding of the difference of\ntypes of attacks that are out there.\n\n566\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.590\nYou can really help protect your system so\n\n567\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.963\nit is a good idea just to be\naware of all the different ones.\n\n568\n00:29:38.963 --> 00:29:43.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's a lot of different\ntypes of attack concepts that we should at\n\n569\n00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:45.710\nleast be familiar with and understand.\n\n570\n00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.235\nBe able to contrast them if we need to.\n\n571\n00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:49.272\nBut, overall though, right?\n\n572\n00:29:49.272 --> 00:29:51.940\nIt makes us better as we start\nthinking about each one of these.\n\n573\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.319\nBecause they are different\nways to do attacks.\n\n574\n00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:57.688\nThey're not all as neat and-\n&gt;&gt; Cookie cutter.\n\n575\n00:29:57.688 --> 00:29:59.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nas we think that the definition sounds.\n\n576\n00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:03.127\nThere are always nuances to them\nthat we have not thought about, and\n\n577\n00:30:03.127 --> 00:30:08.010\nthis is what's gonna continue to happen in\nthe future and we need to be ready for it.\n\n578\n00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.611\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for taking the time to\ngo over, well, a lot of these different\n\n579\n00:30:11.611 --> 00:30:15.459\ntypes of attacks that we may encounter in\nreal life because it happens every day.\n\n580\n00:30:15.459 --> 00:30:18.862\nSo thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, so much for tuning in.\n\n581\n00:30:18.862 --> 00:30:22.126\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this show\nup, but remember, I'm your show host,\n\n582\n00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:22.850\nCherokee Boose.\n\n583\n00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:23.631\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n584\n00:30:23.631 --> 00:30:24.790\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:10.772\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.720\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.450\nwe will be describing different types\nof web and application attacks.\n\n8\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.430\nAnd with us today to help us cover this\ntopic, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.660\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.950\nhaving me back as we continue on in our\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n12\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.640\nWe're really now taking a look, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.838\nat network as well as the web types of\nattacks that we're going to encounter.\n\n14\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.780\nWe just wanna make sure\nwe have a well rounded\n\n15\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.658\nidea of what these attacks\nactually are doing.\n\n16\n00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:48.580\nSo we wanna take a moment to describe them\nand make sure that you have some examples\n\n17\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.180\nof where you tend to see them and\nwhy they work as well as they do.\n\n18\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.500\nSo, at the very beginning here,\nwe're gonna take a look at just some\n\n19\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.740\nvery simple types of network\nattacks that are available to us.\n\n20\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.750\nAnd Cherokee's gonna help us\nout here by describing them.\n\n21\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.887\nAnd hopefully interacting\nwith us to try and\n\n22\n00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.550\nhelp us to understand\nthat a little bit better.\n\n23\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.120\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat are we gonna take a look at first?\n\n24\n00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.159\n&gt;&gt; Well, there are a lot of different\ntypes of attacks out there.\n\n25\n00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.242\nAnd like you'd mentioned,\nthis is gonna be a high level overview so\n\n26\n00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:15.170\nthat you are aware.\n\n27\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.702\nWe're not gonna show you a tutorial like\nstep by step on how to execute them.\n\n28\n00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:18.459\nBecause well,\n\n29\n00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.930\nthere are literally thousands of ways you\ncould execute a different type of attack.\n\n30\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.162\nBut if we take a look at my screen,\n\n31\n00:01:24.162 --> 00:01:26.633\nI'll clarify some of the different\nterms that you may have heard.\n\n32\n00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:31.338\nAnd we're just making sure that we\nunderstand when you hear these different\n\n33\n00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:31.859\nterms.\n\n34\n00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.930\nBecause not everyone uses the same\nterminology here, for instance.\n\n35\n00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.748\nWhen you hear this term denial of service,\n\n36\n00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.895\nI want you guys to think\noutside of the box here.\n\n37\n00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:47.820\nA denial of service simply means you\nare denying any kind of service.\n\n38\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.297\nIt doesn't have to be a particular\nmachine or a network bandwidth.\n\n39\n00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:54.870\nIt could be electricity to your\nbuilding for all that matters.\n\n40\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.670\nBut anytime you're causing\nloss to an organization or\n\n41\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.990\npreventing them from accessing\nnetwork resources or being productive.\n\n42\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.130\nThat's a type of denial of service.\n\n43\n00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.950\nSo knowing that there are many\ndifferent ways, there are different\n\n44\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.850\nprotocols that you can exploit to\ncreate a denial of service attack.\n\n45\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.450\nBut it could also be something as\nsimple like I mentioned as electricity.\n\n46\n00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.330\nSomeone, a construction worker\ncutting a cable, a backbone and\n\n47\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.930\nthis has happened before across\nthe Internet backbone, with a backhoe.\n\n48\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350\nAnd so\nthat's gonna cause major problems for\n\n49\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.330\na lot of companies until they can get that\nfixed and re-route all the information.\n\n50\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.210\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is where it becomes a problem for\n\n51\n00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.680\nmost people is that denial of service can\nhappen even before it hits your network.\n\n52\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.267\nCherokee gave us an example of cutting\nmaybe a fiber optic cable that connects\n\n53\n00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.193\nyou to the ISP.\n\n54\n00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:52.755\nWell, now, your customers can't get to you\nregardless of how well your service is\n\n55\n00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.985\nbuilt up if you rely on that connection.\n\n56\n00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:58.050\nThis is where it becomes problematic.\n\n57\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.114\nSo being able to deny the idea of just\nsimple access into maybe your web services\n\n58\n00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:03.296\nor into your network.\n\n59\n00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:07.490\nOr your network from being able to get\nout to service the customers it needs to.\n\n60\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.019\nThis is one of those types\nof attacks that can do that.\n\n61\n00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.199\nAnd even though we can talk\nabout it in terms of networking,\n\n62\n00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.750\nwe can do the same thing for\nan individual host and machine.\n\n63\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.430\nWhere I might say, look,\nI'm gonna keep a server busy.\n\n64\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.180\nSo much so by requesting so\n\n65\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.120\nmany different resources that it can't\nprovide the service to anybody else.\n\n66\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.166\nSo this may be something, for\nexample, like a file server.\n\n67\n00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.463\nWhere it's constantly just getting\npegged with requests to the point where\n\n68\n00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:35.361\na legitimate request really\ncannot get access in.\n\n69\n00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:41.416\nOr just as simply as me locking\nthe door to a particular server.\n\n70\n00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:45.780\nThat you can't get in there and actually\nreboot it or disconnect the cable.\n\n71\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.940\nWhatever it might be, any place where I\ncan deny you the ability to do the things\n\n72\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.000\nthat you have to do on a regular basis\nis pretty much a denial of service.\n\n73\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.030\nBut in networking sense,\nwe do tend to see these attacks.\n\n74\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.010\nAnd they really did happen more\noften in the days of dial-up.\n\n75\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.473\nIt was relatively easy to do\nit in the days of dial-up.\n\n76\n00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:08.135\nAnd that was because of the very small\namount of bandwidth that we had to\n\n77\n00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.040\nreally just fill up before.\n\n78\n00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.890\nNow, somebody's connection\nwould either disconnect.\n\n79\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.990\nOr it was just so\n\n80\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.950\nbusy somebody else couldn't connect\nin the way that we wanted to.\n\n81\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.080\nToday, though, even with as little\nas six megabits or heck, even two or\n\n82\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.240\nthree megabits.\n\n83\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.015\nIt's fairly difficult to do\na bandwidth type of denial of service.\n\n84\n00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.430\nOf trying to fill up that amount\nof bandwidth before it goes down.\n\n85\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.770\nBut it is possible if you actually start\nusing some different methods as well.\n\n86\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.650\nBut this is one of the ones that we\nmust make sure that we understand\n\n87\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.890\nright at the beginning.\n\n88\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, that's a good\npoint looking at the bandwidth and\n\n89\n00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.681\nseeing how our networks have evolved.\n\n90\n00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:45.360\nAnd we do have a littlet better,\nfaster forms of communication.\n\n91\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.610\nBut if we take a look at my screen,\n\n92\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.200\nI'm gonna start with that basic concept\nof a bandwidth type of denial of service.\n\n93\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.170\nSomething really generic.\n\n94\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.763\nMost of the equipment on networks\ntoday can handle attacks like this.\n\n95\n00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:58.210\nBut just bear with me so\nyou can understand this concept.\n\n96\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.391\nSo let's just say this is\nan attacker's PC up here.\n\n97\n00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:06.280\nAnd you may hear different terms such\nas handlers, the master or the herders.\n\n98\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.019\nAnd I'll explain as to why that\nterminology will make sense here in\n\n99\n00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.763\nthe moment.\n\n100\n00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:13.500\nBut let's start small.\n\n101\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.780\nAnd just think about this for a second.\n\n102\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.240\nIf this particular machine wanted to\ngo ahead and spoof their IP address.\n\n103\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.735\nAnd here I'm gonna pick\non Ronnie a little bit.\n\n104\n00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:25.750\nBut here I have Ronnie's PC\ndown at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.200\nAnd let's say this attacker\nspoofs Ronnie's IP address,\n\n106\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.066\nwhich is relatively easy to do.\n\n107\n00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:34.180\nYou don't even need any special\nsoftware or anything like that.\n\n108\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.394\nSo the attacker spoofs\nRonnie's IP address.\n\n109\n00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:41.686\nHe could ping this particular\nunsuspecting middleman.\n\n110\n00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:45.650\nBut then who is this middleman\ngoing to be replying to?\n\n111\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.363\nWell, that's gonna be Ronnie, right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:50.683\nAnd while that doesn't\nseem like a big problem.\n\n113\n00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.138\nLike one ping, what is that?\n\n114\n00:05:52.138 --> 00:05:55.250\nThat's not gonna do much to go ahead and\nbring Ronnie's system down.\n\n115\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.500\nHis system should be able to handle that.\n\n116\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.490\nAnd that's called a reflective\ntype of denial of service.\n\n117\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.717\nBut what if we amplify?\n\n118\n00:06:04.717 --> 00:06:08.210\nBut we have this in concept,\nso it's still reflective.\n\n119\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.360\nBut instead of pinging this\nunsuspecting middleman,\n\n120\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.210\nwhat if I were to ping an entire\nnetwork broadcast IP address?\n\n121\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.310\nSo let's go ahead and take a look and\nsee what that would look like.\n\n122\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.973\nNow if that attacker were to\nping this entire network.\n\n123\n00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:29.440\nAnd everyone of these computers\nwere to reply to Ronnie now.\n\n124\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.970\nBecause remember, that attacker\nhas spoofed Ronnie's IP address.\n\n125\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.270\nWell, what would happen\nto poor old Ronnie?\n\n126\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.070\nI don't know.\n\n127\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.110\nMaybe his system could handle it,\nmaybe it couldn't handle it.\n\n128\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.413\nMaybe it would bring his system down for\nmaintenance.\n\n129\n00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:44.280\nSo that's where you hear the term\npermanent denial of service.\n\n130\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.850\nIf I have to take that\nmachine offline to repair it,\n\n131\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.530\nthat's an example of\na permanent denial of service.\n\n132\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.584\nAnd you might even hear this term smurf.\n\n133\n00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:55.480\nAnd that's what I just showed you\nan example of a smurf attack there.\n\n134\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.900\nSo if you look at different types,\nyou hear the terms reflective,\n\n135\n00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.750\nyou hear amplified.\n\n136\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.890\nOops, I didn't mean to do that there.\n\n137\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.670\n[LAUGH] Sorry guys,\nI gave you a whiplash here.\n\n138\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.352\nBut the different types,\nwe see reflective, amplified,\n\n139\n00:07:10.352 --> 00:07:12.423\ndistributed denial of service.\n\n140\n00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:17.150\nFriendly denial of service and that\nsmurf attack like I've just shown you.\n\n141\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.800\nNow what does it mean when\nthe type of attack is friendly?\n\n142\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.270\nWell, kind of playing off\nthat term friendly fire.\n\n143\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.113\nIt means it may in fact be a legitimate\ntype of denial of service.\n\n144\n00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:30.710\nWhere, for instance, I have a web\nserver that is just being inundated.\n\n145\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.573\nMaybe there's a Black Friday sale,\nCyber Monday.\n\n146\n00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:37.537\nAnd my web server cannot handle\nthe traffic that is being sent to it to go\n\n147\n00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:41.089\nahead and\nbuy those great deal on those holidays.\n\n148\n00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:46.080\nAnd then distributed denial of service.\n\n149\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.692\nIf you think about location,\ngeographically.\n\n150\n00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:52.192\nIf I have machines spread\nall around the world,\n\n151\n00:07:52.192 --> 00:07:57.200\ngoing to perform an attack at\none particular point in time.\n\n152\n00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.049\nLet's say, let's pick on Ronnie again.\n\n153\n00:07:59.049 --> 00:07:59.827\nI really don't like Ronnie.\n\n154\n00:07:59.827 --> 00:08:01.580\nI know it's his birthday coming up.\n\n155\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.780\nI want him to have a horrible birthday.\n\n156\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.630\nWhat I could do is send out, take a while,\nbuild up my army, my botnet,\n\n157\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.000\nmy zombie army, my drones.\n\n158\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.250\nYou'll hear those different terms.\n\n159\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.690\nBut, I can send little pieces of\nmalware via email attachments or\n\n160\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.530\nany other form of vector.\n\n161\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.900\nLet me build up my army for a while.\n\n162\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.680\nLet me infect those systems.\n\n163\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.220\nLet that rogue malware lay dormant\nuntil a particular trigger,\n\n164\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.610\nRonnie's birthday, or\nsome other type of event.\n\n165\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.510\nAnd then, all of a sudden,\nat the same time, I send the command.\n\n166\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.470\nI'm in control over all\nmy little minions and\n\n167\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.250\nthey perform some form of denial of\nservice on a particular machine or system.\n\n168\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.820\nSo that would be a distributed\ndenial of service and\n\n169\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.890\nthis is really the way of the future guys.\n\n170\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.610\nSorry didn't mean to do that again.\n\n171\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.940\nWe have got IoT botnets,\nI mean, if we could go ahead and\n\n172\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.640\ndo a full screen here, and look right\nhere we have all these different devices.\n\n173\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.275\nWe have cell phones, smart tv's,\nregular desktops, laptops,\n\n174\n00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:05.295\nRonnie, even light bulbs.\n\n175\n00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:05.860\n&gt;&gt; M-hm.\n\n176\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.950\n&gt;&gt; And all of these home automation\ndevices can actually be used\n\n177\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.680\nin these types of distributed\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n178\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.450\nIt's kind of crazy.\n\n179\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.728\nIf we look at events we see a lot of\nvulnerabilities with Mirai botnets that\n\n180\n00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:20.690\nhad happened last year.\n\n181\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.970\nI can only imagine that it's going\nto continue in that path and\n\n182\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.690\nwe're gonna see a lot more of\nthose types of attacks next year.\n\n183\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.510\nWe're talking large scale attacks here.\n\n184\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.700\nWe're talking the Rio Olympics.\n\n185\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.770\nWe're talking about\nPresidential candidates.\n\n186\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:42.600\nWe're talking about security professionals\nand even a large DNS companies that\n\n187\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.340\nbasically are helping the backbone\nof our networks, so the Internet.\n\n188\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.110\nSo there's a lot of different\nmethods that attackers are using and\n\n189\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.580\nfiguring out every single day just\nto try to stay one step ahead there.\n\n190\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Well you think about it, it's a very\neffective attack because it doesn't really\n\n191\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.540\nrequire a lot of knowledge for internal\ndevices inside your network if you wanted\n\n192\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.855\nto produce an attack like\nwhat Cherokee was describing.\n\n193\n00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:13.560\nWhat normally ends up happening is that\nyou end up seeing very much so that they\n\n194\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.210\njust had to have a way to block access\ninto what you actually need to be done.\n\n195\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.410\nSo that's why attackers are very\nfond of these types of attacks.\n\n196\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.250\nAlso because of the way that the internet\nhas now grown to be not only a political\n\n197\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.046\ntool but a financial tool, it gives them\nthe ability to almost crowd-source to,\n\n198\n00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:36.550\nbe able to get a lot of people to jump on\nthe same bandwagon because they want to\n\n199\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.655\ntake down a particular company without\nhaving to actually know a lot of details.\n\n200\n00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:45.026\nThey can be given a few instructions and\nthen they can be told exactly how to\n\n201\n00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:49.640\ndo this and to be part of that\nentire army of devices that\n\n202\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.150\ndo that denial of service or distributed\ndenial of service attack as well.\n\n203\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.720\nBut Cherokee, that's not the only types\nof attacks that we need to worry about,\n\n204\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.670\neven though that's one\nof the biggest ones,\n\n205\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.560\nanother one of course is the idea of\nsome type of man in the middle, right?\n\n206\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, unfortunately,\n\n207\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.050\nit's not the only type of attack\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n208\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.090\nIt's probably going to be pretty\npopular but there are several\n\n209\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.140\nother methods an attacker can execute\nany kind of malicious attack here.\n\n210\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.210\nOne term you may hear is something\ncalled a man in the middle attack.\n\n211\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.840\nThis can be executed in\nmany different fashions but\n\n212\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.790\nlet me switch on over here to Arp for\na second to kind of, and Ronnie, remember\n\n213\n00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.540\nwhen we were talking about different\nprotocols and we said it's important to\n\n214\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.930\nunderstand how the protocols work so\nwe can understand how these attacks work.\n\n215\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.140\nIt just kind of makes sense, right.\n\n216\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.730\nAnd if we think about ARP, right.\n\n217\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.540\nHow does ARP work?\n\n218\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.240\nIt's a very simple basic\nrudimentary protocol.\n\n219\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.250\nIt has four steps here.\n\n220\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.700\nIt doesn't have any integrated security.\n\n221\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.080\nSo step number one my machine here.\n\n222\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.190\nWell first of all I wanna send a message,\n\n223\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.630\nlet's say this machine wants to\ncommunicate with this machine up here.\n\n224\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.530\nAnd here we have a switch to go ahead and\nfacilitate that communication.\n\n225\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.360\nBut first of all I'm gonna look ARP,\nwe'll always look locally first in its\n\n226\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.430\ncache to see if I have ever communicated\nwith this particular node before.\n\n227\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.590\nIf it has, then that's great,\nit'll take this information and\n\n228\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.850\nsend that message on it's way.\n\n229\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.740\nHowever, if there's nothing in my cache,\nit will begin the ARP process and\n\n230\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.970\nsend out that broadcast communication and\nwait for a reply.\n\n231\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.430\nAnd then add it to its cache.\n\n232\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.140\nSo what happens if this particular\nmachine's cache has been poisoned,\n\n233\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.740\nhas been manipulated in some fashion?\n\n234\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.260\nVery easy to do,\nthat's just one of the many, many ways,\n\n235\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.340\nyou're exploiting a type of protocol,\nto perform a man in the middle attack.\n\n236\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.830\nSo man in the middle can just, it's a very\ngeneric term if you think about it.\n\n237\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.270\nYou might even hear\nthe term replay attack.\n\n238\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.690\nReplay attack is a type of\nman in the middle attack, but\n\n239\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.710\nthe difference would be that a replay\nattack is holding that information\n\n240\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.940\nto go ahead and\ncreate a session at a later time.\n\n241\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.670\nCookies, all right,\nwhen we go to start a communication.\n\n242\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.650\nIf I have an attacker here and\nthis attacker is just kind of lurking on\n\n243\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.900\nmy network and waiting, trying to listen\nto communication let's say in this\n\n244\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.370\nparticular situation they have been able\nto gain physical access to that switch.\n\n245\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.090\nThey're able to plug in, configure\nthat switch to setup port mirroring.\n\n246\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.980\nNow this attacker can view all\ncommunications between Bob and\n\n247\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.360\nthis file server.\n\n248\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.300\nWell, if this attacker's able to gain\nthose session cookies, then when Bob goes\n\n249\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.250\nhome at 5 PM, this attacker may be able\nto go ahead and create a spoofed session.\n\n250\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.560\nHe could even hijack Bob's\nlegitimate session and\n\n251\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.710\nthen start feeding Bob false information.\n\n252\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.750\nAnd Bob thinks he's getting legit\ninformation from the file server, where,\n\n253\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.510\nin fact, it's just fraudulent information.\n\n254\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:51.620\nSo wireless is probably going to be, and\nthis is just kinda what that looks like,\n\n255\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.220\nBob could be sending his information\nto the attacker unsuspectingly,\n\n256\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.460\njust different ways.\n\n257\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.200\nYou've got physical access, such as\nwiretaps, and wireless is probably gonna\n\n258\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.090\nbe the most preferred method\nbecause it is the easiest.\n\n259\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.590\nI mean.\n\n260\n00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:07.715\nThat's really the way to go.\n\n261\n00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:10.555\nThat's why we should be very careful\nin the way that we set up our wireless\n\n262\n00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:14.385\nnetworks, making sure we don't\nhave any rogue access points.\n\n263\n00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:18.115\nThat's a very easy way for these type\nof man in the middle attacks to occur.\n\n264\n00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:21.485\n&gt;&gt; You know, the hard thing about\nunderstanding the man in the middle attack\n\n265\n00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:25.950\nis that its ability to detect\nit is almost impossible.\n\n266\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.840\nNot saying you can't, but the only time\nyou can detect it is normally while\n\n267\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.910\nit's happening, and you think that you can\nspot it afterwards, you're not going to.\n\n268\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.260\nVery simply even in the diagram\nthat we're seeing right here,\n\n269\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.160\nall the attacker has to do is\ndisconnect from that switch and\n\n270\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.940\nyou might not ever know that it's\nactually been an attack that went on\n\n271\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.420\nbecause he's not doing anything to try and\nget the traffic.\n\n272\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:55.070\nIt is actually just doing its normal way\nof servicing that ideal port mirroring so,\n\n273\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.340\nit's just sending exactly what\nthe switch is telling it to send.\n\n274\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.020\nSo we're not actually seeing any\ntype of real attack that we can spot\n\n275\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.400\nunless it's occurring right then and\nthere.\n\n276\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.210\nSo it's not one of those after\nthe fact type of things that you\n\n277\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.430\ncan spot very easily.\n\n278\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.360\nBut as far as just general\ntypes of network attacks\n\n279\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.920\nthe idea of denial of service,\ndistributed denial of service, and\n\n280\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.410\nof course this idea of the man in\nthe middle attacks, these are the types of\n\n281\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.330\nattacks that we're probably gonna see\nmore often as far as network attacks go.\n\n282\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.360\nBut we do need to turn our focus a little\nbit now, and start talking about\n\n283\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.720\nthe idea of web attacks which are probably\nmuch more prominent in today's network.\n\n284\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.810\nAnd that is because, well, just about\neverybody has some type of web presence,\n\n285\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.270\nright, some type of presence\nout on the Internet.\n\n286\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.461\nWe all run a web server of some sort.\n\n287\n00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:47.230\nWe all do business a lot of times,\nespecially if you're a corporation,\n\n288\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.391\ndoes business by using that particular\nweb front that you have going on there,\n\n289\n00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:55.674\nwhether it's a store in\nwhich you buy Gadgets on or\n\n290\n00:15:55.674 --> 00:15:57.887\na subscription base by ITProTV.\n\n291\n00:15:57.887 --> 00:16:01.847\nWe all depend on our web servers to make\nsure that everything is actually the way\n\n292\n00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:03.280\nthat we want to.\n\n293\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.130\nThat means we also have to worry\nabout network attacks like this.\n\n294\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.260\nWe don't want somebody to be able\nto bring down our web server.\n\n295\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.740\nThrough a denial service attack.\n\n296\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.370\nSo we choose not to host\nit locally right here.\n\n297\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.070\nWe host it in a cloud somewhere.\n\n298\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.960\nSo that they have redundancy,\nthey have protections,\n\n299\n00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.630\nthey have some other things out there\nthat really do help us as well.\n\n300\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:26.690\nSame thing when we monitor our services\nby using third-party providers, too.\n\n301\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.420\nWe're trying to make sure that nobody else\nis doing things like man-in-the-middle\n\n302\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.640\nattacks as well.\n\n303\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.580\nThat's actually doing the monitoring for\nus 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n304\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.440\nBut it doesn't prevent then\nthe idea of just a regular web,\n\n305\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.680\nattack in which we need to\nmake sure we understand.\n\n306\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.560\nSo let's go ahead and start talking about\na few of these different web attacks that\n\n307\n00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.700\nwe also have available to us.\n\n308\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.620\nAnd one of the ones that we\nneed to focus in on, of course,\n\n309\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.400\nis the idea of what we call\na SQL injection attack.\n\n310\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.240\nThis sounds a little bit intimidating,\nright?\n\n311\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.060\nOr an SQL injection attack.\n\n312\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.060\nSo a couple of different things, right?\n\n313\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.830\nIf you hear the term SQL,\n\n314\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.710\nevery place besides the Microsoft\nworld pretty much calls it SQL.\n\n315\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.810\nThat's what I needed to\nmake sure that you know.\n\n316\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.160\nBut if you're in Microsoft land and I've\nbeen dealing with Microsoft databases.\n\n317\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.490\nI've called it SQL now for\nten years and hard for me to change.\n\n318\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.350\nSo if you're saying Ronnie you should\nsay SQL injection I understand, but\n\n319\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.190\ntake a look at the idea of SQL injection\nattacks is what we want to make sure\n\n320\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.960\nthat we have an understanding\nof as we go through.\n\n321\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.070\nSo let's remember this, right,\nas you go to a website, and\n\n322\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.010\nlet's say that this is\nwhat you want to do.\n\n323\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.090\nYou want to use a search field,\n\n324\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:41.080\ninside of that website to return to you\ninformation that's regarding your account.\n\n325\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.330\nWell that type of search engine\nthat you have available to you\n\n326\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.200\nhooks into a database somewhere, and\n\n327\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.010\nin that database normally what it's\nrunning is some type of SQL, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.020\nRegardless of what the SQL,\n\n329\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.470\nis it depends on that language called\nstructured query language, or SQL.\n\n330\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:02.120\nAnd that means that if somebody then\ncan be smart enough, to be able to\n\n331\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.740\nknow the way that SQL is structured and\nthe way you write the syntax out.\n\n332\n00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.420\nThey can easily run an SQL command,\nagainst your database.\n\n333\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.900\nEven through something as simple as little\nsearch field on the web page, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.770\nAnd if they can, that means that they\ncan return data that is unsuspecting\n\n335\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.750\nThat they don't know about.\n\n336\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.440\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit harder for\n\n337\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.990\npeople that are developing\nweb applications.\n\n338\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.680\nThey need to be sure that\nthey're watching out for this.\n\n339\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.800\nAnd one of the best things they can\ndo it what we call input validation,\n\n340\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.620\nto ensure that they're only allowed\nto put into those search fields\n\n341\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.950\nwhat they really want to put in.\n\n342\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.030\nOr what they want somebody to\nbe able to add in instead and\n\n343\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.370\nnot just anything that they\nwant to type in there.\n\n344\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.350\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying Ronnie is before\nwe go ahead and release a particular form\n\n345\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.870\non a web page, we need to go ahead and\ntest it with input validation to make sure\n\n346\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.440\nthat only the information can\nbe entered into those fields.\n\n347\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.850\nThat well,\nwe really want entered into those fields.\n\n348\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.520\nOtherwise, someone could\nfind an exploit and\n\n349\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.650\ntype in we see integer attacks with\nthese type of input attacks, different\n\n350\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.830\nvariations if we have extra components\nthat really don't need to be there.\n\n351\n00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's no doubt so let's show\nyou an example of what I'm talking about.\n\n352\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.000\nI made a diagram I hope\nthat will help clarify what\n\n353\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.750\nwe normally end up doing here.\n\n354\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.970\nSo let's take a look at this part\nthat's in the white for right now, and\n\n355\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.100\nwe're all going to this\nparticular website right here.\n\n356\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.620\nSo what we do is let's say\nthat we'll take Cherokee and\n\n357\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.750\nshe goes to that website and\nshe realizes that for\n\n358\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.570\nher to get her information, it gives her a\nfield that says please enter your user ID.\n\n359\n00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.310\nWell, then she goes ahead and\nenters her User ID, normally\n\n360\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.570\nin the background because it is connecting\nto a SQL server in the background.\n\n361\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.100\nYou might have this\ngeneric SQL statement that\n\n362\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:51.640\nessentially the web browser allows it to\ngenerate and then run again to database.\n\n363\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.530\nHere's a typical one that you see,\nwhich is right here.\n\n364\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.830\nSo it says select\neverything from the users\n\n365\n00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.300\nwhere the user ID is equal to well 105.\n\n366\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.660\nI probably should have changed that to\n110 so let me go ahead and do that.\n\n367\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.530\nSo I didn't change it so let's do 110.\n\n368\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:14.000\nSo now, what that should do right\nis just return all the records that\n\n369\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.880\nCherokee is looking for that has\nthat user ID of 110 which is great.\n\n370\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.890\nThat's exactly what she wants.\n\n371\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.060\nBut, what an attacker\ncan do at the same time.\n\n372\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.970\nIs that realizing that that\nparticular web form or\n\n373\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.270\nbox that's on that webpage\nallows that to happen.\n\n374\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.420\nWell, notice it gets the same thing.\n\n375\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.100\nAnd now it says, hey,\nattacker enters in 105.\n\n376\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.403\nOr, in this is the entire statement.\n\n377\n00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:45.250\nOne equal one, now what the heck\ncould that actually end up doing?\n\n378\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.370\nAnd that is a question\nthat we need to ask.\n\n379\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.150\nCherokee, do you know what this actually\ndoes for us if we do something like?\n\n380\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.822\nYou don't have to, I'm just trying to-\n&gt;&gt; I don't,\n\n381\n00:20:52.822 --> 00:20:53.850\nI'm looking at that-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n382\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Ratio there.\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n383\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, but\nthat's the key is most of us wouldn't know\n\n384\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.070\n&gt;&gt; But an attacker would, right?\n\n385\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.030\nSo something just like that\nlooks simple enough but\n\n386\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.300\nthey would enter that whole\nthing in there, 105 or 1=1,\n\n387\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.180\nwell look at what the SQL\nstatement now says up at that top.\n\n388\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.610\nSelect star, which normally means\neverything, that's a wildcard,\n\n389\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.790\nfrom the user tables where\nthe user ID Equals 105.\n\n390\n00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.730\nSo it says, return me 105.\n\n391\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.900\nThat's exactly what we said that Cherokee\nwould do with 110, so it returns her 110.\n\n392\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.230\nBut notice, it actually also\nhas this word or in there.\n\n393\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:37.080\nIt doesn't say and,\nwhich means do both, it says either.\n\n394\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.130\nSo by adding in the conjunction in there,\nor,\n\n395\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.870\nit says either 105 or\nanything that is what?\n\n396\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.590\nOne equals one, well that's a statement\nwhich is anything that is true,\n\n397\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.530\nso in another words of saying if\nthis is actually a true statement,\n\n398\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.550\nenter anything or show me everything and\nin theory what that could give as far as\n\n399\n00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.940\nan answer goes what\nthe web servers saying.\n\n400\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.700\nYes show me everything in that table.\n\n401\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.240\nAnd inside that user table\nit could include user ID,\n\n402\n00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.750\ncould include your account number,\nit could include contact information.\n\n403\n00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.490\nYou name it, it can definitely do that.\n\n404\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.430\nSo input validation is definitely\none of the stronger things that we\n\n405\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.100\ndefinitely need to worry about.\n\n406\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.920\nDuring our development process for\nour websites as well, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.870\nWithout this type of validation when\nwe start entering stuff into the search\n\n408\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.920\nfield, this is exactly what it\ncould actually put out there,\n\n409\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.360\njust as a simple example to you.\n\n410\n00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.130\nThat if somebody were able to\nput that in there, it does,\n\n411\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.210\nit just returns to them\neverything that is true,\n\n412\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.650\nin that particular table which is\nall the records that exist there.\n\n413\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.190\nBecause they're saying, look, as long as\nit's a true statement, let's go ahead and\n\n414\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.530\nmake it happen.\n\n415\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.580\nSo that's why you wanna be very careful\nof understanding this type of attack.\n\n416\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.690\nFor us, it's fairly simple.\n\n417\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.750\nYou go to a search, a particular website,\nyou type something like this in and\n\n418\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.870\nnormally what it should tell you is\nthat it should give you an error or\n\n419\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.710\nshould say it's not allowed or\nsyntax error or something like that.\n\n420\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.760\n&gt;&gt; Error and exception handling.\n\n421\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep exception handling but overall\nthough that's what you want to worry.\n\n422\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.480\nNow if it also all of a sudden\nreturns to you something different\n\n423\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.810\nwell now you start to\nrealize at this point,\n\n424\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:22.600\nhere that something else may be wrong and\nthat maybe an attacker at that point,\n\n425\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.710\nwould have the ability to take\nadvantage of something like this.\n\n426\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.050\nSo, very bad type of attack that\nwe have to worry about, but\n\n427\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:34.170\noverall something that can be defeated\nfairly easily with input validation.\n\n428\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.980\nThat means developers go back in and\nmake sure that.\n\n429\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's kind of the problem Ronnie.\n\n430\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.773\nSometimes I know you've been\nin this situation before,\n\n431\n00:23:41.773 --> 00:23:43.522\nit's very common in a workplace.\n\n432\n00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.069\nTo have deadlines, right?\n\n433\n00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:47.519\nAnd if a developer has\na particular deadline, and\n\n434\n00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:49.514\nthey need to move onto the next project.\n\n435\n00:23:49.514 --> 00:23:52.378\nThey might not have been able to test\neverything that they need to and\n\n436\n00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:54.790\nthat's where a lot of\nthese problems come from.\n\n437\n00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.730\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that at one point\nin time we definitely did to have that.\n\n438\n00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.140\nEspecially in a small shop, you'll\ndefinitely have things like that happen.\n\n439\n00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.230\nBut as shops continue to grow, they\nshould put in their particular protocols\n\n440\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.000\nwhere it goes from the development\nto that time of testing, right?\n\n441\n00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.140\nSo they follow like an agile\ntype of methodology\n\n442\n00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.220\nthat allows them to make sure that\nthey go through the entire process.\n\n443\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.500\nThat's not just put out\nthere just to be tested and\n\n444\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.743\ngo, we'll find something-\n&gt;&gt; Fix it later.\n\n445\n00:24:20.743 --> 00:24:22.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll fix it later if\n\n446\n00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.300\nsomething happens here.\n\n447\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.450\nBut we shouldn't see that too often but it\nis something that you stop to worry about.\n\n448\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.690\nSo just remember that this is one\nof the very common types of attacks\n\n449\n00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.280\nthat you're likely to see\nas far as a web server.\n\n450\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.170\nNow another one that's\nvery similar to this,\n\n451\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.530\nis of course what they call some type\nof command injection attack instead.\n\n452\n00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.030\nNow, when we start talking a command\ninjection attack, very similar.\n\n453\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:50.310\nSQL is a form or a subtopic of\na command injection attack, right?\n\n454\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.970\nWe're pretty much taking what\nthey're giving us and saying, hey,\n\n455\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.740\nwhatever commands are run,\njust add in a little bit more and\n\n456\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.300\nsee what that gives us the ability to do.\n\n457\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.980\nWell command injections can work\nvery much so in the same way.\n\n458\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.790\nSo let me kind of give you a for\ninstance here and\n\n459\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.970\nshow you an example of what I mean by\nbringing up my terminal here, okay?\n\n460\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.740\nNow as far as you and I know, right?\n\n461\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.850\nPing is not anything that returns\ntoo much of a value, right?\n\n462\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.900\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and\nping, let's say itpro.tv,\n\n463\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.840\nwell, that gives me some information,\nokay, about what the destination\n\n464\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.840\nas far as his IP address and it gives\nme the ability to ping and that's fine.\n\n465\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.579\nAnd notice here at the end it gives me\na little bit of statistical information.\n\n466\n00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:40.904\nBut you wouldn't think that it would\nreveal any more to you except for,\n\n467\n00:25:40.904 --> 00:25:42.380\nwell, that.\n\n468\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.300\nBut what does it reveal about\nthe person who is pinging?\n\n469\n00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.670\nDoes it reveal anything that you see\nright there on the screen, Cherokee?\n\n470\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.570\nAbout the originator of the ping\nbesides just my name right here.\n\n471\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.650\n&gt;&gt; Well you could, the IP address but that\nis not guaranteed because they could spoof\n\n472\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.670\nthat\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n473\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.800\nit is not even revealing\nmy own IP address.\n\n474\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.820\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n475\n00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.550\nSo yeah.\n\n476\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:05.010\nIt's not really revealing anything\nabout the originator but can it though.\n\n477\n00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.300\nLet's see, if I do a ping and I am\njust gonna do a count of five here, so\n\n478\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.960\nbecause of not in Mac it\nwill go on forever and ever.\n\n479\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.891\nAnd let's say that I ping the same thing,\n192.124.\n\n480\n00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:25.920\nLike that and so it pings and\nit should return the same thing, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.842\nSo if it gets five pings, I get that back.\n\n482\n00:26:27.842 --> 00:26:32.599\nBut can I add in something that will\nallow this to actually be a little bit\n\n483\n00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:33.960\ndifferent?\n\n484\n00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.350\nWhat about put a semi colon here and\nthen also add in the term ID?\n\n485\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.500\nWhen now I'm taking that particular\ncommand and saying, what?\n\n486\n00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.230\nI'm going to attach what another\ncommand at the end of this and\n\n487\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.850\nnow let's take a look at\nthe difference that comes back.\n\n488\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.190\nLooks the same to me right now Cherokee,\neverything looks good.\n\n489\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:57.570\nNow, take a look at the statistics and\nnow we're starting to see a lot more.\n\n490\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.650\nIt not only gave me the regular\nstatistical information\n\n491\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.320\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie Wong.\n\n492\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.670\n&gt;&gt; But now notice,\n\n493\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:09.080\nit actually returned to me some of\nthe things that may be useful to me.\n\n494\n00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Showing me who actually issued the\nping, the group that I'm actually a part\n\n495\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:18.320\nof, and groups, you name it, it gave\nme a bit more to be able to do this.\n\n496\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.090\nNow on my machine, I was kinda limited\ndown, but then I can take that ping,\n\n497\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.340\nand we'll do a count of five again and\n\n498\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.240\nthen we'll add this into a variable,\nis what we'll do.\n\n499\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.741\nInstead.\n\n500\n00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:35.623\nDo something very simple like this,\n\n501\n00:27:35.623 --> 00:27:39.010\nwhere I'm not even pinging my\nIP address anymore, right?\n\n502\n00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:45.580\nNow that I have information about this,\nI could just simply say, hey let me go and\n\n503\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.460\njust ping an ID number, and\nnotice it returned to me the same thing.\n\n504\n00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.730\nBut, I'm just trying to show you at least\nthe beginning steps an attacker might use\n\n505\n00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.250\nto discover more information.\n\n506\n00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.625\nAnd he's not doing anything, but\ntaking advantage of some of the commands,\n\n507\n00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:03.240\nthat are already out there,\n\n508\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.698\nto inject a little bit more information\nto return a little bit more data to you.\n\n509\n00:28:07.698 --> 00:28:11.179\nAnd that's what we wanted to make sure\nof is that you kind of understand that\n\n510\n00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:13.930\na command can be taken\nadvantage of very easily.\n\n511\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.730\nThere are so many commands out there that\nreturn to you so much more information\n\n512\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.880\nthan what we're normally used to make you\ncan't do and you gotta pay attention.\n\n513\n00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.460\nAnd so, that's one of the things that,\nas we start to take a look here,\n\n514\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.220\nit's definitely something that you\nmight not ever have noticed about ping.\n\n515\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.970\nBut it can return to you quite a bit more.\n\n516\n00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.220\nSo, take a note, anytime you\nactually do something like this, and\n\n517\n00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.730\nyou type in something wrong, right.\n\n518\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.831\nSo, let's say I did c-5 instead.\n\n519\n00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:41.553\nLet's see.\n\n520\n00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.545\nMaybe I did it wrong.\n\n521\n00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:43.630\nWhat was I going to do?\n\n522\n00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.919\nI was trying to think of what I\ndid a little bit earlier here.\n\n523\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.020\nThere was something where it gave me an\nerror, and then it, it's not doing it now.\n\n524\n00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.300\nI can't remember what I did.\n\n525\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.640\nI think it might have been C5.\n\n526\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.770\nLet's do that.\nYeah, there we go.\n\n527\n00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.360\nI was trying to figure out what did I\ndo that returned to me all the help.\n\n528\n00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.560\nNotice, it literally can return to you\nmuch more information than you and\n\n529\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.920\nI are thinking.\n\n530\n00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.880\nAnd we just don't think about it\nbecause we don't normally think about\n\n531\n00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.970\nping as being, okay big deal I\njust need to confirm that it's on.\n\n532\n00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.120\nBut notice that it gave me\nsomething else as well.\n\n533\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.920\nIt gives me information\nthat I wouldn't even\n\n534\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.360\nsuspecting that it could return to me and\nthat's why people can take advantages and\n\n535\n00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.640\nif you don't think that the people out\nthere are being able to do this, they are.\n\n536\n00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.050\nThey're taking advantage of stuff\nthat you and I have forgotten,\n\n537\n00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.660\nthat these commands can do, and you're\nlike, how do they do that so easily?\n\n538\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.560\nIt's because it's already built in\nin the utility that's out there.\n\n539\n00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.520\nSo at least at this point,\nrealize that command injections,\n\n540\n00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.730\na form of a command injection,\nis also an SQL injection attack.\n\n541\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.840\nAnd there's many more but I just tried\nto show you two different examples.\n\n542\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.620\nBut we still have to talk a bit about some\nother types of attacks out there, but\n\n543\n00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.087\nI think I've ran out of time.\n\n544\n00:29:52.087 --> 00:29:53.220\n&gt;&gt; We have ran out of time.\n\n545\n00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.520\nBut it is important to be able to\nsee these different switches here,\n\n546\n00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.120\nbecause really knowing where those\ntools are is what's going to\n\n547\n00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.290\nallow these attacks to happen.\n\n548\n00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.400\nAnd knowing which tools to use and\nthen how to prevent them.\n\n549\n00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.870\nAnd it really is all about like you'd\nsaid, that recon or that footprinting,\n\n550\n00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.720\nbecause they're trying to gather as\nmuch information as they can, initially,\n\n551\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.320\nto try to find the vulnerabilities,\nthe weaknesses within your system.\n\n552\n00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.230\nSo, knowing that these different\ntypes of attacks are out there.\n\n553\n00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.050\nBut like Ronnie said,\nwe did run out of time for this show.\n\n554\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.650\nNo worries, guys, we have some great\ninformation headed your way, so\n\n555\n00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.660\nstay tuned for that.\n\n556\n00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.210\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n557\n00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n558\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:34.369\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n559\n00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:40.388\n[MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:43.492\nThank you for

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.664\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:08.438\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:11.844\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals Series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.430\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boost.\n\n8\n00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.880\nThis is actually a part two if\nyou've been following along.\n\n9\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720\nYou'll know in the last episode,\nwe were looking at different web and\n\n10\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.220\napplication attacks.\n\n11\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.750\nWe looked at different types of denial of\nservice, distributed denial of service.\n\n12\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.600\nWe also saw man in the middle, and\n\n13\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.930\nthen Ronnie you explain\nabout SQL injection attacks.\n\n14\n00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.760\nSo thank you for joining us ladies and\ngentleman, and thank you so much for\n\n15\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.270\njoining us today Ronnie Wong.\n\n16\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.060\n&gt;&gt; We'll thank you for having me back\nas continue on to take a look at\n\n17\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.940\nsome of the different types of attacks.\n\n18\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.322\nWhat we had left off with,\nin that first episode,\n\n19\n00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.376\nis the idea of command injection attacks.\n\n20\n00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:54.140\nAnd there are just a couple more I wanted\nto make sure we also threw in there, too.\n\n21\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.610\nTo help round us out on some of\nthe different things we can find.\n\n22\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.970\nRemember that, when it comes down\nto command injection attacks.\n\n23\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.701\nAn SQL injection attack is pretty much\na sub-topic of a command injection\n\n24\n00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.779\nattack as well.\n\n25\n00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.744\nAnd we also showed you where you could\ntake a simple command like ping and\n\n26\n00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:17.173\ndiscover more information than you\nrealize, you've never done that before,\n\n27\n00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:19.240\nto be able to take advantage of that.\n\n28\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.290\nAnd that is another type of injection\nattack by adding in an additional option\n\n29\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.120\nor additional command in there that really\nhelps us out to get more information.\n\n30\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.920\nBut there are a few more and we're just\ngonna go over a couple of them which is,\n\n31\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.930\nof course, what we call an LDAP\ninjection attack as well.\n\n32\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.868\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nwe're not gonna spend too much time in it\n\n33\n00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.940\ncuz they really kind of all\ndo about the same things but\n\n34\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.110\nyou do need to know just a little\nbit of the differences here.\n\n35\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110\nRemember that before using some type\nof light weight directory access.\n\n36\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.610\nMore than likely we'll not\nonly tie it into of course\n\n37\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.600\na database to retrieve information.\n\n38\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.700\nBut also some type of\nauthentication database,\n\n39\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.600\nsome type of management database.\n\n40\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.550\nAnd normally that's gonna\nbe LDAP structured instead.\n\n41\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.900\nWell, when you essentially\nlogin through your web browser,\n\n42\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.050\nwhat you're doing of course\nis your sending a LDAP query.\n\n43\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.730\nSay, hey, this is who I am, and\n\n44\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.820\nmake sure you can authenticate this and\nall the information.\n\n45\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.950\nWell, this is when the attacker\ncan also test that out,\n\n46\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.250\nbe able to add in additional\ncode into their LDAP command.\n\n47\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.462\nAnd if things are not verified or\nvalidated here,\n\n48\n00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:27.061\nwhat can happen of course then has\na couple of different things, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.710\nOne, LDAP don't really work.\n\n50\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.944\nIn LDAP, the types of attacks and\ninjections, you don't really\n\n51\n00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:40.179\nworry too much about the idea here\nof an input validation as much as\n\n52\n00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:46.200\nyou do about the very fact that is\nthe data cleared up properly after input.\n\n53\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.992\nSo on the LDAP side, right,\n\n54\n00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:52.925\nwe don't want stored credentials just to\nbe left there so that that way the next\n\n55\n00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:58.130\nperson that comes in already has some\nbasic information that is left over.\n\n56\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.829\nSo every LDAP created should make\nsure that user data is cleared.\n\n57\n00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.631\nAnd if it's not, then that means that\nthe LDAP injection can take advantage\n\n58\n00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:08.591\nof the previous user's data.\n\n59\n00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.480\nAnd when they now inject in their\nparticular code saying, hey,\n\n60\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.370\nuse whatever was also here and\nnow return to me the information,\n\n61\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.052\nwhat could end up resulting of course\nthen is all of the requested records from\n\n62\n00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:24.660\nthe LDAP directory\nare going to be returned.\n\n63\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.630\nSo that is another possibility.\n\n64\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.080\nNot only do we have an SQL which gets\nus information out of a database but\n\n65\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.670\nnow we might even have, of course,\nthe entire network, as far as users go and\n\n66\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.670\neven resources that\nare authenticating using LDAP.\n\n67\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.530\nAnother possibility, of course, is just\na simple directory traversal attack.\n\n68\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.200\nLet me see if I can move\nthis whole thing over,\n\n69\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.840\nso that we can see it a little bit better.\n\n70\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.740\nIn this particular instance,\nit's simple right,\n\n71\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.720\na directory tree reversal attack really\ndoes try to take advantage of the very\n\n72\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.560\nfact that nobody has checked what's\nentered into the browser itself.\n\n73\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.110\nSo it might be the very first\ntime that they get logged in that\n\n74\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.220\nthey go to mysite.com and\nwhat they get returned to them,\n\n75\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.720\nof course, is information that\nlooks like line number two.\n\n76\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.330\nNow once they get that information,\n\n77\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.200\nthey might start to notice something that\nthey know exactly where display.2 is,\n\n78\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.390\nwhich is normally in the root\nis probably what they see.\n\n79\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.140\nBut they might then be able to manipulate\nthat by adding in a bunch of these here,\n\n80\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.046\nokay, which is the period and\nthe forward slash mark.\n\n81\n00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:39.240\nWell that actually means\nmove up directory tree.\n\n82\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.650\nIn other words, don't stay right here but\ngo ahead and pass me up to directory tree\n\n83\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.790\nuntil you get to, let's say,\nsomething like password.doc.\n\n84\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.830\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of our Linux based systems\nit's kind of strange if you think that\n\n85\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.390\nthe root is at the top of the tree.\n\n86\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.410\nSo, when you say move up the directory\ntree what are we essentially\n\n87\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.480\ntrying to do here Ronnie?\n\n88\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.820\nYeah you're trying to gain access to\nsomething you're not supposed to,\n\n89\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.850\nthat's what it really comes down into.\n\n90\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.740\nYou're navigating throughout the actual\nstructure itself, instead of only limiting\n\n91\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.470\nyourself to that one directive where\nmost websites should normally be.\n\n92\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.945\nSo in that instance right,\nwe don't want to expose the entire server.\n\n93\n00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:18.660\nWe normally turn on a web\nserver of some sort and\n\n94\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.120\nwe only give them access to so much.\n\n95\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.090\nBut it could be that where we have not\nactually checked the information and\n\n96\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.920\nnow somebody adds in\nan extra line of coding,\n\n97\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480\nit now gives them access maybe even\nto whatever your password is or\n\n98\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.220\nyour PASSWD is gonna be when\nyou start to take a look.\n\n99\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.410\nSo that's something that we really\nneed to also pay attention to when\n\n100\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.720\nit comes down to that idea of\nsome type of command injection.\n\n101\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.860\nIt's all taking advantage of\nthe commands that are there and\n\n102\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.520\nthat are available to us.\n\n103\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.070\nBut that's not the only type of attacks\nthat we have to worry about as well, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.970\nThe other ones are a little more ethereal\nif you haven't dealt with them before,\n\n105\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.810\nand that is what we call some type of\ncross-site scripting attack instead.\n\n106\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.700\nNow when it comes down to cross-site\nscripting types of attacks,\n\n107\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.870\nthis essentially exploits some\nvulnerability in the website,\n\n108\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.350\nin few different fashions here.\n\n109\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.750\nAnd to differentiate them is probably not\nsuper important, but we wanna make sure\n\n110\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.940\nyou understand a few of them that end\nup happening here, is what we wanna do.\n\n111\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.440\nA lot of times, what can happen\nof course is that an attacker\n\n112\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.990\nadds in malicious code to the website and\nthen you download it.\n\n113\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.890\nAnd then you run it, and that gives you\naccess to, or then gives them access to\n\n114\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.910\nmore information than what you wanted them\nto have access to that as the attacker.\n\n115\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.840\nSometimes it begins with you\ninitiating the request and\n\n116\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.290\nthen the attacker pretty much\nsending you the attack directly and\n\n117\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.300\nthen of course you exposing more\nthan you thought should be exposed.\n\n118\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.220\nAnd lastly, we can even talk about\nsomething that we call a forward request\n\n119\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.260\nas well and we'll see all of these in an\nexample of what we want to do here, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.980\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.280\ntake a look at a couple of them\nright off the bat here, okay.\n\n122\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.260\nSo one of them is what we\ncall a persistent attack, or\n\n123\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.040\nthe idea of a persistent cross site or\n\n124\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.720\na stored cross site attack is\nwhat you actually end up seeing.\n\n125\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.860\nNow the key here to understanding the\ndifference is where does the attack begin.\n\n126\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.040\nAnd I'm trying to highlight that for\nus right here.\n\n127\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.630\nSo here's the process,\nI have it in about seven steps here, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.915\nSo notice that at the very beginning the\nattacker essentially goes to the website,\n\n129\n00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.370\nokay, and he goes in and\n\n130\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.630\nsends a question with the JavaScript\nthat he wants to manipulate.\n\n131\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.660\nAt that particular point a regular\nuser just logs in to that machine.\n\n132\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.470\nAnd now,\nwhatever question that the user was posed,\n\n133\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.980\nhe now reads that particular question,\nA as well.\n\n134\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.408\nAnd when he decides to read that question\nclicking on the answer, whatever it is.\n\n135\n00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:58.829\nThe server then,\nsends that stored JavaScript\n\n136\n00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:03.040\nback to the originator here, okay.\n\n137\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.420\nSo back to the client.\n\n138\n00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.069\nWell, once the client has now downloaded\nthat JavaScript, the attackers\n\n139\n00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:15.300\nJavaScript now is run inside of\nthe users browser as well, okay.\n\n140\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.870\nSo at this point right, so\n\n141\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.860\nnotice that when user logged\non it also ended up sending\n\n142\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.140\nthat special URL that gives him access to\nthat question, I forgot about that point.\n\n143\n00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.080\nBut overall though, once he get's here,\nthe attacker essentially is going to\n\n144\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.830\nrequest this session token,\nis what the attacker is gonna do, and\n\n145\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.850\nthat is going to be sent\ndirectly to the attacker.\n\n146\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.867\nThat session token, they pretty much\ncan take over the entire session, and\n\n147\n00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:42.446\nnow you don't even know if you're\nreally connected here anymore or\n\n148\n00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.480\nare you connected to something else?\n\n149\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.393\nThe other one, that is pretty common,\n\n150\n00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:53.210\nis what we call the idea of the cross\nsite reflected type of attack.\n\n151\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.257\nThis one begins with the user's logon,\nokay.\n\n152\n00:08:56.257 --> 00:09:01.185\nWhen the user logs on that is when\nthe attacker knows that he's gonna\n\n153\n00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:05.163\nsend a specially crafted type\nof URL to the attacker and\n\n154\n00:09:05.163 --> 00:09:09.240\nthen it says that the user\nends up requesting that.\n\n155\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.960\nHe doesnt' know it,during the log on here,\nwhen he gets there, this particular\n\n156\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.260\nattacker is watching and essentially\nsends him a specially crafted URL.\n\n157\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.300\nAnd then the attacker,\nat that point, sends it.\n\n158\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.850\nSo the storm is when\nthe attacker initiates\n\n159\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.110\nit by storing the information first.\n\n160\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.130\nWhereas the reflected one\nbegins with your request.\n\n161\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.030\nAnd that starts the process\nof the attack but\n\n162\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.130\nthe rest of it is pretty\nmuch the same here.\n\n163\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.061\nThe attacker's JavaScript\ngets on to the machine and\n\n164\n00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.851\nthen we end up sending our session\ninformation back to the attacker.\n\n165\n00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:45.990\nSo both of these really give the attacker,\nright,\n\n166\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.589\nmore information than they need and\neven very good quality information for\n\n167\n00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:54.740\nthe type of attack that they\nreally want to carry out here.\n\n168\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.895\nUsually it's gonna be of course\ngetting some more information then,\n\n169\n00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:01.260\nthan you realize what you're giving them.\n\n170\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.520\n&gt;&gt; So I could only imagine that\nkeeping my browser up to date,\n\n171\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.330\nwould be a great way to prevent\nagainst these types of attacks.\n\n172\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.510\nDo you have any other types of tips or\ntricks that might help me here?\n\n173\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, a lot this, right,\n\n174\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.750\ncomes down to the idea of your\nbrowser is kind of the key, right.\n\n175\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.420\nWhat does it accept, what doesn't it do?\n\n176\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.590\nBut it's to not go to websites\nyou shouldn't be going to,\n\n177\n00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.410\nI mean it really is key here.\n\n178\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.050\nNot downloading stuff that\nyou really don't trust,\n\n179\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.490\nbeing careful especially on sites that\nyou do download information from.\n\n180\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.510\nYou kind of have to hunt around for that\nparticular download link, and it does,\n\n181\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.370\nI recommend you should close it out and\nnot try and get it anyways.\n\n182\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.870\nCuz if it tricks you and you accidentally\nget one, that's how it can start and\n\n183\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.640\nthat's where the problem comes into, okay.\n\n184\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.940\nNow ultimately a lot of times, the goal\nof course is a little bit different,\n\n185\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.170\nlet me show you here too, okay.\n\n186\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.740\nSo here it could be something a little\nbit more different in this way.\n\n187\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.670\nSo they use the idea of cross-site\nscripting, of course, to\n\n188\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.460\nlaunch an attack in multiple ways but here\nis one that we call a forgery request.\n\n189\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.790\nThis one, the client,\n\n190\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.880\nlogs into his own bank to transfer\nfunds from the bank itself.\n\n191\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.360\nNow, while that user is logged in,\nlet's say that what he does is he opens up\n\n192\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.650\nanother tab on his browser which is\ncompromised at some point, right?\n\n193\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.490\nSo without logging out of the bank,\nthe user visits another site and on that\n\n194\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.460\nsite it has a form that says, hey you have\na chance to win $1,000 or $100 here, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.650\nGo ahead and click once here.\n\n196\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.759\n&gt;&gt; Yohoo.\n\n197\n00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Now because you're already\nlogged on through here, right?\n\n198\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.920\nSo you're ready doing this,\n\n199\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.780\nwhat this is gonna do is initiate\na some type of an attack that\n\n200\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.940\nallows them to take advantage of\nthe connection that is up here, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.640\nSo here step three, it says transfer\nmoneys to the attacker's account.\n\n202\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.880\nBecause of cookies associated with the\nbank are also transferred to the attacker\n\n203\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.076\nhere at the same time.\n\n204\n00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:54.728\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I love your URL.\n\n205\n00:11:54.728 --> 00:11:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; www.evilwebsite.com [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah something like that, yeah.\n\n207\n00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it was just, but\n\n208\n00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:00.730\nthat's the key, right?\n\n209\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.447\nIs that this type of attack can go\non without you even thinking about.\n\n210\n00:12:05.447 --> 00:12:08.920\nSo you wanna be very careful\nabout what you are connecting to.\n\n211\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.330\nAt the same time you're doing things\nlike banking and information like that.\n\n212\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.690\nYou wanna make sure that you're not\nconnecting all over the planet at\n\n213\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.930\nthe same time.\n\n214\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.610\nAs you're doing this because\nthese browsers today,\n\n215\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.980\nmost of them are fairly secured\nwhich is great, okay, but\n\n216\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.130\nyou need to run the latest\nbrowser that you possibly can.\n\n217\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.457\nIf you're still trying to run\nthe browser ten from whatever-\n\n218\n00:12:30.457 --> 00:12:32.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Netscape.\n\n219\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean, for example-\n&gt;&gt; I know it's tricky.\n\n220\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.495\n&gt;&gt; Google is up to 50,\nversion 50 now, whatever it is, and\n\n221\n00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:41.300\nyou're still trying to run version 10,\nprior a little bit behind the times, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.430\nIf we're running Java in the background\nof everything that you're doing,\n\n223\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.930\nyou've gotta realize that you know, hey,\nthat may not be a good thing for you.\n\n224\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.860\nBut kinda realize all these, right,\nas essentially different types of\n\n225\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.760\nweb attacks that you generally end up\nseeing happening over and over again too.\n\n226\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.240\nSo it's very clear that we must protect\nourselves against something like this.\n\n227\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.430\nBut overall whether they're actually\npersistent types of attacks or\n\n228\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.690\nreflected attacks.\n\n229\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:13.410\nThere's even one that's called a DOM,\nD-O-M based type of cross-site scripting\n\n230\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.510\nwhich takes advantage of the people\nthat don't update their browsers, okay.\n\n231\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.530\nThose are all different types of\ncross-site scripting attacks that\n\n232\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.170\nwe should always be aware of\nas we start to take a look\n\n233\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.390\nat some of the different\nattacks that go on.\n\n234\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.880\nMost of the times inside\nof a corporate environment,\n\n235\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.870\nyou're not going to have to\nworry too much about this\n\n236\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.820\nunless people are socially engineered and\nthey are all the time.\n\n237\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.370\nSo yes, it means you have to.\n\n238\n00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.722\nBut most of the time as far as software\ngoes, you're probably pushing out,\n\n239\n00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.207\nsoftware updates.\n\n240\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.092\nYou're probably the one\nin control of dating.\n\n241\n00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:50.163\nYou're probably the one in control\nof monitoring the traffic.\n\n242\n00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.640\nBut you might not be in\ncontrol of the person going,\n\n243\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.660\nI have a chance to win $100,\nlet me click on that link.\n\n244\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.020\nAnd that’s where you have\nto worry more and more.\n\n245\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.775\nSo, yeah, even though all of these\ndifferent types of attacks are technical\n\n246\n00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:07.238\nattacks, sometimes they do begin with\nthe idea of social engineering or\n\n247\n00:14:07.238 --> 00:14:10.988\na phishing type of attack that\nmay begin with a human person.\n\n248\n00:14:10.988 --> 00:14:14.300\nSo training is pretty much\nthe key here as well.\n\n249\n00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.570\nSo, all of these types of attacks,\nwe should be fairly familiar and\n\n250\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.990\ncomfortable with them.\n\n251\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.450\nBefore we head into the exam, so\nthat we can identify them fairly easily.\n\n252\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\nnow that you've scared us to death here,\n\n253\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.680\nI think we're able to move\non to the next topic.\n\n254\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.800\nBut just joking, like he said,\n\n255\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.150\nit is really important to number one,\ntrain your end users.\n\n256\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.880\nNumber two, remain offensive.\n\n257\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.880\nLet's not be reactive,\nlet's be proactive with our security and\n\n258\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.600\napply defense in depth here.\n\n259\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.860\nSo thank you so much for joining us\ntoday Ronnie, and thank you ladies and\n\n260\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.805\ngentleman for tuning in today, but\nstay tuned we do have some more Cisco\n\n261\n00:14:47.805 --> 00:14:50.660\ncybersecurity fundamentals\nheaded your way for this show.\n\n262\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.800\nRemember, I'm

00:00:08.025\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n\n5\n00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.410\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.060\nIn this episode we'll be describing\nattacks and invasion methods.\n\n8\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.580\nWith us today in studio\nwe have Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.100\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.350\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.840\nAs we continue on to take a look at more\nof the Cisco cyber security fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.410\nToday we're specifically gonna talk\nabout some of the different attacks.\n\n13\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.910\nWe've already mentioned some\nof them throughout our series,\n\n14\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.350\nthis is more of a review than anything\nelse but we wanna make sure, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.252\nthat we have a good understanding of them.\n\n16\n00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:46.270\nAnd Rosley talk about the idea\nof evasion methods as well.\n\n17\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.320\nSo attacks, of course, come in many\ndifferent forms and factors and\n\n18\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.660\nthat means a cybersecurity professional,\n\n19\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.840\nat least beginning your career you have\nto have a good understanding of them and\n\n20\n00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.620\nthen we're going to talk a little\nbit about the idea of evasion.\n\n21\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.730\nWhich is a little bit different, in\nthis very sense that most of the attacks\n\n22\n00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.160\nthat come, we can identify them and\nwe're used to being able to try and\n\n23\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.870\ngo I know what happened here but\n\n24\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.010\nevasion techniques they're designed\nto well really get out of the scam.\n\n25\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.820\nIn other words, be outside of the scan\nof what we're normally used to\n\n26\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.410\ntaking a look at.\n\n27\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.350\nAnd that means we have to think\na little bit more out of the box when\n\n28\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.570\nwe start talking about\nthese different techniques.\n\n29\n00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.220\nSo that we can also identify them as well.\n\n30\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.790\nSo that is kind of what our\nshow going to be about,\n\n31\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030\nis taking those two different categories.\n\n32\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.030\nBut just making sure that\nwe have a solid foundation.\n\n33\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.010\nAnd we'll kinda name a few examples.\n\n34\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.670\nAs we continue to go through it as well,\nokay?\n\n35\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.485\nSo, let's start off with the idea\nof what we call a buffer overflow.\n\n36\n00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:42.900\nCherokee, you heard about\nbuffer overflow attack before?\n\n37\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.490\n&gt;&gt; I have.\nBuffer overflows are,\n\n38\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.310\nthey are kind of a difficult attack where\nI should say a higher skills set, but\n\n39\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.660\nthey are a.\n\n40\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.370\nThey're pretty promising from an attackers\nstandpoint, just depending on how that\n\n41\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.780\nmachine is able to handle the particular\ncoding that is thrown at it.\n\n42\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.610\nAnd a lot of times we do see success\nwith those types of attacks.\n\n43\n00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.510\n&gt;&gt; You really do, they're kind\nof the basis of just about every\n\n44\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.760\nother attacks that we have out there.\n\n45\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.360\nAnd that is because it really does\ngive the attacker a little bit\n\n46\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.940\nof skill set that they need to\nunderstand how to form the attack.\n\n47\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.030\nBut it also lets them get a little bit\nmore involved with the operating system\n\n48\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.340\nand the way that it manages the memories,\nso it really teaches them a lot of\n\n49\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.720\ntechniques by learning how to\ndo a buffer overflow attack.\n\n50\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.210\nIt gives them solid you know\nfoundational coding skills\n\n51\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.450\nthat they may need to take advantage of\nthe way that the system ends up working.\n\n52\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.750\nSo when we start taking we\ngot buffer overflow attacks,\n\n53\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.240\nthere can be many different types\nof buffer overflow attacks.\n\n54\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.530\nSome that really do attack the coding\nitself but a lot of times its the idea\n\n55\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.770\nhere of attacking the memory\nthat runs on a machine.\n\n56\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.070\nAnd when I say attacking the coding, what\nI'm saying is that they take advantage of\n\n57\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.480\ncoding that's already there\nto try an implement more,\n\n58\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.990\nand to try and implement\nsomething different that can cause\n\n59\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.240\nsome of the same issues that\nregular buffer overflow attacks go.\n\n60\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.300\nSo, to use an analogy of how a buffer\noverflow attack ends up working,\n\n61\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.680\nthink about, of course, having\na glass of water on a desk somewhere.\n\n62\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.650\nAnd the idea of the buffer overflow is\nsimple is that that particular glass of\n\n63\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.410\nwater can only hold so much before if\nyou continue to pour water into it,\n\n64\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.360\nit's gonna spill over the side and\n\n65\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.460\nthen out on the table where we do\nnot want the water to go, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.890\nNow I don't know about you, Cherokee,\nbut if I'm gonna drink water,\n\n67\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.440\nI want it out of the cup I don't\nwant to drink in from the table.\n\n68\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.420\nWhat do you think?\n\n69\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't wanna play a game with my straw,\n\n70\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.186\nand ruining my electronics, and you know.\n\n71\n00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:36.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that's a little bit more\n\n72\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.450\nharsh, right?\n\n73\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.800\nTo think about it, that's just\nkind of a harsh, I hate to say it,\n\n74\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.490\na little gross analogy, at the same time\ntrying to drink water off the table.\n\n75\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.190\nBut overall though,\n\n76\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.630\nit really does bring us the theory\nof what we're trying to get at.\n\n77\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.450\nA buffer overflow attack whether\nwe're talking about something super\n\n78\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.550\ntechnical like the idea of\nthe integer overflow or\n\n79\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.380\nwhether we're talking about some other\ntype of attack in which we're just\n\n80\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.890\nsaying we're gonna consume more resources\nthan what we're allowed to do, and\n\n81\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.180\nthat resource is generally of course,\nmemory inside of our computer systems.\n\n82\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.430\nSo take for an example then,\n\n83\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.610\nyou have an application that is\ngoing to run on your computer.\n\n84\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.660\nWell, where does the application run?\n\n85\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.000\nIt runs inside of RAM.\n\n86\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.640\nAnd the good thing is,\nregardless of whether you\n\n87\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.310\nhave 8 gigs of RAM on your computer,\n4 gigs of RAM, 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n88\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.250\nA single application doesn't sit there and\ngo, all right Ronnie,\n\n89\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.410\nI see that you have 8 gigs\nof RAM on your computer.\n\n90\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.000\nI'm gonna use all 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n91\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.120\nThe reason why that's actually good\nis because at some point, right,\n\n92\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.990\nI may choose to run another\napplication and that one app,\n\n93\n00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.880\ncuz just I'm using all that gigs,\ncuz I need to run, now,\n\n94\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.550\nit doesn't have any ability to run cuz\nit's saying, yeah, I don't have anymore\n\n95\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.500\nRAM left to give you cuz it all take\nenough, so it allocates, essentially, and\n\n96\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.310\namount fo memory that we have available\nto us for that application to run.\n\n97\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.840\nSo if a particular application says,\nthis is how much memory I need,\n\n98\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.870\nlet's just theoretically give it 256 megs,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n99\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.129\nAnd now, that application begins\nrunning some bad coding in it.\n\n100\n00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.469\nNow, says, I think I need an additional 16\nmegs, or I think I need an additional 3,\n\n101\n00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.010\n2 megs, or an additional 256 megs,\nwell what happens then?\n\n102\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.660\nSame thing that happens\nwith a glass of water.\n\n103\n00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.190\nWhat we mean is that then it says look,\nyou say I have 256,\n\n104\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.450\nbut I know that you have more Ronnie.\n\n105\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.470\nI know that there's more\nmemory on your system, so\n\n106\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.400\nwhat am I gonna do with the extra 256 or\nwhatever it requests?\n\n107\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.200\nIt's gonna write it into\nthe adjacent areas of that memory.\n\n108\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.680\nNow you might be wondering,\nwell why is that bad?\n\n109\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.640\nWell there may be other things that\nare running in that adjacent memory area,\n\n110\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.660\nthere may be information that's stored\nthere, it's not designed to run or\n\n111\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.210\nanything, but stored there.\n\n112\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.050\nBut if you take that up that means\nyou're pushing the other stuff out.\n\n113\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.160\nWhich could cause a crash on the computer,\nwhich could actually\n\n114\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.720\nbe overriding something that\nI don't want it to override.\n\n115\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.000\nOr it could even open up the area for\nan attack to happen.\n\n116\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.790\nIf I now continue to send code and\n\n117\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.520\ngo this 256 is already taken up,\nthe glass of water that I have,\n\n118\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.370\nit says let's just write the code over\nhere in the adjacent memory area.\n\n119\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.350\nAnd let's run it from there.\n\n120\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.640\nSo, this is why these types of buffer\noverflow attacks are very successful\n\n121\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.200\nbecause they can crash\nthe machine very quickly or\n\n122\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.820\nthey can allow an attack to occur and it's\njust part of the normal functioning of\n\n123\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.070\nthe way that we handle buffer\noverflows that is taken advantage of.\n\n124\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.880\nSo, there are a lot different\nattacks that really.\n\n125\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.550\nThis is one the ones\nthat's more complicated if\n\n126\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.170\nyou're coding this type of attack, because\nyou do have multiple options out there.\n\n127\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.070\nOne of the harder options is\nthat idea that integer overflow.\n\n128\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.120\nSays, let's change this number,\nand let's do this instead.\n\n129\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.180\nIt's perfectly fine, but\nthe overall concept though is relatively\n\n130\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.480\neasy to understand when\nyou start seeing it.\n\n131\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.820\nAnd you've probably seen this before.\n\n132\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.810\nEven in just regular operations of things.\n\n133\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.070\nWhen things end up slowing down.\n\n134\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.820\nOr you might, where I normally\nuse to see this a lot of times\n\n135\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.970\nis by burning something onto a CD or DVD.\n\n136\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.480\nYou get buffer overflows or\nbuffer overruns a lot of times.\n\n137\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.220\nThere's a saying,\nyou're sending too much information.\n\n138\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.150\nLet me not do anything with that.\n\n139\n00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.940\nSo, there are controls that\nare in place to help us out.\n\n140\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.450\nBut if not it means it still\nhas to write it somewhere and\n\n141\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.090\nthat could cause issues later on, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.140\nSo, that's at least one form\nof attack that we have.\n\n143\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.940\nCherokee, what else do we\nneed to take a look at here?\n\n144\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, the next thing we need to take\na look at is command and control or\n\n145\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.080\nsometimes abbreviated\nas C2 types of attacks.\n\n146\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when we start\ntalking about the command and\n\n147\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.800\ncontrol the great thing is the name,\nI think, gives it away, right?\n\n148\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.969\nSo Cherokee, command and control,\nwhat do you think happens here?\n\n149\n00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:47.205\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you want to know what I\nthink because I have these little ideas in\n\n150\n00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:51.310\nmy head and you might tell me to go grab\nmy tinfoil cap here, but I really think\n\n151\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.382\nthat these types of attacks are pretty\nscary in the grand scheme of things.\n\n152\n00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:59.641\nI mean If you just look at the way that\nwe may even engage in war these days and\n\n153\n00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:03.560\nwe're talking about controlling\ndifferent systems, it's not so\n\n154\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.741\nbad if we're just looking at\na single end user system.\n\n155\n00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:11.616\nBut if we're talking about large systems,\nsuch as our transportation industries and\n\n156\n00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.229\nthings like that, electrical grid systems.\n\n157\n00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:18.930\nI mean, they've even found logic bombs\nthat residual components of that coding.\n\n158\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.538\nThat have kind of been\nleft there as little,\n\n159\n00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:25.343\nI guess warnings depending on\nthings that have been happening,\n\n160\n00:08:25.343 --> 00:08:28.594\npolitical events in the news\nat that particular time.\n\n161\n00:08:28.594 --> 00:08:31.616\nSo I mean, it can happen on a small scale.\n\n162\n00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:34.831\nBut really, it could be pretty\nserious if you think about it.\n\n163\n00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:39.286\n&gt;&gt; You're right, the terminology really\ndoes come from some type of idea\n\n164\n00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:44.275\nof a battle that goes on, command and\ncontrol warfare, it seems to take place.\n\n165\n00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:48.964\nSo it's not that you can't definitely go\nto that place, because the scalability of\n\n166\n00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:53.058\nthis does ramp up to the point that\nCherokee is talking about where it can go\n\n167\n00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:56.359\nfrom just taking over a single system and\nhaving command and\n\n168\n00:08:56.359 --> 00:09:01.048\ncontrol over that they're being able to\ntake over, well, entire systems and maybe\n\n169\n00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:05.379\neven start war games as you start to take\na look at those types of systems here.\n\n170\n00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:10.204\nBut it is something that we have to\nunderstand that today, it's not enough\n\n171\n00:09:10.204 --> 00:09:15.271\nanymore for an attacker to just say,\nI got a virus onto this many systems.\n\n172\n00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:19.177\nDon't get me wrong, it's still for\nthem good praise that they can get out\n\n173\n00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:21.769\nof this and\nthey might be able to run some things.\n\n174\n00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.092\nBut the goal, of course,\nultimately, especially\n\n175\n00:09:25.092 --> 00:09:30.076\nif they a motivation of some type of cash\nreward, some type of payment system or\n\n176\n00:09:30.076 --> 00:09:33.852\nthey're gonna get paid off in\ncertain political capital,\n\n177\n00:09:33.852 --> 00:09:38.252\nwhatever it might be is that they\nwant to gain command of that system.\n\n178\n00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:39.181\nAnd of course,\n\n179\n00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:43.619\ncontrol that system to produce whatever\nit is that they want that happen.\n\n180\n00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:48.386\nNow, the funny thing about this is that\nas much as you start watching movies and\n\n181\n00:09:48.386 --> 00:09:50.121\nyou start seeing command and\n\n182\n00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:55.416\ncontrol takes a ton of effort to literally\ntake over somebody's just initial castle.\n\n183\n00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:57.723\nBetter yet, do anything else and\nthen to have control and\n\n184\n00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:01.210\nyou always see where somebody ends up\nstabbing that king in the back, anyways.\n\n185\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.244\nBut in the computing world,\nit doesn't take that much effort.\n\n186\n00:10:04.244 --> 00:10:06.592\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout here on my screen.\n\n187\n00:10:06.592 --> 00:10:11.245\nSo right here on my screen,\nI just did a simple diagram that I hope\n\n188\n00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:15.999\nreally helps us out in the long\nrun to understand what can happen.\n\n189\n00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:20.321\nWe've already done an attack\nlike this in a previous episode.\n\n190\n00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:26.063\nI'm trying make sure when we did\nthe episode on the next generation IPS.\n\n191\n00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:31.308\nWe did an attack like this where we were\nshowing or it may actually even be further\n\n192\n00:10:31.308 --> 00:10:36.501\nback in that, where we're taking a look\nat the firepower management center.\n\n193\n00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:37.051\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n194\n00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:37.932\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, I was trying to think.\n\n195\n00:10:37.932 --> 00:10:39.952\nI think the IPS show I mentioned it.\n\n196\n00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:44.860\nBut overall, it was the firepower\nmanagement center that we were taking\n\n197\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.007\na look at where we did\nthis type of attack here.\n\n198\n00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:51.696\nIn this command and control attack,\nespecially for a single system and\n\n199\n00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:53.918\nyou might be wondering why does this help?\n\n200\n00:10:53.918 --> 00:10:58.184\nThis can be any system inside\nof your protected network.\n\n201\n00:10:58.184 --> 00:11:01.481\nSo, remember what we mean by\nthe protected network and that's key.\n\n202\n00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.872\nThat's anything that you really have\ncommand and control over as far as\n\n203\n00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:09.014\nsecurity, you know who's logging in, you\nknow what applications are running on it.\n\n204\n00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:12.719\nYou essentially know the components of\nthat particular computer system that's\n\n205\n00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:16.640\nrunning inside your network and then maybe\nunder your own active directory control,\n\n206\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.290\neverything that you have in place.\n\n207\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.604\nSo now that we have one of those, we have\nan attacker that pretty much doesn't have\n\n208\n00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:28.509\nany command or control over your\nsystems that makes sense as well.\n\n209\n00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:31.374\nEven the attacker is on\nthe other side of the firewall,\n\n210\n00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:34.068\nhe shouldn't have any\ncontrol over your systems.\n\n211\n00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:37.150\nYou're the one that should have\ncontrol over your systems.\n\n212\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.585\nSo what happens is that\nwhatever end user this maybe,\n\n213\n00:11:41.585 --> 00:11:45.510\nthat particular end user may\nend up getting an email and\n\n214\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.620\nthat was the demonstration that we saw,\nwas an email saying you need to run\n\n215\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.910\nthis security scan on your computer,\nbecause it found some flaw.\n\n216\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.976\nSo, it could be something\njust as simple as that.\n\n217\n00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.481\nWhen we start to talk about that,\nthat's what we have to ask you think that.\n\n218\n00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:03.160\nIt's a very simple type of\nattack at the beginning.\n\n219\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.128\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\nyou're being a little nice here.\n\n220\n00:12:05.128 --> 00:12:09.317\nAnd in you're diagram, you're making it\nseems as if that end user making it naive.\n\n221\n00:12:09.317 --> 00:12:13.445\nIt was just an accident, but\nthe truth of the matter is and here,\n\n222\n00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:17.274\nI go with a paranoia again,\nit could be like a double agent.\n\n223\n00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:19.819\nIt could be a mole within your company and\nremember that.\n\n224\n00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:21.313\nOnce they get behind that firewall,\n\n225\n00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:23.344\nyou always have to you know\nthink about that also.\n\n226\n00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be a malicious insider.\n\n227\n00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:30.311\nThat's very much true, as somebody\ncould be on the inside literally\n\n228\n00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:36.820\nwaiting to run some type of software\ninside to make that compromise happen.\n\n229\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.706\nNow here in my example, let's say that\nthey go and they click on that link and\n\n230\n00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:42.422\nit leads them to a download site.\n\n231\n00:12:42.422 --> 00:12:46.683\nSo they go ahead and they download this\nparticular malware on to their computer\n\n232\n00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:51.150\nand they go, okay, it says, there's some\ntype of scan that I'm supposed to do.\n\n233\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.050\nOf course,\nI'm gonna run that particular malware.\n\n234\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.974\nAnd when they do so, the nature of it\nis that it doesn't reveal anything\n\n235\n00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:01.696\nto the end user that is doing anything.\n\n236\n00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:05.289\nMore than likely, it just looks like\nthey ran something and nothing happened.\n\n237\n00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:07.955\nSo most of the time,\nif the end user is unsuspecting,\n\n238\n00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.867\nhe probably does what most people do.\n\n239\n00:13:09.867 --> 00:13:12.898\nJust click on it again and\nclick on it again, and click on it again.\n\n240\n00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:13.526\n&gt;&gt; What's happening?\n\n241\n00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.481\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's nothing happening.\n\n242\n00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:17.940\nBut if you were to open\nup there task manager,\n\n243\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.213\nyou might see that it was running two,\nthree, four times in the background and\n\n244\n00:13:22.213 --> 00:13:25.549\nis just sitting there now and\nwhat is it sitting there doing?\n\n245\n00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:28.100\nThat's the key that we have to ask it.\n\n246\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.918\nSo when we start to take a look,\nthat's what we want to be able to do.\n\n247\n00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:33.858\n&gt;&gt; Well, of course,\nthey're trying to remain low key and\n\n248\n00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:35.690\nthey don't really wanna\ncause too much attention.\n\n249\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.924\nThat could initiate some sort of\nstopping in between that attack.\n\n250\n00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:43.930\nSo sometimes, you might just notice\nthat your system is running sluggish or\n\n251\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.068\nslow without any other sort of symptom.\n\n252\n00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:48.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nyou can get symptomatic here,\n\n253\n00:13:48.822 --> 00:13:52.830\nespecially if you run it like ten times in\na row and it eats up a lot of your RAM.\n\n254\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.596\nBut what can happen is that in the\nbackground, what is happening is that it\n\n255\n00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:59.816\nreally did run this particular malware,\nbut I call it hidden,\n\n256\n00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:03.496\nbecause much people don't pay attention\nto the names of these things.\n\n257\n00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:08.158\nYou don't know what's going on, but it's\nturning on a service is what it's doing.\n\n258\n00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:13.207\nAnd now, it's gonna listen for an active\nconnection trying to be made to it.\n\n259\n00:14:13.207 --> 00:14:18.226\nWell, the attacker at that point then can\nnow go ahead and say, look, I need to\n\n260\n00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:23.805\ntry and send a message to everybody that's\nrunning this software and then it's here.\n\n261\n00:14:23.805 --> 00:14:26.089\nBecause he's actually now saying,\n\n262\n00:14:26.089 --> 00:14:30.288\nI'm gonna listen now through my\nentire network and outside of it and\n\n263\n00:14:30.288 --> 00:14:34.800\nmaybe even opening up a connection\nthrough your firewall to do so.\n\n264\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.080\nSay, look, I'm sending traffic out\nhere saying, I have this system and\n\n265\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.370\nI might just be broadcasting it\nout there or it might actually\n\n266\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.150\nhave inside that software that says,\nI'm going to send it to this IP address.\n\n267\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.800\nAnd now this guy goes yeah, let me go\nahead and make that connection back.\n\n268\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.321\nAnd when it does so and\nnow makes a connection and\n\n269\n00:14:53.321 --> 00:14:56.403\nit gives the attacker both the command and\n\n270\n00:14:56.403 --> 00:15:01.424\ncontrol of that system inside of\nour fire power management center,\n\n271\n00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:06.532\nwe showed you in that console opening\nwhere it said, this particular\n\n272\n00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:12.465\nhost may not be under your control or may\nbe under the control of another system.\n\n273\n00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:17.191\nSo that way, you do have things that\nare in place there that kind of let you\n\n274\n00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:22.153\nknow that hey, we're watching and\nwe are actually noticing something that\n\n275\n00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:26.132\nthis computer may go ahead and\nbe compromised at that point.\n\n276\n00:15:26.132 --> 00:15:30.506\nAnd that means you can't trust that system\nand hopefully that leads you, of course,\n\n277\n00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:33.481\nto a series of actions,\nsuch as quarantining the system,\n\n278\n00:15:33.481 --> 00:15:36.580\nmaking sure there is some\nremediation factor that goes on and\n\n279\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.275\nthen getting everything back\nthe way it needs to be.\n\n280\n00:15:39.275 --> 00:15:43.418\nBut these types of commands and controls\nunlike the idea of capture the flag and\n\n281\n00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:47.057\nstuff like that and where the movies\nare when you put your flag down and\n\n282\n00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:49.870\nyou're saying, I am king of the kingdom.\n\n283\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.008\nIt's designed for\nyou to not to really notice.\n\n284\n00:15:52.008 --> 00:15:55.789\nBecause even though you might\ntake over this one system,\n\n285\n00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:59.421\nremember this is behind your command and\ncontrol now.\n\n286\n00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:03.912\n&gt;&gt; And that now means that they can\nstart running different types of attacks\n\n287\n00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:06.122\nagainst you and not realize it, and\n\n288\n00:16:06.122 --> 00:16:11.071\nthat's something else that we're gonna\nmention as well which we call a pivot.\n\n289\n00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:14.351\nIt becomes a beach head or\na front for us in which now,\n\n290\n00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:18.860\nwe're no longer looking for\nthe attack from the outside.\n\n291\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.920\nWe just don't even realize that the\nattacks are being carried out here once\n\n292\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.601\nthe attacker has command and\ncontrol over the device on the inside.\n\n293\n00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:31.618\nSo, it is a very high-functioning\ntype of attack system that\n\n294\n00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:37.023\nyou have already now ready to go\njust at the notice of the attacker.\n\n295\n00:16:37.023 --> 00:16:38.345\n&gt;&gt; And like Ronnie said,\n\n296\n00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:42.812\na lot of the time these particular files\nwant to remain concealed or hidden.\n\n297\n00:16:42.812 --> 00:16:47.586\nSometimes you'll see some strange names\nout there, but it's going to be usually\n\n298\n00:16:47.586 --> 00:16:52.015\nmore beneficial for the attacker to\nname their files something a little more\n\n299\n00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:56.306\nconcealed such as changing ls to ones\nthat look like legitimate files, so\n\n300\n00:16:56.306 --> 00:17:00.667\nthat if you're just scanning through\nquickly that you may look them over or\n\n301\n00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:02.014\nsomething like that.\n\n302\n00:17:02.014 --> 00:17:06.189\nSo, you just wanna be really vigilant\nwhenever you're inspecting these systems.\n\n303\n00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:10.333\n&gt;&gt; The idea of command and control is\nnot something like what we said here,\n\n304\n00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.867\nwhich announces itself.\n\n305\n00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:16.009\nThe idea that being hidden means that they\ncan launch more and more attacks to be\n\n306\n00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:20.151\nable to take more, and more control over\nyour systems inside to the point where\n\n307\n00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:24.670\nyou don't realize that they've taken\nover more than you wanted them to.\n\n308\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.976\nSo it's one of the attacks that we\ndefinitely have to make sure that we\n\n309\n00:17:27.976 --> 00:17:29.689\nunderstand right there, as well.\n\n310\n00:17:29.689 --> 00:17:32.560\nLet's mention the idea of malware just for\nthe sake of mentioning it.\n\n311\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.888\nWe've already talked about\ndifferent types of malware before.\n\n312\n00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:35.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n313\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.220\n&gt;&gt; But let's make sure that we mention at\nleast one particular malware that's really\n\n314\n00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.390\nbad that we haven't mentioned before,\nwhich is the idea of working against and\n\n315\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.590\nseeing the idea of root kits here.\n\n316\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.730\nSo Cherokee,\nyour experience with root kits.\n\n317\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.820\nWhat do you think?\n\n318\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie in my experience\nwhen I started out I started as\n\n319\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.499\na computer technician and\nI saw infected systems a lot.\n\n320\n00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:03.489\nMy best practice for any type of malware\nthat infects the system at that low-level\n\n321\n00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:07.900\nis to go ahead and reformat that disc and\nreinstall an operating system,\n\n322\n00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.009\nbecause the truth of the matter\nis you can go back and\n\n323\n00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:14.079\nfix those registry keys\nthat have been modified.\n\n324\n00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:14.984\nBut a lot of times,\n\n325\n00:18:14.984 --> 00:18:19.560\nyou'll see those reoccurring symptoms\nafter you think the machine is good to go.\n\n326\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.041\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt, Cherokee that that's\none of the harshest things about the way\n\n327\n00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:24.359\nthat root kits end up working.\n\n328\n00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:28.547\nIs their way of getting on to your\ncomputer doesn't install as a normal,\n\n329\n00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:29.928\nnatural program does?\n\n330\n00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:34.136\nIt really does get into what we call the\nroot level and that means it's gonna be\n\n331\n00:18:34.136 --> 00:18:38.109\nhidden from discovery from just about\neverything that we have in place.\n\n332\n00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:41.201\nThis even means from antivirus\ntypes of software as well,\n\n333\n00:18:41.201 --> 00:18:45.241\nwhich normally install and look at layer\nseven or the application layer that\n\n334\n00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:49.366\ndoesn't really go deep into the operating\nsystem to check out those things.\n\n335\n00:18:49.366 --> 00:18:53.208\nNow with this idea, when we start to\ntake a look at the root kit issue,\n\n336\n00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:55.995\nCherokee is absolutely\nright that you might think\n\n337\n00:18:55.995 --> 00:18:59.669\nthat there is some software that\nsays I can remove 100% of it.\n\n338\n00:18:59.669 --> 00:19:04.316\nIt never really does, because they tend to\nactually write themselves in unusual ways\n\n339\n00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:08.704\nto the point where you're never gonna get\nrid of it and they write themselves into\n\n340\n00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:12.963\nkeys, especially in Windows that you're\nnever gonna even try and discover,\n\n341\n00:19:12.963 --> 00:19:15.025\neven manually if you try and do so, but\n\n342\n00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:18.409\nthat's where you will find issues\nwith the idea of rootkits.\n\n343\n00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:23.269\nMy personal experience with them has also\nbeen about the same in the very fact that\n\n344\n00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:27.557\nit was so hidden that the operating\nsystem couldn't report what damage\n\n345\n00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:29.139\nwas actually being done.\n\n346\n00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:33.520\nYou took a look at this computer that\nwas running incredibly slow, but\n\n347\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.302\nyou went into task manager,\n\n348\n00:19:35.302 --> 00:19:39.697\nit looked like that there was plenty\nof free space on the drive itself.\n\n349\n00:19:39.697 --> 00:19:41.967\nThe CPU doesn't look\nlike it was pegged out.\n\n350\n00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:45.281\nThe RAM levels look just\nabout the same as normal.\n\n351\n00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:48.541\nBut yet,\nthe system was performing incredibly slow.\n\n352\n00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:52.840\nSo, I started my regular process of trying\nto exam it using anti virus program.\n\n353\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.178\nAnd if it were any other day,\nI would've just let it run, come back and\n\n354\n00:19:56.178 --> 00:19:58.781\nseen the report where it was good or\nit found viruses and\n\n355\n00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:00.721\nprobably would've gotten rid of them.\n\n356\n00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:04.164\nBut at that point, I had sat down and\nI had just looked up and\n\n357\n00:20:04.164 --> 00:20:07.199\nwas going through c,\nwindows, the fonts folder.\n\n358\n00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:11.529\nAnd once it got into the fonts folder,\nI noticed that there was another single\n\n359\n00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:14.473\nfolder in there that was\nnamed as a single tick mark.\n\n360\n00:20:14.473 --> 00:20:16.703\nSo it was a single quote, but\nI don't even think it was that.\n\n361\n00:20:16.703 --> 00:20:19.154\nIt was the back tick.\n\n362\n00:20:19.154 --> 00:20:22.691\nThe one to the left of the one key and\nI knew that something was wrong,\n\n363\n00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:25.688\nbecause that's not a default\nfolder inside of Windows.\n\n364\n00:20:25.688 --> 00:20:28.259\nSo I closed that out,\nfound inside of Windows Explorer.\n\n365\n00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:29.631\nI went into the font folder.\n\n366\n00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:32.799\nIt couldn't even see that and\nI was wondering what was happening.\n\n367\n00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:35.577\nI unhid all the folders and\nthe files and there it was.\n\n368\n00:20:35.577 --> 00:20:37.546\nIt was a single folder in there.\n\n369\n00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:41.857\nIt had over 26,000 files in there of\nnames that we couldn't recognize and\n\n370\n00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:46.041\nCherokee had mentioned this a little\nearlier were renamed differently, but\n\n371\n00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:50.097\nwith different characters and stuff and\nyou'd realize it somewhere along\n\n372\n00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:53.473\nthe line that this system had\ngotten compromised by rootkit.\n\n373\n00:20:53.473 --> 00:20:56.068\nNothing was actually able to find it,\nexcept for\n\n374\n00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:58.362\naccidentally coming across those files.\n\n375\n00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.475\nI probably would have\nnever even noticed it.\n\n376\n00:21:00.475 --> 00:21:04.415\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, that's a perfect example of\nwhere we really see our human experience\n\n377\n00:21:04.415 --> 00:21:07.176\ncombined with the type of\nsoftware that we're using.\n\n378\n00:21:07.176 --> 00:21:10.979\nNow not all of us can afford those\nexpensive solutions that we've spoke about\n\n379\n00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.799\npreviously, but\nyou really don't have to all the time.\n\n380\n00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:17.756\nThere are a lot of good free solutions\nthat I've used in the past and\n\n381\n00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:21.300\nyou guys should be developing\nyour own software tool kits.\n\n382\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.212\nI love those live CDs and\nRonnie is probably gonna make fun of me,\n\n383\n00:21:25.212 --> 00:21:29.282\nbecause you don't necessarily have\nto use a CD and a disk anymore.\n\n384\n00:21:29.282 --> 00:21:33.040\nWe can use flash drives these days,\nbut they're really great tools.\n\n385\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.639\nSome of my go tos like\nhe had mentioned before,\n\n386\n00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:39.116\ndepending on the operating system\nit could be malware bytes.\n\n387\n00:21:39.116 --> 00:21:44.351\nI usually like to run two scans, so\nmalware bytes with spy bot search and\n\n388\n00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:48.989\ndestroy, Mac systems,\nI think its like ClamXav is a good one.\n\n389\n00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:52.280\nThere is that one out there, but\njust it depends, whatever works for\n\n390\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.600\nyou and whatever you like.\n\n391\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.216\n&gt;&gt; And there is no doubt that there is\nplenty of different tools that are out\n\n392\n00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:57.580\nthere and available to help you out.\n\n393\n00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.072\nRemember that we're probably going to end\nup using those tools if we can't even boot\n\n394\n00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:02.399\ninto the system at that point and\n\n395\n00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:04.532\nthat's because it can run\non its own to do the scan.\n\n396\n00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:08.247\nAnd then once it's done,\nyou're good and you're ready to go.\n\n397\n00:22:08.247 --> 00:22:12.482\nOn those types of devices or\nsoftware that Cherokee's talking about,\n\n398\n00:22:12.482 --> 00:22:15.388\nyou always have to kind\nof recreate them though.\n\n399\n00:22:15.388 --> 00:22:19.663\nYou wanna make sure that you understand\nthat, because they're going to get updated\n\n400\n00:22:19.663 --> 00:22:22.808\nwith newer virus definitions or\nnewer malware definitions.\n\n401\n00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:27.037\nAnd so, that's the key to making sure you\ncatch all the ones that are available.\n\n402\n00:22:27.037 --> 00:22:31.760\nWe also wanna mention, of course, the idea\nof port scanning here just briefly.\n\n403\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.600\nThe goal is not to teach\nyou how to port scan, but\n\n404\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.350\nyou can use end map and that will, of\ncourse, allow you to do port scanning, but\n\n405\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.430\njust remember what the ultimate\ngoal of port scanning is.\n\n406\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.268\nIt's to discover the state of those ports.\n\n407\n00:22:44.268 --> 00:22:46.978\nSo, ports are either open or\nthey're closed.\n\n408\n00:22:46.978 --> 00:22:51.774\nThey may be considered what we call filter\nand ultimately or prevented at some point,\n\n409\n00:22:51.774 --> 00:22:55.520\nand that means that we can\neither attack them or we can't.\n\n410\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.200\nSo, it's given them a reconnaissance\nof the ability to see\n\n411\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.830\nwhat's actually open and available to them\nto be able to run that type of attack or\n\n412\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.530\nrun attack through that port number\nthat they want to be able to run.\n\n413\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.240\nSo, this is where it normally begins\nas far as attack from the outside to\n\n414\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.330\nsee what is open and\n\n415\n00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.520\navailable on that host system that they\nmight be able to take advantage of.\n\n416\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.242\nSo, being able to do that is key.\n\n417\n00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:22.867\n&gt;&gt; And this is really where those\nsolutions, such as as an IPS and\n\n418\n00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:23.992\nIDS come in handy.\n\n419\n00:23:23.992 --> 00:23:27.508\nBecause if the software is able\nto identify characteristics or\n\n420\n00:23:27.508 --> 00:23:32.017\ntraits that look like an ongoing attack,\nsuch as seeing those port numbers being\n\n421\n00:23:32.017 --> 00:23:34.604\nenumerated or\nchecked in a sequential order,\n\n422\n00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:37.820\nthey can say, throw up a red flag and\nsay, you know what?\n\n423\n00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.610\nI think something's not right here.\n\n424\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:44.198\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there's no doubt that this is one\nof the key elements that really is where\n\n425\n00:23:44.198 --> 00:23:45.392\nwe normally begin.\n\n426\n00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:49.016\nThe reason why is that you have\nto actually know what is open and\n\n427\n00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:50.769\navailable for you to attack.\n\n428\n00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:54.423\nSo, using some of my end map is probably\nthe most popular one that's out there and\n\n429\n00:23:54.423 --> 00:23:55.029\navailable.\n\n430\n00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:59.725\nOur last little topic at least for this\nsection, we've got plenty of more to go\n\n431\n00:23:59.725 --> 00:24:04.087\nis we need to talk about something\nwe call, of course, host profiling.\n\n432\n00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:08.389\nNow this is something that's called out\nspecifically on the exam objectives, but\n\n433\n00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:12.830\nthere's really not a lot that's\navailable on the idea of host profiling.\n\n434\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.643\nSo we need to kind of make sure that\nwe understand what we're talking.\n\n435\n00:24:16.643 --> 00:24:19.969\nNow is that meaning\nthe actual machine itself?\n\n436\n00:24:19.969 --> 00:24:23.690\nSo are we talking about\nidentifying the operating system?\n\n437\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.930\nAnd the hardware features that are inside\nit, what drivers are being run in that,\n\n438\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:33.050\nis that what we're normally talking\nabout as far as an attack goes, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.330\nWell, that's a part of it,\nof being able to understand,\n\n440\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.960\nhey, he's running on Windows 7,\nor maybe let's say,\n\n441\n00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.810\nhe's still running on Windows XP That\nmight be a good profile for\n\n442\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:51.150\nus to take a look at as we begin some\ntype of attack inside a network.\n\n443\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.650\nAs we might try to find the systems\nthat are most vulnerable.\n\n444\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.200\nAnd usually that means the older\noperating systems would be, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.500\nThe other thing that might be, of course,\n\n446\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.190\nis the applications that\nare running on systems as well.\n\n447\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.820\nWhen you start taking a look\nat who's still running Java?\n\n448\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:11.250\nOr who's still running an older version of\na browser that shouldn't be run any more?\n\n449\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.260\nThose again could also be included\ninto that idea of a profile.\n\n450\n00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.160\nNow by being able to find\nstuff like this right?\n\n451\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.130\nIt gives the attacker\na better understanding\n\n452\n00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.620\nof what systems can be easily,\nmore easily compromised.\n\n453\n00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.020\nSo it might be where you examine\nespecially a system like that\n\n454\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.520\nyou might find out who they're\ntrying to communicate with.\n\n455\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.590\nYou might find out they're trying to\ncommunicate with an older system or\n\n456\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.375\nanother file server which may be\neasier for you to attack as well.\n\n457\n00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.310\nTrying to find that and\nestablish the patterns of communication\n\n458\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.310\nis another profiling method\nthat might be out there.\n\n459\n00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.450\nSo you might do something like that, too.\n\n460\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.790\nParticular applications that we\ntalked about that are being used or\n\n461\n00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.040\njust even the regular protocol that\n\n462\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.430\na co-system might be available to,\nor normally is using, right?\n\n463\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:05.140\nAll those are always trying\nto give the attacker a sense\n\n464\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.750\nhe knows what vulnerabilities are out\nthere as far as the protocols go.\n\n465\n00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.810\nThe applications running on that\nsystem and even the operating system.\n\n466\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.870\nOne of the easiest things for the\nparticular attacker to do of course is to\n\n467\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.100\nfind out whether or\nnot the system has been updated or not.\n\n468\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.530\nAnd if you're still running\nan unupdated operating system,\n\n469\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.090\nit maybe one of those things that\nthey can't take advantage of\n\n470\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.870\nif they can't figure out\nsomething like that, too.\n\n471\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.720\nSo it's not always just about\nthe idea of I've done this\n\n472\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.690\nthat people even though has a good one,\nbut it's about discovering what\n\n473\n00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.950\nanother attack surface is what\nhost profiling is really about.\n\n474\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.800\nSo we're having reconnaissance that tells\nus that this is a possible attack which is\n\n475\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.790\nanother attack surface, but the idea of\nprofiling may lead us to direct systems\n\n476\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.970\nthat we know that we can ultimately\ntarget, turn into some type of command and\n\n477\n00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.110\ncontrol system if we need to, and\n\n478\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:02.050\nmaybe at that point launch the malware\ninside of that protected network that\n\n479\n00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.940\nwe might not have been able to\ndo from the outside anymore.\n\n480\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.570\nAnd that could compromise just\neverybody in the network.\n\n481\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:12.110\nSo just remember that all these attacks,\neven though they are seemingly separate.\n\n482\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.480\nThey can be used in combination to\nform a whole particular procedure for\n\n483\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.665\nan attack over Overall,and that's\nwhat we want to get at as well.\n\n484\n00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:21.775\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\nI hate to do this you again, but\n\n485\n00:27:21.775 --> 00:27:24.305\nit does look like we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n486\n00:27:24.305 --> 00:27:27.035\nI'm not going to short change this topic,\nbecause we do have a lot of\n\n487\n00:27:27.035 --> 00:27:29.975\ndifferent attacks and\ninvasion methods still to cover.\n\n488\n00:27:29.975 --> 00:27:33.295\nSo stay tuned because we have a lot\nmore information headed your way.\n\n489\n00:27:33.295 --> 00:27:35.615\nFor this show we'll go ahead and\nwrap things up.\n\n490\n00:27:35.615 --> 00:27:37.779\nRemember, I'm your show\n;host Cherokee Boose.\n\n491\n00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:38.741\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n492\n00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:41.750\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n493\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:51.750\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Why would an attacker want to cause harm? By determining the why one might be able to predict the how, or the method. Next, they identify some possible methods such as encryption and tunneling, resource exhaustion, traffic fragmentation, protocol-level misinterpretation, traffic substitution and insertion as well as pivot attacks.",

00:00:08.304\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:11.827\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCybersecurity Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.270\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.950\nThis is actually a continuation, a part\ntwo where we will continue to examine\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.060\ndifferent types of attacks and\nevasion methods.\n\n9\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.178\nWith us today we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.067\nRonnie Wong in studios, thank you for\njoining us again Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:32.409\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back\nas we continue to take a lot at, well,\n\n12\n00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.153\nthis part two.\n\n13\n00:00:33.153 --> 00:00:37.342\nEspecially really focused in on\nthe idea of evasion methodology,\n\n14\n00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:39.390\nis what we're focusing in on.\n\n15\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110\nRemember that attacks,\nwe're normally gonna be able to spot them.\n\n16\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.880\nBut most of the time we don't tend to\nspot attacks when they happen, right?\n\n17\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.210\nWe definitely don't spot\nthem before they happen.\n\n18\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.180\nWe normally spot them after they happen.\n\n19\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.870\nWhich is usually just about the only time\nthat we can spot an attack going on.\n\n20\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.540\nBut the harder part of this is to\nspot the idea of some type of evasion\n\n21\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.490\nthat goes on as well, right?\n\n22\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.830\nAn attack can happen and\nwe can notice it but\n\n23\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.352\nthe problem that we have is what\nif they're already evading us?\n\n24\n00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:15.510\nWe might not be able to detect that\nthe attack has happened at all.\n\n25\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.181\nOr we attack it so late in the process\nthat we don't know what the outcome and\n\n26\n00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:20.830\nthe result of that is going to be.\n\n27\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.845\nSo today that's what we're gonna do.\n\n28\n00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:26.600\nWe're gonna focus in on this idea of\nevasion methodologies to make sure that\n\n29\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.810\nwe understand what it is\nthat we're taking a look at.\n\n30\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.801\nSo we should begin by talking, of course,\n\n31\n00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.713\nabout the purpose of the evasion\nmethod itself, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:41.480\nNow, when we start talking about evasion\nmethodology in terms of cyber security.\n\n33\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.667\nThe purpose the purpose of the evasion\nis really to take advantage\n\n34\n00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.725\nover whatever protocols\nthat we have in place.\n\n35\n00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:54.792\nTo be able to conceal the attack\nwhen it arrives at its destination.\n\n36\n00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:58.658\nAnd that means that what we're trying to\nsay is we wanna make sure that you don't\n\n37\n00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:00.750\nknow that the attack is happening.\n\n38\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.610\nThat we're somehow evading the notice.\n\n39\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.590\nOr you're actually going to end up not\nnoticing that the attack has happened.\n\n40\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.760\nAnd so, how do we do this?\n\n41\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.810\nWith existing protocols that are actually\nin place that we have [INAUDIBLE].\n\n42\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.596\nWell, what can happen of course then\nis that the attacker comes up with\n\n43\n00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:18.760\nan invasion attack.\n\n44\n00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.750\nWhich combines two or\nthree different methods together.\n\n45\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.280\nSo a combination of attacks\nis how they really begin.\n\n46\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.880\nSo an evasion might be I start\nhiding my IP address or spoofing.\n\n47\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.910\nSo that's an evasion technique.\n\n48\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.401\nBut at the same time it might\nalso be that I choose to try and\n\n49\n00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:41.622\ndo this on a command and\ncontrolled machine instead.\n\n50\n00:02:41.622 --> 00:02:46.490\nSo if I start to hide my own IP and then I\nstart doing it on the command and control.\n\n51\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.091\nWell I might not think about\nthe combination of both of those systems.\n\n52\n00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:54.300\nBeing where the attack actually does\nend up really starting from, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.079\nThe other thing as well that they\ncan do on the idea of the evasion.\n\n54\n00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.069\nIs of course being able\nto change the nature and\n\n55\n00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.230\nthe way that it actually looks,\neven on the fly.\n\n56\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.861\nSo as the attack looks like\nit's beginning to happen all of\n\n57\n00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:13.368\na sudden they switch\nto a different method.\n\n58\n00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:16.920\nAnd now you're like, wait a minute, what\njust happened to attack that was going on?\n\n59\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.780\nYou think the attack has gone away,\nbut instead they've changed.\n\n60\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.440\nAnd they've chosen to actually\nswitch to something else as well.\n\n61\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.010\nAnd the way that this is done, is they\ntake advantage of protocols that exist.\n\n62\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.210\nBut, take advantage of properties\nthat we don't think about.\n\n63\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.610\nAnd we showed you an example of this by\nusing Ping in an earlier episode, right?\n\n64\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.810\nSo I showed you where you could actually\ntake Ping and discover information.\n\n65\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.776\nNot only about who you're pinging,\n\n66\n00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:46.895\nso the destination to verify\nthat you have connectivity.\n\n67\n00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:50.051\nBut I even showed you where you could\ntake advantage of that by adding in\n\n68\n00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.660\nan injection attack.\n\n69\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.585\nBy showing you the ID of the issuer\nof that ping message as well,\n\n70\n00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.780\nwhoever's logged in to\nthe machine at that point.\n\n71\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.940\nAnd so when you start to think about this,\nit's not that they've modified Ping.\n\n72\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.093\nThey've just taken advantage of lesser\nknown techniques that we might not\n\n73\n00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:07.701\nthink about.\n\n74\n00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:12.130\nTo be able to say hey, this protocol\ncan do more than you think about.\n\n75\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.771\nCuz most of us don't think about it.\n\n76\n00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:14.306\nWe just go, okay it works and it's great.\n\n77\n00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:17.004\nBut we don't ever think about some of\nthe other things that are attached to\n\n78\n00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:17.623\nthat protocol.\n\n79\n00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:20.840\nAnd that's what they begin doing, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.950\nSo the whole method and\npurpose, right, is really that,\n\n81\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.690\nis to make sure that you just don't notice\nwhen the attack is going to happen.\n\n82\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.850\nNow why do evasion attacks work\nis also another key for us.\n\n83\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.339\nOkay and that is because in every\nprotocol that's out there there\n\n84\n00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:42.350\nare evasions that exist,\nthere is no way to get around it.\n\n85\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.663\nNot every protocol monitors for\neverything, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:48.552\nAnd so for example we were talking\nearlier in another episode\n\n87\n00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:53.330\nalso about the idea of digital signatures,\nwhich is great, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.820\nBut one of the things that\ncan be pulled over on us,\n\n89\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.230\nis when that particular\ndigital signature was issued.\n\n90\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.650\nWhen it was modified, when it was changed,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n91\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.290\nWell, normally, that is something that we\ndon't have associated with that particular\n\n92\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.210\nmethod of security, right,\nof the digital signature.\n\n93\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.250\nThere's no time stamp inherent\ninside of that digital signature.\n\n94\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.004\nSo it might be, for somebody to be\nable to take advantage of that.\n\n95\n00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:19.429\nIs to kind of know that, hey,\n\n96\n00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.870\nthere is something that's actually\nlacking in the way that we do that.\n\n97\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.097\nAnd that's something else that we\nhave to actually think about as well.\n\n98\n00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:31.915\nBecause evasions are designed specifically\nto make sure that they hide things\n\n99\n00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:32.501\nfrom us.\n\n100\n00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.919\nThe combination of them also trips us up,\n\n101\n00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.250\nbecause it doesn't fit neatly into\none category or another, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.150\nWith them not fitting neatly into\ncategories, then we tend to kinda blur and\n\n103\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.780\nwe go, that doesn't really fit this,\nit doesn't really fit that.\n\n104\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.560\nSo how do we categorize that?\n\n105\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.200\nHow do we actually defend against that?\n\n106\n00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800\nIt becomes much more difficult as well.\n\n107\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.635\nThe other thing that we'll also end\nup finding out about these types of\n\n108\n00:05:55.635 --> 00:05:57.726\nmethodologies and testing for them.\n\n109\n00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:01.695\nIs that we're gonna end up\nseeing that the sequence\n\n110\n00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.410\nof the methodology that\nthey use is important.\n\n111\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.570\nAnd that is because it has to happen in\ncertain ways for it to be successful.\n\n112\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.708\nIf they come out too strong,\nin other words,\n\n113\n00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:14.030\nthey're a bit too noticeable\nat the beginning.\n\n114\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.710\nWell, it doesn't matter if you actually\nhave lesser known types of evasions\n\n115\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.870\nthat go on.\n\n116\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.618\nSo the sequence of these really have to\nbe what we have to worry about more than\n\n117\n00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:24.450\nanything else.\n\n118\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.080\nAnd then lastly we wanna make sure\nthat we understand something.\n\n119\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.752\nThat we're not really getting into this\nwhole idea of combining evasions at\n\n120\n00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:32.921\nleast right here.\n\n121\n00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:35.629\nBut as you get into the field\nyou'll probably see that,\n\n122\n00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.077\nthat's more often than not.\n\n123\n00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:39.361\nIs that they don't just\ntend to fit neatly,\n\n124\n00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:41.520\nthey're gonna combine them together.\n\n125\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.792\nAnd that's really kind of beyond\nwhat we're trying to get into here.\n\n126\n00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:49.781\nBut we wanna make sure that we have some\nmethodology to at least understand why\n\n127\n00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:50.560\nthey do it.\n\n128\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.830\nAnd then some idea of how we\ncan begin testing for them.\n\n129\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.796\nAnd that is the key as to understanding\nyou gotta start examining those protocols,\n\n130\n00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:00.630\nat least at the beginning.\n\n131\n00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.723\nAnd then start trying to mix them together\nand seeing what happens there too.\n\n132\n00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:07.250\n&gt;&gt; That's completely the truth Ronnie and\nit’s not even just the protocols.\n\n133\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.219\nSometimes you have to look at different\ntypes of technologies such as\n\n134\n00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:11.404\nMicrosoft's BitLocker.\n\n135\n00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:15.181\nBecause like you said, it's not\nnecessarily a black and white line or\n\n136\n00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:18.210\ndistinction there,\nsometimes we have that gray area.\n\n137\n00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.638\nI mean you've seen newer types\nof malware that's coming out.\n\n138\n00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:27.910\nWe talk about, well, armorware is not\nnewer but that's been out for a while.\n\n139\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.874\nWhere the particular malware is\npreventing any kind of antimalware or\n\n140\n00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:35.911\nantivirus system to go ahead and execute.\n\n141\n00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:40.246\nOr with BitLocker like I started to\nmention there, that Microsoft technology,\n\n142\n00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:42.170\nyou hear this term ransomware now.\n\n143\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.180\nWhere in fact they're encrypting\nthe entire hard disk drive.\n\n144\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.679\nAnd that goes back to what we looked at\nin the past episode with the C2 types\n\n145\n00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:49.488\nof attacks.\n\n146\n00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:52.049\nSo, just knowing that\neverything isn't gonna be so\n\n147\n00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:54.912\ncookie-cutter all the time\nis pretty important as well.\n\n148\n00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:59.426\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that that's definitely\ngoing to be true In terms of understanding\n\n149\n00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:00.706\nthis idea of invasion.\n\n150\n00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:05.083\nSo what in the world do we have to look\nfor then as we start to monitor our\n\n151\n00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:09.914\nsystems and realize that people are not\nonly trying to attack our networks or\n\n152\n00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:13.950\nour systems but\nthey're also trying to hide it, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.490\nThis is where you have to\njump out of the box of\n\n154\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.670\nregular definition like\nwhat Cherokee was saying.\n\n155\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.180\nWe have to think outside of the box of how\ncould they deliver that malware to me.\n\n156\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.720\nWell we already talked about kind of\nthe most common methods like phishing,\n\n157\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.780\nsome type of download on email link.\n\n158\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.960\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering yep.\n\n159\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering.\n\n160\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.550\nBut you have to combine them all\ntogether to actually think like\n\n161\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.750\nhow is somebody going to take advantage\nof that to get access in my system?\n\n162\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.610\nAnd this is where that idea of\nnetwork security monitoring\n\n163\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.510\nthe perspective of it changes\nthe way that cybersecurity\n\n164\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.950\nhas done in comparison to regular\nsecurity that we tend to implement.\n\n165\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.730\nOkay, so in security systems, and\nI think I've mentioned this once before.\n\n166\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.550\nI don't remember if I did too much,\n\n167\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.920\nbut let me mention is now\nbefore it slips my mind here.\n\n168\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.510\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; When we start setting up security\n\n169\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.830\nwe think about setting up\nthe perfect defense, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.230\nThat's what we think about, right?\n\n171\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.850\nWe go okay, I've got my router in place,\n\n172\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.130\nI've got my firewall, I've made sure that\nthose things are secured and controlled.\n\n173\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.330\nGot Active Directory in place.\n\n174\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.160\nI've got to make sure that everything's\nlocked down the way that you want to.\n\n175\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.750\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, though.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n176\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.090\nwhen we think about the idea of perfect.\n\n177\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we do is go,\n\n178\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.360\nall right, nobody can get through this and\nthat's pretty much the way that we think.\n\n179\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160\nIn network security monitoring, and\n\n180\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.800\nin terms of cyber security,\nthe goal is not to think that way.\n\n181\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.960\nI know that sounds strange, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.240\nLeave that up to the guys that\nimplement security, which is fine.\n\n183\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.040\nIn cybersecurity you're assuming that\nattacks are going to happen, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.440\nSo in other words,\n\n185\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.310\ndon't start with, here's all my\nstuff in place to defend against it.\n\n186\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.040\nBut now take a look at it\nfrom the standpoint of hey,\n\n187\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.060\nattacks are going to take place.\n\n188\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.060\nHow is it that they get into my system?\n\n189\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.090\nAnd then from that point,\ndon't worry about the defense, but\n\n190\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.260\nworry about how to identify them.\n\n191\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.020\nBecause if you can identify them,\nthen you can frustrate them.\n\n192\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.310\nOkay, even though they might\nget access to network,\n\n193\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.870\nthey may not get their overall goal\nof what they were trying to achieve,\n\n194\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.590\nif you can learn enough\ninformation about them as well.\n\n195\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.080\nSo that's the same thing here\nwith the evasion methodology and\n\n196\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.550\nwhat we need to look for.\n\n197\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.130\nIs we wanna make sure we're looking in\nthe places that we don't think about, or\n\n198\n00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.550\nchanging our perspective from\ndefense to the idea of spotting and\n\n199\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:34.030\nidentifying and then that way we can now\nproduce a little bit better security.\n\n200\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.430\nCuz now that we have that in\nplace it can be easier for\n\n201\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.190\nus to identify attacks the next time\nif they end up happening that way okay.\n\n202\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.080\nNow the other thing, of course,\n\n203\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.910\nto know is to actually know what's gonna\nbe a target on your networks to, okay.\n\n204\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.920\nSo, most of the time,\nyou might go, a regular end user?\n\n205\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.030\nWell, it depends on what type of\nattack they need to carry out.\n\n206\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.390\nBut yes, a regular end user system\nmay become that point of command and\n\n207\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.110\ncontrol, and may give the attacker that\nability sort of, that pivot, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.040\nThe idea of the pivot is for\nthem to have an anchor head\n\n209\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.860\ninside of your network somewhere,\nthat where you have command and\n\n210\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.250\ncontrol to begin to take over command and\ncontrol of the entire network.\n\n211\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.910\nIt is a launching point for them.\n\n212\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.960\nThey send over whatever\nthey want to infect.\n\n213\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.670\nThen from that point they\ninfect it from there instead\n\n214\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.910\nof having to do it from the outside.\n\n215\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.420\nSo you got to actually know\nwhat your targets really are.\n\n216\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.070\nWhether if it's a file server or whether\nit's the individual host machines or\n\n217\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.560\nwhatever it is you need to\nknow what to protect as well.\n\n218\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.970\n&gt;&gt; Well that's really true Ronnie, because\nif you think about the understanding\n\n219\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.710\nthe actual motive of the attacker,\n\n220\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.410\nusually an attacker wants to get\nthe biggest bang for the buck.\n\n221\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.620\nAnd what does that mean will cause\nthe chaos or reap the most havoc.\n\n222\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.230\nBut lets just say someone is disgruntled,\nor\n\n223\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.390\nhas a grudge against a particular employ\nor maybe they've done their research and\n\n224\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.095\nthey've found that the CEO for this\nparticular organization has got a lot of\n\n225\n00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:08.020\naffluent measures behind them and\nthey're very wealthy and it just depends.\n\n226\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.680\nAnd so you can go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.020\nprotect your systems depending on\nif you understand that motive.\n\n228\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.780\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this is where\nwe really again start kind of saying,\n\n229\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.170\nall right,\nI know now what needs to be protected.\n\n230\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.430\nI know I need to scan these systems for\nwhat could possibly happen to them.\n\n231\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.490\nThe other part, of course is to make sure\nthat we understand not only combined\n\n232\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.690\nmethodology, which we've been emphasizing\nthroughout so far, in this episode.\n\n233\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.760\nBut you also have to look for\n\n234\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.180\nwhat is almost right but not actually\nmaking the connection that it needs to.\n\n235\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.390\nSo this is where it becomes\na little bit harder.\n\n236\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.680\nRemember that the idea of the evasion\nis for you not to notice.\n\n237\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.200\nSo it can be where it\nfeels like it's 99% right.\n\n238\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.560\nEverything looks like is right but\nthere is still something wrong\n\n239\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.300\nwith what you're seeing as\nfar as the connections go.\n\n240\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.580\nOr the protocol, something is happening\nwhere it's not connecting exactly right.\n\n241\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.270\nIt may be where somebody is now\ntaking advantage of one of those\n\n242\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.690\nlesser things happening in the protocol,\nand\n\n243\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.130\nnow your system is scanning going look,\nthis is almost right.\n\n244\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.370\nSo is it just a corruption or\nis it a sign of an evasion or\n\n245\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.850\nan attack that's going on?\n\n246\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.280\nThat's when you have to examine\nthose particular types of packets\n\n247\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.870\na little bit more.\n\n248\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.330\nAlso, understand the limitations\nof what your security devices that\n\n249\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.130\nyou have are in place.\n\n250\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.760\nA firewall is a great\nexample of this idea, right?\n\n251\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.600\nSo a firewall is usually our\nmain perimeter defense for\n\n252\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.970\nmost small to medium networks and\nthat's great because it\n\n253\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:39.210\nreally does stop the majority of\neverything that comes in from the outside.\n\n254\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.340\nBut remember the limitation of this is\nthat it doesn't really prevent anything\n\n255\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.360\nfrom getting in and infecting your\nnetwork if it's already on the inside.\n\n256\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.614\nSo there is a limitation in\nthat system on to itself.\n\n257\n00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:56.520\nThe idea here of also making sure that\nyou have a router that only allows for\n\n258\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.741\ncertain types of traffic to come in also\nworks to, but if you don't protect that\n\n259\n00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:04.780\nconfiguration then you know that\nsomebody can manipulate and change that.\n\n260\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.800\nSo you gotta know what limitations are,\nwhat limitations are on\n\n261\n00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.400\nthe security advise that you\nimplement on your network as well.\n\n262\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.440\nNow, in terms of analysis,\nwhen you suspect that\n\n263\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.550\nsomebody is using evasion\ntechniques on you and\n\n264\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.810\nstarting to happen inside your network\nuse regular troubleshooting models.\n\n265\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.590\nThat really helped us out.\n\n266\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.700\nNow you're saying I'm trying\nto troubleshoot an evasion?\n\n267\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.620\nTo a point, you really are.\n\n268\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.250\nVerify the connections that normally\nmake regular traffic flow are in place.\n\n269\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.090\nTake a look at your Layer 2,\nyour Layer 3 traffic, Layer 4.\n\n270\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.740\nMake sure that, yes, you go everything\nthat's working the way that it should or\n\n271\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:52.190\nare you starting to have the anomalies the\ndifferent things that are just right or\n\n272\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.980\nalmost right,\n\n273\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.960\nbut not exactly 100% right is another\naspect that you have to think about.\n\n274\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.370\nSo together when you start to\nthink about the idea of evasion,\n\n275\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.700\nwe now understand the purpose, we now\nunderstand that we can actually have some\n\n276\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:12.050\ndifferent principles for testing for\nevasion methodologies that are going on.\n\n277\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.650\nBut we also now understand what\nwe have to begin to look for.\n\n278\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.590\nSo in that sense, we actually to now take\na look at some of these different attacks\n\n279\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.670\nto really help us out, and not all of\nthem are attacks, some of them are just\n\n280\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.320\ndifferent protocols that we can used, to\nreally get past us that we don't realize.\n\n281\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.910\nSo one of the initial ways that\n\n282\n00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.950\nattackers tend to use evasion\ntechniques that's fairly simple.\n\n283\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.350\nTo get through a firewall,\nwell the easiest way to evade the firewall\n\n284\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.330\ndetection is to use some type of tunneling\nprotocol, when it comes down to it.\n\n285\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.240\nYou might be wondering, well why?\n\n286\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.760\nWell remember that a firewall\ndoesn't inspect anything that goes\n\n287\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.930\nthrough the tunnel.\n\n288\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.646\nIt just does a tunnel is created and\n\n289\n00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:51.318\nyou said you're allowing\nthat tunnel to go through.\n\n290\n00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:55.365\nSo just remember that even something\nas simple as this where you're\n\n291\n00:15:55.365 --> 00:15:59.849\nusing encryption as well as the idea\nof some type of tunneling technology.\n\n292\n00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:02.898\nThat you're really punching\na hole through that firewall, and\n\n293\n00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:05.460\njust allowing that traffic to go through.\n\n294\n00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.726\nAnd if an attacker can take\nadvantage of that, well,\n\n295\n00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:11.278\nthat's where you have an issue, right.\n\n296\n00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:15.352\nSo most of the time, as long as you\nactually understand that's what's gonna\n\n297\n00:16:15.352 --> 00:16:19.676\nhappen, that means you start monitoring\nyour tunnels a little bit more closely,\n\n298\n00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:21.257\ntaking a look at the traffic.\n\n299\n00:16:21.257 --> 00:16:25.013\nSo for example if you're running IP\nset as your main tunneling protocol,\n\n300\n00:16:25.013 --> 00:16:26.670\nthat's great.\n\n301\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.750\nBut all the sudden you start realizing\nthat hey, there's a connection coming\n\n302\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.820\nthrough here that's another tunnel,\nthat's a GRE tunnel.\n\n303\n00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.520\nPerfectly fine that there are GRE tunnels,\nif you allow that.\n\n304\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.780\nBut what if you said look,\n\n305\n00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.650\nno the only types of tunnels that we\nuse on my network is IPSec tunnels.\n\n306\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.340\nWell now you might've actually found\nthat what they were saying is,\n\n307\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.940\nhey tunneling technology works let's\njust implement a GRE tunnel and\n\n308\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.705\nwe're perfectly fine and happy to go that\nway instead, but didn't choose to do so.\n\n309\n00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:58.960\n&gt;&gt; So that attacker's just saying look,\nthis is another protocol that I can use to\n\n310\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.570\nconceal the type of information that\nI'm putting onto your network, and\n\n311\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.400\nthat should throw up that red flag there.\n\n312\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.670\n&gt;&gt; It should, right,\nit should show you that somebody else is\n\n313\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.710\nsending their data over something you\ndidn't really realize that was there.\n\n314\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.740\nThat should be kind of a sign that\nkind of let's you know that hey,\n\n315\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.520\nthis may be some form of\nevasion that goes on.\n\n316\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.540\nBut because your firewall's\nset up to receive tunnels, and\n\n317\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.000\nsomebody may have gone in there to change\nthat, where they were able to create one.\n\n318\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.540\nAnd, most of the time, if we're not\npaying attention as closely as we should,\n\n319\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.980\nwe might let that slip by and\nnot even think about it.\n\n320\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.025\nBut, overall though,\n\n321\n00:17:31.025 --> 00:17:34.015\nthat's a good sign that you have to\nkind of pay attention to as well.\n\n322\n00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:35.657\nOkay, another one, of course,\n\n323\n00:17:35.657 --> 00:17:38.657\nis just simple resource\nexhaustion is another one, right.\n\n324\n00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.493\nSo let's say that what we do is\nwe take advantage of an intrusion\n\n325\n00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:42.860\ndetection system.\n\n326\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.800\nBy overwhelming that system with\ndifferent requests instead.\n\n327\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.373\nOkay, in other words, we send so\nmuch information to it that then,\n\n328\n00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:52.680\nwe send our attack behind it.\n\n329\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.845\nIf that particular intrusion detection\nsystem is now overwhelmed, or\n\n330\n00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:58.590\neven intrusion prevention\nsystem is overwhelmed.\n\n331\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.705\nThere's a couple of different\nthings that can happen,\n\n332\n00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:04.280\nit depends on what the default is\nif the systems overwhelmed, right.\n\n333\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.900\nSo an intrusion prevention\nsystem it could be that it says,\n\n334\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.120\nlook, if I'm overwhelmed I close.\n\n335\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.900\nI default to a closed type of connection,\n\n336\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.830\nwhich means when once I get overwhelmed\nI don't let any traffic go through.\n\n337\n00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.040\nBut what if you go, look,\nI can't afford to miss traffic, so\n\n338\n00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.110\nif it gets overwhelmed let me\ndefault to leave it open instead.\n\n339\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.320\nThat's a different method that\nyou have to worry about too.\n\n340\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.390\n&gt;&gt; And right, that goes back to to those\nterms, what, fail safe and fail close.\n\n341\n00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.890\nOr-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n342\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.710\n&gt;&gt; One of those two, make sure I'm\n\n343\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.760\nsaying them right here.\n\n344\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.180\nFail open-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, fail open, fail close, fail safe,\n\n345\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.645\nyou name it, there's different\nthings that you don't realize.\n\n346\n00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:42.316\nAnd you want like, what is that about,\nremember that this is where the attacker\n\n347\n00:18:42.316 --> 00:18:47.077\nis taking advantage of understanding\nthe limitations of that security system.\n\n348\n00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:51.008\nAnd says look if I know that I can do\nthis, if I can get that device to fail,\n\n349\n00:18:51.008 --> 00:18:53.200\nits default is to fail open.\n\n350\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.310\nSo they keep doing that,\nthey keep sending attacks and\n\n351\n00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.980\nmake it fail to that point where now it\nsays all right, we're default to open.\n\n352\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.140\nWell now the entire rest of\nthe network is now open as well.\n\n353\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.420\nSo realize that there are limitations\nthat they can take advantage of\n\n354\n00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.660\nespecially by using resource\nexhaustion as well.\n\n355\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.780\nAnother one is simple, what we call,\na traffic fragmentation here.\n\n356\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.640\nTraffic fragmentation is a little\nbit more difficult to try and\n\n357\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.060\ndo, you really have to craft\nyour packets to do this.\n\n358\n00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.670\nIt's simple enough, remember that the\nregular frames are 1500 and 18 bytes or\n\n359\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.230\nso, whatever it might be, and\n\n360\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.240\nthen anything bigger than that, what\nends up happening with the rest of it?\n\n361\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.355\nWell they fragment okay, so\nin that idea of fragmentation,\n\n362\n00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:35.980\nit means that they take out\nthe rest of that chunk and\n\n363\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.250\nthey just send it as a another chunk\nof data across the network, okay.\n\n364\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.650\nTo make it whatever\nsize that they want to.\n\n365\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:47.140\nWell, attackers using evasion\ntechniques can use this idea of traffic\n\n366\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.350\nfragmentation, okay,\nto make sure that what they can do here\n\n367\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.590\nis to be able to overwhelm\nanother system in this way.\n\n368\n00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.894\nOkay, an intrusion detection\nsystem is overwhelmed by a lot\n\n369\n00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:02.210\nof traffic fragmentation.\n\n370\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.080\nYou might be wondering why, it's because\nit has to inspect every single fragment.\n\n371\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.820\nWhen it has to inspect every single\nfragment, let's say it gets a thousand of\n\n372\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.300\nthese fragments that have sequence\nnumbers all in an unusual order.\n\n373\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.720\nNow, before it can actually inspect\nthe entire thing, it has to receive,\n\n374\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.690\nwhat, all of them, and then it has to\nput it together in the same order and\n\n375\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.720\nthen inspect it.\n\n376\n00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.150\nBecause it's not designed\nto expect fragments, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.410\nSo something like that could also be\nan invasion technique instead, okay.\n\n378\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.740\nThe other ones that we can also take a\nlook at here is the idea of protocol level\n\n379\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.398\nmisinterpretation.\n\n380\n00:20:35.398 --> 00:20:37.589\nNow this one's a little bit more tricky,\nand\n\n381\n00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:40.596\nthis is one that's specifically\ncalled out on the exam here.\n\n382\n00:20:40.596 --> 00:20:43.826\nWhat we can do is that,\nor an attacker can do,\n\n383\n00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:48.841\nis they can take an IPS that will\nend up essentially misinterpreting,\n\n384\n00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:53.602\nokay, the end-to-end protocols\nthat are used in a connection.\n\n385\n00:20:53.602 --> 00:20:56.835\nSo when it misinterprets that,\nit still goes, all right,\n\n386\n00:20:56.835 --> 00:20:59.239\nso what do I do now with\nthe default traffic?\n\n387\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.100\nThis is what I'm supposed to do with it\nand this is the way I'm seeing it, so\n\n388\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.420\nwhat do I do with that?\n\n389\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.230\nWell it follows the default rules and\nit may say, all right,\n\n390\n00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.320\nif it's this, I filter it out,\nif it's not this, I let it go on through.\n\n391\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.730\nSo it may go ahead and say,\nlet's take a look at this attack.\n\n392\n00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.080\nWell, it looks like all the all other\ntraffic that I would normally let\n\n393\n00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.300\ngo through, let's go ahead and\nlet it go through.\n\n394\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.640\nSo you can have where the end-to-end\ncommunication the application themselves\n\n395\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.840\nare actually going to be misinterpreted\nby the IPS itself as well, okay.\n\n396\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.040\nOne of the last attacks that we wanna talk\nabout of course is just regular traffic\n\n397\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.420\nsubstitution.\n\n398\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.770\nAnd this is where we may take\nadvantage of the fact that,\n\n399\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.225\nmost of the things that end up inspecting\nour data as it moves through the network,\n\n400\n00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:49.260\nis not gonna look deep\ninto the packet itself.\n\n401\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.770\nIt's really gonna look at a surface layer,\nfirewalls are a good example of that.\n\n402\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.250\nSome of them will look\ndeeper into the packets.\n\n403\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.715\nBut most of them are just really\nlooking at the header information and\n\n404\n00:21:57.715 --> 00:22:01.185\ntaking advantage it there to actually know\nwhether it's gonna allow it through or\n\n405\n00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:05.790\nnot, but it doesn't take a look at\nthe payload of the information very much.\n\n406\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.720\nSo if you can take a traffic header and\n\n407\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.600\nthen put it on to whatever payload\nyou want to, like malicious software.\n\n408\n00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.990\nAnd everything looks good in the header,\nwell, then you might know something.\n\n409\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.882\nYou might actually figure out,\n\n410\n00:22:16.882 --> 00:22:20.050\nthat it might be able to get\nthrough the firewall very easily.\n\n411\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.409\nAnd so this is something where you may end\nup substituting some type of malicious\n\n412\n00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.610\nsoftware and some type of method\nlike that to get through.\n\n413\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.270\nNow this is not always done like that.\n\n414\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.530\nIt's not always about\nmaliciousness because,\n\n415\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:37.630\nsometimes, you definitely do this to make\nsure your traffic can continue through,\n\n416\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.300\njust in case your protocol\nnumber is blocked.\n\n417\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.560\nYou can substitute it and\nput it on port 80 if you wanted to.\n\n418\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Pretty common?\n\n419\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.720\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\npretty common to actually be able to do.\n\n420\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.670\nSo, don't think that it's\nall about maliciousness,\n\n421\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.058\nbut you gotta not also look the other way.\n\n422\n00:22:50.058 --> 00:22:53.695\nAnd say, look, we may have to do\na little bit deeper than that as well.\n\n423\n00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:57.060\nOkay, and we also mentioned the idea\nof pivot a little bit earlier, but\n\n424\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.810\njust remember that that is\nthe ultimate goal here.\n\n425\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.960\nTo, pivot is a form of invasion, and\nthe very fact that they are launching\n\n426\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.055\nthe attack, but\nnot from their own systems anymore.\n\n427\n00:23:06.055 --> 00:23:07.210\nIt's essentially,\n\n428\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.260\na misdirection to a system that's\ninside of your own network as well.\n\n429\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.450\nAnd now that they know that, well even if\nyou stop that pivot, well at that point\n\n430\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.210\nyou kinda realize something you\ndidn't really get the bad guy.\n\n431\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.205\n&gt;&gt; And just to be clear on that Ronnie,\nso what you're saying with those pivoted\n\n432\n00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:27.090\nattacks, I could go ahead and command your\ncomputer and execute that attack from\n\n433\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.930\nyour computer that might be on the local\narea network, a legitimate end user.\n\n434\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.496\nAnd that's what you're referencing there?\n\n435\n00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:33.460\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n\n436\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.470\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much the same idea here,\nright, so\n\n437\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:40.160\nthis is where the nature of\nthe cyber security is getting to.\n\n438\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.350\nIs that they realize they're not\ncatching the bad guy anymore.\n\n439\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.800\nIn the end when they find out where\neverything's originating from,\n\n440\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.720\nit's originating from some pivot point,\nin today's networks very much so.\n\n441\n00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.520\nAnd that's because the attacker\nhas gotten smarter\n\n442\n00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.190\nby using these invasion techniques now.\n\n443\n00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.290\nHe says I'm just sending commands and\ncontrols from sitting at home.\n\n444\n00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.980\nI don't have to try and\nget access in the network because\n\n445\n00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.770\nI can take advantage of everything\nelse that's already there.\n\n446\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.010\nAnd now launch my attacks from internal,\nand not even have to worry about\n\n447\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.720\nhaving to deal with a lot of security,\nsince I'm already on the inside.\n\n448\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.510\nSo there's a lot of this\nstuff that goes on,\n\n449\n00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.380\nbut it's a big part of\nthe process of cyber security.\n\n450\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.210\nUnderstanding the invasion\nmethodology that's out there,\n\n451\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.490\nand something that you have to be\nable to spot, and try, and identify.\n\n452\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.010\nAnd then of course some of the different\nattacks that we've been talking\n\n453\n00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.030\nabout as well.\n\n454\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.530\nAnd that should give you\na nice well rounded approach.\n\n455\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.950\nUnderstanding attacks that happened,\nand being able to identify them too.\n\n456\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronie, it does seem like we've\nbeen speaking on different types of\n\n457\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.430\nattacks and evasion methods for quite\na while But that's because there are a lot\n\n458\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.500\nof different components out there\nthat you do need to be familiar with.\n\n459\n00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.180\nSo ladies and gentlemen,\nyou do have your work cut out for you.\n\n460\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.670\nWe never said it'd be easy but\nit sure is fun.\n\n461\n00:24:50.670 -->
