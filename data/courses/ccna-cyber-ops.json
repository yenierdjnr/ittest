          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.934\n[SOUND] Hi,\nwe're here to do an overview for\n\n2\n00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:08.175\nthe Cisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals show.\n\n3\n00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.750\nIf you're studying to obtain your\nCisco CCNA Cyber Ops Certification,\n\n4\n00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.330\nthen you're in the perfect place.\n\n5\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890\nSo let's take a moment to talk about what\nyou should expect before taking your exam.\n\n6\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.210\nIf we can take a look at my screen,\n\n7\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.520\nI'd like to pull up some\ninformation from Cisco's website.\n\n8\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.380\nNow, just so you're aware,\nthis is actually going to\n\n9\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.980\nbe a certification that requires\ntwo exams that you need to pass.\n\n10\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.569\nSo the first exam that we'll\nbe focusing on is going to be\n\n11\n00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:41.910\nthe 210-250 SECFND, which I have\npulled up in this other tab here.\n\n12\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.530\nAnd this is what we're focusing about for\nthis particular show.\n\n13\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.819\nNow, this is going to run about 90\nminutes for the particular exam.\n\n14\n00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.501\nAnd, I know it says here on my\nscreen 55 to 60 questions, but\n\n15\n00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.276\nwe found some conflicting information\non Cisco's site that also\n\n16\n00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.250\nstates it could be up to 70 questions.\n\n17\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.220\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n18\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.365\nNow, if you're thinking about cost,\n\n19\n00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:12.401\nit's probably going to run you about\n$295 for this particular exam.\n\n20\n00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.353\nBut you might wanna just check\nlocally to verify that price.\n\n21\n00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:18.902\nAnd if you're wondering,\nwell where can I go and take that exam?\n\n22\n00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:22.964\nIf you click on this hyperlink, it'll\nnavigate you to the Pearson View website\n\n23\n00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:25.206\nand you'll be able to\nschedule your exam and\n\n24\n00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:29.345\nfind the nearest Pearson View testing\ncenter so that you can complete this exam.\n\n25\n00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.500\nNow, what about the details of the exam?\n\n26\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.530\nWhat is gonna be covered?\n\n27\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.260\nWhat should you know before\nyou get into that booth?\n\n28\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.100\nWell, maybe Ronnie Wong\ncan help us with that.\n\n29\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.340\nRonnie, what do you think?\n\n30\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.086\n&gt;&gt; Well as we get started\nin taking a look at\n\n31\n00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:45.020\nthe Cybersecurity Fundamentals Show We're\npretty much gonna take the exam objective\n\n32\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.040\noutline and cover all the topics that\nare right there on the exam objectives.\n\n33\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.050\nAs well as add in some personal\ndetails that should help you out\n\n34\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.790\nas you get ready for\nthe Cybersecurity Fundamentals.\n\n35\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.563\nRemember that the goal here is about\nfundamentals of cybersecurity.\n\n36\n00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:03.428\nSo we're not really getting super in\ndepth into a lot of the information, but\n\n37\n00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:06.060\nwe need to have at least\na basic coverage of it.\n\n38\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.650\nAnd that's what we'll do right here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.320\nSo, let's take a look at my screen again.\n\n40\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.650\nAnd that way we'll actually be able\nto show you a few different things.\n\n41\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.370\nAs you go to the Cisco learning website,\n\n42\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.290\nremember that you can always\nuse your favorite browser and\n\n43\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.130\njust type in the Cisco Cyber Ops and\nthat should lead you to a link.\n\n44\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.510\nAnd from there you can click\non the 210-250 on the SECFND.\n\n45\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.030\nOnce you have that, you can then\ngo to where it says exam topics.\n\n46\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.040\nAnd I do recommend that you do this as you\n\n47\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.000\ngo through our show as we start to film\nthat as well, because you'll see that what\n\n48\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.310\nwe'll do is we'll cover all\nthe topics listed right here.\n\n49\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.990\nAnd there are different\ndetails behind it and\n\n50\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.540\nyou can see how the exam breaks down and\nthe different percentages.\n\n51\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.127\nTo make it easier, of course, they have\nthe ability for you to download a complete\n\n52\n00:02:56.127 --> 00:03:00.198\nlist of the topics in a PDF format,\nto make it easier for you to print out.\n\n53\n00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.940\nSo that you can also go back and\n\n54\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.970\nensure that you're covering\neverything that you need to.\n\n55\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.335\nOnce you have that where you download it,\nhere's what it ends up looking like.\n\n56\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:14.110\nAnd what will follow in the format\nof our show is also going to\n\n57\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.490\nkind of really directly come from,\nwell, these fundamentals right here and\n\n58\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.000\nthese exams, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.199\nSo according to the official exam list,\n\n60\n00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.311\nremember that this is exactly\nwhat Cherokee was saying.\n\n61\n00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:29.050\nIt's about a 90 minute exam,\n60 to 70 questions.\n\n62\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.385\nYou can say between 55\nto 70 if you want to.\n\n63\n00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:36.440\nIt's gonna be about $295 US.\n\n64\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.910\nSo if you're in a different area in the\nworld, make sure you check your prices,\n\n65\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.070\ndon't go just by what I said because\nprices can change after time.\n\n66\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.180\nSo make sure you understand that,\nbut download a copy of this.\n\n67\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.710\nWe're gonna spend a good\nbit of time right here in\n\n68\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.140\nthe networking concepts themselves.\n\n69\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.240\nEven though\nthe CCNA Cyber Ops Certification\n\n70\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.560\ndoesn't really require you to\nhave any networking background.\n\n71\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.696\nWell they do question you about it,\nwhere they have 12% of the exam.\n\n72\n00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:09.131\nAnd we'll talk about the basic\nnetworking concepts and\n\n73\n00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.651\nwe'll spend a good bit of time in there,\nbecause it is fundamental knowledge for\n\n74\n00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.355\nyou to be able to do any\ntype of network monitoring.\n\n75\n00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:18.901\nYou have to at least understand basic\nprotocols as well as the devices on\n\n76\n00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:19.618\nthe network.\n\n77\n00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:23.889\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll make sure\nthat we cover a lot of these different\n\n78\n00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.094\njust basic networking concepts to ensure\nthat we have a good foundation for\n\n79\n00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:31.760\nwhere we will begin our cyber\nops training with, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.000\nWe'll also take a look, of course,\nat various security concepts here.\n\n81\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.960\nWell, we'll talk about\nthe basics of security.\n\n82\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.380\nWe'll talk about risks, threats,\nas well as vulnerabilities.\n\n83\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.120\nWe'll take a look, of course, at different\nterms that we need to understand and\n\n84\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.530\nencounter, especially in the business\nworld and the networking world as well.\n\n85\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.950\nWe'll also, of course,\n\n86\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.860\ntalk about some of the different ways\nthat we control access into our networks.\n\n87\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.840\nAnd then various terms that\nwe've come across even without\n\n88\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.860\nhaving to go to the level of what we call\ncybersecurity training today as well, and\n\n89\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.150\nwe'll see that.\n\n90\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.944\nThen we'll spend a little bit of time\nhere in the area of cryptography.\n\n91\n00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:10.865\nAnd what you'll have to also remember\nbecause this is one of their newest\n\n92\n00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:15.044\ncertifications that are out there,\nyou'll end up finding that some of these\n\n93\n00:05:15.044 --> 00:05:18.541\nparticular exam topics that you'll see,\nthey are very vague.\n\n94\n00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.907\nAnd this is where hopefully our show\nis going to help you out to be able to\n\n95\n00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:25.370\nreduce that definition down.\n\n96\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.210\nFor example, right here in this particular\nexam objectives, as you see it,\n\n97\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.410\nwhere it says describe how the success or\n\n98\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.790\nfailure of cryptographic exchange\nimpacts a security investigation.\n\n99\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.950\nWell, that is pretty vague, and\nif you're not exactly sure what\n\n100\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.116\nthe question actually means,\nwell, that's why you need help.\n\n101\n00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:48.954\nAnd that's why I show what we're going to\nbe doing is gonna help you to focus in on\n\n102\n00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.495\nwhat they're really pinpointing on and\ngetting ready for\n\n103\n00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.510\nthis type of exam as well.\n\n104\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.240\nAnd also of course,\n\n105\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.660\ngetting ready to be someone that goes into\nthe cybersecurity realm in your career.\n\n106\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.295\nWe're also gonna take a brief bit of time\nhere to talk about host-based security.\n\n107\n00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:08.850\nWe'll take a look at both Windows\nas well as Linux domains and\n\n108\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.470\ncomputers, so that we understand the good\ndifferences in monitoring utilities, and\n\n109\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.020\nof course, different security\nutilities that we have access in.\n\n110\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.682\nAnd lastly, we'll talk about\nnetwork security monitoring.\n\n111\n00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:24.346\nAnd actually next to last, I should say\nthe penultimate addition here is the idea\n\n112\n00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:29.012\nof security monitoring, talk about\ndifferent types of data that we're looking\n\n113\n00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:33.780\nfor as well as some of the different\ntools that we need to be familiar with.\n\n114\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.480\nAnd also of course,\nwhat we're normally monitoring for\n\n115\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.930\non the network in terms of traffic.\n\n116\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.180\nWe'll also briefly take some time and\n\n117\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.130\nintroduce you to the concepts of\nthe Cisco Firepower Management Center,\n\n118\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.450\nas well as the Cisco Fire Site\nManagement Console as well.\n\n119\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.979\nSo that you can take a look at this idea\nof the next generation IPS events types.\n\n120\n00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.077\nSo we'll be able to show you all those\ndifferent aspects that should help you out\n\n121\n00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:03.519\nas well as you start seeing more and\nmore of this in today's world.\n\n122\n00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:07.750\nLastly, we'll round out everything that\nwe'll do by spending a good bit of\n\n123\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.850\ntime and\ntaking a look at attack methodology.\n\n124\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.640\nNow a good fifth of the entire exam\nis based on methodologies here,\n\n125\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.280\nso 21% of the entire exam is right here.\n\n126\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.680\nBut the great thing about this, and\n\n127\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.710\nI know this is gonna sound a little\nbit unusual that I say it's great.\n\n128\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.200\nBut a lot of this is more memorization,\nit's understanding the basic concepts.\n\n129\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.060\nEven though we show you and\nwe explain to you some of the attacks,\n\n130\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.330\nthis one is really about memorization\nof a lot of these concepts.\n\n131\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.800\nSo make sure that you understand that.\n\n132\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.589\nBut we'll go through every single\none of these exam objectives to\n\n133\n00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.641\nensure that we get a good,\nproper coverage of everything\n\n134\n00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:53.394\nthat you actually end up finding\non the SECFND exam, that 210-250.\n\n135\n00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:57.620\nThat way you'll make sure that\nyou go into the exam prepared.\n\n136\n00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.060\nMake sure you also do\nyour own studying here.\n\n137\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.660\nThere is nothing else that will prepare\nyou better than the content that you'll\n\n138\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.550\nget right here at ITProTV, but\nas well as putting your own study and\n\n139\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.710\nyour own time and effort into learning\nabout these different concepts.\n\n140\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.350\nSo if you're ready for your challenge and\nentry into the, really,\n\n141\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.700\nnext generation of all\nsecurity in the IT world,\n\n142\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.060\nwhich is gonna be cybersecurity, this\nis the perfect place for you to begin.\n\n143\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.963\nAnd we're glad that you're\nactually ready for it, and\n\n144\n00:08:26.963 --> 00:08:28.703\nwe'll
