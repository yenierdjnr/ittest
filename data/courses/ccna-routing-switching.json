          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,311\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,622\nThe Cisco Certified Network Associate,\nor CCNA,\n\n3\n00:00:10,622 --> 00:00:15,520\nis one of the most well-known\ncertifications in IT networking.\n\n4\n00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,060\nIt's designed to demonstrate that you\nhave a intermediate level of knowledge\n\n5\n00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,680\nwith Cisco equipment, particularly\ntheir routers, and their switches.\n\n6\n00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,550\nNow there are multiple versions\nof the CCNA, and for this\n\n7\n00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,400\nparticular ITProTV show, we're talking\nabout the CCNA routing and switching.\n\n8\n00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,030\nFocus is on routers and switches.\n\n9\n00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,880\nThere's also the CCNA security,\nwhich focuses on the ASA firewalls,\n\n10\n00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,670\nand several other variations that focus on\nother things, like wireless, and voice,\n\n11\n00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,770\nservice provider equipment and so on.\n\n12\n00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,180\nBut the CCNA routing and\n\n13\n00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,880\nswitching, that's the one most\npeople think of when they say, CCNA.\n\n14\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,620\nThe certification's designed to show\nthat you understand how to take Cisco\n\n15\n00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,330\nrouters and Cisco switches from\na factory default configuration, and\n\n16\n00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,950\nget them configured in\nsmall to medium networks.\n\n17\n00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,600\nWe're talking about networks that range\nin size from 10 to 100 routers or\n\n18\n00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440\n10 to 100 switches.\n\n19\n00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,040\nIn mixed environments, a headquarters and\nbranch offices, that type of situation.\n\n20\n00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,460\nAnd there are various technologies we need\nto configure that go beyond just a basic\n\n21\n00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,210\nrouter configuration like what you might\nhave in a small office or home office.\n\n22\n00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,000\nThere's also some advanced functionality\nthe routers and switches can do that move\n\n23\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,040\nbeyond basic functionality, and start to\nget our switches acting more like routers,\n\n24\n00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,700\nor our routers performing functions\nthat traditional routers don't even do.\n\n25\n00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,380\nSo, really interesting\nstuff that's out there.\n\n26\n00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,620\nCCNA is one of the more rewarding\ncertifications I find in that you\n\n27\n00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,560\njust learn a lot of cool\nstuff that you can do.\n\n28\n00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,670\nSo it's a good time, and\nit's a fun certification to get.\n\n29\n00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,430\nIt's one of the favorite ones\nthat I've gotten over the years.\n\n30\n00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,320\nNow, if you want to pursue this CCNA,\nthere's a few things we need to remember.\n\n31\n00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,910\nFirst off, it is expected that\nyou already have the CCENT.\n\n32\n00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,200\nThe Cisco Certified Entry\nNetwork Technician.\n\n33\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,080\nSo if you're just getting\nstarted with Cisco,\n\n34\n00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,510\nyou should probably jump over to\nthe CCENT show and start there.\n\n35\n00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,780\nThat's designed for people that have not\nworked with Cisco equipment before and\n\n36\n00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,540\nare just getting started.\n\n37\n00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,650\nBut if you've already got some experience\nwith Cisco equipment, if you've set up\n\n38\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,005\na few routers and switches,\nyou've already got that basic knowledge.\n\n39\n00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:20,270\nAnd you'll find that the CCENT\nmight be a little boring or\n\n40\n00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,830\nbeneath your knowledge level,\nbecause you've already done it.\n\n41\n00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,480\nAnd for you,\nyou can start right here in the CCNA.\n\n42\n00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,250\nJust understand that Cisco will assume\nyou have the knowledge of the CCENT.\n\n43\n00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,370\nSo I encourage you just to read over the\noutline for that exam, and just make sure\n\n44\n00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,250\nyou don't see anything in there that\njumps out at you as new or unexpected.\n\n45\n00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,585\nIf you see anything, maybe you just watch\nthose particular episodes of the CCENT.\n\n46\n00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,520\nSo, there are two different ways\nto get the CCNA routing and\n\n47\n00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,020\nswitching certification.\n\n48\n00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,890\nAnd it all comes down to whether\nyou have that CCENT or not.\n\n49\n00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,420\nAlright.\n\n50\n00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,780\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n51\n00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,700\nHere's the Cisco webpage for\nthe CCNA routing and switching.\n\n52\n00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,580\nAnd you'll see it's\na mid-tier certification.\n\n53\n00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,240\nIt's above the CCENT, but\nnot at the professional level of a CCENP.\n\n54\n00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,770\nAnd for the exams,\nthere's two different exam scenarios.\n\n55\n00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,600\nIf you already have\nthe CCENT certification,\n\n56\n00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,690\nthat's this exam right here, the 100-101.\n\n57\n00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,820\nSo if you've completed that certification,\nthen you just need to do\n\n58\n00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,880\nthe 200-101 exam, or the ICND2 exam,\nand that will get you your CCNA.\n\n59\n00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,000\nIf you don't have your CCENT,\nthen you'll do the 200-120 exam.\n\n60\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920\nThis guy right here.\n\n61\n00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,500\nAnd it's made up of questions\ndrawn from both exams,\n\n62\n00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,310\ndrawn from the 100-101 and the 200-101.\n\n63\n00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,140\nSo it's called a composite exam,\nit just combines them together.\n\n64\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,630\nNow, the composite exam is the same\ncost as adding these two together.\n\n65\n00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,690\nSo you don't save money by doing that,\nyou just save time.\n\n66\n00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,790\nThe exam, well, it takes time.\n\n67\n00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,020\nIt takes you going down to\nthe testing center and taking it.\n\n68\n00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,960\nSo, two exams versus one exam.\n\n69\n00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,830\nIt's just all about how\nmuch time you have.\n\n70\n00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,610\nPersonally, I encourage people\nto complete the CCENT first.\n\n71\n00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,220\nBut, while I do encourage people\nto do that, I didn't do it myself.\n\n72\n00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,640\nThe CCENT wasn't when I\ngot certified originally.\n\n73\n00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,690\nBut even today, I've never gone\nback to do it because, well,\n\n74\n00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,620\nonce you have the advanced\ncertifications you don't really need it.\n\n75\n00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,740\nBut it is great if you're getting\nstarted out because it gives you a nice\n\n76\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,620\neasy entry point into the certification.\n\n77\n00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,110\nNow the exam itself covers\na wide range of topics.\n\n78\n00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,400\nIt covers everything in the CCENT outline,\nand\n\n79\n00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,030\nthen it goes beyond that with\nthe advanced functionality.\n\n80\n00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,010\nAnd you're really just getting to larger\nnetworks in the CCNA side, and so\n\n81\n00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,500\nit's really working with\nthe same stuff from CCENT,\n\n82\n00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,820\njust making it a little more complex.\n\n83\n00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,860\nLet's look at the actual exam.\n\n84\n00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,150\nThe exam is between 50 and 60 questions,\nand it is only 75 minutes long.\n\n85\n00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,530\nNow that sounds like you get\nabout a minute per question,\n\n86\n00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,030\nwhich is enough for\na multiple choice question I suppose.\n\n87\n00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,600\nBut, you don't really have\na lot of time to dally.\n\n88\n00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300\nYou need to know the right answer.\n\n89\n00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,690\nYou read the question, and you answer it.\n\n90\n00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,310\nYou don't sit there and think,\nwell let me see, is it like this?\n\n91\n00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,240\nIs it like that?\n\n92\n00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,865\nThey don't give you enough time to try and\nextrapolate an answer on your own.\n\n93\n00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,030\nYou gotta know it and move on.\n\n94\n00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,160\nThe other thing that makes it more\nchallenging is they're not just multiple\n\n95\n00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000\nchoice questions.\n\n96\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,290\nYou'll see drag and drop questions,\nand you'll see stimulation questions.\n\n97\n00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,830\nOnes where they give you\na simulated set of routers or\n\n98\n00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,430\na stimulated set of switches.\n\n99\n00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,210\nAnd you have to troubleshoot or\n\n100\n00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,780\nconfigure some functionality\nthat they've described to you.\n\n101\n00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,740\nSo you've actually got to get in there and\ndo some work.\n\n102\n00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,700\nThose questions take some time.\n\n103\n00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,270\nAnd if you spend too long doing those,\n\n104\n00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,120\nyou might not be able to get to\nall the questions on the exam.\n\n105\n00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,310\nSo it is very important that you study,\nthat you practice, and\n\n106\n00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,450\nthat you're ready when you go\ninto that testing booth so\n\n107\n00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,169\nyou know the content\nthey're going to be asking.\n\n108\n00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,400\nThe exam is proctored through Pearson VUE,\nwhich is an international company.\n\n109\n00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,650\nThey have testing centers\nlocated all around the world and\n\n110\n00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,650\nmore than likely have one near you.\n\n111\n00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,080\nYou can find out by going to\nwww.pearsonvue.com/cisco.\n\n112\n00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,860\nThat'll take you to\ntheir page where you can\n\n113\n00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,970\ncheck for\na testing center that's nearest to you.\n\n114\n00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,230\nYou can register for the exam,\npay for it, go and take the exam.\n\n115\n00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,480\nAnd then when you pass,\nyou'll receive you'r CCNA certification.\n\n116\n00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,410\nNow the exam topics themselves,\n\n117\n00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,350\nI'll just scroll down here a little bit,\nare divided up into five areas.\n\n118\n00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,610\nWe start with switching.\n\n119\n00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,130\nThere's a lot of switching technologies\nthat didn't get addressed in\n\n120\n00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,380\nthe CCENT certification.\n\n121\n00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,770\nSo in CCENT, for example, we talked about\nspanning tree protocol a little bit.\n\n122\n00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,350\nAnd so we'll see more advanced\nspanning tree protocol here.\n\n123\n00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,480\nAs well as VLAN trunking protocol and\n\n124\n00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,310\nother technologies related to\nmore advanced functionality.\n\n125\n00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,480\nYou'll also get your first\nintroduction to layer three switching,\n\n126\n00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,510\nwhich are switches that act like routers.\n\n127\n00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,390\nAnd that's pretty neat stuff\ncuz we're seeing more and\n\n128\n00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,660\nmore of those out in the real world.\n\n129\n00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,070\nThen we go into routing.\n\n130\n00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,510\nAnd notice the routing and switching\ncombined makes up almost 50% of the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,880\nSo about half of the exam is made\nup of practical configurations.\n\n132\n00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,660\nAnd on the routing side we start moving\ninto advanced routing protocols.\n\n133\n00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,770\nThings like EIGRP and OSPF, and\ngetting a chance to see how they work,\n\n134\n00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,890\nand how they optimize your network and\nmake decisions.\n\n135\n00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,530\nThen, we get into IP services.\n\n136\n00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,440\nNow, IP services makes up a smaller\nportion of the exam because, well,\n\n137\n00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,580\na lot of it was covered in CCENT.\n\n138\n00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,190\nBut the other IP services have kind\nof been shifted off to the CCNA\n\n139\n00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,620\nsecurity certification or\nwireless service provider.\n\n140\n00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,590\nSo they've kind of been moved over\nto those other certifications.\n\n141\n00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,350\nSo here it's more of a informational,\nyou know, making sure we\n\n142\n00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,280\nunderstand what are some of the different\nIP services that are available.\n\n143\n00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,380\nThen we got troubleshooting,\n\n144\n00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,750\nand make troubleshooting makes\nup one-third of the exam.\n\n145\n00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,890\nA big chunk of the exam\non just how to figure out\n\n146\n00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,890\nwhy something isn't working the way\nthat it should, and how to correct it.\n\n147\n00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,320\nAnd then we wrap it talking about wide\narea network, or WAN technologies.\n\n148\n00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,560\nWe get a chance to see things like frame\nrelay, get a little introduction on MPLS.\n\n149\n00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,180\nAnd a couple of the other\ntechnologies you might see out there\n\n150\n00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,780\nas you get connected to the Internet, or\n\n151\n00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,830\nat least get long distance connections\nbetween different locations.\n\n152\n00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,180\nSo, good information, definitely\nthings that we want to know, and\n\n153\n00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,655\nit's all gearing us up to be able\nto configure medium size network.\n\n154\n00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:24,500\nNetworks with a headquarters, the branch\noffices, with 10 to a 100 devices,\n\n155\n00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,520\nrouters and switches that are out there,\nand a pretty good size network.\n\n156\n00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,120\nSo, it's a great certification to get.\n\n157\n00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,050\nThis is normally the certification\nthat people target\n\n158\n00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,200\nwhen they're ready to go out there and\nget their first network administrator job.\n\n159\n00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,310\nPrior to this a lot of people\nwill have more generic type jobs,\n\n160\n00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,790\njobs where you're part system admin,\npart network admin.\n\n161\n00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,840\nBut once we start going all network,\n\n162\n00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,220\nCCNA is usually the first\nstep that gets us there.\n\n163\n00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,800\nSo it is a great certification, and\none that I really enjoyed myself.\n\n164\n00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,900\nWell if that sounds like something you\nwanna do, then you're in the right place.\n\n165\n00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,080\nStay tuned, we've got our CCNA\nepisodes coming up in just a moment.\n\n166\n00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,770\nIf, on the other hand,\nyou aren't in the right place,\n\n167\n00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,200\nif you wanna go check out the CCENT first,\ndefinitely do so.\n\n168\n00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,580\nIt's all part of your\nITProTV subscription, so\n\n169\n00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,380\njust jump right over there and\nwatch it, right?\n\n170\n00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,250\nSo for those of you that need to do that,\ngo ahead, no hard feelings there.\n\n171\n00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,160\nBut for those of you that are sticking\nwith me, well, stay tuned.\n\n172\n00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,436\nWe've got episodes coming up next.\n\n173\n00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:27,679\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
