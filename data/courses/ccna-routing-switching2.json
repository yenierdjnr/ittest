you to\nthe new ICND2 content, getting ready for\n\n4\n00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:20.167\nthat CCNA routing and\nswitching exam, Exam number 200-105.\n\n5\n00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.372\nAnd here to give us some details\non it is gonna be Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:24.141\nThank you for joining us.\n\n7\n00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:26.151\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nit's great to be here and be back.\n\n8\n00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.072\nWe're gonna jump into ICND2.\n\n9\n00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:33.190\nHopefully you've gone though ICND1 and\nCCENT, and maybe even took your exam and\n\n10\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.511\nthat's under your belt.\n\n11\n00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:37.996\nOr you're looking to build some more\nfoundation before you take your CCENT,\n\n12\n00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.410\nthat's a good idea.\n\n13\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.320\nAll right, so in these episodes\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.350\nstart with deep understanding\nof switching, all right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.400\nWe're gonna do enhanced switching,\nand that includes\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.580\na deep dive into spanning tree protocol\nand rapid spanning tree protocol.\n\n17\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.620\nAlso, back on the objectives\nfrom at least six years ago\n\n18\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.014\non the CCNA is something\ncalled virtual trunk protocol.\n\n19\n00:01:00.014 --> 00:01:04.740\nSo it's back, right, and we're gonna\ngo through VTP and learn how to use\n\n20\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.400\nthat in CDP to find your bridge and to\nupdate your databases and stuff like that.\n\n21\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.550\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and have\nsome fun after we get through all those\n\n22\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.850\nepisodes, and hit something ether\nchannel where we're bundling things.\n\n23\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.009\nSo we're not using spanning tree, really,\nor we're gonna bundle our links so\n\n24\n00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.850\nspanning tree sees it as one link.\n\n25\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.209\nAnd then we're gonna hit HSRP, which\nis somewhat of a disappointment to me,\n\n26\n00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.314\nbecause we really shouldn't use HSRP\ntoday, you should be using GLBP.\n\n27\n00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.578\nBut in the new objectives\nthey came out with in 2016,\n\n28\n00:01:32.578 --> 00:01:36.185\nthey took that off when it was on before,\nand only left on HSRP.\n\n29\n00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:38.700\nAnd that's a mistake as far as I can tell.\n\n30\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.333\nBut, we're gonna go through HSRP\nin detail, we're gonna use it,\n\n31\n00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.364\nyou're gonna pass your CCNA and\nthen never use HSRP again, only use GLBP.\n\n32\n00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:48.357\nAll right, and we'll talk about that.\n\n33\n00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:52.743\nAll right, then we're gonna hit\na deep dive into EIGRP and EIGRPv6.\n\n34\n00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:54.946\nWe're gonna spend a good\namount of time on that,\n\n35\n00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:58.975\nreally understanding it's a routing\nprotocol that just always seems to work.\n\n36\n00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:02.593\nAnd unlike the next episode after that,\nOSPF E2 and OSPF E3,\n\n37\n00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:07.165\nit's a little more convoluted and we have\na little bit more work to do with OSPF,\n\n38\n00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:10.119\nand a little bit more\nfundamental understanding.\n\n39\n00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.855\nSo it is a much bigger section than\nit is on EIGRP cuz there's just so\n\n40\n00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:14.803\nmuch more to it.\n\n41\n00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.961\nAll right, so after that we're\ngonna hit troubleshooting.\n\n42\n00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:22.375\nI'm gonna go back to all our routing\nprotocols, and default routes.\n\n43\n00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:26.660\nAnd we're going to look at IP and\nIPv6 access lists,\n\n44\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.719\nboth standard and extended, right?\n\n45\n00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.564\nSo, in the CCENT only covered\nstandard access lists, but\n\n46\n00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:38.960\nnow they don't get real big into extended\naccess lists in the CCNA anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.710\nBut in the troubleshooting section,\nwe're gonna have to understand\n\n48\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.350\nextended access lists and\nbe able to troubleshoot both IP 4 and\n\n49\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.350\nIP version 6 and\nthat's kinda a new objective there.\n\n50\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.070\nThen, we're gonna go and hit, in the\ntroubleshooting section, we've got SPAN\n\n51\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.690\nand we've got service level agreements\nthat we're gonna use to troubleshoot and\n\n52\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.360\ntest our networks with, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.070\nSo then after that we're\ngonna hit wide area networks.\n\n54\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.290\nNow, the good news is,\nafter all of these years,\n\n55\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.260\nFrame Relay is no longer on a CCNA,\nthat is so long overdue.\n\n56\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.860\nSo starting in 2016 they took out the\nFrame Relay and we've got more PPP really.\n\n57\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.470\nSo we still have some serial links, right?\n\n58\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.270\nI don't see those a lot in any of\nmy customers too much anymore.\n\n59\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.230\nBut if you have serial links,\nyou can still run HTLC,\n\n60\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.080\nthat's still in the objectives,\nbut PPP, multi-link PPP.\n\n61\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.590\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nhit our tunnels,\n\n62\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.540\nwe'll top out VPN, build a GRE tunnel.\n\n63\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.020\nAnd then we're gonna end with a really\nfun lab on BGP, border gateway protocols.\n\n64\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.850\nSo that's a new objective as well.\n\n65\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.650\nAnd then we're gonna end with\nnetwork device security and\n\n66\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.230\nevolution of intelligent networks.\n\n67\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.030\nThose will be our last episodes.\n\n68\n00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.312\nThey're not nearly as long, so we start\noff with really long episodes, right?\n\n69\n00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:49.658\nWe kinda then have some fun,\nget into EIGRP,\n\n70\n00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:54.780\nget into some real heavy depth in OSPF and\ntroubleshooting, right?\n\n71\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.888\nAnd then we end up with\nsome fun new stuff, right?\n\n72\n00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:01.377\nThat's how the new ICND2 is gonna go,\nso stick around.\n\n73\n00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:04.740\nLet's head, right now,\ninto enhanced switching.\n\n74\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.507\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle describes and configures how a CCNA candidate deals with switch loop problems such as broadcast storms, multiple source paths and mac-address table instabilities.  He demonstrates how STP, Spanning-Tree Protocol, works to stop these problems by creating a single path for data to the Root Bridge.  He describes the STP Root Bridge Selection and how non-root bridges decides it’s root port as well as how to decide whether ports block or forward data.   Todd also introduces the different STP standards of 802.1d, 802.1w, and 802.1s.",

00:00:19.813\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're going into our CCNA Routing and\n\n4\n00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:21.570\nSwitching Content.\n\n5\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.834\nWe're getting ready for this brand new\nexam and in our studios today that's\n\n6\n00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:28.054\ngonna help us along to make sure that\nwe're focused in on what we need to be.\n\n7\n00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.863\nMr. Todd Lammle, thank you for\njoining us in our studio.\n\n8\n00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.740\n>> Thank you, Ronnie,\nit's good to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.625\nLet's dive right into the ICND2\nobjective for enhanced switching.\n\n10\n00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:40.043\nThat's gonna be spanning tree,\nEtherChannel and a couple other things,\n\n11\n00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:43.960\nport fast, we're gonna get\nthrough some of those things.\n\n12\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.430\nSo let's dive into the objectives.\n\n13\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.192\nThis is a huge objective for\nICND2, no doubt about it.\n\n14\n00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:54.120\nSo [COUGH] one of the other things that\nthey have in the objectives is a review\n\n15\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.910\nof just basic VLANs and trunks and\naccess links and voice links.\n\n16\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.210\nAnd so although I'm not gonna review\nthem here because we covered them and\n\n17\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.220\nyou have an option to go back to them.\n\n18\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.068\nJust understand they are part of\nthe objectives, so let's go ahead and\n\n19\n00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:07.735\ndive right into spanning tree right now.\n\n20\n00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.522\nFirst off we want a redundant connection,\n\n21\n00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.980\nwe want multiple\nconnections between links.\n\n22\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.180\nAnd when we get to our next episode,\n\n23\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.150\nwe'll get to our next section\nof enhanced switching.\n\n24\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.139\nWe'll see that we're gonna talk about\nEtherChannel where we're connecting\n\n25\n00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:25.230\nmultiple links together between switches.\n\n26\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.060\nSo right now we love spanning tree,\nwe have multiple links and\n\n27\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.210\nif we didn't have spanning tree to shut\ndown extra ports, we'd have a loop, right?\n\n28\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.110\nSo if we don't implement this correctly,\nwe're gonna have a loop at layer two.\n\n29\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470\nNow the problem with the loop at layer\ntwo is your network still works,\n\n30\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.290\njust albeit very slowly and it's\nextremely difficult to find this problem.\n\n31\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.470\nThat's why this is a death sentence\nif you get a loop at layer two.\n\n32\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.040\nSo it's pretty funny, it's like we love\nspanning tree, we get the EtherChannel up.\n\n33\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.120\nWe hate spanning-tree, right,\nit's like I want all my links up.\n\n34\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.440\nAll right, so we're gonna be\na little different here anyways.\n\n35\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.080\nSo we wanna eliminate\nsingle points of failures.\n\n36\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.670\nBut let's take a look down here,\nyou can't see this.\n\n37\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.920\nBroadcast storms, multiple frame copies,\nMAC address instability problems.\n\n38\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.880\nBecause we don't know where the MAC\naddress is coming in on multiple ports.\n\n39\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.170\nThis is all what happens if we don't\nimplement a redundant topology correctly.\n\n40\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.806\nSo what we're going to do,\nby default, the spanning\n\n41\n00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:28.340\ntree creates a blocked port and\nnetwork is just simple like this.\n\n42\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.080\nSo it stops us from having a loop.\n\n43\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.250\nNow this happens on all IOS\nswitches by default, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.190\nWe run a certain kind 802.1d,\nthey came out in 1977, all right.\n\n45\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.170\nSo we're running the same version.\n\n46\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.710\nNow Cisco runs an enhanced version we'll\ntalk about, it's called PVST+ right here,\n\n47\n00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.120\nPer VLAN Spanning Tree.\n\n48\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.070\nAnd we'll talk about why they do this and\nhow this enhances it and it really does.\n\n49\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.550\nSo we take the original one and\n\n50\n00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.240\nmake it proprietary by having an enhanced\nprotocol on top of it, PVST+, all right?\n\n51\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.450\nSo by doing this, having this STP,\nloop-free redundant network topology,\n\n52\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.350\nwe place certain ports\nin the blocking state.\n\n53\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.810\nWhich stop us from,\nwe will no longer have a loop, so\n\n54\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.750\nif it comes here, then it won't come\nout here, it will only go out this way.\n\n55\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.660\nWe have to have only one port per\ndesignated segment forwarding.\n\n56\n00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.280\nIf we have both, then we'll end\nup with a loop here, all right.\n\n57\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.580\nSo we have the original one and this is\nwhy we use the term bridge now today.\n\n58\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.500\nSo when we talk about spanning tree,\nI'm not gonna use the term switching.\n\n59\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.544\nCisco's not gonna use the term\nswitching when they get into this,\n\n60\n00:03:38.544 --> 00:03:40.180\nbetter say the term bridges.\n\n61\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.950\nBecause that's all we had\nwhen this came out and\n\n62\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.010\nwhen we're talking about spanning tree,\nwe're referring to bridges.\n\n63\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.368\nSwitches are multiport bridges, right?\n\n64\n00:03:48.368 --> 00:03:52.132\nNow the spanning-tree root port selection,\nso\n\n65\n00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:57.530\nbasically we have to determine\nwho's the king of our network.\n\n66\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.210\nWho's the king of and well the way Cisco\nlooks at it Per VLAN Spanning Tree,\n\n67\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.080\nwho's the king of our VLAN, all right?\n\n68\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.190\nAnd so all roads lead to Rome in\nthe sense that we have the king in Rome,\n\n69\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.980\nthat's our root bridge.\n\n70\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.630\nAnd every other switch must make\na single path to that root bridge.\n\n71\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.660\nEvery other bridge must make\na single path to that root bridge.\n\n72\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.130\nAll other ports are either designated or\nshut down, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.712\nOr disabled, now so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this.\n\n74\n00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:28.610\nSo I have switch X here and switch Y and\n\n75\n00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.268\nwhat we wanna do is look at what's\ncalled the bridge ID, bridge ID.\n\n76\n00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:36.087\nNow this comprises of\na bridge priority and\n\n77\n00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:38.836\nby the way, so we can see this right here.\n\n78\n00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:42.482\n32768 is a, you can expand this out,\n\n79\n00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:47.548\n32768 is a default, so\nit's 0 through 65535,\n\n80\n00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:52.850\nso we're kind of right in\nthe middle there, aren't we?\n\n81\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.390\nThat's the default on all\nCisco IOS switches, right?\n\n82\n00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.480\nSo they're all the same.\n\n83\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.390\nSo when they're the same,\nnow we're gonna use the MAC address, so\n\n84\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.100\nwe combine these two.\n\n85\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.570\nWhoever has the lowest MAC address,\nlowest priority becomes your root bridge.\n\n86\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.360\nSo in this case here, we've both\nhave the same priority and then but\n\n87\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.840\nwe have look it here 1111 and 2222, right?\n\n88\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.840\nThat's not reality, but\nin this case that's how we do it, so\n\n89\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.260\nthis guy is gonna become\nwhat's called my root bridge.\n\n90\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.080\nAll ports on the root bridge\nare forwarding and can never be blocked or\n\n91\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.490\ndiscarded nothing, right?\n\n92\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.323\nSo they're all forwarding.\n\n93\n00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:35.569\nNow, we come over here to what's\nreferred to as the non-root bridge and\n\n94\n00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.320\nwe have to make a single\npath to the root bridge.\n\n95\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.590\nNow on this drawing here I can't\nreally tell if this was a one gig and\n\n96\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.690\nthis was a fast ethernet,\nthen we choose this port.\n\n97\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.190\nThis would be my what's\ncalled a root port.\n\n98\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.490\nNow remember a root port is\nnot the same as a root bridge.\n\n99\n00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.490\nRoute bridges can't have root ports.\n\n100\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.180\nRoute port is my single\npath to the root bridge.\n\n101\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.669\nThis other port would go into blocking.\n\n102\n00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:09.916\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\n\n103\n00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:15.590\ntake a look at a couple\nof other examples here.\n\n104\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.772\nOne root bridge per broadcast domain,\none root bridge per broadcast domain.\n\n105\n00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:21.810\nSo this is what, I just want to\ngo ahead and explain all these.\n\n106\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.190\nPer VLAN Spanning Tree+, so for\nevery VLAN, I'm going to have a king.\n\n107\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.670\nA root bridge.\n\n108\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.600\nAnd every other bridge in that VLAN must\nmake a single path to the root bridge.\n\n109\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.990\nSo my switch might be the king for\n\n110\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.500\nmultiple VLANs or one and\nanother switch could be I want it.\n\n111\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.060\nIt helps us have efficiency and I'll\nshow you this in our drawing in a bit.\n\n112\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.830\nOkay, that's not the most\nimportant thing right now.\n\n113\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.690\nWe'll determine how that\nbecomes efficient in a minute.\n\n114\n00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.270\nBut anyways, we need to understand\nthat we have only one root bridge.\n\n115\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.060\nAll other bridges in that VLAN,\nie broadcast domain.\n\n116\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.309\nVLAN equals broadcast domain\nequals the subnet, right?\n\n117\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.390\nAll must make a single\npath to that root bridge.\n\n118\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.750\nThat single path,\nthat port that they use is called a what?\n\n119\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.550\nRoot port.\n\n120\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.313\nSo if I saw an output and\nit showed a root port,\n\n121\n00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:19.179\nI would know that was a non-root bridge,\nokay?\n\n122\n00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:26.130\nNow all other switches in that broadcast\ndomain, ie subnet, ie VLAN, same thing.\n\n123\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.560\nWe'll have only one root port,\nthat's how we have a single path.\n\n124\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.698\nOne root port per non-root bridge.\n\n125\n00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:36.290\nNow again, same thing, only one root port.\n\n126\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.970\nOne designated port per segment.\n\n127\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.260\nSo on this case here,\nlet's take a look down here and\n\n128\n00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.450\nsee this guy's the root bridge.\n\n129\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.167\nAnd then this guy's the non-root\nbridge based on the bridge ID, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:51.659\nSo these are all gonna be, these\nare referred to as designated, whoops,\n\n131\n00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:55.582\ndesignated forwarding ports,\ndesignated forwarding ports.\n\n132\n00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:59.031\nA root bridge cannot have\na blocked port or a root port.\n\n133\n00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.154\nThere are only gonna be designated ports.\n\n134\n00:08:02.154 --> 00:08:06.896\nOkay, so once we determine, so he's gonna\nforward both on here's a ten base T and\n\n135\n00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:07.810\n100 base T.\n\n136\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.900\nAnd we'll get to the difference\non what that means in a minute.\n\n137\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.460\nThis guy is my root port\nbased on bandwidth.\n\n138\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.630\nSo the first thing it uses is bandwidth\nto determine the root port, okay.\n\n139\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.765\nSo then on the non-root,\n\n140\n00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:26.290\non the one that wasn't as good path to the\nroute bridge it's gonna be non-designated.\n\n141\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.170\nSo now I have one designated\nport per segment.\n\n142\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.590\nThat's what this is here.\n\n143\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.510\nOne route port per non-route bridge.\n\n144\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.040\nOkay, so and\nthen one route port per broadcast domain.\n\n145\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.330\nOkay, so the spanning tree operation that\nfollows these steps, elects a root bridge.\n\n146\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.260\nSo these are the steps that we're gonna\ngo through that you must understand.\n\n147\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.760\nThis is critical for your CCNA.\n\n148\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.520\nYou must be able to find your root bridge.\n\n149\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.050\nYou must be able to understand\nhow it became a root bridge.\n\n150\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.030\nYou must be able to find the root\nports and designated ports and\n\n151\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.945\nthe blocking or discarding ports.\n\n152\n00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:03.310\nNow so number one,\nwe're gonna elect a root bridge.\n\n153\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.780\nThis is based on what?\n\n154\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.590\nBridge ID.\n\n155\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.160\nRemember that bridge ID is a base of\nmy bridge priority plus Mac address,\n\n156\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.320\nthe lower the better.\n\n157\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.210\nNow, so if I have a priority of 32768\nwhich ever one does, and I lower mine, and\n\n158\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.560\nthey are done in increments of 4096.\n\n159\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.460\nIf I lowered mine 16,384 for example,\nI immediately become root bridge.\n\n160\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.620\nAnd you be careful there,\nyou will now go down for\n\n161\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.240\nabout a minute on that VLAN, right.\n\n162\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.760\nBecause you just changed your root bridge.\n\n163\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.970\nAll of the non-root bridges must make\na single path to that root bridge.\n\n164\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.240\nAnd that takes about a minute by default.\n\n165\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.200\nWe can change that, but\nthat's the default.\n\n166\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.630\nNow, we then need to elect a root port.\n\n167\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:47.390\nSo once we elect a root bridge using\na bridge ID, we elect a root port.\n\n168\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.410\nWe find a root port for all the non\nroot bridges that's based on bandwidth.\n\n169\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:58.090\nSo the first ones based on bridge ID, then\nwe check our bandwidth from each non-root\n\n170\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.940\nbridge to the root bridge, to determine\nwhich one has the best bandwidth.\n\n171\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.320\nAnd the one with the best\nbandwidth becomes my root port.\n\n172\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.940\nNow, for each segment that's neither\nconnected to the root bridge, right.\n\n173\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.550\nWe're connected between other bridges,\nwe're gonna elect only one.\n\n174\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.750\nNow, this again is based on bridge ID,\nbetween the two non-root bridges.\n\n175\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.030\nThere gonna look at each other and\nsay, my bridge ID is lower\n\n176\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.460\nI'm forwarding on this segment\nyou're blocking or discarding and\n\n177\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.150\nthen all other ports world then transition\nto the four inner blocking state.\n\n178\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.840\nThis is considered, now we're converged\nspanning tree is now converged.\n\n179\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.400\nLike a routing protocol,\nspanning tree must converge at layer two.\n\n180\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.140\nSo a lot of times you can tell you have a\nspanning tree problem because people will\n\n181\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.950\ncall you and say, well my network\nworks for about 15 minutes,\n\n182\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.490\nthen it goes down for about a minute.\n\n183\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.320\nMy network works for about 15 minutes,\nthen it goes down for about a minute.\n\n184\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.440\nBing, you have a spanning tree problem.\n\n185\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.000\nIt's not converging, why?\n\n186\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.100\nBecause it's not set up efficiently and\nyour root bridges are too far away.\n\n187\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.310\nAnd they time out before\nthey can converge.\n\n188\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.430\nAll right, so that's if everything says,\nit goes down for about a minute.\n\n189\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.490\nTwo things you're running an old\nversion of spanning-tree, and\n\n190\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.290\nyou should be running the newer version,\nbut that's the default.\n\n191\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.230\nIf you don't touch anything\nthat is the default.\n\n192\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.560\n8021D takes about a minute to converge.\n\n193\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.654\nNow let's go ahead and take a look\nat this spanning-tree operation and\n\n194\n00:11:20.654 --> 00:11:23.043\nsee if you guys can figure\nout the root bridge and\n\n195\n00:11:23.043 --> 00:11:25.448\nthat we're going to do\na couple of things here.\n\n196\n00:11:25.448 --> 00:11:27.111\nAlthough this one says,\nthe root bridge up here.\n\n197\n00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.059\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I told you that.\n\n198\n00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:31.213\nBy looking at the MAC\naddresses this is your,\n\n199\n00:11:31.213 --> 00:11:33.942\nI can't see this all the way\nI'm not sure why it came out.\n\n200\n00:11:33.942 --> 00:11:39.214\n0C00 and then all ones over\nhere 0C001111 that's lower for\n\n201\n00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:44.050\nsure and then 2222 this guy is\ndefinitely the root, right.\n\n202\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.690\nSo we can see,\nthe priorities are all the same.\n\n203\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.920\nThe first thing is check your priorities\nthen check your MAC addresses.\n\n204\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.567\nNow once we have that,\n\n205\n00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:58.830\nnow we have the root bridge that has\nall forwarding ports on all segments.\n\n206\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.920\nA root bridge cannot have a root port\nA root bridge cannot have a blocked port.\n\n207\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.420\nA root bridge will always just have\nforwarding designated segments.\n\n208\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.390\nNow it's also important to\nunderstand now that I need to find,\n\n209\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.420\nthat was step number one,\nfind your root bridge.\n\n210\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.318\nWhat was step number two?\n\n211\n00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:21.240\nRoot-\n>> The non-root bridges have\n\n212\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.020\nto find their root port.\n\n213\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.710\n>> Root port.\n\n214\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.260\nOkay, and how do we find the root part?\n\n215\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.520\nWhat are we gonna look at now?\n\n216\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.610\nNot bridge IDs.\n\n217\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.040\n>> Bandwidth.\n>> Bandwidth is correct.\n\n218\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo now each one of these switches\nare gonna check their bandwidth.\n\n219\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.420\nNow, what they do is calculate\nit based on a IEEE certain cost,\n\n220\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.770\nten megabit cost is 100.\n\n221\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.392\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> These keep changing because we keep\n\n222\n00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:43.883\ngetting faster and faster links right,\nso we used to be at one for\n\n223\n00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:47.130\none gig and right now we're at four and\ntwo for ten gig.\n\n224\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.740\nThose are probably gonna change cuz\nwe have 40 gig, 100 gig, and so on.\n\n225\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:57.250\nAnyways, so we have 10 gig,\nnow we have 100 gig as 19, and 1 gig as 4.\n\n226\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.550\nSo we'll typically hang out here,\n\n227\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.110\nthose are the only switches\nthat I have are 101 gig, right?\n\n228\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.510\nSo now, if we look at this,\nthis is 100 based, so this is the cost of.\n\n229\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.660\n19 here isn't it?\n\n230\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.240\nAnd this is a cost of 19, and this is\nthe cost of, this is a ten meg, so 100.\n\n231\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.740\nSo we can see we have to calculate the\ncosts all the way to the root bridge for\n\n232\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.820\nme to determine my root port.\n\n233\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.500\nIn this case here,\nif I went from here this way,\n\n234\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.430\nlike if this is my root port,\nthis would be 119.\n\n235\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.060\nThat would be terrible.\n\n236\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.715\nSo in this case here the root port\nwould be here and here, Right?\n\n237\n00:13:32.715 --> 00:13:36.210\nBecause those are obviously\nthe lowest cost, right?\n\n238\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.380\nSo be careful, just because they're\ndirectly connected to the root bridge\n\n239\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.930\ndoes not mean that that's the root port.\n\n240\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.230\nI'm gonna give you an example here.\n\n241\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.440\nLet me squeeze this to discard my things,\nand then come back here.\n\n242\n00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.210\nNow if this was one gig here, and\n\n243\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.230\nthis was one gig,\nthis would be a cost of what?\n\n244\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.575\nIf I went this way from this port.\n\n245\n00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:59.600\n>> Eight.\n>> This would be a cost of eight.\n\n246\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.590\nThis would definitely be my root port and\nthis would go into blocking.\n\n247\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.120\nCompletely different way, right?\n\n248\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.700\nSo be careful and then we'd have to\ndetermine get rid of that again.\n\n249\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.480\nHold on.\n\n250\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.840\nNow since this was the route port\noriginally, we were like this.\n\n251\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.760\nThese guys were 40s.\n\n252\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.720\nThat's my route.\n\n253\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.620\nThat's just gonna happen naturally.\n\n254\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.790\nNow that means we have to determine\nbetween these two bridges here.\n\n255\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.040\nThat's a designated segment.\n\n256\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.240\nWho's gonna be the designated port?\n\n257\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.760\nI can't forward on both.\n\n258\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.880\nNow we come back, so number one\nwas look for the root bridge, and\n\n259\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.940\nthat was bridge ID, bridge ID.\n\n260\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.210\nThen look for root port,\nand that was bandwidth.\n\n261\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.840\nNow, designated port, I'll just des\nequals, that's gonna be bridge ID again.\n\n262\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.640\nSo this guy's 1111, 111222.\n\n263\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.570\nThis guy's forwarding.\n\n264\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.200\nHe's got a lower bridge ID.\n\n265\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.060\nThis guy's in this case, blocking.\n\n266\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.960\nWe're gonna get to the term\ndiscard in a minute but\n\n267\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.910\nin this case run 8021D\nthat's considered blocking.\n\n268\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.510\nOkay do you see all that's done.\n\n269\n00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.790\nPretty simple look at a little\nbit more complex configuration.\n\n270\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.900\nThat's just the answer.\n\n271\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.830\nNow number one,\nWe're going to elect a root bridge.\n\n272\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.500\nSo we're going to take a look at this.\n\n273\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.520\nSo let's dive in here and\nmake this larger.\n\n274\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.500\nAnd what we'll do is we'll\nsee who is the root bridge.\n\n275\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.024\nAnd so one page at a time, we're gonna\nlook at this network right here.\n\n276\n00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:23.007\nWho is your root bridge?\n\n277\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.862\nI'm letting Ronnie look,\nso when he figures it out,\n\n278\n00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:30.165\nI'll have a feeling that you guys\nwill have it figured out by then.\n\n279\n00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:34.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wow, this is pretty tough one isn't it?\n\n280\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.940\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a little tougher.\n\n281\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.590\nWe got 32768 down here and here, so\nthose two can't be it, but these two have\n\n282\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:45.420\na lower bridge ID, lower than the default,\nremember guys 32768 is your default.\n\n283\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.920\nNow we're going to look at this.\n\n284\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.421\nThis one's a little more challenging.\n\n285\n00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.080\n>> B?\n>> 0-C-A-B.\n\n286\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.831\nSo you start with the left,\nmoving right and as soon as you're lower,\n\n287\n00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:57.639\nas soon as you find a nibble that's lower,\nyou win.\n\n288\n00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:58.758\nYou don't even have to go\nall the way to the right.\n\n289\n00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:02.429\nSo 0CAB this one's 0C9.\n\n290\n00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:03.111\n>> Nine.\n\n291\n00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:07.813\n>> I went here I didn't\neven look at the rest.\n\n292\n00:16:07.813 --> 00:16:10.340\n0C9 wins.\n\n293\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.150\nSo I wrote root bridge here again but\nthe fact is that 0CA may be loose here.\n\n294\n00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.850\nI don't care if I said all ones over\nhere this one had all F's to the right\n\n295\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.120\nI would've won on that nibble right there.\n\n296\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.530\nAll right, now, so I'm a root,\n\n297\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.370\nwhat does that make this, let me,\nI didn't label these, c ,d.\n\n298\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.890\nYeah I did, they're over here, a, b, c, d.\n\n299\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.300\nB is forwarding, forwarding,\nforwarding, agreed?\n\n300\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.910\nThey're designated forwarding.\n\n301\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.140\nNow, what's step number two?\n\n302\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.590\n>> Unknown root,\nbridges must find their root, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:48.530\n>> So now number two elect a root port for\neach non-root bridge.\n\n304\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.580\nFor so decision based on lowest root path\ncost, so know this is my root notice this,\n\n305\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.900\nmy designated port designated these are\nforwarding, forwarding, forwarding, now.\n\n306\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.920\nIn this case here the cost of four, so\nwe're not seeing what the bandwidth is\n\n307\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.050\non here, so with cost of four,\nthis means they're a gig, right?\n\n308\n00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.980\nBut I have this as a cost of four here,\nso this is my root port here, and\n\n309\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:19.060\nthen my root port here, all right so\n\n310\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.120\nthere, and then my root port here,\nthis is a cost of two.\n\n311\n00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.170\nAll right, so if we go back and\nlook at our cost here, so\n\n312\n00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.690\nthere was a 10 gig link I put in there,\nright?\n\n313\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.660\nSo most of the time I don't have those,\nbut in this case here, we have ten gig is\n\n314\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.000\ntwo, gig is four, 100 meg is 19, so I just\nwanted to bring that up to your attention.\n\n315\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.860\nSo let's just stick on this screen for\na second They so go to that one.\n\n316\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.760\nSo in this case here, I made this ten,\nI'm gonna make that a ten gig,\n\n317\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.300\nand then the rest of these are gig,\nthese are one gig.\n\n318\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.230\nSo this is my root port.\n\n319\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.950\nMy root port and\nthen this is my root port here.\n\n320\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:00.990\nSo in this case here I have my root port,\nAnd now I have two segments.\n\n321\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.090\nThis is important to see.\n\n322\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.830\nI have this segment from A to C and\nfrom A to D\n\n323\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.040\nthat are, we can't forward on\nboth switches onto that segment.\n\n324\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.420\nSo on the segment from A to C which\none will be forwarding which one will\n\n325\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.540\nbe blocking.\n\n326\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.480\n>> Forwarding based on the bridge ID.\n\n327\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.080\n>> Yeah, now we go back to bridge ID,\n>> Be switch a.\n\n328\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.260\n>> It will be switch a cuz it\nhas the lowest bridge ID, 28672.\n\n329\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.000\nSo this is forwarding,\nthis will go onto blocking.\n\n330\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.590\nCould be discarded,\n\n331\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.510\ndepending on what we're running but\nin this case, we're just 802.1d.\n\n332\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.890\nAnd the same thing here And\nthen this will go into blocking.\n\n333\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:47.070\nOkay so we gotta be able to find our\nroot bridge, our root ports, and\n\n334\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.380\nour designated segment, which one we're\ngonna forward our designated segments.\n\n335\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.660\nSo now this guy's done, and\nnow he's gonna converge.\n\n336\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.530\nSo we can take a look at this, and, So\n\n337\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.800\nnow we have a designated port for\non this one here.\n\n338\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.770\nSo we can see that this is\nthe answer that I came up with here.\n\n339\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.490\nSo these are all forwarding up here.\n\n340\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.150\nForwarding, forwarding, forwarding.\n\n341\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.110\nThis is a route bridge.\n\n342\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.250\nSo these are all forwarding.\n\n343\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.150\nAnd this one here is forwarding.\n\n344\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.890\nAnd then those are my two block ports.\n\n345\n00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.830\nYou have to be able to calculate this.\n\n346\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.490\nOkay, it's not that hard.\n\n347\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.820\nWe just need a little bit of practice.\n\n348\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.220\nI have a couple other\npractice ones in my book,\n\n349\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.950\nthere's some other examples\nyou guys want to go through.\n\n350\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.010\nNow there's some different protocols for\nsoftware 802.1D.\n\n351\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:36.090\nThis was considered, I know this\nsounds funny, but commons penantry.\n\n352\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.990\nCommon.\nThis was the original one.\n\n353\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.170\nWe had one root bridge for\nour entire network.\n\n354\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.400\nYou got to remember our networks were\nreally small in 1977 you can imagine.\n\n355\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.120\nSo just a couple of links.\n\n356\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.690\nAnyway there's one root bridge\nround the entire thing.\n\n357\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.720\nOne spanning-tree instance for\nthe entire bridge network.\n\n358\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.190\nSo Cisco took that and\nevery other manufacturer took that and\n\n359\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.510\nenhanced it and\nthat's when Cisco came up 802.1D PVST+.\n\n360\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.147\nSo it's an enhancement of the spanning\ntree protocol that provides a separate\n\n361\n00:20:05.147 --> 00:20:08.610\nspanning tree entrance for\neach broadcast, subnet, VLan, right?\n\n362\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.080\nPer VLan spanning tree.\n\n363\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.340\nSo if I say VLan it means\nbroadcast remains subnet.\n\n364\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.420\nSo for each instance.\n\n365\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.710\nFor each VLan, right, this is a,\nwe're going to see how this is efficient.\n\n366\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.260\nNow, there's something else.\n\n367\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.060\nWe're not going to configure,\nit's not much of an objective here.\n\n368\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.500\nBut they did mention it for\nthe first time in the objectives.\n\n369\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.700\nSome multiple spanning tree protocol.\n\n370\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.242\nSo this actually causes quite\na bit of overhead, the PVST+.\n\n371\n00:20:33.242 --> 00:20:37.890\nSo what multiple spanning tree plus does\nis combine the instances on one bridge so\n\n372\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.170\nwe use less processing So it basically\nallows one spanning tree instance to run\n\n373\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.795\non top of another, and that's called\nmultiple spanning tree protocol.\n\n374\n00:20:45.795 --> 00:20:49.900\n802.1w is the one we will do in here,\n\n375\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.290\nthis is the one you really\nshould be running today so\n\n376\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.970\nyou got a Cisco iOS I'm gonna show you\nhow to turn this on it's one command.\n\n377\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.630\nAnd this is called rapid spanning tree.\n\n378\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.960\nWe actually run this one.\n\n379\n00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.210\nRapid spanning tree PVST+.\n\n380\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.000\nThis is going to enhance version of it.\n\n381\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.820\nSo it, so we converge in less than\na minute just less than under a minute for\n\n382\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.810\nyou to that 1D.\n\n383\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.070\nThis takes three, four,\nfive seconds depending on the switch.\n\n384\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:18.265\nOkay so Cisco enhancement of RSTP Okay,\n\n385\n00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:23.512\nso comparison of STP,\nwe've got the protocol regular spanning,\n\n386\n00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:26.640\ncommon spanning tree, 802.1d.\n\n387\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.810\nResources required are low,\nconvergence is very slow but\n\n388\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.750\nwe only have one tree for\nour entire network.\n\n389\n00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.540\nWould never work in today's network.\n\n390\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.660\nSo Cisco again took that or\nany other manufacturer takes that and\n\n391\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.770\nthey enhance it.\n\n392\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.390\nAnd they enhance it with\nwhat's called PVST+.\n\n393\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.300\nWe have high resources.\n\n394\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.340\nBut if we're running 802.1D it's\nstill slow, one for every VLAN.\n\n395\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.380\nSo we're gonna come down\nhere to rapid PVST+.\n\n396\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:58.670\nRapid spanning tree protocol is 802.1W,\nso it's 802., this is 802.1d, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.680\nWhen I upgrade to 802.1w resources needed.\n\n398\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.260\nSomewhere medium.\n\n399\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.500\nBut it's very fast to converge.\n\n400\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:13.186\nBut it's only one tree so Cisco's\ngonna use the rapid spanning PVST+,\n\n401\n00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:20.650\nrapid spanning tree PVST+, very, very,\na lot, a lot, a lot of resources, right?\n\n402\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:26.180\nWe have a root bridge for every spanning\ntree instance, for every VLAN, right?\n\n403\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.410\nBut the conversions\ntime is extremely fast.\n\n404\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.350\nToday's switches really can handle this.\n\n405\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.470\nAll my customers run this so\nyou'll be fine.\n\n406\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.730\nSo we have a number of trees,\none for every VLAN.\n\n407\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.830\nNow multiple spanning tree protocol,\nwhat we do,\n\n408\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.760\nit's, by the way Just so you know, 802.1s.\n\n409\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.110\nSo you have to know 802.1D the original,\n802.1w the faster one that we run now,\n\n410\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:52.530\nand of course we enhance it with\nPVSTM+ on both of those, and\n\n411\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.350\nthen MSTP which is 802.1s.\n\n412\n00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:00.310\nSo it uses slightly less resources because\nwe run one span entry on top of another.\n\n413\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.050\nBut it's very fast convergence.\n\n414\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.170\nI typically see this and I run this\non my Nexus gear and my datacenters.\n\n415\n00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.350\nSo I run 802.1w for my customers.\n\n416\n00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.269\nI run 802.1w for my customers.\n\n417\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.750\nAnd then I run 802.1s in my data center.\n\n418\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.350\nSo, by default,\nwhich port will be in blocking mode?\n\n419\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.680\nSo you have to take a look at this.\n\n420\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.200\nLet's see what you guys got here.\n\n421\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.380\nYou're going to have to\nlook at the the bridge IDs.\n\n422\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.360\nSo what have we learned so far?\n\n423\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.060\nSo by default,\nwhich port will be in blocking mode?\n\n424\n00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.680\nSo the first thing you have\nto do is look at bridge IDs,\n\n425\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.810\nfind who's your root bridge.\n\n426\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.590\n>> Okay.\n\n427\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.820\nThe one on the right.\n\n428\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.185\n>> Okay.\nSo this one over here.\n\n429\n00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:51.915\n00d0.5680f180 and this one's f181, f180.\n\n430\n00:23:51.915 --> 00:23:58.592\n[LAUGH] Came off the manufacturer\none right after the other obviously.\n\n431\n00:23:58.592 --> 00:24:03.096\nThis is gonna be my root And\nso these are both 40.\n\n432\n00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:04.768\nNow we have to determine,\n\n433\n00:24:04.768 --> 00:24:09.780\nI don't need to see bridge IDs\nanymore who's my root port over here.\n\n434\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.502\nThis is switch A and this is switch B.\n\n435\n00:24:12.502 --> 00:24:14.256\n>> It's going to be over\non the left hand side Fa0/2\n\n436\n00:24:14.256 --> 00:24:17.820\n>> Is gonna be your root port.\n\n437\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.389\nThat's true and\nthat S01 would go onto blocking.\n\n438\n00:24:20.389 --> 00:24:21.530\n>> Right.\n\n439\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.100\n>> So if we were to look at this guys.\n\n440\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.860\nI'm not gonna draw on this right now, S01\nwould go on the block end because we're at\n\n441\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.250\n10 mega bits here, 100 mega bits here.\n\n442\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:34.270\nSo S01 would go into if 802.1\nD is blocking, 802..1 W we\n\n443\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:40.540\ncall discarding but nonetheless\nwe'd be forwarded F02 but wait.\n\n444\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.149\nI didn't draw this.\n\n445\n00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:44.369\nWe don't have 10 megabit links anymore.\n\n446\n00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:46.757\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What happens if I make this a 100\n\n447\n00:24:46.757 --> 00:24:47.435\nmegabit link?\n\n448\n00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:52.340\nNow what do you do?\n\n449\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.703\nWhile spanning tree typically by default,\nit depends on when the links come up,\n\n450\n00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:58.510\nbecause I've seen go both ways.\n\n451\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.200\nBut if everything being equal.\n\n452\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.290\nIt'll actually forward on\nthe lower port number.\n\n453\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.170\nSo it makes a decision if there is a tie\nto forward on a lower port number and\n\n454\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.110\nthen block the higher port number.\n\n455\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.400\nThat's the tie right there.\n\n456\n00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:16.290\nBefore, just to reiterate what\nwe have already talked about.\n\n457\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.320\nTo determine my route bridge I go\naround looking at route ID's per VLAN.\n\n458\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.570\nThen I determine my root ports and\nall non root bridge by using bandwidth.\n\n459\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.880\nPath costs by calculating\nthe full path cost.\n\n460\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.141\nThen I use designated ports on segments\nthat aren't connected to the root bridge.\n\n461\n00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:34.345\nRight?\nThey're connected between\n\n462\n00:25:34.345 --> 00:25:35.160\ntwo non-root bridges.\n\n463\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.220\nI can only forward on\none segment on one port.\n\n464\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.540\nI find my designated ports\nby using bridge IDs again.\n\n465\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.230\nBridge IDs path cost bridge IDs.\n\n466\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.580\nNow as we talked about 802.1D.\n\n467\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.460\nThe spanning tree transits through\neach several different states and\n\n468\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.780\nthis takes 50 seconds.\n\n469\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.850\nSo when you first plug a host into\na switch it goes amber for 50 seconds, and\n\n470\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.370\nthen it'll turn green\nindicating normal operation.\n\n471\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.342\nIt could stay amber if it goes\ninto blocking state in this case,\n\n472\n00:26:05.342 --> 00:26:06.306\nonce it converged.\n\n473\n00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:09.621\nIt's either gonna be in forwarding or\nblocking, that means you're converged.\n\n474\n00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:13.620\nOkay, so you're going to, so this is\nactually a really long time, right?\n\n475\n00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.005\nFor today's networks, 1977 it wasn't.\n\n476\n00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:17.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, [LAUGH] anyways.\n\n477\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.970\n>> Learning them 40 is\nwhere I populate them,\n\n478\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.290\nI'm gonna take the time to write this out.\n\n479\n00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.951\nPopulate the mac address table.\n\n480\n00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:31.170\nOkay, so learning and forwarding are where\nI populate the mac address table.\n\n481\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.270\nSo first thing I'm gonna do is blocking,\nthen I listen for\n\n482\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.870\nbridge protocol danseuse.\n\n483\n00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.900\nMake sure I don't have a loop, I don't\nhave that, then I'm gonna start populating\n\n484\n00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.680\nmy mac address tables for 15 seconds and\nthen I'm gonna start forwarding.\n\n485\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.986\n>> All right?\nAnd that's gonna turn green.\n\n486\n00:26:41.986 --> 00:26:45.400\nOr I'm gonna go to blocking\nmode because there was a loop.\n\n487\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.810\nEither way,\nwhen I'm either in blocking mode or\n\n488\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.350\nforwarding state,\nI'm what they call converged.\n\n489\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.440\nWhen all ports on your\nswitches are in blocking or\n\n490\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.390\nforwarding state your network\nis considered converged.\n\n491\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.740\nSo this is a long time,\nthis is 802.1D, even\n\n492\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:07.160\nif you're running PVST+ with this same\nthing that's why it slows conversion time.\n\n493\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.010\nAgain, spanning-tree problems exist,\nthey happen all the time.\n\n494\n00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.240\nI'm up for five, ten minutes, everything's\nworking fine then I go down for\n\n495\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.270\nabout a minute.\n\n496\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.962\nIf you get that call you\nhave a spanning-tree issue.\n\n497\n00:27:18.962 --> 00:27:22.605\nAll right, so assuming all\nswitches are set to the default,\n\n498\n00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:24.825\nwhich ports will be root ports here?\n\n499\n00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:27.273\nSo now we got a little bit\nmore of a challenge here.\n\n500\n00:27:27.273 --> 00:27:33.074\nSo, what values, so let's go ahead and\nfind our root port here.\n\n501\n00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:39.664\nI'll give Ronnie a chance to find it,\n\n502\n00:27:39.664 --> 00:27:42.038\nthat's given you guys\nchance at the same time.\n\n503\n00:27:47.603 --> 00:27:49.930\nNotice I have gig and\n100 megabit links in here, that's good.\n\n504\n00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.700\nSo again, we start at the left, so\nI'll start at 000E and move right.\n\n505\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.716\nAnd then you stop when someone's lower and\nthat person wins.\n\n506\n00:28:00.716 --> 00:28:05.023\nSo 000E, 000D, well so far,\nthe A is out, A is out for\n\n507\n00:28:05.023 --> 00:28:07.820\nbeing the root bridge, he's a loser.\n\n508\n00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.710\nGot a big old L on his switch\nright there 000D, 000D.\n\n509\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.940\nSo, we're tieing now for B, C, and D.\n\n510\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.110\nOkay?\nSo let's keep going through, BD, BD,\n\n511\n00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.350\nBD, C3, C3, C3.\n\n512\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.150\nWooho, this is getting riveting.\n\n513\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.210\nAnd now we've got a 7 C three seven,\n\n514\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.720\nC three four, C three three,\nI win on this three.\n\n515\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.766\nI don't even care which to the right\nto many any more, I win on that three,\n\n516\n00:28:35.766 --> 00:28:36.434\nall right?\n\n517\n00:28:36.434 --> 00:28:37.340\nThis is my root.\n\n518\n00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.420\nForwarding, forwarding,\ndesignated forwarding, all right?\n\n519\n00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.720\nGot my root bridge,\ngot my forwarding ports.\n\n520\n00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.169\nThis is when it gets\nslightly more challenging,\n\n521\n00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:49.910\nwhen you have a network like this.\n\n522\n00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.443\nAnd we're just going to get a bit\nmore hierarchical, but whatever.\n\n523\n00:28:53.443 --> 00:28:57.070\n>> Anyways, now I need my root port for\neach switch.\n\n524\n00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.640\nProbably the ones that are just\ndirectly connected, right?\n\n525\n00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.890\n>> Could be, but not necessarily, yeah?\n\n526\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.860\n>> I don't know, got to be careful.\n\n527\n00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.423\nLet's skid in here\na little bit closer now.\n\n528\n00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:10.537\nOkay, so what do you guys think,\nI don't need to see the bridge IDs anymore\n\n529\n00:29:12.736 --> 00:29:15.560\nI'm looking at path costs.\n\n530\n00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.430\nSo I go to switch A.\n\n531\n00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.080\nI'm definitely connected over here,\non this port here, but\n\n532\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.960\nthat's only 100 megabit.\n\n533\n00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.500\n>> It'd be the one connected to switch D.\n\n534\n00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.900\nSwitch A to switch D.\n\n535\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.200\n>> Yeah, it would be this one here\nwouldn't it because this is a gig so\n\n536\n00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.550\nthat's the cost of what?\n\n537\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.260\n>> Four.\n\n538\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.260\n>> Four, yeah.\n\n539\n00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.010\nAnd then this one's four here so\nthat'd be a total cost.\n\n540\n00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.883\nIf I choose this way it'd be eight and\nthis one's what, 19.\n\n541\n00:29:39.883 --> 00:29:40.559\nRight?\n\n542\n00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:45.410\nSo I'm not going to I'm gonna that\nguys not going to be 40, all right?\n\n543\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.114\nSo I've got a 40 from this\nsegment here from the root.\n\n544\n00:29:48.114 --> 00:29:53.021\nBut on this guy here he's got a cost 19 so\nover here I got a cost of four and\n\n545\n00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:54.100\nfour here.\n\n546\n00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.960\nSo switch D is directly\nconnected with gig as well here.\n\n547\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.200\nSo he's definitely gonna be\nmy root port here, right?\n\n548\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.420\nWith a cost of four and on switch B we\ncan see we have a cost of four here.\n\n549\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.990\nSo that's my root port there.\n\n550\n00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.690\nSo get those figured out, that's all\ngreat and good but I have two segments.\n\n551\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:17.050\nThe one between Switch A here and\nhere, and then from here to here.\n\n552\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.630\nSo between Switch A and B,\nwhich one is going to be forwarding and\n\n553\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.020\nwhich one's going to be blocking\n>> Switch B?\n\n554\n00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.739\n>> Now I have to look at my bridge\nIDs again, 000E that's worse.\n\n555\n00:30:26.739 --> 00:30:29.536\nThis 000D he wins, so this is forwarding.\n\n556\n00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.828\nThis is blocking.\n\n557\n00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:33.572\nWhat about from switch b to d?\n\n558\n00:30:33.572 --> 00:30:37.548\n>> B switch, d.\n\n559\n00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:40.760\n>> C3-4 wins, right?\n\n560\n00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.140\nOkay, you guys see how that's done?\n\n561\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.760\nA little bit more practice there for\nyou guys.\n\n562\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.930\nNow, to change the priority,\n\n563\n00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.620\nlet's say I want someone to\nbe a root bridge that's not.\n\n564\n00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.080\nThere's a couple different\nways to go about this.\n\n565\n00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.480\nBoth of these are in the objectives\nnow and they didn't used to be but\n\n566\n00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.540\nnow they are.\n\n567\n00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.520\nAll right, so the first thing that\nI always used to do was just change\n\n568\n00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.320\nthe priority.\n\n569\n00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.653\nRight?\nSo notice some increments of 4096 and\n\n570\n00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:01.703\nhere's my numbers.\n\n571\n00:31:01.703 --> 00:31:05.590\nSo as to the spanning-tree vlan, you type\nthe number of which one you wanna change.\n\n572\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:10.480\nPriority and then the values and\nit shows me my values right here.\n\n573\n00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.605\nSo I usually lower them\nin numbers that I know.\n\n574\n00:31:14.605 --> 00:31:19.517\nThere's 32768, I go 16384, 4096, 8192.\n\n575\n00:31:19.517 --> 00:31:21.930\nThese numbers are easy for me to remember.\n\n576\n00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.180\nI typically don't raise them up.\n\n577\n00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.610\nI typically lower them down for\nwho I want, but\n\n578\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.440\nthat's not really how we\ndo it on the CCNA anymore.\n\n579\n00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.970\nOkay, this is a very valid way to do this,\nand\n\n580\n00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.202\nwe will look at this when we hit the labs.\n\n581\n00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:39.770\nI'm gonna do spanning tree VLAN number\npriority, and change the priority and\n\n582\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.610\nlower it to make who's the root bridge.\n\n583\n00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.880\nNow, the way we're gonna\ndo it is this right here.\n\n584\n00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:54.704\nSo I'm gonna say, spanning-tree\nVLAN VLAN number root primary.\n\n585\n00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:59.422\nOkay, and secondary.\n\n586\n00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:03.160\nSo now, I'm going to go to a switch, and\nnotice these are two different switches.\n\n587\n00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.620\nSwitch one and switch two,\nyou're the root primary for the VLAN 20.\n\n588\n00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.540\nI will become the root bridge.\n\n589\n00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.290\nNow, the weird thing about this,\nand you need to remember this for\n\n590\n00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.900\nthe objectives as well.\n\n591\n00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.770\nIf I was to fail the root bridge would\nnot be someone that has a lower bridge id\n\n592\n00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.660\nthan me, it would be someone that\nhas a higher bridge id than me.\n\n593\n00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.890\nThat's how that works.\n\n594\n00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.450\nAnyways, spanning-tree VLAN 20 root\nprimary, so you would have to look for\n\n595\n00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.180\nsomething with a higher bridge id.\n\n596\n00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.020\nSpinning-tree VLAN 20 root secondary, so\nI'm gonna set a primary and secondary.\n\n597\n00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.120\nThis is probably an easier way to do it.\n\n598\n00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.730\nThan using the priories although\nI've been doing the priories for so\n\n599\n00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.350\nlong that that's typically how I\nstill do it being an old school guy.\n\n600\n00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.250\nBut I can set primary and secondary and\nyou're going to do that for your CCNA.\n\n601\n00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.810\nI believe this works on packtracer.\n\n602\n00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.950\nSo I would set.\n\n603\n00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.130\nYou guys need to go and do this and\npractice this and then unplug and\n\n604\n00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.670\nsee who becomes your root and\nstuff like that.\n\n605\n00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.960\nOkay, if you have some rules which\nis probably a better way to do it.\n\n606\n00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.540\nNow, let's talk about why we use PVST.\n\n607\n00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.680\nWhy do we use pvst plus?\n\n608\n00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.710\nAll right, so\nthis is a common spanning tree.\n\n609\n00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.860\nThe original recipe 802.1d.\n\n610\n00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:18.860\nThis guy is the root bridge of all VLANs,\n\n611\n00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:25.030\nso if we look at this we have,\nwhy would we want to do this?\n\n612\n00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:29.790\nSo we have our servers over here, okay,\nfor management, engineering and CAD.\n\n613\n00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.760\nCheck this out.\n\n614\n00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.040\nSo if I'm management and let me do\nthis for a second, I come up here and\n\n615\n00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.600\nchange my color, you make it green.\n\n616\n00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.300\nSo if I'm management I would have\nto be able to talk to my servers.\n\n617\n00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.670\nI would have to find my path, whatever it\nis through here, to get to the root bridge\n\n618\n00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.600\nand then be forwarded through\nthe path to my resources.\n\n619\n00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.520\nWhatever that is, I know you can't\neven see that very well with here.\n\n620\n00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.390\nSo, in this case here, if I'm CAD again,\nI don't get to go straight over.\n\n621\n00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.640\nI have to find a path to my root bridge.\n\n622\n00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.490\nAnd then it's going to take the path\nover to my resources, okay?\n\n623\n00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.700\nSo we can see how inefficient that is.\n\n624\n00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.510\nEveryone must go to the root bridge.\n\n625\n00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.010\nRemember, all roads lead to the king.\n\n626\n00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.470\nAll roads lead to Rome\nwhere the king sits, right?\n\n627\n00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.390\nSo, we have to go there first.\n\n628\n00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.380\nThen we can go to our resources.\n\n629\n00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.200\nSo that's why they came\nout with PVST plus.\n\n630\n00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.720\nSo now, if we're looking at this, and here\nis management, and this guy comes up here\n\n631\n00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.760\nand he can go right to his resources here,\nright?\n\n632\n00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.930\nWe don't have to go to the root bridge\nover here because this is a root bridge,\n\n633\n00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:40.800\nso I'm gonna make this a root bridge For\nsales, finance, marketing, management,\n\n634\n00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.700\nengineering and cad is over here.\n\n635\n00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.952\nSo now, I've got more efficient route\nbridge selection closer to the resources.\n\n636\n00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.400\nAll right, so\nthis is how you want to do it.\n\n637\n00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.010\nSo for marketing over here, these guys\nare going to direct upper here like this,\n\n638\n00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.030\nright, we don't have to go over to\nthe right to another root bridge, and so\n\n639\n00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.870\nthe efficient root bridge selection.\n\n640\n00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.877\nNow, in a smaller network,\nyou're not gonna do this.\n\n641\n00:35:02.877 --> 00:35:04.034\nAll right, so now,\n\n642\n00:35:04.034 --> 00:35:08.609\nlet's take a look at Rapid Spanning\nTree Protocol memory called 802.1W.\n\n643\n00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:13.564\nThe one that we're working\nwith before was just 802.1,\n\n644\n00:35:13.564 --> 00:35:16.331\ndo you remember what the MSTP was?\n\n645\n00:35:16.331 --> 00:35:18.172\n>> 802.1s?\n\n646\n00:35:18.172 --> 00:35:24.039\n>> S, yes, the one that I'll use at my\ndata centers and that's just 802.1s.\n\n647\n00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:25.118\nObviously we can use them with iOS.\n\n648\n00:35:25.118 --> 00:35:26.368\nI just haven't done that.\n\n649\n00:35:26.368 --> 00:35:31.945\n802.1d, original recipe 802.1W\nis our Rapid Spanning Tree.\n\n650\n00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:36.212\nNow, this is gonna converge in just a few\nseconds, so if we come down here and\n\n651\n00:35:36.212 --> 00:35:40.390\nunderstand it, it's totally\nbackwards compatible with 802.1D.\n\n652\n00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.496\nHowever, you lose your fast conversions.\n\n653\n00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:46.890\nIf I have a switch that's running 802.1D\nand this one I bring up is 802.1W,\n\n654\n00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.993\nthis one just says I need to go slow for\nthis guy, he's just not that smart.\n\n655\n00:35:50.993 --> 00:35:52.780\nSo you didn't get anything.\n\n656\n00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.960\nSo either turn on Rapid Spanning Tree\nProtocol on all your switches, right,\n\n657\n00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.670\nor you really need to do that,\nit's pretty simple to do.\n\n658\n00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.240\nIt's one command.\n\n659\n00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.574\nThere isn't like you have to go\nto ports or anything like that,\n\n660\n00:36:03.574 --> 00:36:04.598\nit's one global command.\n\n661\n00:36:04.598 --> 00:36:06.683\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n662\n00:36:06.683 --> 00:36:12.754\nSo over here's 802.1D 802.1W over here.\n\n663\n00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:16.790\nNotice we go discarding,\nlearning, forwarding.\n\n664\n00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.918\nDiscarding, learning, forwarding, right?\n\n665\n00:36:17.918 --> 00:36:18.801\nIt's just that fast.\n\n666\n00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:21.725\nAnd on 802.1D it's.\n\n667\n00:36:21.725 --> 00:36:23.030\nWell first off you start off disabled.\n\n668\n00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.668\nAnd then you go blocking.\n\n669\n00:36:24.668 --> 00:36:26.510\nLearning.\n\n670\n00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.225\nBlocking, listening.\n\n671\n00:36:29.225 --> 00:36:29.757\nExcuse me.\n\n672\n00:36:29.757 --> 00:36:31.123\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Blocking, listening.\n\n673\n00:36:31.123 --> 00:36:32.888\nLearning forwarding.\n\n674\n00:36:32.888 --> 00:36:33.942\nActually I did it a little fast.\n\n675\n00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:34.781\nAll right.\n\n676\n00:36:34.781 --> 00:36:38.750\n[LAUGH] We're Rapid Spanning Tree\nProtocols disregarding learning\n\n677\n00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.210\nforwarding, right?\n\n678\n00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.470\nThat's just how it goes.\n\n679\n00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.050\nI mean it's really fast.\n\n680\n00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.360\nWe don't, whenever you see,\nlet's say you see in a question.\n\n681\n00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.370\nYou're doing a practice exam question and\n\n682\n00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.560\nsays what's about\nRapid Spanning Tree Protocol is true.\n\n683\n00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.600\nIf you ever see an option\nthat says blocking,\n\n684\n00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.620\nit's not true about Rapid Spanning Tree.\n\n685\n00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.910\nThey don't use blocking, it uses\ndiscarding, discarding, discarding.\n\n686\n00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.990\nIt no longer uses the term blocking,\nokay, so\n\n687\n00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.800\nwe just have discarding,\nwe're not even forwarding.\n\n688\n00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.390\nIt's backward compatible expands.\n\n689\n00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.430\nNow, we also have alter and\nback up roles and\n\n690\n00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.290\nwe'll that when we have a discarding role.\n\n691\n00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.770\nWe see that as a backup port as well.\n\n692\n00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.910\nSignificantly reduces\ntopology reconvergence time\n\n693\n00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.210\nafter link failure by about 50 seconds.\n\n694\n00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:27.170\nSo [LAUGH] I mean its you know so\nit's significant, for sure.\n\n695\n00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:33.350\nAnd so, on point to point links it's\nfaster transition to the forwarding state.\n\n696\n00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.020\nSo how do we enable this?\n\n697\n00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.330\nHow do we enable it?\n\n698\n00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:41.060\nWe enable it with one simple\nglobal config command on a switch,\n\n699\n00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.430\nit'll go to all of your switches.\n\n700\n00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:47.590\nAnd turn this on and\nsay spanning-tree-mode-rapid-pvst.\n\n701\n00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.020\nSpanning tree mode.\n\n702\n00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.415\nSo I'm gonna go up and\ndo that in a second.\n\n703\n00:37:50.415 --> 00:37:51.970\nspanning-tree-mode-rapid-pvst.\n\n704\n00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.810\nAnd this is just going to enable it.\n\n705\n00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.960\nSo we still have the same, we still\ncalculate everything the same way.\n\n706\n00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.870\nWe still have to find our root bridge,\nour root ports, and our designated ports.\n\n707\n00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.790\nAnd then the rest are discarding ports.\n\n708\n00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.280\nWhatever's left, right?\n\n709\n00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.900\nSo the point is this,\n\n710\n00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.690\nyou still even if they say which is\ntrue about rapid spanning tree protocol.\n\n711\n00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.990\nWe don't freak out and go,\nmy God I don't know how to calculate this.\n\n712\n00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.160\nYes, you do.\n\n713\n00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.180\nRoot port is bridge ID.\n\n714\n00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.760\nI'm sorry, root bridge is bridge ID.\n\n715\n00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.450\nRoot port is path cost, right?\n\n716\n00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:27.730\nBased on bandwidth and then designated\nport is based on bridge ID again and\n\n717\n00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:33.800\nwhatever's left is discarding now,\nI'm gonna go back here.\n\n718\n00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.224\nWhen we're running 802.1D I\ndon't have to worry about\n\n719\n00:38:37.224 --> 00:38:41.064\nthis with Rapid Span Tree Protocol\nbecause we converged very fast.\n\n720\n00:38:41.064 --> 00:38:45.412\nNow, but if 802.1D we don't, a lot of\nthe time you'll plug something in and\n\n721\n00:38:45.412 --> 00:38:49.397\nit will time out for DHCP address\nbecause span tree hasn't converged yet.\n\n722\n00:38:49.397 --> 00:38:51.360\nSo what we're going to\ndo is take ports here.\n\n723\n00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.080\nSo notice these are my access ports.\n\n724\n00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.980\nThis is where I'd turn on PortFast,\nsince it basically disables.\n\n725\n00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.915\nNow, I've got to be careful,\nbecause I wrote well,\n\n726\n00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:00.254\nit disables spanning tree on those.\n\n727\n00:39:00.254 --> 00:39:01.854\nAnd people write and go no, it doesn't.\n\n728\n00:39:01.854 --> 00:39:02.685\nYou're an idiot.\n\n729\n00:39:02.685 --> 00:39:03.241\nAvoid all this.\n\n730\n00:39:03.241 --> 00:39:03.756\nIt does.\n\n731\n00:39:03.756 --> 00:39:06.664\nI puts right into the forwarding state.\n\n732\n00:39:06.664 --> 00:39:09.042\nOkay so, yeah,\nspanning tree's running, but\n\n733\n00:39:09.042 --> 00:39:11.252\nyou're not gonna go\nthrough all the states.\n\n734\n00:39:11.252 --> 00:39:13.911\nYou're just gonna go straight into\nforwarding state as soon as you plug\n\n735\n00:39:13.911 --> 00:39:14.497\nsomething in.\n\n736\n00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:18.697\nSo it effectively disables all\nthose other states, right?\n\n737\n00:39:18.697 --> 00:39:22.427\nSo you're working right away as\nsoon as you plug something in.\n\n738\n00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:23.027\nSo what do you plug in there?\n\n739\n00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.584\nYour servers, your hosts, your printers.\n\n740\n00:39:24.584 --> 00:39:27.448\nAnything you know a switch is\nnot going to be plugged into.\n\n741\n00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:31.396\nSo the problem is, if you take now.\n\n742\n00:39:31.396 --> 00:39:33.220\nAnd you have a port fast switch.\n\n743\n00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:38.270\nAnd you plug in another switch into that\nport, you can create yourself a loop.\n\n744\n00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.002\nIt'll bring your network down.\n\n745\n00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:42.698\nSo, what we're gonna do is turn\non something called BPDU Guard.\n\n746\n00:39:42.698 --> 00:39:46.718\nNow, there's actually,\ntwo types as BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter,\n\n747\n00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:50.046\nfilter just drops the BPDUs and\nit won't create a loop.\n\n748\n00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:54.260\nBPDU Guard actually,\nif it receives a BPDU on a PortFast and\n\n749\n00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.308\na port that's configured with PortFast.\n\n750\n00:39:57.308 --> 00:40:00.803\nIt will put the port in error disabled and\nit'll turn amber.\n\n751\n00:40:00.803 --> 00:40:03.690\nSo I've had people call me and\ngo, my switch just went bad.\n\n752\n00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:07.025\nEvery time I plugged a switch in, the\nswitch, all the ports just turned amber.\n\n753\n00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:10.340\nI just went from one port to another and\nevery port just went bad automatically.\n\n754\n00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.583\nI was just like, my gosh.\n\n755\n00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:15.150\nSo you have to go out there and do a shut\nno shut on all those ports, right?\n\n756\n00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.685\nAnyways, so you do want to this though.\n\n757\n00:40:17.685 --> 00:40:22.145\nOkay, so you want to air on the side of\nstopping connectivity if it's possibly\n\n758\n00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:23.738\ngonna create you a loop.\n\n759\n00:40:23.738 --> 00:40:25.430\nSo I'm gonna put on BPDU guard and\n\n760\n00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.080\nnotice that's the only thing they\neven have there on the objects.\n\n761\n00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.560\nIs that if you turn on port fast,\nnow to me this should be on automatically.\n\n762\n00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.530\nBecause the fact is, this is not that\nanyone can come in and plug into an open\n\n763\n00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.930\nport that you've configured just for\nhosts in VLAN sales, whatever.\n\n764\n00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.920\nAnd someone goes, I need to plug a switch\nin, there's an open port, right?\n\n765\n00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.790\nAnd it brings down your network,\n\n766\n00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.950\nnow it brings down your network\nfrom end to end, right?\n\n767\n00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.950\nSo this isn't just a little thing, right?\n\n768\n00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.280\nThis is a big deal.\n\n769\n00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.970\nSo we want to make sure and\nturn on BPDU Guard so\n\n770\n00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.362\nwhen someone plugs it in,\nthat port is disabled.\n\n771\n00:40:58.362 --> 00:40:59.450\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at how we do that.\n\n772\n00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.640\nIt's pretty simple.\n\n773\n00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.690\nSo to configure BPDU Guard, now I can do\nthis from global config down here and\n\n774\n00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.770\nso I say spanning-tree portfast default.\n\n775\n00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.890\nSo now, here's what I typically do.\n\n776\n00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.620\nI do the range that we saw, interface\nrange, and I pick my whatever it is,\n\n777\n00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.950\n48 ports where all my hosts are in and\nI turn on PortFast.\n\n778\n00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:25.930\nReally, if you're running 802.1d with PVST\nplus, you really want to do this, right?\n\n779\n00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.770\nBecause you're going through\nthat transition state where you\n\n780\n00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:28.370\ndon't really need to.\n\n781\n00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.640\nYou just gotta make sure that\neveryone knows not to plug in\n\n782\n00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.350\nswitches into those ports.\n\n783\n00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.440\nAs long as we plug them into our uplinks,\nwe'll be fine.\n\n784\n00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.000\nSpanning-tree portfast default, turns\nit on on all ports that you've chosen.\n\n785\n00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.490\nNow remember, this is on right here,\n\n786\n00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:45.810\nI'm doing this from globalconfig, so\nI'm doing this on the entire switch.\n\n787\n00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.458\nIt's pretty rare that you might do\nsomething like this if you're at home on\n\n788\n00:41:48.458 --> 00:41:50.659\na small network, something like that,\nthen you could do it.\n\n789\n00:41:50.659 --> 00:41:53.915\nBut if you have an uplink, this is\ngonna turn PortFast on that as well.\n\n790\n00:41:53.915 --> 00:41:57.142\nAll right,\nthen in this case we're gonna go ahead and\n\n791\n00:41:57.142 --> 00:42:00.600\nturn on PortFast BPDU Guard,\nright, on your switch.\n\n792\n00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.320\nThat's fine, this can have no uplinks\nthough, right, to another switch.\n\n793\n00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.270\nSo typically we're gonna go into\nthe interface range up here.\n\n794\n00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.800\nIn this case here I just choose one port.\n\n795\n00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.590\nSpanning-tree PortFast and\nthen BPDU Guard enable.\n\n796\n00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.714\nAll right, again, that should be on by\ndefault as far as I'm concerned but\n\n797\n00:42:17.714 --> 00:42:19.400\nnonetheless, don't forget.\n\n798\n00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.840\nThey've made this actually a little\nbit more directive in the sense of\n\n799\n00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.680\nthe objectives where they're showing\nyou exactly how to configure.\n\n800\n00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.560\nBefore, they just mention it, now they're\nshowing, when you turn on PortFast,\n\n801\n00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.220\nlook at the next command, right?\n\n802\n00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.350\nSo let's practice that.\n\n803\n00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.765\nAll right, a couple more slides here guys.\n\n804\n00:42:33.765 --> 00:42:35.779\nVerifying spanning-tree.\n\n805\n00:42:35.779 --> 00:42:39.503\nVerify spanning-tree protocol, okay?\n\n806\n00:42:39.503 --> 00:42:41.485\nVerify the spanning tree protocol.\n\n807\n00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:42.173\nHow do you do this?\n\n808\n00:42:42.173 --> 00:42:44.568\nNow again,\nwhen you get to your objectives,\n\n809\n00:42:44.568 --> 00:42:46.341\nhow do you find your root bridge?\n\n810\n00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:51.605\nI've had students come and go well,\nI tried everything, show root,\n\n811\n00:42:51.605 --> 00:42:55.990\nshow bridge, show switch,\nand that's not the command.\n\n812\n00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.210\nIt's show spanning-tree.\n\n813\n00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.750\nSo repeat after me.\n\n814\n00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.140\nHow do you find your root bridge?\n\n815\n00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.980\nShow spanning-tree.\n\n816\n00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.249\nHow do you find your root bridge for\nVLAN 20?\n\n817\n00:43:07.249 --> 00:43:10.752\nShow spanning-tree VLAN 20.\n\n818\n00:43:10.752 --> 00:43:13.930\nThere's no such command as show bridge,\nokay?\n\n819\n00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.398\nThere's no such command as show route.\n\n820\n00:43:16.398 --> 00:43:20.067\nIt's show spanning-tree and\nthen you can type in VLAN and the number.\n\n821\n00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:23.079\nIf I just typed in show spanning tree and\nonly had a couple of VLANs, be fine.\n\n822\n00:43:23.079 --> 00:43:27.115\nIt would start with VLAN 1 and\nthen just spacebar through your next ones.\n\n823\n00:43:27.115 --> 00:43:28.878\nSo you'll see a little more down here.\n\n824\n00:43:28.878 --> 00:43:30.260\nThis would say more, right?\n\n825\n00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.305\nAnd then you spacebar and\nyou get your next VLAN.\n\n826\n00:43:32.305 --> 00:43:35.358\nBut let's take a look at this and\nhow you can find your root bridge.\n\n827\n00:43:35.358 --> 00:43:38.245\nAll right, so the top part here,\nfirst off it tells me,\n\n828\n00:43:38.245 --> 00:43:42.116\nnotice I just type show spanning-tree\ncuz that's the command I would type\n\n829\n00:43:42.116 --> 00:43:44.529\nto find out information\nabout my root bridge.\n\n830\n00:43:44.529 --> 00:43:47.111\nShow spanning-tree, right here.\n\n831\n00:43:47.111 --> 00:43:49.664\nThis ieee is 802.1d.\n\n832\n00:43:52.439 --> 00:43:58.123\nRoot bridge priority, 32769, let's talk\nabout that because the default is 32768.\n\n833\n00:43:58.123 --> 00:44:03.150\nNow right here, this tells us,\nthis bridge is the root, right?\n\n834\n00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.850\nSo it's pretty fun when you turn on\ndebugging and you change the priority,\n\n835\n00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.650\nit comes up and says, I am the root.\n\n836\n00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.700\nIt actually transmits that out.\n\n837\n00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.200\nSo this is information\nabout the root bridge here.\n\n838\n00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.671\nThis is information about\nthe root bridge for VLAN 1.\n\n839\n00:44:17.671 --> 00:44:19.766\nThat's this guy right here.\n\n840\n00:44:19.766 --> 00:44:20.559\nThat's the root bridge.\n\n841\n00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:24.330\nNow in this case here, the information\ndown here, the bridge ID and\n\n842\n00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.127\nso on is exactly the same, why?\n\n843\n00:44:26.127 --> 00:44:27.900\nBecause I am the root bridge.\n\n844\n00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.618\nThe other way I can tell I'm\nthe root bridge is down here.\n\n845\n00:44:29.618 --> 00:44:32.792\nNotice that everything is\ndesignated forwarding?\n\n846\n00:44:32.792 --> 00:44:34.829\nDesignated forwarding.\n\n847\n00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:39.824\nNow, I can have all forwarding ports or\ndesignated ports on a non-root bridge,\n\n848\n00:44:39.824 --> 00:44:43.672\nbut I'm gonna have something in there,\na non-root bridge.\n\n849\n00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:48.040\nI'm gonna have a root port,\na root port, right?\n\n850\n00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.850\nSo in this case here,\nI don't even have a root port, all right?\n\n851\n00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.470\nSo I have here,\nnotice that I have cost of 100, so\n\n852\n00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.230\nthis is a 10 megabit port, these are fast\nethernet ports, and that's fine.\n\n853\n00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:04.690\nNotice I had plugged these into a hub and\nthese showed up as a shared connection.\n\n854\n00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.550\nAnd this is a point-to-point connection.\n\n855\n00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.600\nAll right, so\nI can tell I'm in root bridge\n\n856\n00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.930\nbecause everything's designated\nforwarding, but hold on again.\n\n857\n00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.750\nA non-root bridge can have\neverything forwarding, but\n\n858\n00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.770\nyou would have a root port that says\nhow I connect to the root bridge.\n\n859\n00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:22.040\nI don't have that here.\n\n860\n00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.920\nAnd it also says that I'm the root bridge,\nokay?\n\n861\n00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:29.110\nSo just because you don't see any block\nports does not mean your root bridge.\n\n862\n00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.450\nIf you don't have a root port,\nthen you're root bridge.\n\n863\n00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.215\nJust like this says,\nI'm definitely the root bridge.\n\n864\n00:45:33.215 --> 00:45:38.297\nShow spanning-tree, VLAN1, 802.1d.\n\n865\n00:45:38.297 --> 00:45:39.470\nLet me mention this.\n\n866\n00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.638\nSo notice the priority.\n\n867\n00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:43.493\nI just wrote over it, 32769.\n\n868\n00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.836\n32769, okay?\n\n869\n00:45:49.836 --> 00:45:52.290\nWhat about,\nI thought my priority was 32768.\n\n870\n00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:57.671\nIt is, Cisco uses something\ncalled a system ID extension.\n\n871\n00:45:57.671 --> 00:46:01.472\nSo what it does is it\ntakes the root bridge ID,\n\n872\n00:46:01.472 --> 00:46:06.586\nthe priority here, 32768,\nand adds the VLAN number.\n\n873\n00:46:06.586 --> 00:46:09.822\nSo for VLAN1, it's 327.\n\n874\n00:46:09.822 --> 00:46:12.331\nSo my priority right here is 32768.\n\n875\n00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:14.777\nAdd the VLAN number, it's 32769.\n\n876\n00:46:14.777 --> 00:46:21.526\nFor VLAN2, it'd be 32770,\nVLAN3, 32771, and so on.\n\n877\n00:46:21.526 --> 00:46:24.063\nSo it uses something called\na system ID extension,\n\n878\n00:46:24.063 --> 00:46:26.240\nthat's why they're not the same.\n\n879\n00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.564\nNow I can see up here this is\nthe information about the root bridge for\n\n880\n00:46:31.564 --> 00:46:33.400\nVLAN1.\n\n881\n00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.450\nThat's where I'm at.\n\n882\n00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:37.802\nRemember I could have typed show\nVLAN spanning-tree VLAN10, right?\n\n883\n00:46:37.802 --> 00:46:40.716\nOr down here, press spacebar and\nget to the next VLAN.\n\n884\n00:46:40.716 --> 00:46:44.750\nBut nonetheless,\nnotice this is not my root bridge.\n\n885\n00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.770\nHow do you find your root bridge?\n\n886\n00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.250\nShow spanning-tree.\n\n887\n00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.190\nNow this is gonna tell me.\n\n888\n00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.430\nLook at this.\n\n889\n00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.570\nHere's the Mac address of the root bridge.\n\n890\n00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.000\nHere's my root bridge.\n\n891\n00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.400\nWell, that doesn't really help me.\n\n892\n00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.320\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n893\n00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.718\nYou give me a Mac address of the root\nbridge, it doesn't do much for me.\n\n894\n00:46:59.718 --> 00:47:03.688\nBut in this case here it's saying,\nbut you're a cost of 19 away.\n\n895\n00:47:03.688 --> 00:47:05.340\nWhat does that mean?\n\n896\n00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.160\nWell, that means one,\none fast ethernet link away.\n\n897\n00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:15.370\nAnd it tells you right here, your root\nbridge is connected off of Port 1.\n\n898\n00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.860\nI can come down here and see that.\n\n899\n00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.110\nMy root port, so\nif I didn't have a blocking port here.\n\n900\n00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:24.530\nI would still know I'm a non-root\nbridge because I have a root port.\n\n901\n00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.636\nRoot ports say,\nhere's how I get to my root bridge.\n\n902\n00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:28.573\nIt's off of Fa0/1.\n\n903\n00:47:28.573 --> 00:47:32.487\nNow, I wouldn't know to look at this,\nwhere my root bridge is, but\n\n904\n00:47:32.487 --> 00:47:34.009\nit says your cost of 19.\n\n905\n00:47:34.009 --> 00:47:38.293\nIf it said a cost of 38, that means I'm\ntwo bridges away from the root bridge.\n\n906\n00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:42.923\nI am directly connected to\nthe root bridge, off of Fa0/1.\n\n907\n00:47:42.923 --> 00:47:46.620\nSo in this example, again guys,\npay attention to what I'm saying here.\n\n908\n00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.590\nHow do you find your root bridge?\n\n909\n00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.054\nYou're gonna have to type out,\nshow spanning-tree, and\n\n910\n00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:54.322\nyou're gonna have to type out probably\nthe VLAN number, it doesn't matter.\n\n911\n00:47:54.322 --> 00:48:00.053\nFind your root port, trace that,\nyou might have to use show CDP.\n\n912\n00:48:00.053 --> 00:48:02.253\nWhatever.\nTrace that to your root bridge,\n\n913\n00:48:02.253 --> 00:48:06.497\nit's critical for your exam objectives\nthat you can find your root bridge for\n\n914\n00:48:06.497 --> 00:48:07.990\nour VLAN, all right.\n\n915\n00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.090\nSo we can see that we have an alternate,\nright?\n\n916\n00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.360\nThis is my backup, my blocked board here.\n\n917\n00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.775\nAnd this is information about me.\n\n918\n00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:18.070\nAll right here's my Mac address and so on.\n\n919\n00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.830\nSo, no that's how I find my root bridge.\n\n920\n00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.810\nShow span entry, follow your root port.\n\n921\n00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:29.140\nI might have to use CDP, and find out\nwho my neighbor is, go into that switch,\n\n922\n00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:34.620\nfind and show the spanning-tree to find\nout who the root port is, if I'm too away.\n\n923\n00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.440\nNo in this one here,\nshow spanning-tree vlan 30.\n\n924\n00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.616\nShow spanning-tree vlan 30.\n\n925\n00:48:40.616 --> 00:48:46.080\nAll right so now I'm looking at vlan 30,\nI'm not looking at the vlan 1 first,\n\n926\n00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.420\nbecause if I just type show\nspanning-tree vlan 1 would show up.\n\n927\n00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.340\nBut in this case here,\nI'm looking directly at vlan 30.\n\n928\n00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.500\nLet's take a look at it..\n\n929\n00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.035\nFirst off, notice what i'm running.\n\n930\n00:48:57.035 --> 00:49:01.720\nRSTP 802.1, 802.1W right?\n\n931\n00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.066\n802.1W.\n\n932\n00:49:03.066 --> 00:49:08.440\nSo not 802.1D, rapid span entry protocol.\n\n933\n00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.290\nNow this priority is what?\n\n934\n00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.750\nWell, I'm gonna look at that.\n\n935\n00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.090\nThe priorities didn't change.\n\n936\n00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.760\nHow I get my root ports didn't change?\n\n937\n00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.460\nHow I get my root bridge didn't change?\n\n938\n00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.470\nDon't get confused with\nRapid Spanning Tree Protocol.\n\n939\n00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.320\nAll it did was converge faster.\n\n940\n00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.030\nMy bridge parity here is what?\n\n941\n00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.250\nLower than the default, that's your\nanswer for the exam objectives.\n\n942\n00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.500\nWhat do you know about this bridge parity?\n\n943\n00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.090\nIt's lower than the default, right?\n\n944\n00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.410\nThat's all there is to it, okay?\n\n945\n00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.690\nSo that's gonna make\nthis bridge the route.\n\n946\n00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.800\nBecause the bridge ID was\nlower than the default.\n\n947\n00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.430\nAll right now if I look down here,\nthe other way I can tell,\n\n948\n00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.130\nI have designated forwarding ports here,\ndesignated forwarding ports.\n\n949\n00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.430\nI don't have any root ports or\nblocked ports.\n\n950\n00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.310\nAll right so we're root port, root bridge,\n\n951\n00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:51.469\nwe can tell,\ncuz all ports are in a forwarding state.\n\n952\n00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.750\nThey, now, one of the things if someone\nsays hey what's true about this?\n\n953\n00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.040\nOne of your options would be well the\nstates are blocking forwarding listing,\n\n954\n00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.930\nthat's not true it's RSTP you\ncan't have a blocking port.\n\n955\n00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:08.380\nYou have discarding,\ndiscarding learning forwarding, okay and\n\n956\n00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.190\nwe know that the bridge priority is lower.\n\n957\n00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.340\nNow let's take a look at one\nmore technology that's new for\n\n958\n00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.700\nthe objectives now, it wasn't.\n\n959\n00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.310\nIt was not in the last objectives.\n\n960\n00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.400\nIt's now new in these new objectives.\n\n961\n00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:23.720\nOkay?\n\n962\n00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.450\nAnd that's VLAN Trunking Protocol or VTP.\n\n963\n00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.855\nVLAN Trunking Protocol, okay so\nyears ago this was on the CCNA, it's back.\n\n964\n00:50:33.855 --> 00:50:38.000\n[LAUGH]\nIt's convoluted,\n\n965\n00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.500\nthere is no doubt about it.\n\n966\n00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.560\nI didn't see a huge amount of objectives\non this, but we're going to go through it.\n\n967\n00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.130\nAlright?\n\n968\n00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.870\nSo just a couple more slides guys.\n\n969\n00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.030\nI know this has been a huge section.\n\n970\n00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.050\nHang in there.\n\n971\n00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.320\nSo the first thing you do is\nyou set what's called a domain.\n\n972\n00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.690\nRight?\nAnd by default, everyone's a,\n\n973\n00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.240\nwhat's called a VTP server.\n\n974\n00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.300\nSo let's talk about this.\n\n975\n00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:03.590\nNow, the idea of VTP is that I\ncreate my VLAN database, right?\n\n976\n00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.740\nAnd then on one switch.\n\n977\n00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.970\nNow, I usually have to go to every\nother switch and configure those.\n\n978\n00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.330\nBut you could make something wrong.\n\n979\n00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.120\nSo if other words I came up here and\nsaid VLAN 2 named sales, and\n\n980\n00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.760\nthen I came down here and\nsaid VLAN2 name finance.\n\n981\n00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.130\nI might get confused.\n\n982\n00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.300\nMy naming isn't consistent.\n\n983\n00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.505\nSo this helps naming stay\nconsistent across your switches.\n\n984\n00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.600\nMost people don't use this anymore, and\n\n985\n00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.470\nI think that's why Cisco\nhad taken it off the exam.\n\n986\n00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.620\nI'm not even sure why it's back.\n\n987\n00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:34.500\nAnyways, so if I'm a VTP server, and\nall of them are VTP servers by default.\n\n988\n00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.246\nI can create, add and\n\n989\n00:51:38.246 --> 00:51:43.260\ndelete VLANs.\n\n990\n00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.480\nOkay, that's, you're like, yeah, so\nI can't do that on all switches?\n\n991\n00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.260\nNo, no you can't.\n\n992\n00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.070\nOnly on servers, all right?\n\n993\n00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.490\nNow, these guys, notice, are clients.\n\n994\n00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.290\nNow I have to go and\nconfigure them as clients.\n\n995\n00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.180\nRemember all of them\nare servers by default.\n\n996\n00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.580\nSo it means I can create add and\n\n997\n00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:01.770\ndelete vlans on every switch coming off\nthe Cisco factory floor by default.\n\n998\n00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.470\nSo now I'm gonna come up here and\nI'm gonna say create a v to p domain name.\n\n999\n00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:10.110\nThe minimum I have to do is connect\nthese guys with trunk links,\n\n1000\n00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:14.440\ncreate a domain name and then create some\nVLANs and it will be propagated out.\n\n1001\n00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.780\nNow these guys can be servers and\n\n1002\n00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.160\nstill receive that, that's based on\nsomething called my revision number.\n\n1003\n00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:27.070\nSo my revision number says I have\na higher better VLAN database than\n\n1004\n00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:31.889\nyou delete yours, that was the key point\nright there, delete yours and insert mine.\n\n1005\n00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.890\nSo it doesn't add it.\n\n1006\n00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.860\nIt actually deletes their VLAN database.\n\n1007\n00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.440\nSo that was been a point of\ncontention of VTP for a long time.\n\n1008\n00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.320\nAnyways VTP service create and\ndelete, clients receive it.\n\n1009\n00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.400\nNow these guys you can just\nkeep them as servers as well.\n\n1010\n00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.210\nThe problem with keeping these guys as\nservers is someone can come over here and\n\n1011\n00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:55.130\nadmin, he's out here, he creates a new\nVLAN here, gets a new VLAN database.\n\n1012\n00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.660\nWhat's it do?\n\n1013\n00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.830\nIt's got a new number.\n\n1014\n00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.860\nIt's gonna update the server here.\n\n1015\n00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.670\nAnd it's gonna propagate\nto all the other ones.\n\n1016\n00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:03.540\nNow we just change our VLAN database\nthroughout the entire network.\n\n1017\n00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.940\nSo that's how we verify spanning tree,\nshow spanning tree, find your root bridge.\n\n1018\n00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.890\nVery big objective there.\n\n1019\n00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:09.490\nWhen we come back,\n\n1020\n00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.550\nwe have another objective all right based\non this,on this virtual trunk protocol and\n\n1021\n00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:14.970\nwe're gonna move on to ether channel and\nso on.\n\n1022\n00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.140\nBut remember, show spanning tree.\n\n1023\n00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:21.270\n>> Alright, so in this segment,\nremember that what we took a look at here,\n\n1024\n00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:25.040\nof course is the basics of spanning\ntree and getting that understanding,\n\n1025\n00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.820\nthat foundational knowledge that we need.\n\n1026\n00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.420\nTo get ready for that exam.\n\n1027\n00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.460\nYou do not want to head into that exam if\nyou do not know this process of being able\n\n1028\n00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.290\nto find out the different\ncomponents that Todd talked about.\n\n1029\n00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.280\nSuch as a root bridge, knowing how\nto also discover the root port,\n\n1030\n00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.910\nas well as what ports will be\non forwarding, or blocking, or\n\n1031\n00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.680\nthe idea here of the discarding as well.\n\n1032\n00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.780\nGo back and take a look at this episode\na couple of times as you get ready for\n\n1033\n00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.120\nthat exam.\n\n1034\n00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.290\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off.\n\n1035\n00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.440\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n1036\n00:53:54.440 -->

Todd also describes the use of VTP and it’s practical usage by configuring the VTP domain-name and mode.  Even so it can be practical, it’s considered to bring more problems than solutions to a switching network.",

00:00:19.736\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking that ICND1 content, getting ready\n\n4\n00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:24.300\nfor that CCNA routing and switching exam\nthat has just come out from San Francisco.\n\n5\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230\nAnd in our studios today, we have well,\nMr. CCNA himself, Todd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.970\nThank you for\njoining us in the studios today.\n\n7\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.370\n>> Thank you Ronnie, it's good to be back.\n\n8\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.864\nI promise this section will be\na lot shorter than the last one.\n\n9\n00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:35.368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's probably the longest one\n\n10\n00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.630\nwe've done of any.\n\n11\n00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.070\nBut that's spanning tree guys and\nyou gotta go through it.\n\n12\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.710\nI'd go through that section a couple times\nand read my book as well, huge objective.\n\n13\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.550\nSpeaking of huge objectives, I got a new\none for you called virtual trunk protocol.\n\n14\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.170\nIt was back on the CCNA years ago and\nthen it was off.\n\n15\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.180\nIt's back.\n\n16\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n17\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.630\nVirtual trunk protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.153\nLet's take a look at what it is.\n\n19\n00:00:57.153 --> 00:01:03.685\nAll right, so virtual trunk protocol, or\nVTP, allows me, I can't even spell it,\n\n20\n00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:09.113\nVTP, allows me to create a VLAN\ndatabase on a server, on a VTP server,\n\n21\n00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:15.630\nand then send that out to all the other,\nwhat we're gonna call, VTP clients.\n\n22\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.320\nSo basically, this keeps naming consistent\ncuz I create one VLAN database.\n\n23\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.720\nI make sure it's the same on\nall of my other switches.\n\n24\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800\nThe reason this was off and the reason\na lot of people don't use this is it can\n\n25\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800\ncause problems and\nend up deleting your VLAN database.\n\n26\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.880\nSo, if you're not very careful it\ncauses more problems than it does help.\n\n27\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.320\nAnd anyway, so we're gonna ahead,\neveryone's a VTP server by default,\n\n28\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.030\nso there's three different types.\n\n29\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.672\nOn the server, which you are by default,\n\n30\n00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:47.330\nyou can create, add, and delete VLANs.\n\n31\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.076\nOn a client they can't do any of that.\n\n32\n00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:53.080\nI can't do anything, all I can do is\nreceive a VLAN database from a server,\n\n33\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.725\nall right?\n\n34\n00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:58.266\n[COUGH] So what I want to do here\nis go ahead and set my client so\n\n35\n00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.715\nno one can create VLANs there.\n\n36\n00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:04.385\nCuz what will happen is,\none of the admins will come down here and\n\n37\n00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:08.985\ncreate a new VLAN down here,\nwe're gonna, VLAN added down here.\n\n38\n00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:12.900\nAnd what it's gonna do is take this and\nerase it throughout your network and\n\n39\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.410\ntake their VLAN database,\nnow erase everyone else's.\n\n40\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.500\nSo the problem with VTP was,\n\n41\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.250\nwhen someone created a new VLAN database,\nit got a new revision number.\n\n42\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.130\nSo we want to look at,\nit's very important here, revision number.\n\n43\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.730\nAnd we'll take a look at this,\nand we'll configure this.\n\n44\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.530\nSo the VLAN database\ngets a revision number.\n\n45\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.772\nWhen that gets updated,\nthat's now propagated out.\n\n46\n00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:38.362\nEveryone deletes their VLAN database and\ninserts this new VLAN database, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:39.850\nSo you can see how this\ncould create a problem.\n\n48\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.480\nNow they came out with a version two and\na version three,\n\n49\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.910\nand the version three allowed me\nto create primary VTP servers.\n\n50\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.012\nSo, the reason we get errors is because\neveryone's a VTP server by default.\n\n51\n00:02:53.012 --> 00:02:56.355\nSo people can go and create VLANs anywhere\nand it would update the VLAN database and\n\n52\n00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:56.994\nwipe them out.\n\n53\n00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:01.124\nWell what we'd do with the newer\nrevisions of VTP is be able to say, hey,\n\n54\n00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:02.293\nyou're a primary.\n\n55\n00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:05.761\nThat means unless someone creates a VLAN\nhere, even though the rest are servers,\n\n56\n00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:08.000\nno one's gonna accept that database,\nright?\n\n57\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.648\nSo there was fixes that they\nhad with version two and three.\n\n58\n00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:16.430\nAll right, now, on this case here,\nwe're gonna propagate that,\n\n59\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.530\nwe're gonna look at the revision numbers,\nwe're gonna be careful.\n\n60\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.697\nWe can go through and make them clients.\n\n61\n00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:24.165\nI don't really use this too much\ntoday because of all the problems.\n\n62\n00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:28.026\nI think that they fixed the issues\nwith VTP version three, but\n\n63\n00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:32.999\nby then VTP had a such a bad name, no one\nwants to use it anymore because it created\n\n64\n00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.032\nmore problems than it fixed,\nright, or that it helped us with.\n\n65\n00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:38.647\nAnd so even though they came up\nwith a fix, everyone's like,\n\n66\n00:03:38.647 --> 00:03:39.559\nI don't even wanna hear about it.\n\n67\n00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.177\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is cumbersome,\n\n68\n00:03:41.177 --> 00:03:42.593\nit is extremely cumbersome.\n\n69\n00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:43.436\nWe'll take a look at it.\n\n70\n00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:45.039\nNow, there's three different types.\n\n71\n00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.907\nThere's server, client and transparent.\n\n72\n00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:49.673\nSo this is the default mode.\n\n73\n00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:54.484\nWe can create, add and delete VLANs, and\n\n74\n00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:58.390\nthen we synchronize these with\nother servers and clients.\n\n75\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.420\nRemember, everyone stay a server.\n\n76\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.312\nWhoever has the highest revision number,\nthe latest VLAN database wins.\n\n77\n00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:08.352\nEveryone else must delete and\ninsert, right?\n\n78\n00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:11.830\nSo, I think you're getting the idea\nhow this can create a problem.\n\n79\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.490\nSo, I had customers, they were\nstudying for their CCNA or NP and they\n\n80\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.100\nhad a switch on a test bed, and they were\ncreating VLANs and all this other stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.470\nAnd so basically they take this switch,\nso something went bad,\n\n82\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.270\nthey needed another switch so they'd go\ngrab this one off the test bed, put this\n\n83\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.950\nin the rack because this one went bad,\nit was three in the morning or something.\n\n84\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.430\nAnd it had all these VLANs in there with a\nsame domain name, right, that was the key,\n\n85\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.420\nand they had a high revision number\ncuz they were making a bunch of VLANs.\n\n86\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.730\nIt wiped out this complete\nhospital database from end to end,\n\n87\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.230\nthe entire thing was down, right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.160\nSo you can see,\nyour entire network goes down.\n\n89\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.810\nNow at that time on a lower code, all the\nports on the switches went amber, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.170\nSo what that meant is that all those ports\nwere assigned to VLANs that didn't exist\n\n91\n00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.100\nin the VLAN database, all right?\n\n92\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.890\nSo, I automatically knew what\nthe problem was when they called me.\n\n93\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.760\nBut to them they were like,\n\n94\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.602\nall my switches from end to end\nin 40 closets went bad, right?\n\n95\n00:05:09.602 --> 00:05:13.780\n[LAUGH] It took one switch to do that,\nright, one VTP switch.\n\n96\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.250\nBring down that entire network.\n\n97\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.960\nAll right now, so we're gonna go ahead and\nset the other ones as clients\n\n98\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.410\nif we're gonna use VTP, or\nyou can leave them all as servers.\n\n99\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.620\nBut typically you may use clients,\nthey cannot create, modify or\n\n100\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.170\ndelete VLANs at all.\n\n101\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.770\nWe synchronize with servers only, right?\n\n102\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.270\nNow, some people get confused\nbecause we can have, so\n\n103\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.110\nif I have a server up here connected\ndown here to a client, and\n\n104\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.540\nthen downstream I have another client.\n\n105\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.950\nThat's a possibility,\nthose are all trunk links.\n\n106\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.640\nSo people will tell me, no,\nno, I got this from a client,\n\n107\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.960\nI got a VTP database from a client,\nno you didn't.\n\n108\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.560\nIt forwards VTP advertisements,\nit forwards VTP summaries, right?\n\n109\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.150\nThe client will forward it, right?\n\n110\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.220\nIt's not going to update it\nfrom the client database,\n\n111\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.330\nit's gonna get it from the server, and\nthen forward it down to the other clients.\n\n112\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.720\nIt's just gonna forward it downstream.\n\n113\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.620\nAll right, now, transparent.\n\n114\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.690\nNow, what happened when we\nstarted having a lot of problems,\n\n115\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.020\npeople were like, I'm tired of this.\n\n116\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.120\nWe're having nothing but problems.\n\n117\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.100\nWe're gonna put everything\nin transparent mode.\n\n118\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.460\nWhat transparent mode means is that your\nswitch is not gonna receive anything.\n\n119\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.810\nIt's gonna just receive it.\n\n120\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.140\nNow, if you have other trunk links\nit's gonna forward it downstream to\n\n121\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.110\nother switches that might be there.\n\n122\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.173\nBut a transparent will never\nupdate its VLAN database\n\n123\n00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:35.700\nfrom a summary advertisement, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.375\nSo we're gonna have our own VLAN looked\nat, no ones gonna screw with it.\n\n125\n00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.693\nAnd so everyone that I knew had, when we\nhad so many problems, they started saying,\n\n126\n00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:44.730\neverything goes into transparent mode.\n\n127\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.660\nEverything was server, so\n\n128\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.560\nwhat we started doing was VTP\ntransparent mode in all our switches.\n\n129\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.740\nEvery database was local, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.550\nThat's the typical configuration for\nall my customers today.\n\n131\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.399\nSo on the CCNA though,\nthat's not what you're gonna see.\n\n132\n00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.770\nYou're gonna see servers and clients,\nthey're gonna ask you what transparent is,\n\n133\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.510\nand that means, hey, I have my local\ndatabase but wait, don't forget, it's not\n\n134\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.860\ngonna synchronize a VLAN configuration,\nbut it is going to send it downstream.\n\n135\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.170\nSo if it comes in one trunk port,\n\n136\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.060\nit's gonna send it out another\ntrunk port downstream.\n\n137\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.766\nSo it will forward the VTP\nsummary advertisements.\n\n138\n00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:21.720\nOkay, and lastly to look at, then we'll go\nand configure it, here's how you do it.\n\n139\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.398\nVtp domain Lammle, in this case here,\nyou site your domain.\n\n140\n00:07:25.398 --> 00:07:27.365\nYou have to have at least one switch for\nthe domain.\n\n141\n00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:28.080\nSo you're like, one switch?\n\n142\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.800\nDon't they have, no, not really.\n\n143\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.980\nSo if they all come out with,\nthey're just colon, the name is nothing.\n\n144\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.590\nAnd if I set one with a domain name,\nthe other ones will see the summary\n\n145\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.050\nadvertisement and\nset themselves to that domain name.\n\n146\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.160\nThis is another problem with VTP.\n\n147\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.740\nIt kinda tries to auto-configure\nitself and it does it very poorly.\n\n148\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.400\nAll right, so what'll happen is\nI'll send Lammle down there.\n\n149\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.090\nThe switch will go,\nlook what I got in my trunk link,\n\n150\n00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.280\nI'm now part of the Lammle domain.\n\n151\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.096\nLet me get your VTP VLAN database.\n\n152\n00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:54.651\nMaybe you didn't want\nthat switch to get it.\n\n153\n00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:57.684\nToo bad, he's connected to the trunk link,\nhe's gonna get it now, and\n\n154\n00:07:57.684 --> 00:07:59.248\nhe's gonna forward it downstream.\n\n155\n00:07:59.248 --> 00:08:02.126\nOkay, so I set the transport,\nthe domain name.\n\n156\n00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.440\nNow, notice, though, in this case here.\n\n157\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.267\nTransparent mode.\n\n158\n00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.296\nVTP mode transparent.\n\n159\n00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:08.988\nTo turn off now, in VTP3.\n\n160\n00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.390\nYou can say, VTP, I think it's mode off.\n\n161\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.700\nI forget what the command is.\n\n162\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.850\nBut the problem with VTP, what upset\neveryone, is you couldn't turn it off.\n\n163\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.970\nThe only thing you could do is\ngo to all your switches, and\n\n164\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.660\nmake them transparent mode.\n\n165\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.220\nThat was the way to turn off VTP.\n\n166\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.090\nVTP was very annoying,\nit was very difficult.\n\n167\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.340\nShow VTP status right?\n\n168\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.340\nRemember, for our root bridge,\nshow spanning tree for\n\n169\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.390\nVTP, show VTP settings,\nit's only one command.\n\n170\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.579\nOne command to verify VTP,\nshow VTP status.\n\n171\n00:08:41.318 --> 00:08:44.798\nWe see we're version capable 1 to 3,\nand I'm running version 2,\n\n172\n00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:47.120\nthat's typically what everyone runs.\n\n173\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.885\nAgain, 3 would probably be\nbetter if you're gonna run this,\n\n174\n00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:51.080\nbecause you can set your primary servers,\nand\n\n175\n00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.360\nthen you can turn it off instead of having\nto set everything to transparent mode.\n\n176\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.630\nIn this case,\nhere the domain name is Lammlie, and\n\n177\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.410\ndown here I'm now transparent mode.\n\n178\n00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.369\nNow check this out, guys.\n\n179\n00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:06.261\nHow many VLANs are supported locally?\n\n180\n00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:09.930\n1005, remember our default.\n\n181\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.848\nOur defaults that you can't change are 1,\n1002, through 1005.\n\n182\n00:09:13.848 --> 00:09:19.750\nSo we can create VLANs from 2 to 1,001,\nthat's 1,000 VLANs.\n\n183\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.348\nOkay, now here's my revision number,\n\n184\n00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:24.170\nthis is the number you gotta pay\nattention to for your exam objectives.\n\n185\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.240\nBecause they're going to say,\n\n186\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.750\nwhat happens if you get this,\nlet's say that this number was like 12.\n\n187\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.960\nWhatever, I'm just making up a number.\n\n188\n00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.470\nAnd they're going to say, okay looking at\nthis switch here, what happens when you\n\n189\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.250\nget that speed line data base from\nswitch a and your switch c whatever.\n\n190\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.520\nYou're gonna have to go to switch a and\nsee what it's revision number is,\n\n191\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.250\nif it's less than 12, or\nequal to 12 nothing happens.\n\n192\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.050\nIf it's greater than 12, well in\nthis case here, I'm transparent, so\n\n193\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.340\nnothing again nothing would happen,\nbut if I was client or a server and\n\n194\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.540\nit was greater than 12 Then I would erase\nmy VLAN database and get the new one.\n\n195\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.190\nIf it was twelve or lower nothing\nwould happen, I would just discard it.\n\n196\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.220\nYou've got to remember that.\n\n197\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.480\nNow then down here, this is your MD5,\nthis is your password, so\n\n198\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.970\nyou can set a password here.\n\n199\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.470\nThis is your MD5 hash down here.\n\n200\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.920\nSo these have to match.\n\n201\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.970\nSo a lot of times you're looking at it,\nit's got a higher reversion number but\n\n202\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.190\nit's rejecting it.\n\n203\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.990\nCheck your password.\n\n204\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.470\n'Show VTP password' is the command.\n\n205\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.348\nAll right, let's go out and\ndo some labs now.\n\n206\n00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:26.870\nAll right, so, we're gonna come over here.\n\n207\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.520\nI've got my three switches here.\n\n208\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.060\nLet's start with switch one.\n\n209\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.860\nNow, we've got some labs to do.\n\n210\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.310\nWe've got the spanning tree labs to do,\nright.\n\n211\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.500\nShow, what's the command to see my\nroot bridge, is it show bridge?\n\n212\n00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.050\nI can't remember.\n\n213\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.320\n>> Show spanning dash tree.\n\n214\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.500\n>> Show, okay, show bridge.\n\n215\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.305\nThat didn't work.\n\n216\n00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:46.844\nHow about, show root-bridge?\n\n217\n00:10:46.844 --> 00:10:50.152\nEveryone, these are all the commands\nmy students tell me I try to type in.\n\n218\n00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:51.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Doesn't work.\n\n219\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.330\nAnd some other bad words.\n\n220\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.330\nBut anyway, show, I'm gonna spanning tree.\n\n221\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.580\nNow, remember, I can type vlan, whatever.\n\n222\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.990\nBut, I can just press enter here,\nand I'm gonna take a look here now.\n\n223\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.340\nFirst off, I'm gonna come down here,\nand I see a lot of alternate BLK ports.\n\n224\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.310\nI'm gonna guess that I\nam not a root bridge.\n\n225\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.350\nI think that's a pretty good one.\n\n226\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.090\nP2p.\nI've got a root port thought\n\n227\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.510\nthat tells me how I get\nto my root bridge and\n\n228\n00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.870\nthen I'm a cost of 19 away Whatever my\nroute bridge is, it's off of port 19.\n\n229\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:28.078\nSo how would I find out the host\nname of my route bridge?\n\n230\n00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.227\n>> You would use CDP.\n\n231\n00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:35.047\n>> Show CDP neighbor,\nI'm gonna look off of what's off port 19,\n\n232\n00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:36.580\nthat's my route bridge.\n\n233\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.430\nOkay, so here's my 19 right here,\nso switch one,\n\n234\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.760\nI thought I was in switch\none I'm in switch three.\n\n235\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.400\nSwitch one is the root bridge for\nwhat though?\n\n236\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.770\nSo let's go back up here, for VLAN one.\n\n237\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.460\nSo I'm up here.\n\n238\n00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.150\nRemember, PVST I'm in VLAN one.\n\n239\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.210\nI didn't type in show spanning tree VLAN\none, I just typed show spanning tree and\n\n240\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:58.870\nit gave me one.\n\n241\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.340\nNow, I've set these to factory default,\nso I don't have any VLANs,\n\n242\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.360\nwe can go out there and create a couple\nVLANs, and play with the root bridges.\n\n243\n00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.720\n32769, my default is 32768,\n\n244\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.540\nplus the system ID extension of\nthe VLAN number, which is 1.\n\n245\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.680\nThis is the, my root bridge information.\n\n246\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.140\nYou can see that it doesn't, it would\nsay this, you are the root bridge, or\n\n247\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.400\nI ame the root bridge, whatever.\n\n248\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.030\nAnd in this case here it says nope,\nyou are not through a bridge,\n\n249\n00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.470\nhere it is right here, it's a cost of 19.\n\n250\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.150\nCost of 19.\n\n251\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.120\nOff of port 19 which it should say 0/19\nthere, but it says right there, so\n\n252\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.090\nit tells me where my root bridge is.\n\n253\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.550\nI can't tell you how important this is for\nyour objectives.\n\n254\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.720\nWho's your root bridge?\n\n255\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.000\nHow do you find your root bridge?\n\n256\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.326\nShow spanning tree, trace it down.\n\n257\n00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:48.980\nNo, so I did a show cdp neighbours\nto find it off of port 19 here.\n\n258\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.770\nSo let's do this, let's see,\nlet's do show vlan from here.\n\n259\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:57.927\nNow, I got some other vlans on here,\nso let's do this,\n\n260\n00:12:57.927 --> 00:13:02.695\nshow vlan, I'm sorry,\nshow spanning-tree vlan 2.\n\n261\n00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:07.924\nOkay, so again so\nnow I'm looking at plan 2, and\n\n262\n00:13:07.924 --> 00:13:12.790\nwe can see again is off of 19,\nso switch one.\n\n263\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.880\nHe is like the king right now,\nthat's the king.\n\n264\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.860\nOur roads lead to Rome and right now this\nis information about my root bridge.\n\n265\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.300\nThis is information about me down here.\n\n266\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.570\nThis is information about my root bridge.\n\n267\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.790\nAnd we can see,\nthis is typically what we'll see.\n\n268\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.920\nI see a root port to my root bridge, and\nI also have an alternate back-up port.\n\n269\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.900\nIt's blocked.\n\n270\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.570\nAnd then I have some other\nforwarding ports here.\n\n271\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.190\nI take it you don't see everything\nblocked like I did on that last one,\n\n272\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.200\nbut you never know.\n\n273\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.588\nShow speed lan,\nvlan 4 I think was another one.\n\n274\n00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:44.280\nOkay, again, 802.1d,\nI get these off of, man,\n\n275\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.730\nwe gotta go out there and look at switch\none and see what's going on here.\n\n276\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.100\nBut why don't I do this?\n\n277\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.840\nWhy don't I do this?\n\n278\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.170\nI wanna be the root bridge.\n\n279\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.740\nNow remember, why would I wanna be\nthe root bridge for a particular VLAN,\n\n280\n00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.980\nin all VLANs efficiency\nof root bridge selection?\n\n281\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.450\nAll right, so I'm gonna say this.\n\n282\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.226\nI'm gonna say config t.\n\n283\n00:14:00.226 --> 00:14:03.336\n[COUGH]\n\n284\n00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:08.830\nSpanning tree Vlan 4, and\n\n285\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.770\nthen I should be able to do you so there's\na couple things I can do here guys.\n\n286\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.920\nI can set the root configure the switch\nas a root, so I can say root.\n\n287\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.540\nAnd if I did that but I could also do\nthis priority oops what'd I do here.\n\n288\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.110\nPriority, and now the set's\ngonna be in increments of 4096.\n\n289\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.960\nSo if I was to set this down here,\nand it didn't give me the number.\n\n290\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.030\nSo I'm going to have to remember.\n\n291\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.770\nSo if I said 16384.\n\n292\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.520\nI'm just, those are just some numbers I\nremember, b ecause just in increments.\n\n293\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.730\nBut in 4096, and so on.\n\n294\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.200\nI just became the bridge for VLAN4.\n\n295\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.610\nDid I bring down VLAN4?\n\n296\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.860\nYes, I did, for about a minute.\n\n297\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.240\nBecause it's gotta converge.\n\n298\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.537\nSo, if I said, show spanning.\n\n299\n00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:05.450\nNotice I'm in learning mode,\nbecause I'm in my transition state.\n\n300\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.660\nSo, I've got forwarding, learning,\nI don't even have any block states.\n\n301\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.260\nI'm going through my transition state.\n\n302\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.400\nVLAN4 is down,\nbecause we're trying to find.\n\n303\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.610\nSo remember, we've got about a minute\nwe've got to sit here, right?\n\n304\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.010\nNow we've got to go into listening mode,\nright?\n\n305\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.970\nWe were into listening mode.\n\n306\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.080\nNow we're into learning.\n\n307\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.580\nAnd now I'm all forwarding.\n\n308\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.990\nWhy am I all forwarding?\n\n309\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.380\nBecause I set my priority, look at this.\n\n310\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.170\nThis bridge is the root.\n\n311\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.880\nI just set it down to 16384.\n\n312\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.510\nRight?\n\n313\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:37.310\nAnd so we could see that 16384 is my\npriority, and these are the same because\n\n314\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.680\nI became the root bridge 16384 plus this\nis mighty extension, gives me 16388.\n\n315\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.130\nNow these are all forty.\n\n316\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.080\nNow let's take a look, let's do vlan 2.\n\n317\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.100\nI am not the root bridge.\n\n318\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.250\nI want to be the root bridge for VLAN two.\n\n319\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.988\nWell let's do it a different way.\n\n320\n00:15:57.524 --> 00:16:02.191\nAnd let's do root primary or secondary?\n\n321\n00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:03.270\nI'm gonna be the primary.\n\n322\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:08.520\nWhat I want you to notice\nis what my priority became.\n\n323\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.870\n32768 is the default.\n\n324\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:16.390\nSo now we're setting to two, and\nI'm going to do show, spanning, two.\n\n325\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.420\nNow I'm listening, all right?\n\n326\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.230\nSo that takes ten seconds.\n\n327\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.530\nThen we should go to learning,\nI'm too fast here.\n\n328\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.050\nI am faster than spanning tree.\n\n329\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.910\nI'm trying to go slow.\n\n330\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.940\nNow I'm in learning for\n15 seconds and then we're gonna see,\n\n331\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.720\nnotice my priority here.\n\n332\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.000\nIt's set to 24576 plus the system ID.\n\n333\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.980\nOkay, so notice it lowered it.\n\n334\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.210\nAll right, and\nnow I'm the root bridge for VLAN 2.\n\n335\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.520\nBut notice, so\n\n336\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.660\nnow I've set one as a primary root,\nroot primary, is that the command?\n\n337\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.180\n>> Yes.\n\n338\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.530\n>> The other one I set a priority,\ndoes it matter?\n\n339\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.830\nNot really, it's just kinda easier to do\nthis and we could see it a lot easier.\n\n340\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.520\nRight when we do that now.\n\n341\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.540\nNow let's say that we have two of the\nthings we have to do before we get to VTP.\n\n342\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.850\nLet's say that I want to run 802.1w.\n\n343\n00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:18.060\nI want to do this in all my switches, so\nif I come back over here hold on a second.\n\n344\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.690\nSo I am going to do show spanning tree.\n\n345\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.780\nYou know what is funny?\n\n346\n00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.750\nI know you can't see it but this is a,\nyou can't do this from user mode for\n\n347\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.880\nsome reason.\n\n348\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.220\nI thought you would be able to.\n\n349\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.070\nSpanning tree vlan 2.\n\n350\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.100\nNow that we are going to see\nthat I am not to root bridge.\n\n351\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.260\nOkay, so, I'm nineteen away\noff of port 19, my root port.\n\n352\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.920\nSo, again, to find your root bridge, if\nsomeone says this, I'm going to say who's\n\n353\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.790\nmy root bridge, we can see that here's\nthe priority of my root bridge,\n\n354\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.130\nhere's me, 32768 plus system id of VLAN2.\n\n355\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.520\n32576 plus vlan two.\n\n356\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.740\nAll right.\nSo I can do show.\n\n357\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.430\nI wanna see who's off of Fa0/19 and\nwho's my root bridge.\n\n358\n00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.487\nWell, we kind of know who it is but\nyou gotta get used to this.\n\n359\n00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:11.900\nGotta be able to find your root bridge.\n\n360\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.470\nAnd off of 19 is Switch 3.\n\n361\n00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.330\nAll right?\n\n362\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.590\nSo that's your answer, press Next, right?\n\n363\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.080\nWho's your root bridge.\n\n364\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.920\nAll right.\nNow hold on We can see that we are all\n\n365\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.060\nrunning 802.1d.\n\n366\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:28.700\nSo I'm going to come under here and\nI'm going to go under all switches t.\n\n367\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.860\nSpanning tree mode,\nlet's see what options we have here.\n\n368\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.630\nMST Multiple spanning tree 802.1s,, rapid.\n\n369\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:45.930\nSo I wanna say, rapid pvst, that's 802.1w.\n\n370\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.340\nThat's it, I am now running it.\n\n371\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.480\nNow since my other two aren't running it,\n\n372\n00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.600\nnow when you did that,\nmy network did go down.\n\n373\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.460\nJust remember when you play with\nSpanning Tree your network goes down.\n\n374\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.380\nNow this bridge will come\nup relatively quickly but\n\n375\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.070\nthe other ones will be about a minute.\n\n376\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.370\nAll right?\nThis is gonna affect\n\n377\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.950\nall of your VLANs at this point.\n\n378\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.863\nSo let's come back over here,\n\n379\n00:19:12.897 --> 00:19:16.438\nSpanning-tree mode and rapid pvst.\n\n380\n00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:17.541\nI'm done.\n\n381\n00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:19.205\nThat's it, that's all I have to do and\n\n382\n00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:21.131\nthen let's go over to\nour other switch here.\n\n383\n00:19:31.224 --> 00:19:34.383\nOkay, now, so\nlet's go back down here and verify it.\n\n384\n00:19:42.162 --> 00:19:47.259\nShows, show spanning tree,\nI think line one's fine.\n\n385\n00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:51.903\nNote it says more because\nI have more VLANs.\n\n386\n00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:53.880\nSo this is VLAN one.\n\n387\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.310\nNotice we're running RSTP.\n\n388\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.100\nNotice, we have discarded,\nthese are discarding, but\n\n389\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.560\nthese are an alternate blocking,\nbut we're running RSTP.\n\n390\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.650\nNothing else really changed here.\n\n391\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.000\nHere's vlan2.\n\n392\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.920\nNotice I am the root port for vlan2.\n\n393\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.100\nI wasn't the root port for\nvlan1, that was switch1.\n\n394\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.830\nLet's see if switch1 is still,\nit's gig 19.\n\n395\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.260\nWe know that goes to there.\n\n396\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:24.170\nSo let's go over to this switch here and\nmake this switch The root port for vlan 1.\n\n397\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.390\nHow do you want to do it Ronnie?\n\n398\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.970\nTwo different ways,\nset the priority or change it to root?\n\n399\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.250\n>> Let's change the root.\n\n400\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.200\n>> Okay.\n\n401\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.900\nthe vlan 1, okay root and\nthen either primary or secondary.\n\n402\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.070\nSo you are a primary.\n\n403\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.570\n>> Primary.\n\n404\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.000\n>> Okay now I am primary for vlan one.\n\n405\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.560\nLet's go down here.\n\n406\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.610\nI can do this and then do show span and\nI'll just hit that for\n\n407\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:01.440\nv land one and now I'm blocked for\nit because we're no longer the rebridge.\n\n408\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.560\nSo let's find out the root\nport is now port 21.\n\n409\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.770\nDid you see how fast that happened?\n\n410\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.050\nI couldn't do it faster\nthan spanning tree now.\n\n411\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:16.280\nI can do it faster than 802.1 but\ni can't do it faster than 802.1W, alright?\n\n412\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.230\nSo you can see this here, that took what?\n\n413\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.290\nLike two or three seconds maybe and\nthat was already route port.\n\n414\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.619\nMy network was up and converged.\n\n415\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.590\nSo if we look off here,\nI'm off of port 21.\n\n416\n00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.470\nShow, what am I looking at, cdp neighbor.\n\n417\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.370\nSee who's on port 21.\n\n418\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.132\nSwitch 2, bridge, three line one.\n\n419\n00:21:34.132 --> 00:21:35.280\nVery cool guys.\n\n420\n00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.340\nPlay with this, objective, huge.\n\n421\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.940\nNow, I have a lot of ports on\nthis switch that are just for\n\n422\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.290\nhosts and they're timing out\nwhen I'm plugging for DHCPM.\n\n423\n00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.160\nI'm getting a lot of calls.\n\n424\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.780\nHey I can't get in.\n\n425\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.360\nI have to do IP release\nrenew all the time.\n\n426\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.000\nWhat do you guys think we should do?\n\n427\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.450\n>> BPDU guard or port fast.\n\n428\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.130\n>> Port fast.\nNo, he was right.\n\n429\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.070\nWhen we do port fast,\nthen you want to do BPDU guard right?\n\n430\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.680\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n431\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.440\nI'm going to choose all of my host ports,\nso I have to determine what those are.\n\n432\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.280\nNow remember I can turn it\non in the switch and hold.\n\n433\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.900\nLet's do it,\nbecause it will bring our network down.\n\n434\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.030\nIt's going to be great.\n\n435\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.560\nSo, to do this, I can say spanning tree,\nso this is going to turn it on by default.\n\n436\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.190\nSpanning tree portfast, and\nthen I think it's default.\n\n437\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.200\nMy switch right?\n\n438\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.530\nIt says warning, warning.\n\n439\n00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.580\nThis command enables\nportfast on all interfaces.\n\n440\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.160\nYou should now disable portfast explicity\non switch ports leaving the hubs.\n\n441\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.860\nWhy would I want to do that?\n\n442\n00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.570\nThat wouldn't be any fun.\n\n443\n00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.140\nThen my network wouldn't go down.\n\n444\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.700\nI have portfast enabled on all of\nmy switchports on this switch.\n\n445\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.300\nThink that's bad?\n\n446\n00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.140\nIt is bad because I have switch boards\nbetween their trunk ports and everything.\n\n447\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.150\nIs that going to cause a problem?\n\n448\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.150\nSure it is!\n\n449\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.800\nSo we're going to get some sort of loop.\n\n450\n00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.820\nSo [COUGH] the other thing that we\nshould turn on though by default.\n\n451\n00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.880\nSo I'm probably not going to do that.\n\n452\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.750\nI'm going to do Ctrl+A and say no because\nthat turned on every single port.\n\n453\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.810\nSo I'm going to go in here and say\ninterface range, I think, are we gig here?\n\n454\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.446\nYeah, we're gig.\n\n455\n00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:05.697\nGig, zero, one,\n\n456\n00:23:05.697 --> 00:23:10.377\n[SOUND] See what it tells me.\n\n457\n00:23:10.377 --> 00:23:12.896\nOkay, I already got that.\n\n458\n00:23:12.896 --> 00:23:15.280\nI think it's, we'll say 24.\n\n459\n00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.830\nEh, that worked.\n\n460\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.020\nI think the other ones are my uplinks.\n\n461\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.760\nSo 24.\n\n462\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.080\nPort switch, four uplinks.\n\n463\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.296\nNow I'm gonna say spanning tree,\nPort fast.\n\n464\n00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:32.090\nAnd yeah and then just Enter, yeah.\n\n465\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.200\nPort fast be configured in 24\ninterfaces due to the range command.\n\n466\n00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.790\nWill only have effect these\nare in non-trunking mode.\n\n467\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.590\nSo again, I'm not gonna put\nthis on trunk links, right?\n\n468\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.590\nSo in this case here,\nbe careful on which ones you put this in.\n\n469\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.450\nAnd if you do this,\nnow what do I wanna turn on?\n\n470\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.320\nSpanning tree, you said it before.\n\n471\n00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.192\n>> BPDU guard.\n\n472\n00:23:50.192 --> 00:23:56.053\n>> PortFast, now, BPDU, now PortFast.\n\n473\n00:23:56.053 --> 00:23:56.554\n>> Nope.\n\n474\n00:23:56.554 --> 00:24:01.513\n>> In this case, not Spanning tree,\nBP I'm sorry I was doing it wrong.\n\n475\n00:24:01.513 --> 00:24:05.020\nBPDU, notice there's a BPDU guard and\na BTU filter.\n\n476\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.880\nNow you can do the filter here now that's\njust going to drop the frame so you don't\n\n477\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.870\ncreate a loop, but it's not going to\ntell you if you have a problem, and\n\n478\n00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.770\nsome people are going to plug in, and the\nlight's going to be blinking green, and\n\n479\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.590\nthey're going I don't know why it's not\nworking, it's in there, the light's green.\n\n480\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:21.810\nBPDU guard is a better way to go because\nit's going to shut down the port.\n\n481\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.350\nEnable.\nEspana-tree Bpduguard enabled,\n\n482\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.240\nokay, look at it.\n\n483\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.135\nIt's now bringing down my network now.\n\n484\n00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.270\n[LAUGH] I just brought down my network.\n\n485\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.960\nThat is awesome.\n\n486\n00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.240\nOkay, so, I turned it on.\n\n487\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.910\nIt says, well you already have it in\nall these ports, well now you don't.\n\n488\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.140\nBecause it went and it shut down.\n\n489\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.120\nIf I go and look at these ports,\nlet's go see which one it shut down.\n\n490\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.820\nPutting gig in error disables.\n\n491\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.080\nDan, check that out.\n\n492\n00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.660\nThis is awesome.\n\n493\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.240\nAll right.\nSo show interface what was it, gig 22.\n\n494\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:49.740\n>> Yes.\n\n495\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.300\n>> Okay.\n\n496\n00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.850\nDown line proto error disabled.\n\n497\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:55.760\nNice.\n\n498\n00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.580\nHey it works.\n\n499\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.250\n>> It does work.\n\n500\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.500\n>> That is awesome.\n\n501\n00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.440\nSo the way to fix that, let's turn\noff this so I can get to my BPT lab.\n\n502\n00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.650\nInterface, what do I do?\n\n503\n00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:09.310\nGig, zero, one through 24, range command.\n\n504\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.400\nI'm going to turn this off, but\ndid you see how this worked?\n\n505\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.050\nThat was awesome!\n\n506\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.770\nPlay with this before you take your exam,\nso you really have that down.\n\n507\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:25.740\nNow I should be able to just,\nI want to take off, it was this one.\n\n508\n00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.270\nHold on, I'm getting there guys, hold on.\n\n509\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.440\nSpanish portfast.\n\n510\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.450\nThat's right, I turned off portfast.\n\n511\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.040\nNow the problem is I\ndidn't fix the problem.\n\n512\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.610\nI turned off portfast and that's fine.\n\n513\n00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.200\nNow I'm not running port fast anymore,\nokay.\n\n514\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.070\nNo spanning tree.\n\n515\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.120\nLet me make sure.\n\n516\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.560\nPort fast, okay.\n\n517\n00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.760\nI, there isn't a default on the end.\n\n518\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.320\nThat's why I wanted to do that again.\n\n519\n00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.190\nNow, I've turned off port fast.\n\n520\n00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.270\nMy ports are still down.\n\n521\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.140\nIf I went and looked at the switch,\nthey're all amber, all right.\n\n522\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.020\nSo I'm going to have to go into interface.\n\n523\n00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.320\nNow what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take\nall these ports and shut them down.\n\n524\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.560\nNow, don't do this in production.\n\n525\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.000\nI'm in a non-production environment,\nwe're in a test lab.\n\n526\n00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.942\nI'm like screw it, just bring my whole\nscript, it's easier, and then a no shut.\n\n527\n00:26:15.942 --> 00:26:18.860\nOkay, now that's going to take all\nthe ports that were on port fast, and\n\n528\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.240\nthen re-enable them.\n\n529\n00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.730\nAll right?\nSo we can see them, they went down and\n\n530\n00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:22.550\nthey're going to come back up.\n\n531\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.860\nAgain, don't do this in production,\nwhat I just did.\n\n532\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.400\nThis is on a testbed.\n\n533\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.310\nI would have to go to\nthose ports individually.\n\n534\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.980\nWell, your network was down anyway, so you\ndidn't really hurt anything by doing this.\n\n535\n00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.040\nAnd, now, do I still have BPDU guard on or\nsomething?\n\n536\n00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.063\n>> It looks like you do.\n\n537\n00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:40.749\n>> [LAUGH] It looks that way.\n\n538\n00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:42.060\nAll right, so, no spanning.\n\n539\n00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.508\nThis is awesome.\nThis is a great lab, guys.\n\n540\n00:26:43.508 --> 00:26:47.887\nbpduguard.\n\n541\n00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.270\n[LAUGH] No span should be tgguard.\n\n542\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.033\nOkay, now I'm going to shut,\nSo I turn that off,\n\n543\n00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:04.400\nlet that all go,\nthis is awesome, this is fun.\n\n544\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.000\nI hope this is fun.\n\n545\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.935\nThis is fun, right?\n\n546\n00:27:05.935 --> 00:27:07.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is fun.\n\n547\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.270\nNow it should bring up all my ports here.\n\n548\n00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.200\nThey should go down and\nthen they should come back up.\n\n549\n00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.760\nNegotiating, okay.\n\n550\n00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.500\nThere we go.\n\n551\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.620\nAll right, no we're up.\n\n552\n00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.100\nNow we got a domain miss-match\nwhich we're gonna fix right now.\n\n553\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.440\nBut the fact is, is I had BPDU guard on,\nit shut down all those ports,\n\n554\n00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.540\nthe only way to get them done is to do\na no-shut on them and to clear them out.\n\n555\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.650\nI didn't turn everything\noff to get those working.\n\n556\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.130\nLet's take a look at one more thing and\nfor\n\n557\n00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.480\nme to be able to do that I needed to\nget my network back up and running.\n\n558\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.040\nThis has been really fun.\n\n559\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.120\nMake sure you do this in your\nlabs cuz this is a lot of fun.\n\n560\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.850\nNot show VLAN.\n\n561\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.450\nI want-\n>> VTP.\n\n562\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:48.790\n>> VTP.\n\n563\n00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.140\nShow vtp.\nThere's only one command, guys.\n\n564\n00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.900\nWhat is it?\n\n565\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.480\nOne VTP command, show vtp status.\n\n566\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.290\nSo I can see here that I'm running\nversion 2, and that's fine.\n\n567\n00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.830\nLook at my configuration\nrevision number 21.\n\n568\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.060\nCuz it's been raising as I've been\nplaying it for the last week,\n\n569\n00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.290\nwhenever I've been playing on this.\n\n570\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.540\nEvery time I make a change,\nit changes the revision number.\n\n571\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.810\nMost the time.\n\n572\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.140\nIt only changes it when\nyou don't want it to.\n\n573\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.300\nWhen you want it to,\nyou're looking at it, it never changes.\n\n574\n00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.040\nAnyways.\n\n575\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.620\n1005, 16,\nyou've got to be able to read this.\n\n576\n00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.270\nOkay, I am a server, and the domain name.\n\n577\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.090\nI'm gonna change this\nto vtp domain Lannle.\n\n578\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.940\nOkay, so now I'm Lannle.\n\n579\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.020\nAnd I am a server.\n\n580\n00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.779\nAnd that's fine, I'm gonna make switch\nthree, I'm gonna make this guy a client.\n\n581\n00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.330\nOkay, whoops,\nhow about if I type in vtp mode client.\n\n582\n00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.805\nOkay, so now I'm a client mode.\n\n583\n00:28:45.805 --> 00:28:53.550\nOkay, so I'm a client.\n\n584\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.270\nDomain name Lammle.\n\n585\n00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.340\nLook at my revision number.\n\n586\n00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.230\nNow I've got to be honest with you,\nit didn't used to do this, it used to keep\n\n587\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.150\nthe revision number, so when you go\nto create your server, you're 21.\n\n588\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.090\nYou had to raise your revision number\non your server to get pass that number\n\n589\n00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.050\nso it update.\n\n590\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.360\nIn this case they already\nfixed it because there were so\n\n591\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.710\nmany problems with this that when I\nnominate a client it changed it back to 0.\n\n592\n00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.940\nI got to be honest it\ndoesn't always changes to 0.\n\n593\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.960\nGot to keep an eye on this cuz you're\nlike why am I not get my VI database,\n\n594\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.010\ncuz my version number is\nhigher than my server.\n\n595\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.920\nThat's your number one troubleshooting\nspot other than like your domain.\n\n596\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:29.530\nOkay so let's go over here And we're\ngoing to go ahead and create some VLANs.\n\n597\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.090\nOr let's see what our VLAN database is.\n\n598\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.700\nOkay?\n\n599\n00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.450\nNow, remember, we saw [INAUDIBLE].\n\n600\n00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.145\nWe had a VLAN2 and\n4 that we were playing with earlier.\n\n601\n00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:36.670\n>> Mm-hm, right.\n>> Or a VTP.\n\n602\n00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.440\nLet's see if we still\nhave those in a minute.\n\n603\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.670\nThat was on switch three.\n\n604\n00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.520\nI know we had 1, 2, and 4.\n\n605\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.670\nAnd there were a couple\nothers listed in there.\n\n606\n00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.610\nTen and 20 and so on.\n\n607\n00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.570\nWe do a show vlan here.\n\n608\n00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.260\nI've got two, three, four, sale,\nlet's create a new one though.\n\n609\n00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.440\nvlan, is there a 5?\n\n610\n00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.390\n5, Name, Ronnie.\n\n611\n00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.003\nThat sound good?\n\n612\n00:29:54.003 --> 00:29:55.057\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n613\n00:29:55.057 --> 00:29:59.440\n>> So now we have a VLAN\nnamed Ronnie in here, right?\n\n614\n00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.215\nI'm not going to create any other switch,\nwe'll see if we get it.\n\n615\n00:30:03.215 --> 00:30:08.250\nNow, show VTP status.\n\n616\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.510\nOkay.\n\n617\n00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.790\nNow, I am Lammle.\n\n618\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.120\nNow, this very well may have gotten this.\n\n619\n00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.010\nI didn't look.\n\n620\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.050\nWhen I was a server I\nchanged my domain name.\n\n621\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.320\nThe other ones very well may pick that up.\n\n622\n00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.490\nOr maybe we had changed it earlier.\n\n623\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.300\nI don't remember.\n\n624\n00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.410\nBut anyways.\n\n625\n00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.750\nVersion let me try to type this in again.\n\n626\n00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.433\nShow VTP status.\n\n627\n00:30:31.941 --> 00:30:34.870\nOkay, so I'm VTP capable one to three.\n\n628\n00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.060\nRunning version one.\n\n629\n00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.160\nThat's a problem.\n\n630\n00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.620\nMy other one was running two.\n\n631\n00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.040\nKeep this in mind.\n\n632\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.360\nLammle.\n\n633\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.710\nAnd then check this out though.\n\n634\n00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.560\nI did get this from the other one because\n\n635\n00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.670\nit tells me there's\na objective right here.\n\n636\n00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.670\nWhere did you get your VLAN database from?\n\n637\n00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.823\nOkay, so\nhow do you see show span and tree?\n\n638\n00:30:54.823 --> 00:30:58.470\nHow did someone ask you where did you get\nyour VLAN database from, show VTP status.\n\n639\n00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.860\nAnd it tells me right here configuration\nlast modified by 10.10.10.1,\n\n640\n00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.630\nwhich I know was that switch three, right.\n\n641\n00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.850\nAnd at, who cares about these dates.\n\n642\n00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.760\nBut notice of what it did and\nso it found my updater.\n\n643\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.500\nSo this is how you see where you\ngot your vlan database from.\n\n644\n00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.140\nIt did update my domain name, I don't\nknow why I'm running version one though.\n\n645\n00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.580\nNow I'm a server.\n\n646\n00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.420\nI was a server though.\n\n647\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.310\nRemember when I changed\nmy domain name to server?\n\n648\n00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.160\nI was already a server.\n\n649\n00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.770\nSo, what was going to update?\n\n650\n00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.880\nSo I changed my domain name.\n\n651\n00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.470\nThe other ones probably\ndidn't have a domain name.\n\n652\n00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.120\nAnd so they went, there's a domain name.\n\n653\n00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.570\nSet myself a domain name.\n\n654\n00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.020\nSuck down that VLAN database.\n\n655\n00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.470\nThat was other thing, I didn't remember\ncreating these VLAN over here.\n\n656\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.090\nDo you remember that?\n\n657\n00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.200\nAnd so we're seeing those VLAN sales and\ntwo invoice.\n\n658\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.190\nI only set on these other\nones the other day.\n\n659\n00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.990\nSo absolutely,\n\n660\n00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.930\nas soon I set the domain name I get a new\nVLAN database that deleted this one.\n\n661\n00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.800\nSee the problem with ETP?\n\n662\n00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.279\nAll right let's go see what\nit did on the other one.\n\n663\n00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:55.744\nNow on the server, my VTP,\nwhere is my I got to find my\n\n664\n00:31:55.744 --> 00:32:01.109\nServer 1005, configuration revision is 1.\n\n665\n00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:04.526\nWell this isn't a problem now because when\nI set that other one to client it set\n\n666\n00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:06.180\nitself to zero.\n\n667\n00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.440\nOkay, so it doesn't always do that,\nyou're gonna have to watch out for it.\n\n668\n00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.480\nLets go to this switch over here.\n\n669\n00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.120\nAlmost time guys, hang in there.\n\n670\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.620\nWoops.\n\n671\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.450\nShow p2p status, one to three,\nlook and see, this is the default,\n\n672\n00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.040\nthis is what the other one was.\n\n673\n00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.420\nIt was null, which means as soon as I set\nthat name, you know I don't know why I\n\n674\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:30.370\ndidn't get this, because it says that it\ndid, he should have been [INAUDIBLE] but\n\n675\n00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.160\nlet's keep him as a server and\nsee if he gets this.\n\n676\n00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.850\nSo let's do this vttp domain lanley.\n\n677\n00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.940\nHe didn't set it, null is a default so\n\n678\n00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.720\nhe should have set it\nhimself if he received it.\n\n679\n00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.980\nWhat's that say?\n\n680\n00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.290\nSo he changed the vpv domain name.\n\n681\n00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.000\nIt's possible my trunk's still not working\nbecause remember in my last lab I kinda\n\n682\n00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.760\nscrewed them up didn't I?\n\n683\n00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.240\nIt was kinda fun though,\nit was fun, right?\n\n684\n00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.999\nOkay, so let's do this, show end trunk.\n\n685\n00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:59.608\nYeah, I got my trunks.\n\n686\n00:32:59.608 --> 00:33:01.190\nUh-uh, I don't.\n\n687\n00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.420\nThis is not my trunking down below,\nI don't think.\n\n688\n00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.520\nShow cdp neighbor to 3.\n\n689\n00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.860\nYeah, no, they're there.\n\n690\n00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.530\n21, 22.\nNo, I'm looking good.\n\n691\n00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.230\nAll right, so they're all on.\n\n692\n00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.410\nSo I should be able to\nget show vtp status.\n\n693\n00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.380\nMy server okay.\n\n694\n00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.340\nWe might have gotten it.\n\n695\n00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.760\nBecause there's my revision numbers 1,\nwhich was what I set my server to.\n\n696\n00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.260\nMy other server.\n\n697\n00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.120\nThis guy's still a server,\nbut I had updated that one.\n\n698\n00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.570\nLet's see if Ronnie's in here.\n\n699\n00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.070\nShow vlan.\n\n700\n00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.290\nThere it is.\n\n701\n00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.490\nAll right, you guys, VGP is dangerous.\n\n702\n00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.340\nIt's starting to work.\n\n703\n00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.270\nIt erased my vlan.\n\n704\n00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.040\nI did not create 2, 3,\n4, 5 on this switch.\n\n705\n00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.350\nOr, ten and twenty, Or, any of these.\n\n706\n00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.030\nThese were all those other switches.\n\n707\n00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.670\nSo, whatever I have on here,\nbecause I went and\n\n708\n00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.300\nplayed with that other one,\nboom it erased this one and put those in.\n\n709\n00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.150\nVTP is very dangerous, okay?\n\n710\n00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.970\nI have no idea how deep they're gonna get\non the new objectives where they're at\n\n711\n00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.460\nright now, I went as deep as they\ndid on the old ones, just in case.\n\n712\n00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.650\nAll right, so this was a large,\nreally great fun troubleshooting section.\n\n713\n00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:04.370\n>> All right, well Todd thank you again\nfor demonstrating those different types of\n\n714\n00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.910\ncommands that we’re likely\nto see on the exam.\n\n715\n00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.970\nFor the exam, you have to be fast as well\nas accurate in everything that you’re\n\n716\n00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:15.060\ndoing, and that includes configurations\nas well as the knowledge that you have\n\n717\n00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.640\nto set all this stuff up.\n\n718\n00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.860\nSo in this episode, remember what\nwe actually took a look at there,\n\n719\n00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.990\nwas the basics of VTP,\nthe VLAN Tracking Protocol,\n\n720\n00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:27.880\nthat allows us to be able to configure\nVLANs on one VTP server and push them out,\n\n721\n00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.320\nof course, to others that will\nhave that same domain name.\n\n722\n00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.940\nWe also then, of course, took a look\nat our lab section, which goes over\n\n723\n00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.638\neverything that we've actually done up\nuntil this point on the IVO switching.\n\n724\n00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:41.730\nWe showed you the spanning\ntree protocol at work, and\n\n725\n00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.540\nshowed you how to actually recreate and\nreset up the priority so\n\n726\n00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.570\nthat you can actually become the root,\nor to change the actual root\n\n727\n00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.580\nitself by actually setting in\na primary and secondary, as well.\n\n728\n00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.080\nSo all of this stuff that you\nactually are seeing here,\n\n729\n00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.400\nremember, if you don't feel comfortable\nwith any of it, it's now time for\n\n730\n00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.525\nyou to go back and review that, as well.\n\n731\n00:35:01.525 --> 00:35:03.880\nDon't forget that Todd also\nhas his book coming out too.\n\n732\n00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.720\nSo you wanna make sure that you\ncheck out those chapters on that\n\n733\n00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.150\nbook as well as the review\nquestions that he has, and\n\n734\n00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.540\nof course the labs that\nhe has set up in there.\n\n735\n00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:16.280\nThat will help you to get ready for\nthat new CCNA, routing and switching exam.\n\n736\n00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.240\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off then.\n\n737\n00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.946\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong\n>> And I'm Todd Langley\n\n738\n00:35:21.946 --> 00:35:23.976\n>> Stay tuned right here for\n\n739\n00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:27.461\nmore CCNA routing and switching content.\n\n740\n00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:34.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.300\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking that ICND2 content.\n\n4\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.220\nWe're getting ready for\nthat new CCNA routing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.770\nswitching exam that Cisco's\njust come out with.\n\n6\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.980\nIn our studio's today helping us to make\nsure we're focused in on the exam is Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.670\nTodd Lammle.\n\n8\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.890\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n9\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.420\n>> Thank you Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.190\nLet's continue one with our enhanced\nswitching section in this episode.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.290\nWe're gonna talk about EtherChannel.\n\n12\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.800\nThen after this we'll get into\nfirst hop redundancy protocols.\n\n13\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.880\nBut, EtherChannel is fun.\n\n14\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.750\nIt's great.\n\n15\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.790\nRemember in our last one we love\nSpanning Tree it solved our problems.\n\n16\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.435\nWe hate Spanning Tree now, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:49.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's go ahead and see why.\n\n18\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.400\nSo if we had Spanning Tree in this when\nwe have multiple links to aggregate on\n\n19\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.180\nthe switch.\n\n20\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300\nAnd by the way, I can have eight\nconnections between switches.\n\n21\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.270\nEight, 10 gig or 8 gig,\nwhatever you can afford.\n\n22\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.570\nSo this increase uplinks speed, but\n\n23\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.140\nif we do this, we can have a congestion\nif we don't configure it right.\n\n24\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.150\nSo we just let it run.\n\n25\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.360\nLet's say I had four, five, six, seven,\neight all of them will be blocked but\n\n26\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.580\none link by default right,\nwith Spanning Tree.\n\n27\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.340\nSo the loop prevention span tree\nwill disable something like that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.710\nSo in this case here I'm going to have\nmultiple links between switches and\n\n29\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.380\nI'm gonna aggregate these and\nbundle that to give me high band width.\n\n30\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.270\nSo if these were gig or\nten gig links, that would be great.\n\n31\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.450\nIf I had at least four\nbetween switches here, so\n\n32\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.960\nthat's 40 gig,\naggregate of 80 gig full duplex.\n\n33\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.490\nSo we'd have load sharing.\n\n34\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.630\nAnd to Spanning Tree,\n\n35\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.610\nthe way that it does this, this looks\nlike one, what's called a port channel.\n\n36\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.380\nSo we'll see this as a port channel and\nof course that gives us redundancy.\n\n37\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.360\nWe can lose everything but one link and\nit'll still keep running right?\n\n38\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360\nSo this is what we wanna do.\n\n39\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.050\nNow I'm gonna get right into what\nwe need to know for the Jack test.\n\n40\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.420\nI'm not gonna give you extra detail here.\n\n41\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.180\nThere's two different types\nthere's PAgP and LACP, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.980\nSo PAgP is the Cisco proprietary version,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.130\nthe way that we configure\nit is pretty simple.\n\n44\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.310\nThere is desirable and auto.\n\n45\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.390\nSo in other words, now so\nthere's two different types of protocols.\n\n46\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.870\nTypically you can just turn them on.\n\n47\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.640\nI recommend running the protocol.\n\n48\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.190\nWhat this does is makes sure all\nthe ports on both sides are the same.\n\n49\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.450\nIf they are not the same,\nthe port channel won't come up.\n\n50\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.710\nThis is where you are going to look for\nyour objectives for troubleshooting.\n\n51\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.130\nYou have to have duplex and\nspeeds the same.\n\n52\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.750\nYou can't mix and match them.\n\n53\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.920\nYou have to have the trunking.\n\n54\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.540\nThey all have to be trunking.\n\n55\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.810\nI can do this on a non-trunk port But\nif I'm gonna trunc some,\n\n56\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.140\nI have to trunc them all.\n\n57\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.220\nAnd then if I'm going to send some VLANs\ndown but not others, then all links,\n\n58\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.648\nall interfaces have to be\nconfigured exactly the same.\n\n59\n00:02:56.648 --> 00:03:02.235\nSo what and PAgP does, and really they're\npretty much exactly the same protocol,\n\n60\n00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:04.525\nso it doesn't matter which one you use,\nreally.\n\n61\n00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:06.675\nWhat they do is make sure all\nthe ports are the same and\n\n62\n00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:08.525\nbrings them up into a bundle.\n\n63\n00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:09.095\nOkay?\n\n64\n00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:11.675\nLet's go ahead and go full screen back\nhere again and take a look at this.\n\n65\n00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:18.300\nSo we've got PAgP and\nwe've got two modes, Desirable and Auto.\n\n66\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.430\nSo if I want to run PAgP,\nif we look down here.\n\n67\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670\nSo first off, I can turn it on.\n\n68\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.830\nI don't have to run any protocol.\n\n69\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.520\nI can just go to the interfaces and\nturn on ether channel.\n\n70\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.610\nIf they're all the same, it will come up.\n\n71\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.300\nThe problem is it won't tell\nyou if there's a problem.\n\n72\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.900\nIf they're not all the same,\nit just won't create the channel.\n\n73\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.470\nIn this case here,\nif I turn them on, if I turn on yes,\n\n74\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.990\nif one side is set to desirable and one to\nauto, then no, they're not going to work.\n\n75\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.280\nIn this case here, if they're desirable\nand auto, notice that it will work\n\n76\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.840\nIf it is auto and auto,\nit's not going to work.\n\n77\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.210\nSo I can do desirable and\ndesirable, that will work.\n\n78\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.310\nOr desirable and auto.\n\n79\n00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.780\nBut auto is waiting, so\nauto is passively waiting.\n\n80\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.470\nTypically I'll set them\nto desirable desirable.\n\n81\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.380\nI don't know if I ever\nset them desirable auto.\n\n82\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.460\nDoesn't matter.\n\n83\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.750\nHere's your two options\nPAgP you have to remember.\n\n84\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.350\nSet both sides to\nthe desirable to desirable or\n\n85\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.800\none side to desirable the other one auto.\n\n86\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.200\nYou need to remember this for\nyour exam or judges are gonna show you.\n\n87\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.720\nHey, what's the other side of this?\n\n88\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.180\nThis one is set to auto,\nwhat's the other side gonna be?\n\n89\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.710\nDesirable.\n\n90\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.600\nOkay, so you got to remember for\nPAgP desirable and auto and\n\n91\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.310\nthe way to remember this is to do a lab.\n\n92\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.150\nNow I'll do how much you\nneed to do them with me.\n\n93\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.560\nNow, on LACP which is the IEEE non\nspecific, non specific, there's two modes.\n\n94\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.860\nActive and passive.\n\n95\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.950\nNow I can make them both active or\nI can make one inactive and one passive.\n\n96\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.860\nOkay?\nBut I can't make them both passive.\n\n97\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.630\nJust like I have to make them both so\nthey'll actively asking, right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.210\nSo Active Active?\n\n99\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.790\nOr active passive, but\nnot passive, passive.\n\n100\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.810\nThat's the only thing\nyou need to remember.\n\n101\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.840\nSo for PAgP, I'll just write it\nup here instead of going back.\n\n102\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.420\nPAgP, I can do desirable, desirable, or\n\n103\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.090\ndesirable auto, but I can't do auto auto.\n\n104\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.750\nI can't do passive, passive.\n\n105\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.320\nOkay?\nSo it doesn't really matter\n\n106\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.500\nhow you really configure it\n\n107\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.530\nas long as you don't set it them to\nthe two modes that just don't work.\n\n108\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.390\nNow, to configure EtherChannel, we have\nto make sure, and this is your exam\n\n109\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.740\nobjectives right here, other than setting\nthem with desired modes speed and\n\n110\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.840\nduplex, access or trunks, it's pretty\nrare that you'd only have access.\n\n111\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.370\nYou could.\n\n112\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.990\nYou could set up a lot o access links and\ndo it.\n\n113\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.370\nNotice this, and\nI didn't mention this earlier.\n\n114\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.270\nThe native VLAN has to be the same.\n\n115\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.210\nRemember how we did the native VLAN\nyesterday, had mismatches, and like,\n\n116\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.060\nit's still working, we're just getting\nan error every 60 seconds from CVP, right?\n\n117\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.110\nIn this case here I'm saying, no,\n\n118\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.310\nI'm not gonna bring up my I'm not\ngonna bring up their channel.\n\n119\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.510\nOkay access VLAN on the access\nports have to be the same,\n\n120\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.190\nwhich ones we send across the trunk,\nwhich ports.\n\n121\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.750\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this,\nat this easy configuration.\n\n122\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.220\nThis is the greatest part.\n\n123\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.310\nThe configuration for\nEtherChannel is simple.\n\n124\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.350\nIt's easy.\n\n125\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.230\nIt usually just works.\n\n126\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.680\nBut again I'm recommending\nusing a protocol.\n\n127\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.560\nI really don't see\nthe difference between the two.\n\n128\n00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:19.500\nPAgP, knock yourself out.\n\n129\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.685\nIt really comes down to which modes\nI remember at the time, really.\n\n130\n00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:24.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz there's four and I'm like,\n\n131\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.410\nwhich one am I thinking of right now?\n\n132\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.120\nOkay, desirable, desirable works,\nI'll use that one.\n\n133\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.340\nSo anyways, it doesn't really even matter.\n\n134\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.930\nNotice I'm gonna choose my two ports,\n1 and 2, I do a range.\n\n135\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.800\nChannel group mode active, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.870\nNow, that's all I have to do,\nhowever, before I do that, and\n\n137\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.960\nin this case here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and configure this.\n\n138\n00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.550\nNotice the trunk allowed.\n\n139\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.460\nNotice I didn't change the native VLAN,\nso we're looking at one here.\n\n140\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.190\nI if was changing the VLAN,\nI would have to do that on both sides.\n\n141\n00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.040\nOkay?\nSo notice that we're at trunk.\n\n142\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.750\nNow when we go to ours we know\nwe run 802.1 and QNSISL so\n\n143\n00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.530\nI've set the encapsulation the same.\n\n144\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.130\nTurn it on trunk and\nthen say what I'm going to trunk.\n\n145\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.930\nNow I send them all across, it's pretty\nrare that I prune them but you could.\n\n146\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.840\nIn this case her only allow 1, 2,\nand 20 is what this is saying.\n\n147\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.380\nAnd then I'm gonna have\nto do the same over here.\n\n148\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.810\nSo notice this is active, active.\n\n149\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.840\nWhich mode am I running?\n\n150\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.060\n>> Its got to be, L.\n\n151\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.830\n>> Lack P.\n>> Lack P.\n\n152\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.698\n>> Right, and it doesn't have to be\nactive, active, it can be active passive.\n\n153\n00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:30.680\nBut I couldn't have passive, passive, in\nthis case here I could do active active,\n\n154\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.916\nor I could give active passive, but\nI couldn't do passive, passive.\n\n155\n00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:35.576\nAll right guys, so\nI have another question for you here.\n\n156\n00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:39.850\nNow I'm doing PAgP yeah I think this auto,\n\n157\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.230\nwell that's not gonna work if I set this\nother side to auto, so what do I set here?\n\n158\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.900\nSo Channel group one mode\n>> Desirable?\n\n159\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.010\n>> Desirable man this guys pretty\ngood he know's his EtherChannel.\n\n160\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.770\nDesirable, this is the kind of\nobjective you'll get right here.\n\n161\n00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.877\nWhat do you put here?\n\n162\n00:07:55.877 --> 00:07:58.863\nNotice my trunks have to be\nthe same if I am using trunking.\n\n163\n00:07:58.863 --> 00:08:03.235\nPretty rare if you are not using trunking\nagain you dont have to Everything\n\n164\n00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:05.504\nmust be configured the same, right?\n\n165\n00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:11.540\nThe access ports that I'm allowing,\nthe trunk ports, what I'm allowing.\n\n166\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.900\nThe native vlan, the same.\n\n167\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.250\nThey must be trunked, or\nyou can just make them all access ports,\n\n168\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.050\nwhichever you wanna do it.\n\n169\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.810\nAnd then we're gonna set the auto or\ndesirable.\n\n170\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.120\nOkay, to verify.\n\n171\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.370\nAnd I wrote these down so I wouldn't\nforget to do them when I did our lab.\n\n172\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.290\nCuz that's about it with the EtherChannel,\ntwo modes.\n\n173\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.830\nDoesn't matter which one that you choose.\n\n174\n00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.870\nYou could just go turn them on,\nbut then you're responsible for\n\n175\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.310\nmaking sure all of your interfaces\nare exactly the same, Run a protocol.\n\n176\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.430\nIt's easy.\nIt's not a lot of overhead.\n\n177\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.500\nShow interface Port-channel,\netherchannel Port-channel,\n\n178\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.348\netherchannel summary, and then we're\ngoing to take a look at spanning-tree and\n\n179\n00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:49.240\nsee how spanning-tree\nsees my port channel.\n\n180\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.880\nOkay?\n\n181\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.550\nNow, one more thing,\nI'm going to also demonstrate,\n\n182\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.810\nwhat's now new in the objectives,\nis a layer 3 etherchannel.\n\n183\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.900\nWhen would I use something like that?\n\n184\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.100\nThat's a good question.\n\n185\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.570\nSo I have a router.\n\n186\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.000\nAnd I have two, and this is my switch.\n\n187\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.750\nThis is a router.\n\n188\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.720\nI have two ethernets, gigabit.\n\n189\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.450\nIn this case here, I have a gigabit 00.\n\n190\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.760\nSo here's gig 00 and gig 01.\n\n191\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.950\nAnd I'm not gonna put an IP\naddress on either one of them.\n\n192\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.600\nI'm gonna bundle them, right.\n\n193\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.820\nAnd I'm gonna put the IP address\nunderneath the port channel.\n\n194\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.640\nso here's your CCA objective question,\nyour creating a layer\n\n195\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.460\nthree ether channel, where does the IP\naddress reside for that ether channel?\n\n196\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.220\nThe answer is underneath the logical port\nchannel, not underneath the interfaces.\n\n197\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.190\nI assign the ports to a channel group, and\n\n198\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.000\nthat port channel then gets the IP\naddress in reference both those ports.\n\n199\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.310\nThis is a great way,\nit's a great little configure.\n\n200\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.380\nNow I can low balance across 2\ngig ports on a router, very cool.\n\n201\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.730\nLet's go ahead and take a look at our lab.\n\n202\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.200\nWe'll start here, we'll switch 3,\nthis will be my core here.\n\n203\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.220\nLet's take a look,\nwe can do show city P neighbors, you\n\n204\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.520\nsee we're connected to switch 1 with\n19 and 20, switch 2 with 21 and 22.\n\n205\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.150\nSo in show int trunk show,\nI have to type out.\n\n206\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.465\nIt doesn't know what I mean.\n\n207\n00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:17.390\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n208\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.170\nWe can see that we're connected we're\nall running the same encapsulation.\n\n209\n00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.360\nWe're all trunking.\n\n210\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.350\nWe all have the same native vlan.\n\n211\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.380\nYou don't have to, but in this case\nwe're going to leave them all the same.\n\n212\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.650\nSo we're going to do G10/19 and G10/20.\n\n213\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:36.430\nSo if I come back down here, so\nif I'm going to do show, and\n\n214\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.920\nlet's do the switch 1, we'll do and\nthen 20 and 21, we'll do the others.\n\n215\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.091\nSo config t int r g0/19-20,\nand then the command\n\n216\n00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:52.600\nis channel-group,\nthis is actually relatively simple.\n\n217\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.070\nSo I'm gonna create two channel groups,\none going to one switch,\n\n218\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.900\none going to another.\n\n219\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.360\nAnd then I'm gonna say mode,\nquestion mark, and\n\n220\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.990\nwe'll be able to see our\ndifferent options here.\n\n221\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:11.270\nSo, if I wanna use LACP,\nover here I can put passive on this side.\n\n222\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.800\nThat means it's not gonna come up until\nI go to the other side and add active.\n\n223\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.840\nSo we'll leave that down for a second.\n\n224\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.740\nWe'll come over here.\n\n225\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.400\nWhoops, wow I made him really big.\n\n226\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.040\nOkay, and let's do show cdp neighbor,\nI think he's the same as well.\n\n227\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:33.166\nLet's verify our ports, and\nswitch three is 0/19, 0/20.\n\n228\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.660\nAnd we did what over there,\nsassive, so we're gonna do active?\n\n229\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.250\n>> Active.\n\n230\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.386\n>> Okay, so channel group mode active.\n\n231\n00:11:44.386 --> 00:11:49.810\nAnd so I was passive,\nnow that I did that I've gotta say channel\n\n232\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.390\ngroup 1 actually, group 1 mode active.\n\n233\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.320\nNow that the other side is passive, it's\nnot saying it so we got a problem here.\n\n234\n00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.130\nThis is good.\n\n235\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.700\nRight after trauma, it could not.\n\n236\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.800\nThis is why you run a protocol.\n\n237\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.570\nIt's coming back and saying, can't do it.\n\n238\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.430\nYou got a problem.\n\n239\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.970\nAnd we're gonna, let's look into this,\ncannot bundle after 19, not compatible,\n\n240\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:14.360\n19 is 1, port channel ID is 99.\n\n241\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.800\nSo It's telling me that my\nnative E lands aren't the same.\n\n242\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.070\nOkay, so we'll have to look at that.\n\n243\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.840\nLet's see if we can get this\nother one working first though.\n\n244\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.930\nSo that was 19 and 20?\n\n245\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.630\n>> Yes.\n\n246\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.300\n>> And then so,\nwe're going to do interface range\n\n247\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.190\n21 and 22, channel group, two.\n\n248\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.220\nAnd let's go ahead and, so the other\none we use LACP with, after the PASSIN,\n\n249\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.400\nlet's take a look here.\n\n250\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.670\nAnd we wanna do PHDB, so\nI'm gonna do auto on this side,\n\n251\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.270\nwhich is not gonna do anything until I go\nto the other side and set it to desirable.\n\n252\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.400\nOK?\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\n\n253\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.036\nshow CDP neighbor Okay, and\nI wanna go to switch three.\n\n254\n00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:03.560\nSo it's 21-22 config t\ninterface range f0/21-22 and\n\n255\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.921\nwe set that one to, what'd we set it to?\n\n256\n00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:09.907\nAuto, so that means I would\nset this one to desirable.\n\n257\n00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:15.260\nChannel group, Did I set it to one?\n\n258\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.440\nI did two, okay, channel group 2.\n\n259\n00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.920\nOkay, so I have a different channel group,\nand that one was auto, so\n\n260\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.980\nwe're gonna set this one to desirable.\n\n261\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.080\nThat one should probably come up,\nwe'll probably watch this one come up.\n\n262\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.220\nWe'll have to troubleshoot the other one,\n\n263\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.600\nwhich is kind of good that\nwe have a troubleshooting.\n\n264\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.520\nWe see it go down, and\nthen we see the port channel come up.\n\n265\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.870\nWe didn't see the port channel for\n\n266\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.520\none come up, we'll see if we can that\nfixed but this is why you run a protocol,\n\n267\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.150\nbecause it tells you\nthat you have a problem.\n\n268\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.710\nSo when we looked at this, it's saying\nf019 is not compatible with port channel\n\n269\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:54.640\none and will be suspended.Native vlan\nis one and port channel one id is 99.\n\n270\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.120\nNot sure where it got that one, so\nlet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n271\n00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.500\nSo show, you know,\nthis is that time I'm gonna\n\n272\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:09.840\nuse that show switch port,\nshow interface f0/19.\n\n273\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.770\nAnd let's take a look at that,\nand it should be switchport.\n\n274\n00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.369\nSo interface, interface, switchport.\n\n275\n00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.300\nIts gig.\n\n276\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.930\nOkay, im like I know this is right,\nI know this is right.\n\n277\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.520\nOkay, lets take a look here.\n\n278\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.830\nSo 19 gigs, gigs are 19, truck,\nsuspended member of bundle 1, dot 1 Q.\n\n279\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.150\nNative VLAN is 1, so\nit's not liking us very well.\n\n280\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.558\nAll VLANs, so let's come over here,\nsame thing here.\n\n281\n00:14:46.558 --> 00:14:54.880\nShow, show interface f,\nthis one's f, switch port.\n\n282\n00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.240\nHm, didn't like that.\n\n283\n00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.290\nYeah it did.\n\n284\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.930\nSwitch port.\n\n285\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.910\nNative VLAN 1.\n\n286\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.080\nIt's lying to me, right?\n\n287\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.863\nIt's lying to me.\n\n288\n00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:10.549\nSo let's int r f0/19-20.\n\n289\n00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:14.250\nI'm gonna do that shut.\n\n290\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.930\nIt does not like, cuz I did have a set of\ndifferent, so it's still giving me that\n\n291\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.510\nsame error, saying it's a member of ID 99,\nwhich isn't true.\n\n292\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:31.600\nSo I'm gonna shut that down, and\nswitchport tru native vlan 1.\n\n293\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.460\nNow remember, this is why you\nrun that protocol, because if I\n\n294\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.790\njust turned them on it wouldn't come up,\nit wouldn't tell me what my problem is.\n\n295\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.320\nI'm not even sure if I'm\nseeing a problem here, but\n\n296\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.250\nit's telling me I still\nhave a problem here.\n\n297\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.720\nSo I'm gonna come under here again,\nand let's see.\n\n298\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.450\nThese are down, so\nI'm gonna do a no shut over here.\n\n299\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.470\nYou can't see me doing that but, but\nI promise I did a no shut there.\n\n300\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.379\nAnd let's see what I got over here.\n\n301\n00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:00.686\nAll right, let's see if they come up.\n\n302\n00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:02.984\nNo, it's still giving me that Native VLAN.\n\n303\n00:16:02.984 --> 00:16:05.991\nThis when you're in production, the best\nthing to do is erase, start, reload.\n\n304\n00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:08.252\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding, just kidding.\n\n305\n00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:11.290\nSo it shouldn't be doing this.\n\n306\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.310\nSo if I did a sh etherchannel summary,\n\n307\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.530\nit's gonna tell me s is suspended, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.373\nSo this doesn't tell me why.\n\n309\n00:16:22.373 --> 00:16:28.585\nsh int port channel, port,\n\n310\n00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:39.490\nsh int, okay,\nthey have my port channel, like I said.\n\n311\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.365\nPort channels, port group,\nbut port-channel 1.\n\n312\n00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:48.090\nOkay, we're definitely down, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:53.240\nLink type is auto, media type is unknown,\nall right, so this doesn't look good.\n\n314\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.211\nIt's not seeing this\nhardware's ether channel, so\n\n315\n00:16:57.211 --> 00:17:02.164\nthere's something it's not liking,\nbut I can't see what it is.\n\n316\n00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:07.600\nIt's not that stinking\n\n317\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.858\nsh etherchannel summary.\n\n318\n00:17:13.858 --> 00:17:16.105\nOkay, so we can see this one, p is good,\n\n319\n00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:18.700\nthat means the import\nchannel I is suspended.\n\n320\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.103\nI did the native VLAN again on both?\n\n321\n00:17:21.103 --> 00:17:23.925\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I didn't config t,\n\n322\n00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:28.209\ninterface g0/19-020 [COUGH]\n\n323\n00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:45.915\nOkay, and switchport t n vlan 1.\n\n324\n00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:46.995\nLet's see, if it takes that.\n\n325\n00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:49.769\nSwitchport t n vlan 1.\n\n326\n00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:51.770\nMan, I set those native VLANs.\n\n327\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.750\nAnd if I do sh int trunk, there they are.\n\n328\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.270\nI see port channel 2.\n\n329\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.459\nThis is great.\nSo I see them as bundle.\n\n330\n00:17:58.459 --> 00:18:01.083\nBut 1920 will not bundle for me.\n\n331\n00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:02.638\nThis isn't good, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:02.638 --> 00:18:04.020\nSo we can see all of ours in there.\n\n333\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.446\nPort channel 2, running really well.\n\n334\n00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:09.999\nPort channel 1 is not,\nit is really unhappy here.\n\n335\n00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:12.704\nsh int trunk.\n\n336\n00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:15.371\nTypically don't see these problems\nin production all that much,\n\n337\n00:18:15.371 --> 00:18:16.490\nI gotta be honest.\n\n338\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.726\nThis stuff just comes up and runs.\n\n339\n00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:29.268\nOkay, 19 encapsulation.1\ntrunk mode active.\n\n340\n00:18:29.268 --> 00:18:35.131\nIn this one, I think I had\nset it as passive, 19 and 20.\n\n341\n00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:40.530\nPassive, active.\n\n342\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.791\nLet's change these both to active, so.\n\n343\n00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:47.451\n>> 19 and 20\n>> Yeah, with 22,\n\n344\n00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:49.498\nit looks like either I missed that config.\n\n345\n00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:50.113\nIt's probably down.\n\n346\n00:18:50.113 --> 00:18:51.620\nI just missed it.\n\n347\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.223\nLet's do this.\n\n348\n00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:55.264\ng0/19-020.\n\n349\n00:18:55.264 --> 00:18:59.920\nint r gig 0/19-020.\n\n350\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.075\nAnd I'm gonna say channel-group 1 mode.\n\n351\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:06.735\nLet's change the group number.\n\n352\n00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:11.475\nLet's just try a different group\nnumber cuz it might be stuck that hey,\n\n353\n00:19:11.475 --> 00:19:15.460\nI don't know,\nI'm just unhappy with you, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.024\nOkay, I changed that to 3,\nso let's go over here.\n\n355\n00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.885\nChange this guy,\n\n356\n00:19:20.885 --> 00:19:26.608\nconfig t int r f0/19-020,\n\n357\n00:19:26.608 --> 00:19:31.004\nchannel-group, group.\n\n358\n00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:31.769\n>> 3.\n\n359\n00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:33.186\n>> 3 mode.\n\n360\n00:19:33.186 --> 00:19:34.573\n>> It should be active.\n\n361\n00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.930\n>> Active, the other one's passive.\n\n362\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.985\nAll right, let's give it a second.\n\n363\n00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:41.010\nAnd we didn't get an error yet.\n\n364\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.720\nThe last time, we got an error tell us\nthere's something wrong with the VLAN.\n\n365\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.230\nSo that looks a lot better to me.\n\n366\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.980\nPort channel 3 is up.\n\n367\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.374\nOkay, I gotta be honest with you.\n\n368\n00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:54.334\nThere is something in the background,\nat one point in our last labs,\n\n369\n00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:56.190\nwe had that as native VLAN 99.\n\n370\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.967\nIt just didn't seem to forget that.\n\n371\n00:19:57.967 --> 00:19:59.970\nIt didn't like that at all.\n\n372\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.390\nI'm not sure what we did wrong, because we\ncan see all the configurations there, but\n\n373\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.970\ncheck this out.\n\n374\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:11.890\nShow int trunk and there it is,\nmy port channel 3 in native VLAN.\n\n375\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:18.060\nSo now,\nI'm getting some information here [COUGH].\n\n376\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.005\nIt very well, someone brought up VTP.\n\n377\n00:20:21.005 --> 00:20:24.135\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wouldn't doubt it with VTP.\n\n378\n00:20:24.135 --> 00:20:26.330\nVTP is the bane of\neveryone's existence here.\n\n379\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.190\nIt very well could have been cause in\nmy last audit of VTP, it's possible.\n\n380\n00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.441\nBut check this out, sh spanning-tree,\n\n381\n00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:36.750\nlet's check this out, and\nthere's my port channel three down here.\n\n382\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.985\nIt is blocked.\n\n383\n00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.830\nThis should not be blocked down here.\n\n384\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.180\nThat's ridiculous.\n\n385\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.455\nAll right, so\nright there on the root port for,\n\n386\n00:20:44.455 --> 00:20:48.970\nit is on VLAN,\nwhatever VLAN that was, VLAN1.\n\n387\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.428\nFor VLAN1, it is a blocked port\nbecause we're not the root port.\n\n388\n00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:57.467\nI am the root port,\nport channel 3 is the root port for VLAN2.\n\n389\n00:20:57.467 --> 00:21:02.308\nIt's the designated forwarding port for\nVLAN3.\n\n390\n00:21:02.308 --> 00:21:06.415\nAnd it's a root port for VLAN4,\nand designated port for VLAN5, and\n\n391\n00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:07.480\nwe can go on.\n\n392\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.090\nSo you can see now that we\ncan see these port channels.\n\n393\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.170\nIt was even a blocked port,\nthe whole thing was blocked for VLAN1.\n\n394\n00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.340\nOkay, so let's come down here,\ngo through some more stuff.\n\n395\n00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:22.430\nsh etherchannel summary,\nis what I want to look at.\n\n396\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.000\nAnd now we should see,\nlook at they're both P now.\n\n397\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.970\nSo this was kind of cool.\n\n398\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.940\nLook at my first one in there.\n\n399\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.480\nHe's like, come on, give me a chance,\nI'll work this time.\n\n400\n00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.750\nOkay, that was kind of\na challenging problem.\n\n401\n00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.050\nI can see that there was\na native VLAN issue.\n\n402\n00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.836\nCould've been caused by VTP, maybe\nI'll look into it later, probably not.\n\n403\n00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:38.281\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyways,\n\n404\n00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:42.530\nyou can see I'm running PAgP go into\nswitch 2, and switch 1, I'm using LACP.\n\n405\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.880\nAnd before we saw them as I, right,\nas stand alone, it just was not working.\n\n406\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.464\nIt gave us a native VLAN mismatch,\ncouldn't find the issue,\n\n407\n00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:53.514\ncreated a new port channel and\nit seemed to work.\n\n408\n00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:59.632\nSo a couple other commands\nthat we want to do,\n\n409\n00:21:59.632 --> 00:22:06.878\nsh interface port-channel 2,\nI like seeing it up.\n\n410\n00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:08.244\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That makes things feel a lot\n\n411\n00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.225\nbetter, don't you think?\n\n412\n00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:10.542\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz that was pretty bad,\n\n413\n00:22:10.542 --> 00:22:12.005\nseeing it back down and for no reason.\n\n414\n00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:16.229\nSo we're gonna see our port channel is\nup and I could do the same thing with 3.\n\n415\n00:22:16.229 --> 00:22:18.040\nUp and up is good.\n\n416\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.589\nAll right, and then, sh etherchannel\nsummary and then etherchannel port.\n\n417\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:31.070\nShow etherchannel port-channel.\n\n418\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.180\nAll right, now here's my port channel.\n\n419\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.010\nNumber of ports.\n\n420\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.546\nWe can see that it is bundled\nport-channel 1 and port-channel 2.\n\n421\n00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:44.935\nWe can see our different ports in here,\ngigs 21 and 22.\n\n422\n00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:47.710\nSo nothing in 1, 21 and 22.\n\n423\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.678\nAnd in we have these guys are in\npassive state in port-channel 3.\n\n424\n00:22:52.678 --> 00:22:54.942\nThese guys were in what, desire automatic?\n\n425\n00:22:54.942 --> 00:22:56.998\nI guess they were in desirable mode or\nsomething, right?\n\n426\n00:22:56.998 --> 00:22:58.123\n>> Yep.\n\n427\n00:22:58.123 --> 00:23:01.615\n>> Okay, so one of the things that\nwe want to take a look at guys,\n\n428\n00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:03.058\nis let's go to a router.\n\n429\n00:23:03.058 --> 00:23:05.084\nLet's see, I think I got a router here.\n\n430\n00:23:13.502 --> 00:23:15.162\nOkay, so check this out.\n\n431\n00:23:15.162 --> 00:23:21.663\nSo, let me do a do sh ip int b, okay?\n\n432\n00:23:21.663 --> 00:23:24.229\nOkay, I've got two fast etherrnets.\n\n433\n00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:28.490\nI've got some sub interfaces from when\nwe were doing VLANs, doesn't matter.\n\n434\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.694\nBut I'm gonna use FastEthernet0/0 and 0/1.\n\n435\n00:23:31.694 --> 00:23:38.140\nSo I'm gonna say, interface, let me,\nI think I can do this, f0/0-1.\n\n436\n00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.450\nI don't think it's gonna like this.\n\n437\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.050\nI'm not gonna play with this all day.\n\n438\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.980\nSo interface f0/0, no ip address.\n\n439\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.370\nAnd I want to create a channel group,\nso I'm gonna say, under the interfaces,\n\n440\n00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.510\nI'm gonna say Channel Group.\n\n441\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.330\nAnd I'll say, channel-group.\n\n442\n00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.408\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n443\n00:23:56.408 --> 00:23:57.964\nWe can do 1 through 64.\n\n444\n00:23:57.964 --> 00:23:58.800\nThat's plenty.\n\n445\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.890\nI'm just gonna say 10, channel-group 10.\n\n446\n00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.424\nIt's not configured,\nso I'm gonna come back.\n\n447\n00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:08.200\nAnd say channel group interface.\n\n448\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.750\nSorry, you create a port channel before\nyou can put a channel group in there.\n\n449\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.381\nSo that the port channel creates it.\n\n450\n00:24:14.381 --> 00:24:18.933\nSo interface port channel 10, okay.\n\n451\n00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:26.880\nIP address 20.20.20.1 and I'll have to\ndo a show run so you guys can see that.\n\n452\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.080\nSo [COUGH] and then, so\ndo show IP int brief, okay,\n\n453\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.800\nthere's my Port-channel, 20.20.20.1.\n\n454\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.915\nI'm down right now.\n\n455\n00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:42.681\nAnd now I can go to interface f0/0 and\nsay channel -group, what were we?\n\n456\n00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.750\n10?.\n\n457\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.979\n>> We were 10.\n\n458\n00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:49.340\nNow the one thing is [INAUDIBLE]\nhave to be the same on here.\n\n459\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.750\nAnd that one's going\nto come up right away.\n\n460\n00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:57.070\nAnd then I'm going to say interface\nF01 channel group 10, okay.\n\n461\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.570\nSo now ports F00 and\nF01are in the same channel group.\n\n462\n00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.790\nThere is no IP address.\n\n463\n00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.170\nLets take a look at this.\n\n464\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.800\nLet's let this run for a second\nbecause it is going to come back and\n\n465\n00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.900\ngive me some more info.\n\n466\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.504\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n467\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:14.600\nOkay, come on.\n\n468\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.640\nI should have done show run interface.\n\n469\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.590\nI forgot how big this config is.\n\n470\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.190\nSo there's my port channel, right?\n\n471\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.730\nAnd my IP address.\n\n472\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.610\nI have no IP addresses underneath\nthe physical interfaces.\n\n473\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.650\nI'd get rid of these sub interfaces for\nsure.\n\n474\n00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.770\nBut notice they just say channel group 10.\n\n475\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.310\nThey have to have the same configuration,\nsame speed, and same MTU.\n\n476\n00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.200\nThat was the thing that had\nset it automatically for me.\n\n477\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.720\nOkay so what have we done.\n\n478\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.990\nWe set lack P, we set PAGP.\n\n479\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.440\nWe had a troubleshooting\nopportunity that was,\n\n480\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.540\nI don't know a really odd problem\nI hadn't seen too often before.\n\n481\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.720\nBut I don't really screw with my native\nV lens a lot either so in production.\n\n482\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.610\nSo in this case here, we had to create\nanother port channel because it\n\n483\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.790\njust wouldn't figure out,\nI'm not in that same native VLAN anymore.\n\n484\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.980\nEven though we told it it wasn't.\n\n485\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.530\n>> All right, Tom,\nwell thank you again for\n\n486\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.740\nshowing us the details of\nsetting up EtherChannel.\n\n487\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.990\nRemember that in EtherChannel we're really\nlooking at two different technologies\n\n488\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.700\ndepending on what you want to set up.\n\n489\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.410\nThe PAGP here is actually gonna be for\nCisco proprietary.\n\n490\n00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:16.530\nAnd then, of course, there's LAGP which\nis for Cisco and everything else.\n\n491\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.020\nThey both seem to be\nconfigured fairly similar.\n\n492\n00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.400\nRemember the differences and\ntheir configurations as well\n\n493\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.920\nwhen you are setting up ether channel and\ngetting that to work too.\n\n494\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.870\nAlso Todd showed us\nthe verification commands so\n\n495\n00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.780\nthat we could go back through and verify\nthat they are also set up and working.\n\n496\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.690\nSeeing them connected is key, but also\nwhen we actually did the ether channel\n\n497\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.870\nstatus, remember what you're looking for\nis that S and\n\n498\n00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.240\nthat U in capital letters that\nshows that everything is up.\n\n499\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.430\nAnd then of course is actually operating\nthe way that it needs to as well.\n\n500\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.370\nSo those are actually very important\nthings that we'll end up seeing\n\n501\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.700\non that CCNA routing and\nswitching exam, too.\n\n502\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.710\nAnd we even had that\nchance of troubleshooting.\n\n503\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.460\nBut this is a great time for us to go\nahead and sign off for this episode.\n\n504\n00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n505\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.000\n>> And Todd Lammie.\n\n506\n00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.852\n>> And stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA routing and switching

          "description": "In this episode, Mr. Todd Lammle introduces the routing protocol of OSPF.   OSPF is a link-state protocol that uses the Shortest Path First Algorithm to determine the best route to the destination and does more, according to Todd.  He tells us that OSPF also creates a neighbor table, topology table and routing table based on “cost” (bandwidth).  OSPF doesn’t exchange routes so much as link-states between routers, Todd says.  He also describes that routers can report different LSAs depending on whether the router is an ABR, Area Border Router or ASBR, Autonomous System Border Router.  He also shows the basic OSPF configuration styles using the ‘Router OSPF <Process-ID>’ command or per interface using ‘ip ospf <proccess-id> area<area-id>1’",

Wong.\n\n3\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.030\nAnd today we're gonna be taking that\nICND2 content, getting ready for\n\n4\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.940\nthat new CCNA Routing and Switching exam.\n\n5\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.030\nAnd in our studio today, we have Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.040\nTodd Lammie to help us to focus in\non what we need to actually know.\n\n7\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.640\nSo thank you, Todd, for\nbeing back in the studios with us.\n\n8\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.180\n>> You're welcome.\nIt's great to be back.\n\n9\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.000\nWe're gonna continue on\nright where we left off.\n\n10\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580\nWe're in routing protocols.\n\n11\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.160\nWe did some intense EIGRP yesterday,\nboth IPV 4 and IPV 6,\n\n12\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.210\nyou gotta know them both very well.\n\n13\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.090\nWe had multi-link, equal costs,\nunequal costs, load balancing.\n\n14\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.820\nWe're gonna do the same thing with OSPF.\n\n15\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.500\nWe're gonna start off with the OSPF\nfeed two and with IP version 4,\n\n16\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.180\ndo a load balancing.\n\n17\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.110\nWe're gonna do OSPF feed three\nwith IP version 6 as well.\n\n18\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.510\nAll right, so let's go ahead and dive\nright into the concepts Of OSPF version 2.\n\n19\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.890\nAll right now, so OSPF is an open.\n\n20\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.230\nThis is why it was kinda popular.\n\n21\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.220\nWell, there's two things is, it was\nbuilt to be used in worldwide networks.\n\n22\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.460\nHuge networks, I mean just hundreds and\nhundreds of thousands, millions of routes.\n\n23\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.230\nSo that's something, obviously,\nRIP couldn't handle.\n\n24\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.510\nWe only had RIP and OSPF at the time.\n\n25\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.822\nSo, it uses the shortest path\nfirst algorithm, What is that?\n\n26\n00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:30.980\nAlgorithm.\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n27\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.935\n>> I can't even say that right.\n\n28\n00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:34.420\nLink-state routing protocol\nversus distance vector state.\n\n29\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.285\nQuick look at this vector and\nthey comparison to OSPF.\n\n30\n00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:42.790\nLink-state protocols are more scalable.\n\n31\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.240\nAnd when we're talking about link-state\nwe're comparing really OSPF to RIP, but\n\n32\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.440\nyou could say ISIS is link state.\n\n33\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.780\nIt's really kind of a competitor to OSPF,\nnot really that much different.\n\n34\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.530\nAnd then, we had Disk Inspector\nrouting protocols like RIP and IGRP.\n\n35\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.370\nThere was a couple at Apple and\nNovell had one and so on.\n\n36\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.960\nBut in the sense here,\njust I want you to think of RIP and\n\n37\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.700\nOSPF as what we're comparing here.\n\n38\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.650\nEach router has a full picture of the\ntopology, we didn't have that with RIP.\n\n39\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.510\nWe build a topology table now.\n\n40\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.420\nSo we can't have loops,\ncuz we know much more about the network.\n\n41\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.260\nSo updates are sent, so we never really\nsend updates, not with EIGRP OSPF, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.500\nthat's the link state\na characteristic of EIGRP, right?\n\n43\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.045\nSo with RIP, the disk inspector qualities,\nor just inspect in general,\n\n44\n00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:29.260\nwe send updates on periodic intervals.\n\n45\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.740\nWe don't send updates unless a change\noccurs with our linked state.\n\n46\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.350\nSo, we respond quickly to topology\nchanges, we don't wait for\n\n47\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.480\nour timer to expire.\n\n48\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.700\nWhen something happens,\nwe respond immediately.\n\n49\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.490\nAnd we have more information\nbetween the routers.\n\n50\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.130\nNow, we create neighbor relationships,\nso we're gonna call this an adjacency.\n\n51\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.150\nSo, we're gonna come up now, with the\nAGRP, this was pretty simple, as long as\n\n52\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.660\nyou're autonomous system numbers match and\nno one changed your K values.\n\n53\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.630\nSee, that should never be\na problem because no one should be\n\n54\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.980\nscrewing with your K values.\n\n55\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.530\nBut if Cisco did that on exam,\nit's just something for you to look at and\n\n56\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.360\nshow IP protocols would show you this.\n\n57\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.140\nBut in OSPF though,\nit's a little bit more complex.\n\n58\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.450\nThere's a lot of things that have to.\n\n59\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.961\nThere's a fly that was going by.\n\n60\n00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:12.906\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Flying by me.\n\n61\n00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:15.720\n[LAUGH] There's a lot of\nthings that have to match.\n\n62\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.030\nWe're gonna see that and\nwe're gonna talk about that in detail.\n\n63\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.180\nI'm gonna show it to you in detail.\n\n64\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.930\nAnd we're gonna troubleshoot this.\n\n65\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.940\nAnd when we go through our\ntroubleshooting episode,\n\n66\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.930\nwe're going to spend a lot\nof time on that as well.\n\n67\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.150\nWe don't ever send routing table updates,\nokay?\n\n68\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.880\nEIGRP doesn't either, OSPF doesn't.\n\n69\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.770\nWe don't send routing tables updates.\n\n70\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.730\nWe exchange neighbor information.\n\n71\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.750\nWe update our topology tables, right?\n\n72\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.990\nOur topological database.\n\n73\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.893\nWhat we call in OSPF.\n\n74\n00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:43.230\nThen we update our routing table that way.\n\n75\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.830\nAll right?\n\n76\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.940\nSo in the LSAs,\nwe understand what our links are.\n\n77\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.930\nOur links are our router interfaces.\n\n78\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.680\nEach one's a different address space.\n\n79\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.070\nSo I could use the term subnet.\n\n80\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.120\nThen what would you use if you used IVV6?\n\n81\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.980\nI know that we quote unquote,\nsubnet's IVV6.\n\n82\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.790\nIt's just not the same with IP version 4,\nare they?\n\n83\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.690\nSo we're gonna call everything a link.\n\n84\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.470\nSo we also have a description of\nan interface and its relationship, and\n\n85\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.460\nthat's what we understand, the link\nstate of each neighbor, of each link.\n\n86\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.280\nSo we flood these link state\nadvertisements to all those\n\n87\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.560\nrouters in the area.\n\n88\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.850\nAll right, so we flood more than just\nto our directly connected neighbors,\n\n89\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.350\nwe flood to all routers in our area.\n\n90\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.500\nSo we're gonna talk about areas,\nwhat those are, and so\n\n91\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.520\nanyone in our neighborhood we're gonna\nflood, and we're gonna talk to them,\n\n92\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.040\nand this way we understand.\n\n93\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.890\nSee with distance spectrum,\nwe just can only tell about\n\n94\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.590\nour directly connected neighbors, and\nwhatever they tell me Is the truth.\n\n95\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.040\nIt's called routing by rumor,\nrouting by rumor.\n\n96\n00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.830\nBecause we don't know that it's true and\nwith rip it's a lot, it's not.\n\n97\n00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.880\nWe only trust it 50% of the way.\n\n98\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.140\nSo but with those peaphony as your P,\nwe get more information about the network.\n\n99\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.510\nWe have a bigger picture, right?\n\n100\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.620\nSo we use the shortest\npath birth algorithm.\n\n101\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.760\nTo calculate the shortest\npath to each destination and\n\n102\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.340\nthen we place it in the routing table,\nthe best path.\n\n103\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.520\nSo we do use a cost, right.\n\n104\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.730\nWe only use bandwidth with OSPF or\nwith EIGRP.\n\n105\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.793\nAs we saw we used bandwidth and\ndelay of the line, which\n\n106\n00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:25.134\nis probably a better algorithm really,\nbut with OSPF we just use bandwidth.\n\n107\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.240\nOkay, so we have a hierarchy.\n\n108\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.440\nI mentioned areas.\n\n109\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.330\nNow we don't have to have areas.\n\n110\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.940\nWe can have a single area, right?\n\n111\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.460\nBut in an autonomous system,\nit's a collection of routers, right, that\n\n112\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.865\nwe administrate, that understand IBM.com\nwould be an administrative distance.\n\n113\n00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.990\nCisco.com an autonomous system right?\n\n114\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.770\nand so in that since we can make smaller\nareas of routing because in an autonomous\n\n115\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.780\nsystem we could have hundreds or\nmaybe even millions of routes right?\n\n116\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.930\nSo hundreds of thousands you know\ntypically thousands maybe hundreds of\n\n117\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.440\nthousands or something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.770\nBut nonetheless,\nwe wanna make smaller areas of routing so\n\n119\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.120\nin a network like that.\n\n120\n00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.580\nSo, some customers that I've\nhad that are nationwide and\n\n121\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.800\nthey were in every city,\nI made their cities areas.\n\n122\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.750\nRight, so it was a real nice kinda demark\nfor me to say okay, here's Cleveland,\n\n123\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.110\nhere's Detroit,\nhere's Philadelphia and so on.\n\n124\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.690\nBecause we had a lot of\nroutes in each city.\n\n125\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.950\nAnd they had one area cross the nation,\nwhich is fine.\n\n126\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.350\nHowever, with a problem\noccurring in Philadelphia,\n\n127\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.910\nthen that would trickle across\nthe whole United States, right?\n\n128\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.230\nEvery router then had to\nknow about this problem.\n\n129\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.230\nSo, when I created an area in\nPhiladelphia and there was a problem.\n\n130\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.610\nThen that problem only was in that area.\n\n131\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.600\nRight, so this localized the impact of a\ntopology change within Philadelphia only.\n\n132\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.340\nSo also it minimize routing table entries\nbecause I only knew about Philadelphia or\n\n133\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.570\nI only knew about Detroit.\n\n134\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.730\nAnd for me to get to those other areas,\nI had a summary route.\n\n135\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.350\nOkay, so I'm not saying you\nneed to use multiple areas.\n\n136\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.770\nYou'd have to have\na pretty big network for\n\n137\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.600\nme to want to put multiple areas in today.\n\n138\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.690\nBecause single area\nnetworks work very well.\n\n139\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.610\nThey're quicker,\n\n140\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.460\nthey have less link state updates,\nless link state advertisements, right.\n\n141\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.180\nSo there's some benefits\nto having a single area.\n\n142\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.330\nBut then the benefits of multiple\narea are in a larger network,\n\n143\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.450\nyou don't want to take a problem in\nMiami and have it go all the way\n\n144\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.360\nto every city all the way to Seattle or\nSan Francisco, right?\n\n145\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.920\nThat's a lot of problems\nto fix along the way.\n\n146\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.370\nNow in this picture here,\nlet's take a look.\n\n147\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.120\nFirst off, this is my autonomous system.\n\n148\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.740\nAnd we have the backbone area,\nthis is also referred to as Area 0.\n\n149\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.208\nNow, if I have multiple areas\nI have to have an Area 0.\n\n150\n00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:55.066\nIf I have a single area,\nI can name it anything I want, right?\n\n151\n00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:57.725\nYou have areas numbers from\n1 to 2.4 billion, I think.\n\n152\n00:07:57.725 --> 00:08:02.268\nSo anyways,\nyou have plenty of areas to number.\n\n153\n00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:06.840\nBut if you aren't gonna do multiple areas,\nI have to have an Area 0.\n\n154\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.127\nNow that being said,\n\n155\n00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:12.284\nall other areas then if you have\nthe must connect directly to Area 0.\n\n156\n00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:16.140\nNow if you don't do that,\nthere is a temporary way to do this.\n\n157\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.260\nNow this was important years ago in the\n80s and 90s when I was hooking this up,\n\n158\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.647\nit was hard to get links back\nto our corporate office or\n\n159\n00:08:24.647 --> 00:08:28.490\nour location where we\nwere terminating these.\n\n160\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.650\nSo we could have temporary links, all\nright, I don't see these as much anymore,\n\n161\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.775\nbut let's say this was Area 4 over here.\n\n162\n00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:37.557\nThis could connect into\nArea 1 temporarily, and\n\n163\n00:08:37.557 --> 00:08:40.480\nthen we'd create something\ncalled a virtual link.\n\n164\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.100\nNow, these are supposed to be temporary.\n\n165\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.771\nBut they never were.\n\n166\n00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:52.230\n[LAUGH] So they allowed us to traverse\nanother area to get to Area 0, all right?\n\n167\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.260\nI don't recommend these because\ntemporary always ends up permanent.\n\n168\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.635\nSo be very careful with virtual links.\n\n169\n00:08:57.635 --> 00:09:02.230\nNow, this router here that connects to\n\n170\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.250\nanother autonomous system is called\nan autonomous system border router, ASBR.\n\n171\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:14.110\nThe routers that connect multiple areas\ntogether, come on, iPad, you can do this.\n\n172\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.905\nArea border router, okay, these are to\nconnect my different routers together.\n\n173\n00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:25.831\nSo these are just normal routers,\narea routers here inside of an area.\n\n174\n00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.450\nAnd then we have our ASBRs and ABRs.\n\n175\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.600\nNow, so we have our backbone area,\nArea 0, and then normal areas, right?\n\n176\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.760\nAgain, don't have to have an Area 0\nunless I have multiple areas, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.010\nVirtual link connects an area\nthrough another area temporarily,\n\n178\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.402\nthat's the only reason it was created.\n\n179\n00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:46.500\nBut now, the reason,\n\n180\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.730\nagain, we want multiple areas is\nif we have a very large network,\n\n181\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.920\nthis will minimize running table entries,\nmake my network more efficient.\n\n182\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.772\nDon't have to have multiple areas\nif you build this correctly.\n\n183\n00:09:56.772 --> 00:10:00.270\nUnlike EIGRP,\nthat works in any crappy network design.\n\n184\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.770\nIt's just this old routing\nprotocol that can.\n\n185\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.020\nOSPF is not.\n\n186\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.040\nIf you don't build it in a hierarchical\nmanner, it just won't convert.\n\n187\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.370\nSo be very careful in how you build OSPF.\n\n188\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.755\nAnd you're also gonna see that we have\na third layer that we need to think about,\n\n189\n00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:17.070\nour logical area of addressing\nwe're going to get to in a minute.\n\n190\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.170\nOSPF takes some thought\nbefore we configure it.\n\n191\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.385\nEIRGP does not, right?\n\n192\n00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:22.780\nWe can just configure it,\nit comes up, and it starts working.\n\n193\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.840\nIt's a great routing protocol, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.840\nArea 0, again,\n\n195\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.000\ncalled the backbone area, okay, I have to\nhave an Area 0 if I have multiple areas.\n\n196\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.320\nYou must connect all\nother areas to Area 0.\n\n197\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.240\nIf not, temporarily use a virtual link.\n\n198\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.540\nHierarchical networks don't\nrequire multiple areas.\n\n199\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.520\nAnd one of the benefits of OSPF\nis it can be used in a business\n\n200\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.660\nwith multiple routers.\n\n201\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.000\nNow, hold on a second,\nif I take a non-Cisco router and\n\n202\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.940\na Cisco router, will they come up and\nwork with OSPF?\n\n203\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.280\nAbsolutely not, no,\nnothing works out of the box.\n\n204\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.780\nWhat they mean is you can configure\nit to work with multiple routers.\n\n205\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.120\nBe careful here.\n\n206\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.979\nAll right, so if you take two routers,\nthey are not going to create an adjacency.\n\n207\n00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:11.217\nAnd that's part of the troubleshooting,\nso Cisco hits hard on these objectives on\n\n208\n00:11:11.217 --> 00:11:15.046\nhey, you connect these two routers\ntogether, what's the problem here?\n\n209\n00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:18.700\nAnd you're gonna have to figure that out,\nso we will go through that in detail.\n\n210\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.720\nAll right, so\nif you have two Cisco routers,\n\n211\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.040\nas long as they're in the same area,\n\n212\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.390\nthey're just gonna come up cuz everything\nelse is gonna be configured the same.\n\n213\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.120\nSo really, your problem occurs when\nyou have a Cisco and a non-Cisco.\n\n214\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.940\nOkay, they do not work out of the box.\n\n215\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.880\nThey can be configured to work together.\n\n216\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.990\nAll right, now we use cost or\nbandwidth, converges quickly.\n\n217\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.658\nEIGRP is probably faster, but compared\nto rep is what they're saying here.\n\n218\n00:11:41.658 --> 00:11:47.300\nIt uses costs to determine the best route,\nand before we exchange\n\n219\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.320\nrouting information into our topological\ndatabases, we build a neighbor table.\n\n220\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.520\nSo we build a neighbor table,\nthen we build our topological database,\n\n221\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.790\nunderstanding the links and\n\n222\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.230\nthe state of each link before\nwe build our routing table.\n\n223\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.243\nNow to configure OSPF, it's a little bit\nmore convoluted than, we've gone through\n\n224\n00:12:06.243 --> 00:12:10.019\nwhat, static and default in ICD 1, and\nwe did RIP back there as well, EIGRP,\n\n225\n00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:13.910\nactually pretty simple, EIGRP,\nit's kind of almost hard to screw up.\n\n226\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.919\nAnd the way I showed you not to corrupt\nEIGRP, if you went to that episode,\n\n227\n00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:20.180\nwas you do a show ip int brief.\n\n228\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.585\nIt's right in front of you,\nit says hey, type this in.\n\n229\n00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:23.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so\n\n230\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.970\nit's kind of hard to screw that up.\n\n231\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.290\nWith OSPF,\nwe can easily screw it up, right?\n\n232\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.890\nEIGRP, as long as you do a show ip\nint brief or show ip route connected,\n\n233\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.780\nwhatever, you can see your\ndirectly connected networks.\n\n234\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.980\nIt's pretty simple, and\nyou could use inverse masks or not.\n\n235\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.460\nWith OSPF, you have to use inverse masks.\n\n236\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.920\nAll right, so let's take a look here.\n\n237\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.670\nIt's a router OSPF and a process ID.\n\n238\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.810\nNow this is not the same\nthing as with EIGRP.\n\n239\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.140\nThat was an autonomous system number,\n\n240\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.300\nwhere all routers within that autonomous\nsystem must use that same number.\n\n241\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.530\nThis number's irrelevant.\n\n242\n00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.735\nHowever, with that [LAUGH] being said,\nthis is the most important\n\n243\n00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:02.710\nunimportant number with your OSPF\n[LAUGH] configuration, I'm like, what?\n\n244\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.730\nIt's true.\n\n245\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.340\nNow so let me tell you what happens here.\n\n246\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.630\nIf I said router OSPF, and\nI have numbers between 1 and 65535, right,\n\n247\n00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.580\nit doesn't matter what number you choose,\nevery router can be different.\n\n248\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.870\nBut I recommend not doing that,\nand here's why.\n\n249\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.413\nSo I said router OSPF 10,\ndid some configuration,\n\n250\n00:13:21.413 --> 00:13:25.365\nI went over to another router,\nand I said router OSPF 11.\n\n251\n00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:28.425\nIt doesn't matter, those numbers are\nlocally significant for that router only,\n\n252\n00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:30.711\nthey don't use that in their exchanges or\nloads or anything.\n\n253\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.320\nSo I come back to this router,\nand I say router OSPF 11.\n\n254\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.240\nWhoops, I just created\nanother OSPF database,\n\n255\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.660\nI no longer work as an IGP, cuz I'm\nan exterior gateway router protocol.\n\n256\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:49.260\nI'm now an autonomous system board router,\nright, so I have two databases, right.\n\n257\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.220\nSo, you don't wanna do that.\n\n258\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.160\nIt will not work correctly.\n\n259\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.180\nSo, it's an unimportant number in\nthe sense that it doesn't matter what you\n\n260\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.972\nchoose, and all the routers can be\ndifferent, as long as you know what it is.\n\n261\n00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:02.350\nNow there's a couple of different\neasy ways to see how it is.\n\n262\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.900\nShow IP protocols, show IP proto,\n\n263\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.720\nshow IP OSPF, there is a myriad of\ncommands that will show you this.\n\n264\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.010\nHowever, so what I recommend is\njust making them all the same.\n\n265\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.930\nLiterally, whenever I'm with a customer,\nI just say router OSPF 1.\n\n266\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.683\nAnd I use the same number every time,\nthat way, I know what it is.\n\n267\n00:14:22.683 --> 00:14:23.820\nIt is important they're all the same?\n\n268\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.809\nAbsolutely not.\n\n269\n00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:25.856\nIs it important you know it?\n\n270\n00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:27.279\nYes, right?\n\n271\n00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.524\nSo, it's important unimportant\nnumber at the same time.\n\n272\n00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:31.760\nI don't know how else to say that.\n\n273\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.197\nSo, just make them all the same, even\nthough you have to remember that it has\n\n274\n00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:38.850\nnothing to do with them exchanging\ninformation or creating adjacency.\n\n275\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:43.040\nNow, that being said, then I'm gonna come\nin here and say network address mask, so\n\n276\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.670\nI would say network.\n\n277\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.464\nI can put in a class and a work number and\n\n278\n00:14:46.464 --> 00:14:49.393\nthen the inverse mask that we\nlearned about with access list.\n\n279\n00:14:49.393 --> 00:14:51.726\nAnd we used them with the IGRP.\n\n280\n00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:55.698\nSame one, and then we say area and\nthen the area-id.\n\n281\n00:14:55.698 --> 00:14:59.315\nNow so the area numbers can\nbe from 0 to 2.4 billion.\n\n282\n00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:04.125\nSo remember, the process ID is from 1,\nnot 0, okay.\n\n283\n00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:05.475\nThat's a mistake some people make.\n\n284\n00:15:05.475 --> 00:15:08.895\nThey see that on the exam, and\nthey choose router OSPF 0.\n\n285\n00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:12.230\nNo, you can't do that,\nit has to start at 1 up to 65535,\n\n286\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.480\nand the areas can be up to 2.4 billion and\nthey can start at 0, right?\n\n287\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.820\nNow that's a lot of numbers.\n\n288\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.030\nCan I really create that many areas?\n\n289\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.227\n>> I don't think so.\n\n290\n00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:26.930\n>> [LAUGH] No, now the reason\nthey did that, and in the 90s,\n\n291\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.920\nI know people didn't really know IP until\nlate 90s, even into the 2000s, right?\n\n292\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.910\nAnd so what I used to do was\ncreate my areas like this.\n\n293\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.159\nI would say network and so on, and\n\n294\n00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:44.695\nthen I'd say area 172.16.10.0.\n\n295\n00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:49.840\nThat was actually my area, so you could\ndo it as a four octet number like this,\n\n296\n00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.175\nand my areas would be the actual subnets,\nright?\n\n297\n00:15:53.175 --> 00:15:55.573\nAnd that way, no,\nI don't do that like that anymore.\n\n298\n00:15:55.573 --> 00:15:59.835\nBut back then, everyone went, okay, so\nthe area was same as the subnet number.\n\n299\n00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:03.251\nSo I don't know if they created it for\nthat reason but that's how I did it.\n\n300\n00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:07.470\nBecause of the way they created it,\nit allowed me to do something like that.\n\n301\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.830\nI can write it as anything as I wanted,\nright.\n\n302\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.300\nSo it is a pretty big number.\n\n303\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.800\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.250\nNow OSPF Configuration.\n\n305\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.490\nLet's take a look here as an example.\n\n306\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.850\nSo a couple of different\nways I can do this network.\n\n307\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.730\nNow if everything is\ngonna be in area zero and\n\n308\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.720\nnothing is gonna be outside of\narea zero and it's a single area.\n\n309\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.261\nI have a very easy way to configure OSPF.\n\n310\n00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:29.687\nYou know I just say Config T,\n\n311\n00:16:29.687 --> 00:16:33.760\nrouter OSPF one, right?\n\n312\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760\nSo I know the number.\n\n313\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.750\nDon't care what the number is,\nas long as I know it.\n\n314\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.950\nMake them the same on every router,\nso that you don't forget them.\n\n315\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.160\nAnd the network in this case,\nany network, any octet committee value,\n\n316\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.470\narea zero, right?\n\n317\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.150\nThat's what my inverse mask\nis saying here, right?\n\n318\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.250\nI know I can't see that on here.\n\n319\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.030\nThere we go.\n\n320\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:54.960\nAnyways, this is a way to do it but this\nis only if you're doing area zero, right?\n\n321\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.410\nSingle area this'll work just fine, right?\n\n322\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.340\nI typically don't use this one.\n\n323\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like a little bit more control.\n\n324\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.620\nBut it is an answer for\nthe objective to be honest with you.\n\n325\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.290\nSo Let's take a look at this one.\n\n326\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.230\nrouter OSPF 100.\n\n327\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.640\nWhy 100?\nI don't know.\n\n328\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.390\nIt felt good, all right.\n\n329\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.280\nNetwork.\n\n330\n00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.920\nNow check this out.\n\n331\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.220\nI typed in the IP addresses here.\n\n332\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.726\n10.11.2 and then 0.0.0.\n\n333\n00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:21.870\nNow, we can't use the host command\nlike we did with our access list.\n\n334\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.020\nSo zero means that octet\nmust match exactly right?\n\n335\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.590\nSo the quad zero means we're looking for\nthat particular IP address.\n\n336\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.470\nThis is pretty tight.\n\n337\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.030\nThe problem with this,\nit dictates no mistakes, no typo's,\n\n338\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.520\nyou must have that interface correct.\n\n339\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.620\nNow that's easy to do again.\n\n340\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.690\nBefore I type in, so I type router\nospf 1 Do show IP interface brief.\n\n341\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.800\nMy IP addresses are right there.\n\n342\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.570\nI can type network, type those\nnetwork numbers in, quad zeroes.\n\n343\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.530\nThey're right there.\n\n344\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.540\nIt's hard to screw that up right?\n\n345\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.650\nIt can't be done though.\n\n346\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.800\nBecause I have people do\nthis in my classes and\n\n347\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.010\nthey're typing in 10.1.1.2 and\nthey type in 10.1.1.1.\n\n348\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.870\nIt doesn't matter that it's sitting\nin front of you, it's hard.\n\n349\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.100\nWhat I ended up doing was changing my\nlab and saying, in the fourth octet,\n\n350\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.840\nwe're not gonna put a zero there,\nput a 255.\n\n351\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.050\nThat way you can type in anything\nthat feels good in the fourth octet.\n\n352\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.920\nThen my labs usually work that, right?\n\n353\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.090\nAgain, if you make a mistake here,\nit's good.\n\n354\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.730\nYou need to troubleshoot.\n\n355\n00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.910\nTroubleshooting is half your exam,\nall right?\n\n356\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.874\nSo make a mistake, and\nthen have to go and fix it, all right?\n\n357\n00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:31.160\nSo 10 2.2.2, 0.0.0.0 area 0,\nput them both here at 0.\n\n358\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.660\nEasily could've taken the same network and\ntyped this bottom command here.\n\n359\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.843\nEither one results with 0s in\nthe routing table, all right?\n\n360\n00:18:38.843 --> 00:18:41.027\nIt doesn't matter you configure it.\n\n361\n00:18:41.027 --> 00:18:48.390\nI could have done this, 10.0.0.0, And\nthen 0 for so octet match exactly.\n\n362\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.390\n255.255.255, right?\n\n363\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.320\nArea 0.\n\n364\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.850\nDoes it matter?\n\n365\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.420\nIt matters not, right?\n\n366\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.630\nSo I could have done it either way and\n\n367\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.250\nthat would cover everything\nthat starts with 10, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.600\nNow to verify OSPF,\n\n369\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.470\nnow what we're gonna do here is I'm\ngonna through some verification plans.\n\n370\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.210\nI'm gonna run out and do a lap and\n\n371\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.480\nI'm gonna configure a little\nnetwork that we did with EIGRP.\n\n372\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.250\nAnd we're gonna go through that and\nwe're gonna get that thing running, right.\n\n373\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.520\nAnd then we're gonna run through\nsome verification commands.\n\n374\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.630\nAnd then we're gonna come back and\nwe're gonna discuss multi area OSPF and\n\n375\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.850\nthen configure multi area and\nso on and then do OSPF v3.\n\n376\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.390\nNow in the meantime though,\nlet's take a look at some commands.\n\n377\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.929\nShow ip protocols.\n\n378\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.100\nShow ip protocols just verifies that\nany routing protocol is configured.\n\n379\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.120\nAnd we'll see that we have RIP.\n\n380\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.630\nI don't think that I ever turned that off.\n\n381\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.940\nEIGRP and OSPF.\n\n382\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.180\nNow to get this working,\nwill OSPF work if EIGRP is running?\n\n383\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.560\nLet's find out.\n\n384\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.400\nShow IP route or\n\n385\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.680\nI could do show IP route OSPF to\nshow me my routing table, obviously.\n\n386\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.890\nNow this is the most important command for\n\n387\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.530\nyour objectives right here:\nshow ip ospf interface.\n\n388\n00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.000\nBecause this is again,\nfor your objectives,\n\n389\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.760\nI guess you're not talking to a Cisco\nrouter or something by default or\n\n390\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.130\nthey just screwed it up because\nyou don't form an adjacency.\n\n391\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.042\nThis is half of your objectives for OSPF.\n\n392\n00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:15.850\nYou're connected to a neighbor, but\nyou're not forming adjacency, why?\n\n393\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.700\nI mean, look at that question\nlike ten times, right?\n\n394\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.620\nSo the fact is you have\nto understand this 100%.\n\n395\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.980\nSo I'm just gonna pound it into you.\n\n396\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.310\nThese are the reasons, these\nare the reasons, here's what you look for.\n\n397\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.440\nWe're gonna go over it in this session.\n\n398\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.850\nAnd then when I do my troubleshooting\nepisode, I'm gonna go over it again.\n\n399\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.760\nOkay, show ip ospf interface.\n\n400\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.900\nI'm gonna compare the timers.\n\n401\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.330\nThe area, the subnet, the authentication.\n\n402\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.470\nWe're gonna go through some other stuff\nand make sure they're all the same, and\n\n403\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.190\nthis command will give it to us.\n\n404\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.090\nOkay, I can get the same thing from a show\nrun assuming you can do a show run.\n\n405\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.370\nAll right, so we're gonna do it both ways.\n\n406\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.470\nNow the show ips enable shows my\nneighborship table in the database.\n\n407\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.320\nShows me my top logical database.\n\n408\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.520\nWe'll take a look at both of those.\n\n409\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.810\nAlso, the show ip ospf command.\n\n410\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.444\nSo less run out to their lab,\n\n411\n00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:03.520\nlet's configure simple ospf\nsingle area right now.\n\n412\n00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:09.300\nOkay, I'm gonna start with my Corp.\n\n413\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.030\nLet's take a look at my\ndrawing once again, okay?\n\n414\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.400\nSo in this case here I'm just gonna\ndo IP version four at this point so\n\n415\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.220\nwe can see that I have my 172.16.10.0\nsubnet here, 172.16.10.4.10.8.\n\n416\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.850\nNow if I'm on corp I can just\nsay 172.16.0.0.0.0.25.25 and\n\n417\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:34.620\ncover all of those subnets very simply.\n\n418\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.580\nI've got a 192.68.10.\n\n419\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.180\nI have 20, 30, there's a 40 over here, and\nthen the 10.10.10.0 network down here.\n\n420\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.630\nAll right, so let's run out to the Corp,\nand we'll do the LA and San Francisco.\n\n421\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:50.430\nNow, since they're all Cisco routers,\nI only care about me.\n\n422\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.320\nNow, when we get to the point\nwhere we're not forming adjacency\n\n423\n00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.490\nnow I have to care about\nmy neighbor unfortunately.\n\n424\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.890\nBut with the IGRP,\nwe never really had to do that did we.\n\n425\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.210\nAll right let's jump out to and\ndo our OSPF lab here.\n\n426\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.310\nI already turned off the IGRP and\nrib here, I was turning that off.\n\n427\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.550\nSo we're just gonna have OSPF going.\n\n428\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.351\nSo I'm gonna do a show,\nI'm gonna do a config t router ospf 1.\n\n429\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.990\nAnd then do show ip ospf brief.\n\n430\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.432\nOops, it makes me spell that right.\n\n431\n00:22:29.742 --> 00:22:34.300\nDo show ip int brief.\n\n432\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.750\nIs what I meant, all right.\n\n433\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.720\nNow I'm not gonna worry about\nmy loop-backs here, and\n\n434\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.030\nwe're gonna find out why in a minute.\n\n435\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.610\nOn this one I don't even\nhave any loop-backs,\n\n436\n00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.930\nbut I can type this in\na couple different ways, guys.\n\n437\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.870\nOn the Corp we can make\nthis pretty simple.\n\n438\n00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.340\nAnd I can just, since everything's gonna\nbe in one area, I'm just gonna say,\n\n439\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.590\nnetwork, any network,\nAny octet can be any value.\n\n440\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.970\nArea zero, okay?\n\n441\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.770\nSo, this is gonna cover all\nof my interfaces no matter\n\n442\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.270\nwhat their IP address is.\n\n443\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.790\nIf you're using Single area OSPF,\nthis is an easy way to do it.\n\n444\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.210\nAll right, so under the San Francisco\nrouter, we'll do the same thing here.\n\n445\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.110\nrouter ospf 1.\n\n446\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.460\nI'll use the same number.\n\n447\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.880\nDoesn't matter which number I use\nas long as I remember what it is,\n\n448\n00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.330\nby using the same number then\nyou always know what it is.\n\n449\n00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:30.090\nAnd then do show ip int brief.\n\n450\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.722\nAnd I'm not gonna type in my loop-backs,\nwe're not gonna advertise those with OSPF.\n\n451\n00:23:36.722 --> 00:23:37.440\nWith OSPF for,\n\n452\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.840\nwe're going to use those as the name\nas the RID of the routers we'll see.\n\n453\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.954\nAnd since those were up already\nthose automatically became my RID.\n\n454\n00:23:43.954 --> 00:23:47.170\nSo we'll come back to that as soon as we\nfinish our configure in a couple minutes.\n\n455\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.635\nSo I'm going to do this\none a different way.\n\n456\n00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:54.970\nNetwork 192.168.0.0.0.0,\n\n457\n00:23:54.970 --> 00:24:00.309\nnope 255.255 area zero,\nlet's go back to this.\n\n458\n00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:03.288\nNow this zero, I put a zero here.\n\n459\n00:24:03.288 --> 00:24:09.065\nIf I don't put a 2D5 in that same octet\nvalue, then I'm saying I want subnet zero.\n\n460\n00:24:09.065 --> 00:24:11.930\n192.I68.0 or network zero, whatever.\n\n461\n00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:17.600\nThe fact is is If I put a 0 here and\nI want to encompass the 10 and\n\n462\n00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.690\nthe 40, I'm going to put\na 255 in that octet place.\n\n463\n00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.850\nIf I put a 0 here,\nif I was to type 0 here,\n\n464\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.740\nthen what I'm saying is I\nwant 192.168.0 network only.\n\n465\n00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.344\nAnd I don't want that, I want 255.\n\n466\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.270\nSo that means any value\nin that third octet.\n\n467\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.389\nOkay, but I still need the 172.16.\n\n468\n00:24:45.595 --> 00:24:48.100\nBut that's gonna cover my 40, and\nI don't wanna advertise my 40.\n\n469\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.740\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nup arrow, and Ctrl+A, and say no.\n\n470\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.720\nAnd by the way, this is how you\ntake out a network statement.\n\n471\n00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.420\nIf you see this on your exam objective\ns you have to take something out.\n\n472\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:08.930\nPut a no in front of\nthat network statement.\n\n473\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.180\nSo I'm gonna be a little\nmore succinct here.\n\n474\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.350\nArea 0, and\nthen network 172.16.0.000 2D5 2D5 area 0.\n\n475\n00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.900\nOkay.\n\n476\n00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.540\nSo this advertise my LAN, and it's\nadvertised my WAN's but not my loopback.\n\n477\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:23.190\nSo I'm not, I typically don't\nadvertise my loopback's in my network.\n\n478\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.690\nIn this case here, there are diagnostic\nto add extra networks in here, but\n\n479\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.920\nin OSPF they are used as my rid so\nI'm not going to, you can advertise them.\n\n480\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.100\nI typically don't.\n\n481\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.030\n>> Now Todd, would that 19216830.\n\n482\n00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.270\nYou had a 10 one of those interfaces.\n\n483\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.199\n>> You're right.\nIt was [CROSSTALK].\n\n484\n00:25:38.199 --> 00:25:39.221\nSo now I've gotta do it again.\n\n485\n00:25:39.221 --> 00:25:40.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n486\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.260\n>> I was seeing if Ronnie\nwas paying attention here.\n\n487\n00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.380\nRouter, now this is easy to remember,\nbecause I don't have to go back and\n\n488\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.620\nfind out what I typed in as my process ID,\nso now I'm gonna come under here and\n\n489\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.610\nsay, there's my control A no.\n\n490\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.430\nAnd then change this to\nnetwork 192.168.10.0.\n\n491\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.610\nOkay, so\nagain I made two mistakes in there.\n\n492\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.410\nI had to take them out.\n\n493\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.480\nWatch your typos on here.\n\n494\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.550\nWhen you're in the exam and\nyou're in a hurry, be very careful.\n\n495\n00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.290\nSee how easy that was?\n\n496\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.100\nIt was sitting right in front of me and\nI still made a mistake.\n\n497\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.400\nAll right, now let's come over here.\n\n498\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.360\nAnd I'm gonna do this one\na little bit different here.\n\n499\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.635\nI'm gonna say, config t, [COUGH]\n\n500\n00:26:20.635 --> 00:26:24.900\nconfig t router ospf 1,\n\n501\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.790\nand that's all I'm gonna do for\nright now, right.\n\n502\n00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.220\nI'm gonna do more under here in\na minute I'm going to do a Do Show IP\n\n503\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.120\ninterface brief.\n\n504\n00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.520\nI see I have a fast ethernet and\ntwo serials.\n\n505\n00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.970\nAgain, i'm not going to advertise my\nloopbacks in this environment, but I am\n\n506\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.350\ngoing to advertise my physical interfaces\nbut not 0/0 because we're not using that.\n\n507\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.780\nSo check this out,\ni'm going to say interface f0/0,\n\n508\n00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.150\nip ospf process ID 1 area 0.\n\n509\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.330\nNow I no longer have to\nuse network statements.\n\n510\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.680\nI can just put the ospf underneath\nthe interfaces themselves.\n\n511\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.340\nThis is how you see it\non the exam objectives.\n\n512\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.940\nThey have the ospf configuration\nunder the interface.\n\n513\n00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.650\nIs there a difference?\n\n514\n00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.880\nNo, not really.\n\n515\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.280\nSo in this case here I don't\nhave to understand inverse mass.\n\n516\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.330\nSO I'm going to go under an interface\ns0/1/0 and this is what I have right.\n\n517\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.780\nJust up arrow twice,\ntype in the same thing.\n\n518\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.560\nInterface s0/2/0,\nup arrow type in the same thing.\n\n519\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.080\nOkay.\n\n520\n00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.190\nSo I just say iopf the process\nID I set for global config.\n\n521\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.240\nAnd then what area I did.\n\n522\n00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.120\nI don't have to know the network, right?\n\n523\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.850\nAnd this is why we don't do the passive\ninterface with OSPF because\n\n524\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.300\nwe're telling it which\ninterfaces to turn on.\n\n525\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.270\nAnd even with out network\nstatement we're doing that.\n\n526\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.710\nAll right, so I'm just going out to\nthe interfaces, choose my interface, and\n\n527\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.390\nturning that one.\n\n528\n00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.398\nNow we should be good to go.\n\n529\n00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:51.960\nSo I'll come down here Show IP route.\n\n530\n00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.060\nAnd so I see networks ten.\n\n531\n00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.350\n30 is static.\n\n532\n00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.450\nRight.\nOkay, [LAUGH] so I have a static route,\n\n533\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.720\na default router so\nI'm picking this up by static.\n\n534\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.790\nThat's kind of funny.\n\n535\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.275\nI can't get rid of these\nloopback interfaces.\n\n536\n00:28:07.275 --> 00:28:08.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways, so\n\n537\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.330\nthe 20 though, is not static.\n\n538\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.690\nThat should have showed up as OSPF.\n\n539\n00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.700\nOkay.\nThat should be off my 010, of course.\n\n540\n00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.100\nThat's connected off of my LA router,\nthe 20.\n\n541\n00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.810\nDidn't I put that underneath there?\n\n542\n00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:32.100\nAnd then so I've got the serials, and\nthen my ten network off of San Francisco.\n\n543\n00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.610\nThe 30 network which is off of LA, and\nthe 40 network's not being advertised.\n\n544\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.980\nSo I can get rid of the static routes,\nbut okay.\n\n545\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.320\nI know why 20's showing up in here.\n\n546\n00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.120\nBecause I have a static route with\nadministrative assistance of 1 over here.\n\n547\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.710\nSo even though I got rid of my routing\nprotocols, let's go take a look here and\n\n548\n00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:53.030\nif I do a show run,\nI'll see my static routes down here.\n\n549\n00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.400\nSo there's network 30,\nI'm not advertising that.\n\n550\n00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.550\nNetwork 10, I'm not advertising that.\n\n551\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.140\nBut 20 I am.\n\n552\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.324\nAnd of 0 1.\n\n553\n00:28:59.324 --> 00:29:02.670\nDid I not put something underneath there?\n\n554\n00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.650\nI don't see it.\n\n555\n00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.320\nI thought I put it underneath there.\n\n556\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.520\nMaybe I put it underneath the wrong one.\n\n557\n00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.852\n>> Then that ones, yeah\n>> There it is I put it under fast ether\n\n558\n00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:14.410\n00.\n\n559\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:19.460\nAgain I made yet another typo guys,\nbe very careful here.\n\n560\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.740\nEven though its that its\n01 I put it under 00.\n\n561\n00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:28.560\nWhich is shut down its not even used,\nso another error.\n\n562\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.360\nip ospf 1 Area 0, okay?\n\n563\n00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.610\nSo that's why my 20 didn't show up,\nand it showed up as static.\n\n564\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.340\nBut let's take a look at why\nmy static showed up anyways,\n\n565\n00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:45.800\nbecause it should show up unless I changed\nthe administrative distance of it.\n\n566\n00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.110\nI have a default route,\nthat must have [COUGH] I know.\n\n567\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.390\nOn my corporate network I must\nhave a static route there.\n\n568\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.975\nOkay.\nIP route to network.\n\n569\n00:30:01.975 --> 00:30:03.195\nNetwork 20 right there.\n\n570\n00:30:03.195 --> 00:30:05.345\nBut notice why it showed it,\n\n571\n00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:09.355\nand why I have OSPF is because I have\na default route to 20 and 30, right?\n\n572\n00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:13.145\nBut they have a high\nadministrative distance.\n\n573\n00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:16.425\nSo we put those in at a floating\nroute last week sometime.\n\n574\n00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:18.485\nAnyways, that's why it showed up.\n\n575\n00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:19.085\nRight?\n\n576\n00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:21.675\nSo that was kinda nice for\nme to have that as a backup route.\n\n577\n00:30:21.675 --> 00:30:22.435\nSaid, hey.\n\n578\n00:30:22.435 --> 00:30:23.065\nI gotcha man.\n\n579\n00:30:24.465 --> 00:30:26.460\nSo now we should have all O's.\n\n580\n00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.520\nNetwork 30 is fine.\n\n581\n00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.080\nWe did not advertise network 30 and\n\n582\n00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.880\nI still have that static route\nright here that says to get there.\n\n583\n00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.320\nNow show IP proto,\nthat shows me I have EIGRP on here.\n\n584\n00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.540\nWhy am I not seeing the EIGRP?\n\n585\n00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.350\nBecause my other routers\nhad turned it off and\n\n586\n00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.270\nI turned off rip on everything as well.\n\n587\n00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.720\nSo this is just running in the background\nbut should I have that in here?\n\n588\n00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.860\nNo, not in production,\nI only have OSPF, right?\n\n589\n00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.560\nOkay, so here's my OSPF process ID one.\n\n590\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.770\nI don't have a distribute list, we'll\nsee that in our troubleshooting chapter.\n\n591\n00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.915\nAnd then obviously my RID.\n\n592\n00:30:57.915 --> 00:31:00.150\n172.16.10.9, the IP address on my router.\n\n593\n00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.270\nMaximum pass, I'm in a load bounce cross\nfour equal cross path automatically.\n\n594\n00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.310\n>> And I can see that my gateways\nare 40.1 and 30.1 right here,\n\n595\n00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.600\nso let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n596\n00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:20.000\nShow up route again, and see that to get\nto network 10 is OSPF via 10.2 serial.\n\n597\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.635\nThat's on my San Francisco router,\nI only have one serial interface.\n\n598\n00:31:24.635 --> 00:31:30.200\n10.4 and to get to network 20 which is off\nmy LA router I have two serial links and\n\n599\n00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.500\nI'd removed the bandwidth commands so\nnow we can see they're equal cost and\n\n600\n00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.830\nI'm load balancing across equal\ncost paths automatically.\n\n601\n00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.900\nIf they weren't equal cost paths I\nwouldn't load balance across them.\n\n602\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.796\nRight?\nSo what I would do is go in there and\n\n603\n00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:44.435\nchange it and\n\n604\n00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:48.456\ntell OSP equal costs even though\nthey're not by changing the bandwidth.\n\n605\n00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:52.372\nSo if they were different, if I had 1 gig\nand one not, I'd have to go in there and\n\n606\n00:31:52.372 --> 00:31:54.885\ntell the serial that hey,\nit's as good as the gig so\n\n607\n00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:56.659\nit would load balance across both.\n\n608\n00:31:56.659 --> 00:31:59.205\nSo I tell it that the bad\none is better than it is so\n\n609\n00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:01.452\nit will load balance across both of them.\n\n610\n00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:05.556\nAll right, so lets take a look at a couple\ncommands here before we take a break.\n\n611\n00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:07.740\nShow IP OSPF neighbor.\n\n612\n00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.290\nOkay, we can see that fully adjacent\nwe are going to fully understand that\n\n613\n00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.150\nin a second.\n\n614\n00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.170\nThe neighbor id is 30.1.\n\n615\n00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.010\nWe are going to find out\nwhat my neighbor id.\n\n616\n00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.268\nThis is actually my neighbor\nip address over here.\n\n617\n00:32:22.268 --> 00:32:23.840\n172.16.10.10.10.6, and 10.2.\n\n618\n00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.740\nAnd we can see that that's\nthe actual interface IP address\n\n619\n00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:35.230\nof my neighbor, but their name is this,\nthis is their RID, their router ID.\n\n620\n00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.580\nOkay so we are going to come back to that.\n\n621\n00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:46.190\nSo IP OSPF THat database\nis my typology database.\n\n622\n00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.590\nShow ipospf database.\n\n623\n00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.130\nSo I can see this is my typology table for\nmy different links and\n\n624\n00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.580\nthe status of the links that\nI get from my neighbor.\n\n625\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.800\nIf you have the show ip route,\nshow ip neighbor, and\n\n626\n00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.780\nshow ip typology we have show\nip protocols, show ipospf.\n\n627\n00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.220\nThis gives us a lot of information.\n\n628\n00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.450\nThis tells me my process ID and\nmy RID and other great information.\n\n629\n00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.270\nAnd then,\nthe other command that we're gonna use.\n\n630\n00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:22.500\nA little bit more when we get back is\nthe show ip ospf interface command.\n\n631\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.730\nAll right, so this is gonna give\nus information about our timers\n\n632\n00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.770\nthis is important when we're\ntroubleshooting between neighbours and\n\n633\n00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.890\nwhy this are forming in adjacency\n>> All right, Tod.\n\n634\n00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.080\nWell, thank you again for\nshowing us the OS pi introduction here.\n\n635\n00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.640\nMake sure you do have\nthe fundamental concepts and\n\n636\n00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.380\nthe understanding here for OSPF,\nthe Open Shortest Path First.\n\n637\n00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.310\nYou do wanna pay attention\nto that algorithm that they\n\n638\n00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.480\ncall the Shortest Past First as well.\n\n639\n00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.740\nAnd the Didykstra or the Dykstra,\nhowever we actually normally pronounce-\n\n640\n00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.540\n>> I think Dijkstra, yeah.\n\n641\n00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.311\n>> Yeah, good job, Todd.\n\n642\n00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:56.173\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I couldn't have pronounced it again.\n\n643\n00:33:56.173 --> 00:33:58.779\nRemember that we wanna pay attention\nto that particular algorithm.\n\n644\n00:33:58.779 --> 00:34:02.270\nAnd that's really the basis of how\nOSPF actually ends up working.\n\n645\n00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.550\nRemember those different\ntopology tables and\n\n646\n00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.590\nof course even the idea of\nhow that database is formed.\n\n647\n00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.770\nTodd also showed us in this particular\nsection here, right, a configuration,\n\n648\n00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.030\na simple configuration,\nof single area OSPF.\n\n649\n00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.280\nRemember that we can actually create the\nrouter itself by using that router, OSPF,\n\n650\n00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.770\nand whatever process ID creating network\nstatements with the wildcard mask or\n\n651\n00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.860\nthe inverse mask on those.\n\n652\n00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.740\nOr, you can go to each interface and\n\n653\n00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.410\nactually use that command\nto only do it on that, and\n\n654\n00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:36.400\nthat way you don't have to ever type\nout the network commands there either.\n\n655\n00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.500\nBut, overall though,\nit's a great little lab.\n\n656\n00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.740\nIt's something that you should try.\n\n657\n00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.420\nMake sure that you are getting the OSPF\nroutes that you're expecting to see.\n\n658\n00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.160\nSo that's a great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n659\n00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.580\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n660\n00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.253\n>> And Todd\n>> Stay tuned for more CCNA routing and\n\n661\n00:34:54.253 --> 00:34:56.011\nswitching content.\n\n662\n00:34:56.011 --> 00:35:03.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.229\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking that ICND2 content,\n\n4\n00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:22.940\ngetting ready for\nthat CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n5\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.100\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.090\nTodd Lammie right here in our\nstudios to guide us through.\n\n7\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640\nWelcome back, Todd.\n\n8\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.850\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.450\nWe're gonna hit right back in the SPF.\n\n10\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.215\nWe're gonna start talking about,\nwe need to understand RIDS.\n\n11\n00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.000\nWe need to understand the election\nprocess, multi-aerial SPF, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.600\ntroubleshooting.\n\n13\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.540\nSo this isn't gonna be\na short section either.\n\n14\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.700\nBut OSPF is a huge objective for us.\n\n15\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.350\nSo let's hit right back into it.\n\n16\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.690\nSo when to establish OSPF Neighbor\nAdjacencies we're going to send\n\n17\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.320\nan link state advertisement type 1,\nlink state advertisement type 1.\n\n18\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.080\nOkay.\n\n19\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.480\nAnd inside there we're gonna\nhave the router ID and\n\n20\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.990\nthis is why this has to match.\n\n21\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.880\nLet's take a look at\nthis a little bit closer.\n\n22\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.880\nThe router ID, my hello and\ndead interval, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.404\nAnd by default,\nthose are ten and 40 on Cisco.\n\n24\n00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.453\nWell, the reason that we\nhave to do troubleshooting,\n\n25\n00:01:13.453 --> 00:01:17.651\nis that if you have anything other than\na CISCO, those are not gonna match.\n\n26\n00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:21.318\nMost people are ten and 30 or five and\n30, or something like that, but\n\n27\n00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:22.690\nthey're not ten and 40.\n\n28\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.810\nSo that's the number one\ntroubleshooting spot.\n\n29\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.250\nAgain, we'll come back to those.\n\n30\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.150\nWe have to know who our neighbors are,\nthe Area ID must match.\n\n31\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.060\nAnd so right here we got\nthe asterisk here, hello and\n\n32\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.680\ndead area, Authentication data.\n\n33\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.330\nSo we must be in the same area, must be\nin the same subnet, that's just assumed.\n\n34\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.430\nAnd so the router priority, the DR and\nIP address, that's gonna given,\n\n35\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.580\nprovided in here.\n\n36\n00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.060\nSo some of this stuff must match, and\n\n37\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.650\nagain we'll get into that in\nextreme detail, painful detail.\n\n38\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.590\nAll right, so hello packets\nare periodically sent to 224.0.0.5\n\n39\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.570\nto follow a CISCO every ten seconds,\nthat's a long time today.\n\n40\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.180\nWe certainly can lower these.\n\n41\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630\nBut again, we can have them\ndifferent between neighbors,\n\n42\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.600\nbut on a point to point between my\nneighbors they're gonna be the same.\n\n43\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.920\nI can have different over here, pretty\nmuch would set everything the same though.\n\n44\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.775\nRouters must agree on certain information\non directly connected neighbors before\n\n45\n00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:15.990\nthe create an adjacency.\n\n46\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.240\nAll right so OSPF uses hello packets,\nlink state advertisement type one,\n\n47\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.560\nto create adjacencies that maintain\nconnectivity with neighbor routers.\n\n48\n00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.790\nWe use the multicast address 224.0.0.5 and\nso\n\n49\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.000\nevery ten seconds we're\ngonna send a hello.\n\n50\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.478\nThese provide dynamic neighbor discovery,\nhello they maintain neighbor\n\n51\n00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:37.119\nrelationships, and the hello packets and\nother link state advertisements,\n\n52\n00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.292\nwell there's 11 different types\nof link state advertisements.\n\n53\n00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:43.750\nBut I have some good news for you, we\nonly have to learn five of them for ICD2.\n\n54\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.990\nBut when we get to CCMP then\nwe learn the other ones.\n\n55\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.450\nThese and the other ones.\n\n56\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.118\nSo these help build and\nmaintain the top logical database.\n\n57\n00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:58.750\nSo the RID, which is the router,\nhow we're known to the OSPF.\n\n58\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.890\nNow by default this is the highest\nIP address on any active interface\n\n59\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.680\nat the moment of OSPF start up.\n\n60\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.800\nHowever, there was a couple routers we had\nloop back interfaces set already, right?\n\n61\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.170\nSo if we remember the San Francisco and\n\n62\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.970\nLA routers, if you remember the lab,\nwe used loop back interfaces for EIRGP and\n\n63\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.140\nRIP and just our static route just\nto add extra networks into our lap.\n\n64\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.020\nWell, OSPF uses those to create the RID.\n\n65\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.370\nWe'll go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n66\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.540\nSo, loopback interfaces supersede and\noverride the highest IP address.\n\n67\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.990\nSo a lot of times when we are configuring\nOSPF we're going to go out and\n\n68\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.280\ncreate another logical grouping of\ninterfaces, loopback interfaces.\n\n69\n00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.300\nAnd this helped keep the network stable.\n\n70\n00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.120\nNow, there's another\nbetter way to do it now.\n\n71\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.200\nAnd I'm going to show you.\n\n72\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.930\nThat's the router ID under the process ID.\n\n73\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.810\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n74\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.740\nTo configure loopback interfaces.\n\n75\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.350\nAgain, these supersede\nthe highest IP address.\n\n76\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.410\nSo the RID is the number\nby which is known to OSPF.\n\n77\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.270\nBy default,\n\n78\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.770\nit's the highest IP address on any active\ninterface at the moment of OSPF startup.\n\n79\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.250\nSo if I had an interface down\nwith the high IP address.\n\n80\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.150\nAnd I said router OSPF1, press Enter.\n\n81\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970\nThen went to that interface,\ndid a no shut.\n\n82\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.890\nIt wouldn't be the RID.\n\n83\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.460\nI'd have to reload the router for\nthat to become the RID.\n\n84\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.590\nAgain, if I create a loopback interface.\n\n85\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.930\nWhich, most of us already\nknow how to do that.\n\n86\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.250\nWe've already shown that.\n\n87\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.270\nConfig T interface, and I'm just gonna\ntell LO zero, and that's loop back zero.\n\n88\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.490\nAnd then I put an IP address under that,\nor I have to do a no shut.\n\n89\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.360\nThat will become the rid if I start OSPF.\n\n90\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.670\nSo, before I start O-S-P-F I'm\ngonna create my rid,\n\n91\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.410\nthen say router O-S-P-F one,\nand that would become my rid.\n\n92\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.300\nIf I already did that then\nI could reload the router.\n\n93\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.070\nOr I will show you another way to do it.\n\n94\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.140\nRemember, once your rid is chosen\nuntil you restart the OSPF process.\n\n95\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.430\nSo we will just go out and\nturn off the OSPF, put it back on, and\n\n96\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.160\nthen that will give us our new RID.\n\n97\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.180\nNow, why would I want a RID?\n\n98\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.650\nThat is a really good question.\n\n99\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.082\nBecause, OSPF was built to be,\n\n100\n00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:03.850\nwas created to be built in really,\nreally, large internet.\n\n101\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.410\nNow if you have a small or\n\n102\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.680\nmedium sized network,\nwe're not even gonna worry about this.\n\n103\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.660\nJust let it run,\nit does fine in the background.\n\n104\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.690\nSo if I have a large core, and you know we\ndidn't have switches when OSPF came out.\n\n105\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.275\nSo routers ran everything.\n\n106\n00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.725\nI had hundreds or thousands of WAN links\ncoming into all these core routers,\n\n107\n00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.345\nwhich were connected\ntogether on a backbone.\n\n108\n00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:28.345\nAnd what would happen is, if a new router\ncame up, you know, it would send out,\n\n109\n00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:29.975\nhey, I'm here.\n\n110\n00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:33.785\nAnd then, you know, if all the routers\nresponded it would just crash the network,\n\n111\n00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:36.025\nyou know,\nwith their link state information.\n\n112\n00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.145\nRight, cuz that's what RIP would do.\n\n113\n00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:41.040\n[LAUGH]\nSo when they came up with OSPF they said,\n\n114\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.620\nlet's create someone that's gonna\nrespond to only one router and\n\n115\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.500\nthat's called the designated router,\nthe DR.\n\n116\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.330\nSo when we come up and we say,\nhey I'm a new router, it comes back and\n\n117\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.390\nresponds, the DR's gonna respond\nwith the link state information.\n\n118\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.530\nAll the other routers will see this and\nknow that responded to this new router.\n\n119\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.230\nSo we're gonna elect someone to talk.\n\n120\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.770\nNow these elections will only occur and\n\n121\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.490\nthis will only happen on broadcast\nmulti-access networks, i.e., ethernet.\n\n122\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.824\nWe had non-broadcast\nmulti-access networks,\n\n123\n00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:13.400\ni.e., frame relay, this didn't happen on.\n\n124\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.900\nAnd that doesn't happen\nalong serial links.\n\n125\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.710\nSo we won't see these elections.\n\n126\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.550\nWe do have Ethernet cord, so on everything\nthat we have an Ethernet backbone on,\n\n127\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.220\nanything that my router has an Ethernet\non, it's gonna try to do an election on\n\n128\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.392\nthere, thinking hey,\nI need to find out who the DR and BDR is.\n\n129\n00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:30.520\nAll right, so that's why we did it.\n\n130\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.560\nIt helped us work in really large internet\nworks without bringing the network down.\n\n131\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.450\nWe could add new routers, right.\n\n132\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.820\nAnd we can get our link state information.\n\n133\n00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.390\nSo let's go ahead and talk about\nthis a little bit more in depth.\n\n134\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.770\nSo to create the RID, so that asks why\ndo I wanna have a RID then, right?\n\n135\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.730\nSo we didn't answer that question.\n\n136\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.940\nWhoever has the highest RID would\nbecome the DR by default kind of.\n\n137\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.790\nThe point is that whoever\nhas the highest RID\n\n138\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.470\nif they start up at the exact time, right?\n\n139\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.690\nSo if this guy starts out before\nthis guy and talks to another guy.\n\n140\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.060\nAnd this guy comes up and\n\n141\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.130\nhas a higher RID, would they already\nhave an election even if they have it?\n\n142\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.140\nThis guy comes in and\nsays but I got a higher RID.\n\n143\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.100\nDoesn't matter.\n\n144\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.230\nSo, it's cumbersome to do this.\n\n145\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.640\nThis is why a lot pf people went out and\n\n146\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.760\nconfigured their RIDs before\nwe even start up OSPF.\n\n147\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.210\nRight, so\nagain OSPF takes another layer of design,\n\n148\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.740\nthen we're going to create RIDs for\neach router.\n\n149\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.040\nAnd what we're going to do though,\nis I'm going to show you here,\n\n150\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.430\nwe're going to do a /32 network\nbecause every single RID\n\n151\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.150\non a router would have to\nbe a different subnet.\n\n152\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.280\nSo, if I create a little\nloopback interface for\n\n153\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.100\nevery router,\nI'd have to do 172 16 30.0/24.\n\n154\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.960\nWell, I couldn't put\nanything in the 30 something\n\n155\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.110\nit somewhere else it would get\nduplicate RID Issues, right?\n\n156\n00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.510\nThat's another troubleshooting\nspot we're gonna get to.\n\n157\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.930\nDuplicate RIDs, that is an objective.\n\n158\n00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.331\nSo hold on to that thought.\n\n159\n00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:02.031\nNow so what we do is we're gonna go\non to the router process itself And\n\n160\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:07.431\nas OSPF is concerned,\nthis is a relatively new configuration,\n\n161\n00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.840\nbased on how old OSPF is.\n\n162\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.060\nThis is the way to do your rets.\n\n163\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.440\nSo, first off,\nI'm just gonna create a sub.\n\n164\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.860\nAnd let's say I had 100 routers.\n\n165\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.400\nI don't know, that's not a lot.\n\n166\n00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.160\nLet's say I had 100 routers.\n\n167\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.729\nI can just do a slash 24 network, right?\n\n168\n00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:25.720\nWhich is 172, 16, 172,\n31, 1.0 network, right?\n\n169\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.150\nAnd then I need the routers .1,\n.2, .3, .4.\n\n170\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.160\nWhen I put it under here,\nthere are each individual slash 32s,\n\n171\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.590\nso I can put it under a loop back as\na slash 32, or I can use this process ID.\n\n172\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.190\nThis is probably the easiest way to do\nit because then you will always see what\n\n173\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.070\nyour RIT is.\n\n174\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.310\nBut when you look at your process\nID it always shows your RIT.\n\n175\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.722\nAnd by the way,\nthat's how they do it on the objectives.\n\n176\n00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:46.710\nAll right?\n\n177\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.490\nSo if I come out here,\nlet's take a look real quick.\n\n178\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.940\nLet's go back out here for\na second, and let's see now,\n\n179\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.740\nI'm gonna come out here, and\nI'm gonna say show IPO OSPF.\n\n180\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.270\nAnd my RID notice is 30.0, isn't it?\n\n181\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.400\nWell, if you remember something,\nI created that loopback with 30.0,\n\n182\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.220\nI don't know if this would be my RID.\n\n183\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.930\nI might have another higher IP address.\n\n184\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.640\nMaybe I wouldn't have, but\nnonetheless, the RID is always,\n\n185\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.600\nI'm sorry, the loopback interface IP\naddress is always gonna be the RID.\n\n186\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.940\nAlways, right?\n\n187\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.310\nWhen you start OSPF.\n\n188\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.450\nNow again, you create the loopback\nafter OSPF is already created,\n\n189\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.720\nthen it's not gonna become the RID until\nyou reboot the router or clear the OSPF.\n\n190\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.280\nSo now, if I came under here and I did\nthis, and I said config T, router OSPF.\n\n191\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.850\nNow isn't it nice that I\nremember my process ID?\n\n192\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.620\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n193\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.416\nSo, because if not, I'd have to look.\n\n194\n00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:43.830\nWell, remember, it's up here with OSPF1.\n\n195\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.530\nBut let me tell you something.\n\n196\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.720\nIf you make them all different,\nbecause you're trying to be creative,\n\n197\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.070\nyou're just gonna be in for\na world for hurt, right?\n\n198\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.510\nIf you said I wanna make every one\ndifferent cuz it feels good, that's fine,\n\n199\n00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.700\njust wait til you have to troubleshoot and\nyou're in a hurry.\n\n200\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.320\nAll right.\n\n201\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.361\nRouter OSPF1.\n\n202\n00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:02.840\nCheck this out,\nthis is your exam objective here.\n\n203\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.520\nThe RIDs are gonna be\nunderneath the process ID.\n\n204\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.518\nNow, check this out, I do 1.1.1.1.\n\n205\n00:10:08.518 --> 00:10:13.224\nNow, this isn't my RID right now because\nit says, hey, you gotta reload the router.\n\n206\n00:10:13.224 --> 00:10:14.530\nOr you could do this.\n\n207\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.660\nIt says clear.\n\n208\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.790\nThis is a better way to do it.\n\n209\n00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.380\nNow, this is gonna bring routing\ndown on this router, but\n\n210\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.870\nit's faster than reloading the router.\n\n211\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.790\nWould you agree?\n\n212\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.090\nNow, OSPF takes a few minutes for\na routing to come back up.\n\n213\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.450\nYou've gotta build your neighbor table,\n\n214\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.870\ntopological database,\nrebuild your routing table.\n\n215\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.810\nThis isn't an easy process.\n\n216\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.330\nIt's gonna take a few minutes for\nit to talk to its neighbor and\n\n217\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.650\ncreate its adjacencies.\n\n218\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.640\nSo you are going to bring routing\ndown on here if you do this.\n\n219\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.170\nIs it really important you\nchange your RID right now?\n\n220\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.090\nYou gotta keep that in mind.\n\n221\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.110\nProbably not.\n\n222\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.210\nClear your IP OSPF.\n\n223\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.660\nI gotta do a do,\nbecause I'm in router process right?\n\n224\n00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.940\nDo clear IP OSPF process command.\n\n225\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.840\nNow, let me tell you something,\n\n226\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.520\nthis is faster,\na lot faster than reloading the router.\n\n227\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.440\nOkay, and it says reset.\n\n228\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.775\nNo, you don't want to do that.\n\n229\n00:10:58.775 --> 00:10:59.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes I do.\n\n230\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.450\nNow, it didn't ask me do you want to save.\n\n231\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.260\nIt's not reloading the router.\n\n232\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.010\nIt's going out to redoing it,\nresetting my RID.\n\n233\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.810\nI really,\nhighly recommend setting your router IDs\n\n234\n00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.260\nbefore you configure your interfaces\nwith OSPF or your network statement.\n\n235\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.520\nGet them all set.\n\n236\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.770\nDo your processes.\n\n237\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.120\nDo your RIDS, right?\n\n238\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.290\nThis is, again,\nanother layer of design, guys.\n\n239\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.390\nReally need to consider your RIDs, who's\ngonna be your DR, this is a way to do it.\n\n240\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.043\nI'm not saying.\n\n241\n00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:29.793\nIt's a way, all right?\n\n242\n00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:31.100\nGo ahead.\n>> So, Todd.\n\n243\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.106\nIf I set a router ID and then I\nhappen to go back in for testing and\n\n244\n00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:39.940\nset a loopback address,\nwhich one of those becomes my RID?\n\n245\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.940\n>> That's a really good question,\nthat's a good objective question.\n\n246\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.620\nLet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n247\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.370\nSo he went right into my next slide,\nit's like he knew it was coming.\n\n248\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Did you know it was coming?\n\n249\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.360\nWere you looking at my slides?\n\n250\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.928\n>> I did not.\n\n251\n00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:52.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n252\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.790\nNow, if I look at this slide it say's,\nwhich is the RID of R1?.\n\n253\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.870\nWell, take a look here for a second.\n\n254\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.150\nFirst off, I see loopbacks, I'm not\neven gonna consider physical interfaces,\n\n255\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.930\nonly loopbacks, if they're in here.\n\n256\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.540\nAll right?\n\n257\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.690\nNow, you'd have to see a question that\nstates this, you set a loopback and\n\n258\n00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.810\nthen started OSPF process, right?\n\n259\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.410\nOr you start it, you create a loopback and\nreloaded the router.\n\n260\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.260\nIt would have to say\nsomething like that or\n\n261\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.860\nyou'd be like, well,\nI'm not sure how to answer this.\n\n262\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.830\nDid you reload the router after\nyou created the loopback, right?\n\n263\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.530\nThey gotta tell you.\n\n264\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.620\nThe loopback RID will not take effect\nunless the OSPF process is restarted again\n\n265\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.250\nsomehow, reload or clear IP OSPF process.\n\n266\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.040\nIn this case here, it's the highest\nIP address of any loopback interface.\n\n267\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.730\nNotice I have two,\nthis is my RID right here.\n\n268\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.320\nNow, that being said,\nbased on what Ronnie just said,\n\n269\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.390\nthe RID is determined one of\nthree ways in this order.\n\n270\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.420\nIf I have a router-ID and\na process-ID, that's my RID.\n\n271\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.720\nAgain, if I've reset my process-ID, right?\n\n272\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.870\nSo, I'm going to set my process-ID.\n\n273\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.920\nInteresting enough, check this out.\n\n274\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.160\nIf I say router OSPF1 and then RID,\nit's gonna come back and say, well,\n\n275\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.730\nyou already started it.\n\n276\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.490\nWe already chose your RID based\non your highest IP address.\n\n277\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.960\nSo you're gonna have to clear it,\nwhich is fine.\n\n278\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.332\nIt's gonna do nothing,\ncuz you have no network statements.\n\n279\n00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:09.760\nThen, create your network statements,\nyour RID is chosen.\n\n280\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.560\nSo, kind of an odd process,\nbut that's how it's done.\n\n281\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.410\nThat's what I highly recommend.\n\n282\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.460\nThat's what you'll see on the objectives.\n\n283\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.120\nNow, if you don't see that, then you're\ngonna look for a loopback interface.\n\n284\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.740\nSo, the first thing you check for\nis router ID.\n\n285\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.550\nThen check for a loopback interface.\n\n286\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.570\nIf you don't see that,\n\n287\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.240\nthen it's gonna be the highest IP\naddress of any active interface.\n\n288\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.190\nBe careful!\n\n289\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.350\nSo, I think we have one up here.\n\n290\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.490\nWell, I don't think any\nof these were shut down.\n\n291\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.070\nBut verify before you choose an interface\nif it was shut down, all right?\n\n292\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.850\nSo, details, my friends.\n\n293\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.395\nNow wait, wait, what happens if\nI say I don't care about RIDs,\n\n294\n00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:45.230\nI just wanna be king.\n\n295\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.400\nCan't I just be king?\n\n296\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.110\nWithout having to have an election?\n\n297\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.210\nDo I really have to be\ninvolved in all this?\n\n298\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.800\nThe answer is not really.\n\n299\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.830\nI can some in here and\nchange my party, check this out.\n\n300\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.000\nThis is the command you'll use for\ntrouble shooting.\n\n301\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.605\nShow IP OPSF interface,\nlook at my priorities.\n\n302\n00:14:00.605 --> 00:14:02.870\nFirst off, I am a DR my priority is one.\n\n303\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.926\nNow, the priorities go from zero to 255.\n\n304\n00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:07.290\n255 means I'm always king.\n\n305\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.860\nZero means I am not in\nthe election process.\n\n306\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.470\nOne is the default,\ntwo means I win, right?\n\n307\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.890\nAnything higher, I automatically win.\n\n308\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.950\nBut wait, so we have an election, right?\n\n309\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:23.190\nAnd they win, now just because I stand\nup there and say but I'm better, right?\n\n310\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.650\nThat would be easy to say today.\n\n311\n00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.260\nBut I'm better than what's out there.\n\n312\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.020\nNo one cares,\nbecause someone's already been elected, so\n\n313\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.570\nwe have to get rid of them, right?\n\n314\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.890\nSo we have to go, you have to actually\nshut down the interfaces you're connected\n\n315\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.610\nto, the DR BDR,\non that broadcast multi-access network.\n\n316\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.320\nYou have to actually shut them\ndown to have another election.\n\n317\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.650\nNow, you can force another election,\nright?\n\n318\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.290\nThat's easy, I just bring this guy, change\nthe party, he comes up and goes I'm king,\n\n319\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.120\nI'm party.\n\n320\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.160\nAnd the two routers that are elected,\nDR and BDR backup,\n\n321\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.790\nare gonna go that's nice, and ignore,\nand they'll stay as DR and BDR.\n\n322\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.470\nSo you have to actually shut down their\ninterfaces on that Ethernet LAN, and\n\n323\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.030\nthen this router becomes DR,\nthen you can bring them back up, okay?\n\n324\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.540\nThat's the only way to do it.\n\n325\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.260\nAnd this is a way to do it,\n\n326\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.900\nbest thing is to do to set the RIDs\nbefore you configure OSPF.\n\n327\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.390\nNow, remember our wildcards,\nwe have to, I did\n\n328\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:20.150\nmy last configuration with 0.0.0.0,\nor 0.0.255.255.\n\n329\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:25.720\nIn other words, I didn't use any inverse\nmask that were creative of any way, right?\n\n330\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.610\nBecause I was choosing the whole\ninterface saying match exactly or\n\n331\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.330\nbe any value, right?\n\n332\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.275\nNow, you're going to see things on\nthe objective that are not any value and\n\n333\n00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:37.420\nthey say let's say let's do a block size,\nlet's choose a block size.\n\n334\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.467\nNow, remember, let's take a look here.\n\n335\n00:15:39.467 --> 00:15:43.810\nRemember the wild card address is always\nless, one less than the block size.\n\n336\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.460\nSo we saw this with access list.\n\n337\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.460\nI even used it with EIGRP a little bit,\nalthough you don't have to.\n\n338\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.653\nWe did it cuz it was fun.\n\n339\n00:15:49.653 --> 00:15:52.636\nNow, in this case here,\nwhat this says here,\n\n340\n00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:56.616\nis you type in not the interface name,\nyou type in the subnet.\n\n341\n00:15:56.616 --> 00:16:00.847\nSo, in this case here, I'm in the fourth\noctet with 192.168.10 network.\n\n342\n00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:04.944\nAnd I'm saying, this is subnet ten and\nit's a block size of four.\n\n343\n00:16:04.944 --> 00:16:07.602\nSo I say,\ngo find something that start with A,\n\n344\n00:16:07.602 --> 00:16:11.770\nhas a block size of four, and\nplace it into area zero, so any interface.\n\n345\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.880\nSo, I'm actually just\napplying the subnets.\n\n346\n00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.940\nNow, do you have to do this?\n\n347\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.050\nI mean, does this make it better,\nmore efficient?\n\n348\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.170\nNo, it makes your configuration\nlook a lot harder, so\n\n349\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.500\nmaybe they can't lay you off as easily,\nI don't know.\n\n350\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.520\nRight, so when they look at that and\n\n351\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.870\ngo, we can't get rid of that\nguy it's really complex.\n\n352\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.790\nI don't understand that.\n\n353\n00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.050\nI don't know why I would do this.\n\n354\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.130\nBut anyways, you either know your\ninterface IPs or you're not.\n\n355\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.100\nSo, basically what you're doing is,\nyou're configuring all these ospf's in.\n\n356\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.840\nWell I know these subnets are going\nto be on these interfaces.\n\n357\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.560\nI just haven't decided what\nthe IPs are gonna be yet.\n\n358\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.850\nNow that's a pretty weird statement,\nbut I suppose that's what it is.\n\n359\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.830\nNow this is going to be,\ncheck this out 8 to 11, but you're right.\n\n360\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.990\nWait a minute, subnet 8,\nyou can't use 8, 11's the broadcast.\n\n361\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.940\nNot necessarily, check this out, because\nI could actually have a larger block.\n\n362\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.430\nAnd say I want any interface form 8 to 11,\nmaybe that's something else, right?\n\n363\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.950\nThen maybe that's a block of 16, so just\nbecause I'm saying It's a block of four.\n\n364\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.320\nDoesn't mean that it's actually\nsubnet of slash thirty here.\n\n365\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.960\nIt could be a slash twenty eight.\n\n366\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.750\nDoes that make sense that I'm\nsaying use this block of four?\n\n367\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.980\nCould it be anything in\nthese four addresses?\n\n368\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.340\nThat is intense, I get that.\n\n369\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.230\nI mean, but, I don't recommend\ndoing something like that.\n\n370\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.350\nThat is really outside and\nthat's even above detectives.\n\n371\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.990\nAll right, but in this case here,\nI've got a 48 with a block size of 16.\n\n372\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:33.690\nSo, it's going to be any interface from 48\nto 63 is going to be placed into area 1.\n\n373\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.380\nSo I'm doing this, saying,\ngive me a range of interfaces.\n\n374\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.390\nNow this is kind of weird, because I'm\nsaying this could cross subnet boundaries.\n\n375\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.150\nAny interface from 48 to 63,\n\n376\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.800\nI don't care what subnet it's in\nIts going to be placed in area 1.\n\n377\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.230\nThese are pretty broad,\n\n378\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.930\nIm not sure if i would do something like\nthis in cross multiples subnet, right?\n\n379\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.610\nBecause really,\nim just saying go find this interface,\n\n380\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.770\nI dont care what subnet its in, I just\nwant that interface number in the area 1.\n\n381\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.460\nIn this case here, its even broader,\n\n382\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.140\n96 and 32, could be 96 into 127 Right?\n\n383\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.340\nAgain, typically I wouldn't do that.\n\n384\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.700\nI would choose the subnet and\n\n385\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.190\nthen, it would let it choose the IP\naddresses within that subnet.\n\n386\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.200\nBut again, it doesn't have to be,\nI can just choose\n\n387\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.170\na broad block size of interfaces and\napply it this way.\n\n388\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.770\n128 this block size 64, so\nI want to go 128 to 191, right?\n\n389\n00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.400\nSo, that is a way to do it.\n\n390\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.340\nThis is a way to put them in.\n\n391\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.970\nThis is a really broad way.\n\n392\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.900\nI probably don't recommend\ndoing it like this.\n\n393\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.630\nYou can do it this way.\n\n394\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.750\nYou very well may see it\non the objectives that way.\n\n395\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.370\nThat's why I'm going to show it this way.\n\n396\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.560\nYou can play with it like this,\nbut when you do it in productions,\n\n397\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.496\nit might be hard to troubleshoot, right?\n\n398\n00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:54.170\nBecause you're going to be looking at it,\ngoing, well,\n\n399\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.260\nwhat interfaces am I actually\ntalking about here, right?\n\n400\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.910\nSo I actually recommend now, when we\ndo ospf putting them on the interfaces.\n\n401\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.460\nBecause when I look at my interfaces,\nI know what they connect to and\n\n402\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.150\nwhat area they are in.\n\n403\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.800\nAnd I really don't care\nabout IP addresses.\n\n404\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.960\nI don't care about network statements or\nanything like that.\n\n405\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.140\nThat might be a better way to go today.\n\n406\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.870\nBut I have to show you always, because\nall of these are on the objectives, okay?\n\n407\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.300\nOkay, now so\nbased on what you just found outm\n\n408\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.490\nI guess we'll test Ronnie here since\nyou guys aren't going to respond.\n\n409\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.890\nRonnie what interface,\nbecause I don't know what subnet this is.\n\n410\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.860\nMaybe it's a /24 and I'm going to\nuse this network statement and\n\n411\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.950\nsay although I have a /24\nwhen I show a 6812.\n\n412\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.759\nI only want some of these interfaces,\nNTB into area 0.\n\n413\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.427\n>> Into area 0?\n\n414\n00:19:43.427 --> 00:19:45.489\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n415\n00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:45.989\nSee?\n>> Yep.\n\n416\n00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:52.480\n>> So I have the starting address.\n\n417\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.500\n>> Okay.\n>> And it's a block size of what?\n\n418\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.440\n>> It should be 64.\n\n419\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.490\n>> So it's going to be what?\n\n420\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.900\n>> 64 through 127.\n\n421\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.130\n>> Right and typically, I'm going to\nchoose the numbers in-between those.\n\n422\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.010\nI'm typically not going to\ncreate this broad address.\n\n423\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.650\nAnd I couldn't really\nput a slash 24 on here,\n\n424\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.480\nbecause all of these interfaces\nhave to be in different subnets.\n\n425\n00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.480\nI'm sure you're aware of that but\nI'm just making a point.\n\n426\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.280\nSo what do you think, Ronnie?\n\n427\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.400\nSo it's going to be anything\nbetween 64 and 127.\n\n428\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.710\nSo it's going to be here.\n\n429\n00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.620\n>> Right.\n\n430\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.020\n>> This one\n>> Serial 0?\n\n431\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.410\n>> And then ,Serial 0.1 subinterface 102\n>> Yup, then 102, yup.\n\n432\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.692\n>> Those three interfaces right?\n\n433\n00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:29.420\nOkay, now as I showed\nyou earlier in the lab,\n\n434\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.740\nI can do this and you are going\nto see this on the objectives.\n\n435\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.840\nYou are going to see OSPF\nconfigured under the interfaces.\n\n436\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.300\nThis is probably the most efficient\n\n437\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.160\nway to do it today,because it's harder\nto script the network statements.\n\n438\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.700\nAnd when you're troubleshooting, if you\nwere very broad like I just showed you,\n\n439\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.280\nwhich is still an objective.\n\n440\n00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.300\nYou're not really sure which\ninterfaces you're talking about.\n\n441\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.760\nYou have to actually go do a show IP\ninterface brief and then verify it, right?\n\n442\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.900\nAnd then this way here, I know right away,\n\n443\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.690\nand usually troubleshooting\nwhen you're in a hurry, right?\n\n444\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.010\nIt's pretty rare that you're\ntroubleshooting and you're not in a hurry.\n\n445\n00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.990\nYou know, so, notice I created ospf,\nprocess one, all right.\n\n446\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.740\nThis is going to match here, all right.\n\n447\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.890\nOspf 1 and I put the R-id underneath here.\n\n448\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.540\nSo, we're going to get to this\nwhen we get to troubleshoot and\n\n449\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.760\nwe're going to come back to this.\n\n450\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.360\nNotice, there's a hello statement in here.\n\n451\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.878\nWe changed the hello timer, right.\n\n452\n00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:21.470\nWe checked our subnet, here's my area id,\nmy process id, and then my rit.\n\n453\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.460\nNow, let's talk about\nthe exchange protocol.\n\n454\n00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.020\nWe do have to understand our link state\nadvertisements areas one through five.\n\n455\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.660\nI'm sorry link state advertisements\none through five, okay.\n\n456\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.926\nSo we know that we have our area,\nautonomous system boarder router.\n\n457\n00:21:35.926 --> 00:21:41.950\nWe have our normal router inside of\nan area and that's what these are here.\n\n458\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.950\nAnd then we have our ABRs,\nour area border routers.\n\n459\n00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:52.580\nSo, leasing advertisements type one,\nhere is the status of my links.\n\n460\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.210\nSo we're basically going to flood within\nour area directly connected neighbors and\n\n461\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.420\ntell them information.\n\n462\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.451\nWe're going to give them our hellos.\n\n463\n00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:02.250\nWe went through this,\nwe got our hellos and dead timers.\n\n464\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.967\nInside there, we have our RIDs, right.\n\n465\n00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:06.590\nOur authentication if we're using that.\n\n466\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.510\nSo if we had single area,\nhere's a benefit for the objectives.\n\n467\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:17.520\nSingle area OSPF reduces the type of LSAs\nneeded and reduces, so we have less LSAs.\n\n468\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.510\nWe only have a couple, right?\n\n469\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.750\nBut so, if I had multiple errors,\nI'm going to have at least five and\n\n470\n00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.980\nthen, if I have LSAs, we're not\ngoing to need virtual links, either.\n\n471\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.945\nYou really shouldn't use virtual links,\nto begin with.\n\n472\n00:22:29.945 --> 00:22:35.110\nSo but anyways, the type ones do not\ngo across area border routers, right?\n\n473\n00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.350\nThey're only within their area, and\nthey type, they talk within there.\n\n474\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.550\nSo, let's take a look at the other one.\n\n475\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.490\nOkay, so taking a look at here, remember\nwe have our type one, these are hellos.\n\n476\n00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.370\nRouter LSA's,\nthey're going to be communicating between\n\n477\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.910\neveryone in your area, right,\nall routers in your area.\n\n478\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.770\nThen the network LSA's, are going\nto come from inside your area, but\n\n479\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.660\nfrom your designated router, so\nwe're back at designated routers.\n\n480\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.380\nAnd they're going to communicate but\nnot outside your area.\n\n481\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.350\nSo remember, that they only happen\non broadcast multi access networks.\n\n482\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.070\nNow the type threes are going to come from\n\n483\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.460\narea border routers like Corp router\nhere is my area border router.\n\n484\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.250\nThis would be an APR over here.\n\n485\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.330\nSo the type threes would come here and\n\n486\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.040\ntell each other about other\nnetworks outside of the area.\n\n487\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.140\nThe autonomous system.\n\n488\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.600\nThis is gonna tell, this is a Type\n4 that comes from the ABR but\n\n489\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.670\nit tells us how to get to the ASBR.\n\n490\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:33.220\nAnd the autonomous system LSA is going\nto advertise external routes, okay.\n\n491\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.510\nSo, we need to remember that.\n\n492\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.730\nSo, eespecially the Type 5.\n\n493\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.710\nWhat advertises our external routes?\n\n494\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.000\nRASBR type five.\n\n495\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.640\nNow our neighbor states, now this is,\nI mean there's quite a few states here,\n\n496\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.440\nguys, and we do have to understand them.\n\n497\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.590\nAnd I've gotten some information in here,\nbut you do have to read my book on this.\n\n498\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.307\nNow I haven't gone through and said,\nhey go through these videos and\n\n499\n00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:56.176\nthen read my book for more detail.\n\n500\n00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:58.354\nBut I've got to be honest with you, for\n\n501\n00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:01.788\nOSPF They are going to drill you\non OSPF on some of the details.\n\n502\n00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:04.425\nYou have got to get down in to\nthe nitty gritty on that chapter, okay?\n\n503\n00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:07.382\nSo, watching this video and\nreading the book Again,\n\n504\n00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:10.284\nwatching a video is not\ngonna get you a CCNA, right?\n\n505\n00:24:10.284 --> 00:24:13.706\nWatching a video's gonna really help,\nI've gone through a lot of great stuff for\n\n506\n00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:14.730\nthe objectives.\n\n507\n00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.120\nBut you really still need some\nmore details or recommend a book,\n\n508\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.180\nmine or whatever, but let's take\na look here at the neighbor states.\n\n509\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.850\nWe're gonna understand the neighbor\nstates, get to two-way state, and\n\n510\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.410\nthen see what happens after that.\n\n511\n00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.480\nSo the first thing is all\nrouters start in a down state.\n\n512\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.430\nThat means we received a hello packet but\nwe haven't seen the rid yet, right.\n\n513\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.580\nSo all routers start in down state.\n\n514\n00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.384\nOkay, so no hello packets\nreceived on the interface.\n\n515\n00:24:39.384 --> 00:24:45.601\nNow the init state means I received\nthe hello and I've got [COUGH] the rid.\n\n516\n00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:47.800\nSo the two way state says\nwe've exchanged hellos,\n\n517\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.499\nwe now understand each others' rids.\n\n518\n00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:53.420\nAt this point,\nwe can then have a election for the RBDR.\n\n519\n00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.035\nNot all routers will go past this point,\n\n520\n00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:58.457\nif you're not on a broadcast multi-access\npoint, you're just gonna stay in two way\n\n521\n00:24:58.457 --> 00:25:01.327\nstate at this point because we're\nnot gonna have an election, right?\n\n522\n00:25:01.327 --> 00:25:04.088\nNow, once we get past two way state,\nso I want you to think about,\n\n523\n00:25:04.088 --> 00:25:06.767\nremember our Bob and Sally analogy\nthat we used a long time ago?\n\n524\n00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:09.380\nYou know Bob's always trying to\ngo out with Sally or whatever.\n\n525\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.970\nSally doesn't really like Bob,\nbut anyways, in this case,\n\n526\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.235\nhere, Bob goes onto Match.com or\nFarmer's Only, whatever.\n\n527\n00:25:15.235 --> 00:25:16.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Sally gets him, and\n\n528\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.740\nhe has a different name.\n\n529\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.280\nWell, he's saying all the right stuff to\nSally, and Sally's like, okay, let's meet.\n\n530\n00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.380\nSo at this point, here,\nshe's made a date with Bob.\n\n531\n00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.570\nAll right, that's where we're at.\n\n532\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.090\nSo we haven't gotten\nany further than that.\n\n533\n00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.960\nLet's take a look at what\nhappens when they meet.\n\n534\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.470\nSo now they're at Starbucks or\nwhatever, and they get in and\n\n535\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.380\nthey're gonna do what's called the Exstart\nstate, so are we gonna go out any further?\n\n536\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:49.760\nSally sees that it's Bob and says, no,\nBob, you have too small of an MTU, maximum\n\n537\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.230\ntransmission unit, and she never gets out\nof Exstart state and then she leaves.\n\n538\n00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.690\nNow you will never forget this.\n\n539\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.640\nWhy won't you get out of Exstart state?\n\n540\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.020\nBob's MTU is too small and\nSally knows it and\n\n541\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.770\nshe's not gonna go on a date\nwith this guy, all right.\n\n542\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.340\nSo anyways, now Sally goes back to\nfarmers.com or Christian Mingle or\n\n543\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.210\nwhatever it is, finds someone with\nan MTU that she thinks is matching her\n\n544\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.490\nexpectations here, and\nthen they're gonna get past Exstart state.\n\n545\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.301\nYou okay there, buddy?\n\n546\n00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:19.714\n[LAUGH] And at this point,\n\n547\n00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:23.289\nthey're gonna start exchanging\ntheir link state databases.\n\n548\n00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:24.045\nAll right?\n\n549\n00:26:24.045 --> 00:26:28.295\nNow, you might think that analogy is kind\nof rudimentary, or something like that.\n\n550\n00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:30.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you're not gonna forget this.\n\n551\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.980\nWhy won't we get out of Exstart state?\n\n552\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.190\nThe MTUs don't match.\n\n553\n00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.070\nAll right?\n\n554\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.630\nExchange state, now we're gonna\nexchange the link state database, and\n\n555\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.520\nthen we're gonna acknowledge that.\n\n556\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.820\nAnd then we're gonna load the link\nstates into our topological database.\n\n557\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.040\nNow if there's something\nI need to understand,\n\n558\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.120\nremember, I don't just find out about\nmy directly connected neighbors,\n\n559\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.220\nI find out about their neighbors and\nwhat they're directly connected to and\n\n560\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.570\nI'm gonna ask for specific link state\ninformation about these networks.\n\n561\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:27:01.440\nI find out, I go to the source,\nI don't route by rumor like rip, right?\n\n562\n00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.600\nSo we find out all the information.\n\n563\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.410\nAt this point here, Sally and\nSteve now, cuz she got rid of Bob,\n\n564\n00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.835\nnow they're gonna get married and they're\ngonna acknowledge this, they have their\n\n565\n00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:15.230\nlink state databases, everything matches\nand they live happily ever after.\n\n566\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.190\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n567\n00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.570\nNow we're in something called full state.\n\n568\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.210\nOkay?\n\n569\n00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.930\nSo how does it go?\n\n570\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.860\nOnce we get from down state,\nthere's actually another state in here\n\n571\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.570\nthat I kind of skip because it's only\nif you're on a non-broadcast network,\n\n572\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.460\nwhich we don't really necessarily\nhave that much of anymore.\n\n573\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.810\nDefinitely going to a NIT state where\nwe're changing, we go into two way states.\n\n574\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.930\nIf we decide to go further,\nwe're gonna have elections.\n\n575\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.020\nWe're on a broadcast multi-access network.\n\n576\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.520\nThen what we're gonna go into Exstart.\n\n577\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.750\nOnce we decide that our MTUs match, we're\ngonna exchange our link state databases.\n\n578\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.130\nRight, we're gonna acknowledge that and\nthen we're going to go ahead and\n\n579\n00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.010\nload our topological databases.\n\n580\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.500\nOnce that, we're gonna send\nthe link state request for\n\n581\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.960\nthings that we don't understand.\n\n582\n00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.410\nWe're gonna get the link state updates,\nand we're gonna end up in full state.\n\n583\n00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.364\nYou need to understand, Exstart.\n\n584\n00:28:03.364 --> 00:28:09.365\nSo once we're past two way state, you go\nExstart, Exchange, Loading and Full, okay?\n\n585\n00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:11.758\nExstart, Exchange, Loading and Full.\n\n586\n00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:14.480\nAll right, so\nwe can see this with the show.\n\n587\n00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.470\nNow so, if I come back here,\nhold on, let's go and take a look.\n\n588\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.010\nOops the other way.\n\n589\n00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.176\nOkay, so I'm gonna come out to you guys,\nI'm at user mode.\n\n590\n00:28:24.176 --> 00:28:28.930\nShow IP OSPF neighbor, right?\n\n591\n00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.380\nSo we can see that we're\nin full state here.\n\n592\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.510\nThese guys came in.\n\n593\n00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.740\nThey're actually in full state.\n\n594\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.040\nYou know that they're serials,\nand they didn't have an election.\n\n595\n00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.360\nWe did go by, you see the dashes here.\n\n596\n00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.870\nThat means they're serial links.\n\n597\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.460\nSo this guy actually isn't a serial\nlink but he's showing up as one.\n\n598\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.940\nHe must be,\nhe's coming across the serial link.\n\n599\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.560\nAll right.\n\n600\n00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.700\nNotice the priorities are set to 0 here,\nthey should be 1 by default.\n\n601\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.550\nSo I'm must have changed\nthem at one point.\n\n602\n00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.375\nBut the priorities,\n\n603\n00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:56.290\nremember, before the election means, we're\nnot involved in the election process,\n\n604\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:00.320\nthat's because they're coming across\nthe serial link so the priority's 0.\n\n605\n00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.190\nLet's go up to one that has\na show ip ospf neighbor.\n\n606\n00:29:07.475 --> 00:29:12.810\nOkay, I should have LAN interface\nshow IP and what happened to my LANs?\n\n607\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.492\nSomeone stole my LANs.\n\n608\n00:29:14.492 --> 00:29:16.486\n>> [LAUGH] I know they're\nall strung at the serial.\n\n609\n00:29:16.486 --> 00:29:21.800\n>> It says [INAUDIBLE] zero zero.\n\n610\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.340\nWhat?\n\n611\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.905\nI don't have a neighbor on there.\n\n612\n00:29:24.905 --> 00:29:29.005\nOkay, so I add to the new neighbor for\nour [LAUGH] and I didn't add him so\n\n613\n00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:30.008\nlet's do this.\n\n614\n00:29:30.008 --> 00:29:32.288\nHe is 20, right?\n\n615\n00:29:32.288 --> 00:29:37.005\nSo I'm gonna say on here of\nconfig t interface.ccn01.\n\n616\n00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:37.530\nLet's do it this way.\n\n617\n00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.719\nI'm in a hurry, I don't have the subnet,\nI don't know what are codes are,\n\n618\n00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:47.197\nIPOSPF1 area, let's make them 1 and\nthe other side will be 1.\n\n619\n00:29:47.197 --> 00:29:48.500\nI had to make the other side a 1.\n\n620\n00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.660\nI don't have the adjacency.\n\n621\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.121\nThis interface isn't gonna come up.\n\n622\n00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:55.071\nSo notice it says, the other guy is\nactually configured in the area 0.\n\n623\n00:29:55.071 --> 00:29:58.656\nSo notice it's saying, hey man,\nI'm getting something from another area,\n\n624\n00:29:58.656 --> 00:30:00.460\nand it's not a virtual link.\n\n625\n00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.960\nI am really unhappy.\n\n626\n00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.790\nSo I'm gonna have to go and\nfix that, okay.\n\n627\n00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:09.130\nSo let's change him to 0 and\nsee if he pops up.\n\n628\n00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.088\nCuz received invalid\npackage mismatch area 0.\n\n629\n00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:18.840\nNow, remember [LAUGH] here's the idea\nthat CISCO goes, hey, what's the problem?\n\n630\n00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.020\nWhy aren't these guys\nforming an adjacency?\n\n631\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.810\nWell, most of the time, if you just watch\nthis, OSPF is gonna tell you, right?\n\n632\n00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.740\nWrong area, wrong whatever,\nduplicate RIDs, and stuff like that.\n\n633\n00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.756\nIt gives you all that information.\n\n634\n00:30:31.756 --> 00:30:35.350\nDo show IP, OSPF neighbor,\nlet's see if that worked.\n\n635\n00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.990\nI'm gonna have to go\nlook at the other side.\n\n636\n00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.620\nLet's go do it.\n\n637\n00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.410\nSince I'm out here.\n\n638\n00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.724\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n639\n00:30:43.724 --> 00:30:46.232\nOkay, there's the 20.2, he's down.\n\n640\n00:30:46.232 --> 00:30:47.868\nThat might be why.\n\n641\n00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.420\nOkay, let's see if I get some loops here.\n\n642\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.366\nThat should've come up.\n\n643\n00:30:58.366 --> 00:31:00.320\nOkay, that came up,\npassed ethernet came up.\n\n644\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.150\nLet's see if, and\nthen I have to go in there and say IP,\n\n645\n00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.993\nOSPF area, let's set it to 1.\n\n646\n00:31:07.993 --> 00:31:09.020\nLet's set them to one.\n\n647\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.330\nI forgot my process ID.\n\n648\n00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:19.530\nI'll come back to this guy and\nsay IP OSPF 1 area 1, okay?\n\n649\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.020\nNow, we should pop up if they\nwere connected, I think they are.\n\n650\n00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.100\nFind out here in a heartbeat.\n\n651\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.690\nHe's not.\n\n652\n00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.620\nThey're not connected in that way.\n\n653\n00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.440\nAll right, I'm gonna, I thought\nthat they were off that interface.\n\n654\n00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.111\nMaybe I'm wrong.\n\n655\n00:31:34.111 --> 00:31:41.465\nShow, show cdpneighbor.\n\n656\n00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:45.200\nOkay, it's to be two off fast ethernet 00.\n\n657\n00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.420\nFast ethernet three.\n\n658\n00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.980\nReceived invalid packet mismatch.\n\n659\n00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.860\nArea id must be verselink.\n\n660\n00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.360\nHm.\n\n661\n00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.691\nOkay, hold on.\n\n662\n00:31:55.691 --> 00:31:59.203\nInterface, where were we?\n\n663\n00:31:59.203 --> 00:32:02.395\n>> E3?\n\n664\n00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:04.095\n>> IPOSPF.\n\n665\n00:32:04.095 --> 00:32:09.439\nAreas ip ospf 1 area 0,\nnow here is the thing guys,\n\n666\n00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:17.080\nwhan you have a problem, okay,\nwhen you have a problem, you fix it.\n\n667\n00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.300\nBecause of things like this, right, I'm\nsitting here trying to type and your like,\n\n668\n00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.460\nI can just leave that, I don't care.\n\n669\n00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.410\nYes you do!\n\n670\n00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:27.390\nOkay, ip ospf1 area 0.\n\n671\n00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.285\nOkay.\n\n672\n00:32:28.285 --> 00:32:31.710\nI see it as neighbor down.\n\n673\n00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.550\nOkay so we're in down state, right.\n\n674\n00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.420\nNice.\n\n675\n00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.250\nShow ip ospf neighbor, okay?\n\n676\n00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.920\nThere, so we're starting\nwe're finding something here.\n\n677\n00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.770\nAll right, it's 20.1.\n\n678\n00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.099\nHe's in two way state and it's a druther.\n\n679\n00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.300\nSo we might not go any further than that.\n\n680\n00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:55.000\nRemember I set my rid to 1.1.1.1 on there?\n\n681\n00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.583\nSo we're not going any further\nthan 2 way say at this point,\n\n682\n00:32:57.583 --> 00:32:59.470\nlets see if we can get\nstuck in x start state.\n\n683\n00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.553\nShow cdp neighbor, okay,\n\n684\n00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:11.972\nfast ethernet 3, cb2, done.\n\n685\n00:33:11.972 --> 00:33:18.442\nShow cdp neighbor.\n\n686\n00:33:18.442 --> 00:33:21.176\nShow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n687\n00:33:21.176 --> 00:33:24.042\n10.9 40.1.\n\n688\n00:33:24.042 --> 00:33:29.502\nHe's over there,\nhe's off fast ethernet 0 1 0.1,\n\n689\n00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:36.120\nso I got to 40.1 now over there,\nso let's show ip ospf neighbor.\n\n690\n00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.455\nSo I don't see that connection over here,\nso\n\n691\n00:33:41.455 --> 00:33:46.760\n[COUGH] when I came out of here, what\nwas I looking for when I came over here?\n\n692\n00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.780\nSo let's hold on guys.\n\n693\n00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.340\nWe're gonna come back to this for\na second.\n\n694\n00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.540\nSo let me come back to here.\n\n695\n00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.430\nNow, so, when we see our hellos right?\n\n696\n00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.214\nSo, when we come back there, remember,\nour type our ospf packet types,\n\n697\n00:34:01.214 --> 00:34:04.765\nwe have our hellos and\ndatabase description packets,\n\n698\n00:34:04.765 --> 00:34:09.474\ndatabase description packets,\nour link state requests, so after, so\n\n699\n00:34:09.474 --> 00:34:13.949\nagain, we're gonna go through this\nin a little bit more detail, but\n\n700\n00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:18.770\nthe hello packets discover and\nmaintain neighbors, this is my type one.\n\n701\n00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.170\nAnd type two,\nwe send the database description DBD and\n\n702\n00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.710\nthey contain the LSA headers.\n\n703\n00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.520\nAnd then we have the link state request,\nif we don't have current information for\n\n704\n00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.500\nany link state advertisement,\nthen we're gonna ask hey,\n\n705\n00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.970\nI don't understand the link state for\nthat guy.\n\n706\n00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.570\nAnd then we're gonna get\na link state update with\n\n707\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.430\na list of link state advertisements\nthat should be updated, okay?\n\n708\n00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:45.700\nThis is often used in flooding, we usually\nsend this type four out in flooding, so\n\n709\n00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.910\nwe give the information.\n\n710\n00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:53.390\nSo, ospf does flood the network every\nonce in a while with link state updates.\n\n711\n00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.040\nAnd then we acknowledge to help ensure\nreliably transmission of link state\n\n712\n00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.170\nadvertisement.\n\n713\n00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:03.390\nEach LSA is explicitly acknowledged,\nright, we have to get an acknowledgement.\n\n714\n00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.560\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look\nat this, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n715\n00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.520\ntroubleshoot, I'm gonna bring\nthat link up really quick so\n\n716\n00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.200\nI'm gonna put this on pause really\nquick so you guys aren't watching,\n\n717\n00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.420\nlet me fix that link and\nthen we can do some troubleshooting.\n\n718\n00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.810\nSo we're gonna put this on pause,\nI'll be right back.\n\n719\n00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.520\nAll right.\nSo now we took a look at that.\n\n720\n00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.120\nReally I just needed to\nwait a couple more minutes,\n\n721\n00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.200\nand then OSPF popped back up cuz I had\na feeling those interfaces were together.\n\n722\n00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.990\nBut now that that's working,\nI want to talk about troubleshooting.\n\n723\n00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.380\nSo let's use those two interfaces, and\n\n724\n00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.340\nthis is what I was trying to get to, let's\nuse those two interfaces to troubleshoot.\n\n725\n00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.240\nLet's talk about our\ntroubleshooting techniques here.\n\n726\n00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.730\nWe'll come back to this again in\nmy troubleshooting section, but\n\n727\n00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.520\nI wanna do it right now too\ncuz it's really important.\n\n728\n00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.890\nSo the components of troubleshooting OSPF,\n\n729\n00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.220\nfirst off we're gonna check\nour enabled adjacencies.\n\n730\n00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.270\nThese are the steps you're gonna take.\n\n731\n00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:50.630\nWe're gonna make sure\nour neighbors are up.\n\n732\n00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:55.210\nSo with OSPF, unlike ERGP and RIP form,\nlike pay attention right here\n\n733\n00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.368\nwith OSPF I also have to pay attention to\nmy neighbor too and check my adjacencies.\n\n734\n00:35:59.368 --> 00:36:02.560\nThen I'm gonna check my routing tables and\nmake sure all my routes are in there and\n\n735\n00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.560\nthen I am also need to\ncheck my path selection,\n\n736\n00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.780\nbecause if I have unequal cause paths,\nI can make them work.\n\n737\n00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.990\nNow, that being said, the first thing\nI'm gonna do, what are the hello and\n\n738\n00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.780\ndead timers set to to by default?\n\n739\n00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.080\nSo I'm gonna check\na couple different areas.\n\n740\n00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.850\nRight here, here is my hello and dead.\n\n741\n00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:23.050\nThis is between, right so I'm here,\nthis is just an ethernet zero whatever,\n\n742\n00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.450\nconnecting to an ethernet zero over here.\n\n743\n00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.660\nI'm looking at zero zero and\nconnecting to zero zero over here.\n\n744\n00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.970\nAnd so I'm looking at the hello and\ndead timers.\n\n745\n00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.170\nI have to make sure they're\nthe same on both interfaces.\n\n746\n00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.520\nI have to make sure\nthey are the same area.\n\n747\n00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.270\nI have to make sure they\nare the same subnet.\n\n748\n00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.290\nThat is typically not a problem but\nwe are definitely going to check that.\n\n749\n00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:48.944\nSo we are gonna check area but also we're\ngonna check that the rids aren't the same,\n\n750\n00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:51.080\nthat's another place we're gonna\nlook at so let's take a look.\n\n751\n00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.430\nSo why isn't R1, and\nwe are gonna go out, and\n\n752\n00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.910\nwhile i was out there while we\ntook a break, i went out and\n\n753\n00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.130\nI made some changes between those two\nrouters, cuz they started working,\n\n754\n00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.270\nand I couldn't make them stop working, so\nI went in there and created some problems.\n\n755\n00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.780\nSo let's take a look,\nwhy doesn't R1 form adjacent to R2?\n\n756\n00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.670\nNow, how do you approach this question?\n\n757\n00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.130\nThe fact is, you don't look for\nthe right answers.\n\n758\n00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.400\nYou look for the wrong answers and\neliminate them.\n\n759\n00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:19.510\nBecause, in this case here,\nit says why isn't, well some of\n\n760\n00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:25.170\nthe answers are that you could choose,\nlet's say this was A, B, C, D, whatever.\n\n761\n00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.960\nA, B, C, D, I don't know that\nit's like this, I'm just saying.\n\n762\n00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.359\nSays static routing is configured.\n\n763\n00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.989\nIf static routing has a lower AD and\nstatic routing is configured,\n\n764\n00:37:33.989 --> 00:37:35.600\nthat'll be in the routing table.\n\n765\n00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.530\nBut that doesn't stop these guys\nfrom creating an adjacency.\n\n766\n00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.500\nThat's not what the question says,\n\n767\n00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.260\nit says,\nwhy aren't they in the routing table.\n\n768\n00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.600\nThen that would be the answer.\n\n769\n00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.570\nIt says why aren't they\nforming an adjacency.\n\n770\n00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.090\nSo why isn't E up?\n\n771\n00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:52.170\nMaybe it's because EIGRP is configured and\nthat has a lower AD.\n\n772\n00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:56.040\nWell, that would be again the answer if it\nsays why isn't OSPF in the rotting table.\n\n773\n00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.110\nThat's not what it says.\n\n774\n00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.550\nThis would not stop OSPF in\nthe background from creating an adjacency.\n\n775\n00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.340\nHowever, if the low and\n\n776\n00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:08.120\ndead timers are not set to the same values\nthat's not gonna clear the adjacency or\n\n777\n00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.710\nthey are configured in different areas,\nthat's not gonna create an adjacency.\n\n778\n00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.280\nRight?\nSo\n\n779\n00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.950\nI take out these two and that leaves\nme with the two correct answers.\n\n780\n00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.420\nRight?\nSo just look for the wrong answers and\n\n781\n00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.210\nyou're gonna be stuck\nwith the right answers.\n\n782\n00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.230\nYou're stuck with them.\n\n783\n00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.200\nAll right, let's take [LAUGH]\ntake a look at this guys and\n\n784\n00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.040\nthen we're gonna run up to my router and\nsee if we can fix that.\n\n785\n00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.920\nOkay, it says, so I got two routers.\n\n786\n00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.188\nFirst thing I'm going to do is check\ntheir interface, they're both /30s,\n\n787\n00:38:32.188 --> 00:38:32.850\n240.1 and 240.2.\n\n788\n00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.130\nOkay, those are good.\n\n789\n00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.670\nIn this case here, the encapsulation's\nare the same, I don't really care,\n\n790\n00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.060\nwe haven't even done WANs, yet.\n\n791\n00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.740\nBut anyways, I'm gonna look at this,\nip ospf 3, ip ospf 4.\n\n792\n00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.000\nThat does not matter,\nthose are process IDs.\n\n793\n00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.720\nNow, that process ID does\nhave to match here though.\n\n794\n00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.270\nAll right, so I'm gonna check these,\nsay okay, those are fine.\n\n795\n00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.320\nThen I'm gonna say area 0, area 2.\n\n796\n00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.110\nWell, there's my problem number one,\nisn't it, they were in different areas.\n\n797\n00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.860\nNow, the other thing, this says IPO\nwas cut off of low interval 50.\n\n798\n00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:07.400\nWell this one doesn't anything,\nso what is this one at?\n\n799\n00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.890\nDefault of 10 and 40.\n\n800\n00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.550\n>> Yeah, this one's at 40,\nbecause that's the default.\n\n801\n00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.060\nBecause it says nothing.\n\n802\n00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.190\nSo if it says nothing we're on a default,\nso the hello of 10, dead at 40.\n\n803\n00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.750\nSo that's problem number two.\n\n804\n00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:23.150\nSo that's problem number one, two,\ndo we have a third problem showing here?\n\n805\n00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.370\nI know you can't see it too well,\nthere you go.\n\n806\n00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.860\nThe answer is yes.\n\n807\n00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.400\nBecause I have my router-id set here,\nrouter-id set here, And\n\n808\n00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.970\nsome genius set them the same.\n\n809\n00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.220\nNow, that being said,\nthis would never work, right?\n\n810\n00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.660\nYou have three problems.\n\n811\n00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.780\nThese are some huge issues here.\n\n812\n00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:45.160\nLet's go out and\ntake a look at my lab and let's see.\n\n813\n00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.590\nNow we're looking between here.\n\n814\n00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.320\nI have two interfaces connected.\n\n815\n00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.240\nIt took them a while for them to come up.\n\n816\n00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.780\nBut they did come up, okay.\n\n817\n00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.540\nSo let's see.\n\n818\n00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.697\nShow, so the first thing I'm gonna do,\nsee if you can see this.\n\n819\n00:39:58.697 --> 00:40:01.638\nShow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n820\n00:40:01.638 --> 00:40:02.350\n>> Flood war.\n\n821\n00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.760\n>> Well, I see 10.1 that's across serial.\n\n822\n00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.261\nThat is We're in a flood war.\n\n823\n00:40:09.261 --> 00:40:12.302\nThey're telling me the problems here,\nI got to get rid of that.\n\n824\n00:40:12.302 --> 00:40:13.190\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n825\n00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.560\n>> Let me do this.\n\n826\n00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.490\nLoggin no con, right?\n\n827\n00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.132\nConsole no logging, was it no logging?\n\n828\n00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:25.430\nLog.\n\n829\n00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.740\nI forget, what's the command?\n\n830\n00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.490\nI just did it on the other one.\n\n831\n00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.250\nNo logging console.\n\n832\n00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:34.910\nThere, okay.\n\n833\n00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.950\nDon't do that one a lot.\n\n834\n00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.760\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou shouldn't probably ever do that.\n\n835\n00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.060\nBut since I don't want you to see\nall the problems ahead of time.\n\n836\n00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.690\nSo I say, show ip ospf.\n\n837\n00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.320\nNeighbor.\nI'm only seeing the corp router.\n\n838\n00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.402\nI'm not seeing my other router,\nmy San Fransisco router.\n\n839\n00:40:49.402 --> 00:40:51.390\nAll right, so I'm seeing that there.\n\n840\n00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.020\nSo let me do this,\nI'm connected off of F01 in each one.\n\n841\n00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.520\nNow there's a couple\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n842\n00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.180\nIf I'm on the exam, I'm in a hurry,\nI'm probably just going to show run and\n\n843\n00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.540\nlook what's change on each interface and\ncompare them.\n\n844\n00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.517\nThat is a way to do it.\n\n845\n00:41:06.013 --> 00:41:08.200\nShow ip ospf interface F0/1.\n\n846\n00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.440\nAll right so let's take a look at this.\n\n847\n00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.010\nMy internet address 20.2, so\nI'm going to check the other side.\n\n848\n00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.050\nThis guy is in area zero,\nwell that looks good to me.\n\n849\n00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.600\nAttachment or interface, process ID 1.\n\n850\n00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.250\nThat doesn't really matter.\n\n851\n00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:26.970\nMy process ID doesn't have to be the same.\n\n852\n00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.400\nBut here's my RID, 40.1.\n\n853\n00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.230\nSo I know I'm in 20.2,\nor 20 subnet, size 24.\n\n854\n00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.270\nMy RID is 40.1.\n\n855\n00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.920\nOkay?\n\n856\n00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.320\nNow, my hello is 10 and 40.\n\n857\n00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.645\nWell, that looks, and\nthere's nothing wrong with this.\n\n858\n00:41:41.645 --> 00:41:42.690\nRonnie, do you see any problems here?\n\n859\n00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.440\nSo, I'm in area zero.\n\n860\n00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.170\nI'm in the 19126820 network.\n\n861\n00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.370\nMy read is 19126840.1.\n\n862\n00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.840\nEverything else looks good.\n\n863\n00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.200\nI'm not shut down.\n\n864\n00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.980\nTen and 40.\n\n865\n00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.420\nLet's go out and check the other\nrouter off of F zero one and\n\n866\n00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.730\ncompare the interfaces.\n\n867\n00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.346\nShow IP.\n\n868\n00:42:02.346 --> 00:42:07.664\nOSPF interface F01.\n\n869\n00:42:07.664 --> 00:42:14.030\nOkay, I'm in the 20 subnet,\nI'm in area two.\n\n870\n00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.710\nThat's never going to work.\n\n871\n00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.340\nWhat else do we have?\n\n872\n00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.710\nWell, I believe that I have the same rid.\n\n873\n00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.795\nI worked hard to get that\nother rid working in here.\n\n874\n00:42:21.795 --> 00:42:24.810\nSo if I come over here,\ntheres my rid right there.\n\n875\n00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.752\nAnd I'm in the right thing.\n\n876\n00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:31.550\nSo, if you can somehow get these\ninterfaces next to each other, hold on,\n\n877\n00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.580\nlet me do this.\n\n878\n00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.780\nThen I can have a look so\nI'm in the 20 summit, that is fine.\n\n879\n00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.380\nArea 2, area 0.\n\n880\n00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.880\nThe 40, right?\n\n881\n00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.366\nSo we got the wrong areas and\nwe have duplicate rids, but\n\n882\n00:42:47.366 --> 00:42:49.820\nwait my hello is ten, debt is 40.\n\n883\n00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.670\nLook at this, hello is 30, did is 120.\n\n884\n00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:58.190\nI don't remember setting that,\nbut I must have.\n\n885\n00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:02.520\nSo this thing is jacked up,\nmy friends, this thing is jacked up.\n\n886\n00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.040\nSo here's another way to see this and\nreally quick,\n\n887\n00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.070\nif you're on the exam and\nyou're in a hurry, just do a show run.\n\n888\n00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.585\nAll right and, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at F01 here.\n\n889\n00:43:14.238 --> 00:43:18.704\nAll right so, theres my hello interval 30,\nin my area two, so\n\n890\n00:43:18.704 --> 00:43:22.775\nI can change these, so\nI'm just gonna do this, Config T.\n\n891\n00:43:25.299 --> 00:43:30.130\nInterface F01 no IP ISPF\nhello interval 30.\n\n892\n00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.500\nThat just sets it back to default.\n\n893\n00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.050\nNow I'm going to change\nthis IP ospf 1 area 0.\n\n894\n00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.750\nOkay.\n\n895\n00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.910\nThose are fixed.\n\n896\n00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.640\nSo I fixed the hello interval.\n\n897\n00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.430\nI fixed the wrong area.\n\n898\n00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.930\nWhat else did we have?\n\n899\n00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.090\nA duplicate grid.\n\n900\n00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.370\nSo now we're going to come down here.\n\n901\n00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.230\nI'm gonna do show run.\n\n902\n00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.580\nCome down here to my router OSPF process.\n\n903\n00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.180\nAnd, I can see my rid right there,\nwhich I had set to say,\n\n904\n00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.390\nI wouldn't check what the rid was and\nset it the same.\n\n905\n00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.920\nAll right?\n\n906\n00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.530\nSo you've got to pay attention to\nthese right here, so here's my rid.\n\n907\n00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.070\nSo I'm just gonna say\nconfig T router OSPF1.\n\n908\n00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.165\nIt's a good thing I changed that to one,\n\n909\n00:44:08.165 --> 00:44:12.330\nso I always know what it is,\nI would hate to look.\n\n910\n00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.356\nAnd I say no router-id.\n\n911\n00:44:16.356 --> 00:44:21.082\nOkay, and then clear IP OS.\n\n912\n00:44:21.082 --> 00:44:27.209\nOkay do clear IP OSPF process.\n\n913\n00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.000\nYes, okay now give it a couple minutes.\n\n914\n00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.390\nAnd these two links would come up.\n\n915\n00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.480\nAll right, that's some great\nOSPF troubleshooting, but\n\n916\n00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.670\nwe still have a little bit more to do.\n\n917\n00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.550\nOSPF V three.\n\n918\n00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.520\nThis is actually the easiest\nsection of OSPF.\n\n919\n00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.000\nLess troubleshooting, it just works.\n\n920\n00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.670\nNo network statements,\nno inverse mass, nothing.\n\n921\n00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.050\nYou can't even put those in.\n\n922\n00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:55.190\nSo we just configure\nthem on the interfaces.\n\n923\n00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:57.740\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and take a look, and\nwe're gonna run out to San Francisco and\n\n924\n00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:03.800\nLA, configure those, and\nthen come back to the corp network,\n\n925\n00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.410\nwhich when I configure it,\nthen the whole network will come up.\n\n926\n00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:07.481\nOk, so let's run out to San Francisco.\n\n927\n00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:08.180\nAll right.\n\n928\n00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.670\nSo from San Fransisco, fig T.\n\n929\n00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:14.170\nGotta spell it right.\n\n930\n00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.180\nAnd IPv6 unicast routing.\n\n931\n00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.140\nI already have it all running, but\ndon't forget you'd have to do that, and\n\n932\n00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:29.070\nthen you gotta go to each interface and\nput this on do show IP int brief.\n\n933\n00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:34.020\nNow you can do IPv6 int brief but\nin this case here I want to see my\n\n934\n00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.410\nwhich interface, all they care\nabout is which interfaces they are.\n\n935\n00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:41.500\nSo I'm using fastseason 00000 and then\nwe'll go ahead and use loop back for fun.\n\n936\n00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.790\nSo interface f00 and then I say IPv6 OSPF.\n\n937\n00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:52.610\nOne, that is the process ID I use for\nglobal configuration where I set my rid.\n\n938\n00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:59.130\nAnd then area zero, interface set 000.\n\n939\n00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:02.850\nAnd then I sub arrow and\nhit the same thing.\n\n940\n00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.460\nInterface loop back zero\nup arrow hit same thing.\n\n941\n00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.360\nSo really easy, one command, now if you\nhad different areas all I do is up arrow,\n\n942\n00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.050\nchange this area to area one or\nwhatever it was.\n\n943\n00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:24.340\nOkay so from global config IPV 6\nrouter EIGR oops, not EIG, OSPF 1.\n\n944\n00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.240\nOSPF 1, EIGRP would be the same thing.\n\n945\n00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.240\nAnd then so,\nnow I've got that configured and\n\n946\n00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.559\nthe only thing I'd put under\nhere is my router ID, right?\n\n947\n00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:38.234\n0.0.0.\n\n948\n00:46:38.234 --> 00:46:41.260\nWe'll do this as .1.\n\n949\n00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.430\nOkay, now so\nthat's really all I need under right?\n\n950\n00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:46.720\nThere's not a lot of stuff on there.\n\n951\n00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.190\nI'm gonna put in a global config.\n\n952\n00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.890\nSo I can set that first, or I can put\nit on my interfaces then set this.\n\n953\n00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.430\nDoesn't really matter,\nit's that sooner that I just did it.\n\n954\n00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.980\nSo, you can see that my\nOSPF config is pretty good,\n\n955\n00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.490\ndidn't even care about my networks.\n\n956\n00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.770\nNow, let's say I didn't want to\npush OSPF out faster than 800,\n\n957\n00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.190\nthen I just wont put it on that interface,\nthat's fine.\n\n958\n00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:09.950\nSo there is no passive interfaces,\nright, in this case.\n\n959\n00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.000\nAll right, so let's go to LA.\n\n960\n00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.060\nSo nothings going to pop up\nuntil I get corp working,\n\n961\n00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.810\nwhich they're all connected to, okay.\n\n962\n00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.838\nRouter, IPV6 router OSPF1.\n\n963\n00:47:23.838 --> 00:47:25.470\nRouter Id, 0.0.0.2.\n\n964\n00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.090\nDo show IP int brief.\n\n965\n00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:32.230\nAnd I can do show IPV6 in brief, right,\n\n966\n00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:39.460\nbecause I have IPV6 on there already,\nsince it's already been configured.\n\n967\n00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.940\nTo me,\nit's a little bit harder to read this way.\n\n968\n00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:49.170\nSo I just, even though I\"m doing IPv6,\nI do show IP int brief.\n\n969\n00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.810\nIt's just a little, darn it.\n\n970\n00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.905\nIt's just a little bit quicker for me to\njust to see the actual interfaces here.\n\n971\n00:47:54.905 --> 00:48:00.113\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nconfigure these into f0/0.\n\n972\n00:48:00.113 --> 00:48:04.144\nIPv6 OSPF process id.\n\n973\n00:48:04.144 --> 00:48:06.549\nI can put this in area 1,\narea 0, whatever,\n\n974\n00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:09.270\nwe've got 2.4 billionaires, right.\n\n975\n00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.280\nAnd then I'm just gonna choose\neach interface I'm using.\n\n976\n00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.468\nUp arrow twice.\n\n977\n00:48:14.468 --> 00:48:19.560\nInterface has 020, up arrow twice,\nand then I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n978\n00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.620\nuse my loopback and\nthose show up as slash 32s don't they.\n\n979\n00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.470\nAnd that's it.\n\n980\n00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.560\nDone and done, right?\n\n981\n00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.121\nNow, my network's not up and running\nbecause I gotta come down here to the.\n\n982\n00:48:33.242 --> 00:48:37.948\nConfig t, ipv6\n\n983\n00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:44.340\nrouter ospf 1, rid.\n\n984\n00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.740\nOops, router-id 0.0.0.3.\n\n985\n00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.580\nOkay, that works very well.\n\n986\n00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.030\nDo show IP brief.\n\n987\n00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.390\nSee, my interface is there.\n\n988\n00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.990\nNeed a little bit more room over here,\ninterface F00.\n\n989\n00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.900\nI don't care about what\nthe network numbers are,\n\n990\n00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:05.683\nI'm just saying two interfaces I'm\ngoing to run this on, IPv6 router O-S.\n\n991\n00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:12.620\nNow, IPV6 OSPF 1 area 0.\n\n992\n00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.640\nAnd, it doesn't matter if I'm doing\nmultiple area or not, it's so\n\n993\n00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.160\nsimple to do multi area this way,\nisn't it?\n\n994\n00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.500\nNow remember, and I did show you, we can\ndo I-P version four this way, can't we?\n\n995\n00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.500\nAbsolutely.\n\n996\n00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.580\nJust type IP instead of IPV6.\n\n997\n00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.030\nAnd it's probably\na better way to do it and\n\n998\n00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.970\nthat's certainly the way they\ndo it on the objectives.\n\n999\n00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.840\nThey put it on\nthe interfaces IP version 4.\n\n1000\n00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.870\nOkay, so we'll see them both on here.\n\n1001\n00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:40.564\nS 000 up arrow, 0, uh-oh.\n\n1002\n00:49:40.564 --> 00:49:46.230\n[LAUGH] Darn it, okay interface s, 010.\n\n1003\n00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.420\nInterface s 020.\n\n1004\n00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.260\nI think I got them all.\n\n1005\n00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.580\nI didn't do loop back.\n\n1006\n00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.050\nAnd 000.\n\n1007\n00:50:07.405 --> 00:50:10.830\nOkay, let's come up here on that one corp.\n\n1008\n00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.410\nSo let's just do some verification\ncommands and wrap this whole episode up.\n\n1009\n00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.440\nIt's been a long episode.\n\n1010\n00:50:17.272 --> 00:50:23.570\nShow ipv6 route, okay,\nwe should see pretty much all in here.\n\n1011\n00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:28.540\nMaybe some rip, I did have rip\nrunning as well, so there's my O's.\n\n1012\n00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.090\nMy three remote networks, yes, okay.\n\n1013\n00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.890\nSo we can see guys, what I want you to pay\nattention to here is you get these and you\n\n1014\n00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:41.790\ncommunicate routing protocols through link\nlocal addresses, not the global addresses.\n\n1015\n00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.680\nObviously we can see the global address or\n\n1016\n00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.820\nthe network prefix on there so\nthis is my prefix.\n\n1017\n00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.710\nThis is subnet 3, subnet 1, subnet 4,\nsubnet 5, subnet 6, and so on, okay?\n\n1018\n00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.100\nLet's do a show run.\n\n1019\n00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.860\nLet's take a look at this config here.\n\n1020\n00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.590\nSo I didn't do any loopback here,\nbut I can see I have IPv6,\n\n1021\n00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:10.510\nI thought I had four in here, but\nI must have used my network statements.\n\n1022\n00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.700\nBut here I have my IP address,\nnotice I used my EUI-64 format, so\n\n1023\n00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:20.960\nif I was to go look at that we would\nsee that EEFFFE, put my OSPF in here.\n\n1024\n00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:28.683\nClock rate underneath the serials\nbecause of a non-production environment,\n\n1025\n00:51:28.683 --> 00:51:33.208\nyour IP 4 address, IP 6 address,\nand then OSPF for IPV 6.\n\n1026\n00:51:33.208 --> 00:51:39.070\nI didn't put, let me see,\nI must have taken OSPF off of here.\n\n1027\n00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:43.310\nThere's my IPv6 with my read, okay?\n\n1028\n00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:46.710\nSo some of the couple of\ncommands we're gonna run through,\n\n1029\n00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:51.060\nremember show IPv6 ospf,\nvery good command.\n\n1030\n00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:59.683\nThis is gonna show me my read right and\n\n1031\n00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:07.630\nmy process ID, show ipv6 proto, okay?\n\n1032\n00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:12.355\nI can see that I've connected and\n\n1033\n00:52:12.355 --> 00:52:16.909\nit was OSPF 1 for IP version 6,\n\n1034\n00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:22.180\nshow ipv6 ospf Interface f0/0.\n\n1035\n00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:22.930\nOkay.\n\n1036\n00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:28.640\nSo I can now see my RID,\nmy designated router, my local address.\n\n1037\n00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.200\nThis is obviously my link local.\n\n1038\n00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.950\nMy hello and dead timers.\n\n1039\n00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.360\nSo, the interface ID.\n\n1040\n00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:43.410\nSo and my Process ID and so\n\n1041\n00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.180\nmy Link Local and you want to see,\nhere's your DR and\n\n1042\n00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.020\nthen if we had a BDR on there,\nI don't have another router on here.\n\n1043\n00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.070\nAnd the reason I'm looking at this,\nis how you would compare interfaces.\n\n1044\n00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.630\nLike we just went through in that\ntroubleshooting, I could do the same with\n\n1045\n00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.898\nIP version 6, I gotta make sure\nI'm in the same area, all right?\n\n1046\n00:52:59.898 --> 00:53:05.510\nSo area 0, listed right here,\nmy process ID doesn't have to be the same.\n\n1047\n00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.650\nBut I make sure I can't have the same RID,\nright?\n\n1048\n00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.610\nSo here's my RID right here.\n\n1049\n00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.330\nI gotta make sure that's not the same.\n\n1050\n00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.540\nThat's another reason you wouldn't\ncome out of X Start Save, by the way.\n\n1051\n00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:19.400\nIf you have put this on two routers and\nyou're going to see that you'll be stuck\n\n1052\n00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.480\nin Exstart state because\nyou have duplicate reds,\n\n1053\n00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.930\nalso because the MTU's don't match.\n\n1054\n00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:28.060\nOkay, so we've gone through an awful lot,\nwell I don't know about awful,\n\n1055\n00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:32.479\nit was an amazing amount of information\nwith our IPV4 and IPV6 OSPF.\n\n1056\n00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:35.540\n>> All right,\nwell Todd thank you again for\n\n1057\n00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.510\ndemonstrating to us the idea\nof the configuration of OSPF.\n\n1058\n00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:42.680\nRemember that in this episode we\ntook a look at OSPF specifically and\n\n1059\n00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.190\ntalking about the overall configuration\nand of course some of the details that we\n\n1060\n00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:51.620\nneed to know for OSPF routers to become\nadjacent SC's or neighbors, right?\n\n1061\n00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.550\nSo if any of those fields\ndon't tend to match up,\n\n1062\n00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.040\nwell then you are gonna\nend up having a problem.\n\n1063\n00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.780\nNot only did we see that, we also saw\nthat between point to point links,\n\n1064\n00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.140\nyou end up actually\nbeing able to see where,\n\n1065\n00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.120\nwell you don't really have to\nworry about too much, right?\n\n1066\n00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.620\nThey actually can communicate and\n\n1067\n00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.650\nthey are going to actually work\nvery well with each other.\n\n1068\n00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:13.390\nBut if you're on an ethernet link, right,\nwhere you have multiple routers all on\n\n1069\n00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:18.340\nthe same subnet you may end up finding out\nthat there's gonna be a designated router\n\n1070\n00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.620\nas well as a backup\ndesignated router as well.\n\n1071\n00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.875\nAnd that's gonna also be determined too.\n\n1072\n00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:27.370\nAnd so remember that those are actually\nkey elements when we are actually going\n\n1073\n00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.960\nfor the exam and\nunderstanding that concept as well.\n\n1074\n00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.580\nAnd making sure that we can compare them,\nthose things that will allow us\n\n1075\n00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.420\nto see why the adjacencies don't\ncome up and they become neighbors.\n\n1076\n00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.720\nUsually in terms of troubleshooting,\nthat's kind of the key element.\n\n1077\n00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.458\nAnd that's gonna be true also\nif you're actually going for\n\n1078\n00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:48.350\nOSPF version 3 that you actually\ntend to hit the same marks.\n\n1079\n00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:53.260\nThe difference here is that we\ntend to configure OSPF version 3.\n\n1080\n00:54:53.260 --> 00:55:00.320\nAll the IP version 6 information\nright there on that router itself.\n\n1081\n00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.630\nThe only thing that we're doing there is\nnormally configuring the router ID and\n\n1082\n00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.620\nthen each each interface that we\nwant OSPF to be reported out of.\n\n1083\n00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.090\nWe will not have a passive interface\n\n1084\n00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:12.590\ncommand that we tend to\nrun with OSPF version 3.\n\n1085\n00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:16.660\nSo, a lot of great information and\nthat's a great place for us to make sure\n\n1086\n00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:21.128\nthat we understand that, for the exam,\naccuracy and speed is the key here.\n\n1087\n00:55:21.128 --> 00:55:24.530\nEntities, concepts and OSPF 3, or OSPF\n\n1088\n00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:28.160\nversion 2 I think is what the IP version\n>> V2.\n\n1089\n00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.530\n>> Yeah, V2, when we start seeing that,\n\n1090\n00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:35.990\nif any of this doesn't sound great make\nsure you check Todd's book out as well.\n\n1091\n00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:39.370\nSo that's a great place for us to end\nthis episode like I was saying here.\n\n1092\n00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.860\nAnd signing off for ITPro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n1093\n00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.960\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n1094\n00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:51.153\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA Routing and Switching content.\n\n1095\n00:55:51.153 --> 00:55:54.381\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle introduces EIGRP as a routing protocol.  This protocol creates a 100% loop free routing for all routers configured with EIGRP.  He also describes how EIGRP builds a neighbor table, topology table and routing table to discover not only the best route (Successor) but also the next best route (Feasible Successor).  Todd also shows the simple configuration for EIGRP and differences for using subnets depending on the IOS version.  To insure that routers become EIGRP neighbors, routers must match on Autonomous System number and K-Values, Todd reminds us.",

00:00:17.460\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.010\nwe're taking a look at ICND2 content,\ngetting ready for that CCNA routing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.340\nswitching exam that\nCisco has just released.\n\n6\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.870\nIn our studio today is gonna be Mr.\nTodd Lammle,\n\n7\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.250\nwho's gonna help us to ensure that we are\nfocused in on those exam objectives, so\n\n8\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.400\nwelcome back to our studios, Todd.\n\n9\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500\n>> All right, it's great to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170\nLet's jump right into routing protocols.\n\n11\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.500\nWe're gonna do EIGRP,\nOSPF and then multiarea OSPF.\n\n12\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.902\nAt the very end when we get to WANs,\nwe're gonna add in BGP in this new ICND2.\n\n13\n00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:47.359\nSo let's start with EIGRP,\nlet's take a look.\n\n14\n00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.315\nOkay, so EIGRP stands for Enhanced\nInterior Gateway Routing Protocol,\n\n15\n00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:53.660\nalso we used to have just IGRP.\n\n16\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.950\nSo EIGRP is advanced distance vector.\n\n17\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.632\nAlso, maybe some people call it a hybrid,\nbut advanced distance vector.\n\n18\n00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:05.614\nIt's the most rapid convergence\nof any routing protocol.\n\n19\n00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.016\nSo in OSPF would be faster than RIP,\nstuff like that.\n\n20\n00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:13.148\n100% loop free, classless routing,\nthat's a pretty bold statement.\n\n21\n00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:16.379\nAnd the reason they say that,\nas we're gonna find out next slide,\n\n22\n00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:18.178\nthat we make three tables, not one.\n\n23\n00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.565\nLike in RIP, they have one table,\none routing table, and\n\n24\n00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:21.850\nthey share that information.\n\n25\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.220\nWe don't share routing table information,\nwe'll take a look here.\n\n26\n00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.380\nThe one thing is though,\nwe have a complexity of a routing\n\n27\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.470\nprotocol like OSPF, in the background, but\nwith the ease of configuration of RIP.\n\n28\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.800\nOSPF is hard to configure, and\nit works hard in the background, right?\n\n29\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.880\nEverything about OSPF is hard,\nwith EIGRP, it's very simple.\n\n30\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850\nSo what Cisco says, is hey,\nwe're gonna come up with this\n\n31\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.000\nphenomenal routing protocol,\nthat does all this work in the background.\n\n32\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.970\nDon't worry about that.\n\n33\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.430\nConfigure it like you were doing RIP and\nlet EIGRP do the work.\n\n34\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.570\nAnd that is a very true statement.\n\n35\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.600\nOkay, so easy configuration,\nincremental updates instead of periodic.\n\n36\n00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.330\nSo RIP sends periodic updates,\nright, of its\n\n37\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.490\nrouting table every 30 seconds, right, and\nso we don't send any updates ever, right.\n\n38\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.690\nSo anyways, load balancing across\nequal and unequal cost pathways.\n\n39\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.400\nSo unlike other routing protocols,\nwhich they all do equal cost paths,\n\n40\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.410\nwe can configure this, and\nwe will to do unequal cost paths.\n\n41\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.880\nIn my lab, I have two serial links between\nSan Francisco and LA, and we'll be able to\n\n42\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.370\nuse those and put a variance in there and\nmake them unequal, it'll be fun.\n\n43\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.850\nAll right, flexible network design,\nthat's right.\n\n44\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.080\nConfiguration of OSPF,\n\n45\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.120\nit has to be done in a really good\ndesigned network or OSPF doesn't converge.\n\n46\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.210\nEIGRP will work in any\ncrappy network design.\n\n47\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.430\nYou just turn them on, it'll find a way.\n\n48\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.870\nOSPF won't do that, all right.\n\n49\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.150\nMulticast is all we use.\n\n50\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.600\nAnd then sometimes with something\ncalled reliable transport protocol,\n\n51\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.498\nwe'll be able to talk to our neighbor and\nuse unicast.\n\n52\n00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:02.780\nUnicast may not know its IP address,\nI'm gonna talk to it directly.\n\n53\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.225\nAll right, support for\nVLSM and discontiguous,\n\n54\n00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.842\nnetworks by doing the No Auto,\nlike we did with RIP.\n\n55\n00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:13.159\nSo but we have to talk about that in\na little bit more detail on this,\n\n56\n00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.300\non the 15 code here.\n\n57\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.531\nAnd then, of course,\nwe can do route summarization.\n\n58\n00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:25.168\nOkay, so with EIGRP terminology,\nwe have three tables.\n\n59\n00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:31.052\nSo when we come up, we do this 224.0.0.10.\n\n60\n00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:33.951\nDoes anyone remember\nwhat RIP Version 2 was?\n\n61\n00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:35.468\n224.0.0.\n\n62\n00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.710\n>> Nine?\n>> Nine is the correct answer.\n\n63\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.061\nYou do need to know these numbers, and\n\n64\n00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:45.262\nthey're gonna be good for\nIPV6 too, as well.\n\n65\n00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:49.233\nAnyways, so 224.0.0.10,\nyou're like, no we can't use 224,\n\n66\n00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:53.105\nthat's not what I am saying, we'll\nuse those 9 and 10 with IP Version 6.\n\n67\n00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:56.725\nAll right, 224.0.0.10 with IP Version 4,\n\n68\n00:03:56.725 --> 00:04:02.279\nthe neighbor table we come up, we find out\nwho's our neighbor, we put them in there.\n\n69\n00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.502\nWe're gonna find we run something\ncalled a smooth round-trip time.\n\n70\n00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:07.425\nHow many milliseconds for\nme to get my neighbor and back?\n\n71\n00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:09.110\nAnd then they do it to us.\n\n72\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.489\nAnd it helps us determine\nthe bandwidth and delay of the line or\n\n73\n00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.340\nthe delay between me and my neighbor.\n\n74\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.530\nAnyway, so we've put in the next hop.\n\n75\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.754\nInt router in the interface they're\noff of, we know their IP address,\n\n76\n00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:22.212\nthe interface they're off of, and\nthe delay that a time takes to get there.\n\n77\n00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:25.270\nAll right, then we go, and\nwe talk to our neighbor.\n\n78\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.090\nWe go and talk to our neighbor, and\n\n79\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.810\nwe say, I need to know about everything,\nall the links you know about.\n\n80\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.690\nWhat are all the links you're\ndirectly connected to?\n\n81\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.616\nOkay, I'm gonna put those\nin my topology table.\n\n82\n00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:37.844\nI'm gonna put all mine in there.\n\n83\n00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:40.573\nI'm gonna put my neighbors in there,\nI talked to all of my neighbors.\n\n84\n00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:42.067\nAnd then I'm gonna go to them and say,\n\n85\n00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:44.795\ntell me about all the other links\nyou're not directly connected to.\n\n86\n00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:46.863\nAnd I'm gonna put those\nin my typology table,\n\n87\n00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:49.270\nI'm gonna add my cost to my neighbor.\n\n88\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.935\nAnd then that's what's called a feasible\ndistance, don't get confused,\n\n89\n00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:53.949\nwe'll come back to that,\njumping ahead with some terms.\n\n90\n00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.480\nI know you're like, I'm gonna turn this\noff, he's doing all these terms already.\n\n91\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.500\n[LAUGH] I'm just trying to make sure that\nyou understand that we have three tables.\n\n92\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.800\nWe have three with OSPF too, but\nthey're a little bit different.\n\n93\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.035\nWe have the neighbor table here,\n\n94\n00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:09.660\ntopology table,\nnow we find every link in the network.\n\n95\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.510\nIf we have more than one path to remote\nnetwork, we're gonna run something\n\n96\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.960\ncalled DUAL diffused update algorithm.\n\n97\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.170\nYou'll actually see what you find here,\nin the routing table with a D,\n\n98\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.590\nwhich stands for DUAL.\n\n99\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.782\nBecause DUAL found it, pulls it out,\nfinds the best path, and that best path is\n\n100\n00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:33.789\ncalled a successor path, pulls it out,\nplaces it in the routing table, and\n\n101\n00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.132\nthe only thing in the routing\ntable is this successful routes.\n\n102\n00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:38.810\nWe only want winners.\n\n103\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.040\nNo losers in our routing table.\n\n104\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.625\nThe losers now are still\nin topology table, and\n\n105\n00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:46.050\nthey're considered backup routes.\n\n106\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.396\nOkay, we call them feasible successors.\n\n107\n00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:52.461\nSo the successors are the best path\nof remote location, we copy those,\n\n108\n00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:53.900\nwe don't pull them out.\n\n109\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.972\nYou don't pull them out of topology,\nyou copy them,\n\n110\n00:05:56.972 --> 00:06:01.102\nplace them into the routing table,\nand those are my successor routes.\n\n111\n00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:05.540\nNow IP can use that to forward\ntraffic to a destination.\n\n112\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.180\nNow, so DUAL finds the best path.\n\n113\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.298\nNow Ronnie, by default,\nif I didn't do anything, how many paths,\n\n114\n00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:18.355\ndo you think,\nequal cost paths can I have in there?\n\n115\n00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:20.340\n>> Up to 4 or 16.\n\n116\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.787\n>> Well, it is four by default.\n\n117\n00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:22.465\n>> Four by default.\n\n118\n00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.674\n>> And I think if we go look here, it can\nprobably be configured to 32 now, but\n\n119\n00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:27.647\nwell, it depends on\nthe code we're running.\n\n120\n00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:28.677\n>> Right.\n\n121\n00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:30.938\n>> So 16 is really the answer.\n\n122\n00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:33.386\nI don't think they even\nask this on the CCNA, but\n\n123\n00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.690\nit is four equal cost paths by default.\n\n124\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.260\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna see\nthat in our routing configuration,\n\n125\n00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260\ncuz I have that other link up and running.\n\n126\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.110\nSo we'll make sure, and\n\n127\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.390\nwe'll see that it'll load\nbalance cuz it'll be equal cost.\n\n128\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.140\nThen we'll change that.\n\n129\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.420\nBut in the meantime,\nwe'll let it go out and find it,\n\n130\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.030\nand we'll see that our little RIP network\nfound it as well, cuz RIP is still running\n\n131\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.890\nin the background,\nway back then when we were doing CSEnt.\n\n132\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.620\nAll right, so successor,\nfeasible successor,\n\n133\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.360\nDUAL, we talked about a bunch of terms,\nfeasible distance and so on.\n\n134\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.260\nAll right, now in the EIGRP tables,\n\n135\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.090\nwe have the neighbor table and\nthe topology table.\n\n136\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.993\nNow remember, we do not exchange routing\ntable information with our neighbors\n\n137\n00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:12.952\nlike RIP does.\n\n138\n00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:17.058\nWe talk to our neighbors and\nexchange neighbor information but\n\n139\n00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:18.691\ntopology information.\n\n140\n00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:21.484\nWe don't update the routing\ntable based on the neighbor,\n\n141\n00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:23.200\nwe base it from our topology table.\n\n142\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.590\nSo let's go back for a second.\n\n143\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.680\nSo if I'm here, this gets updated,\nthis then updates the routing table.\n\n144\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.203\nMy neighbor doesn't update my\nrouting table, that's RIP, right?\n\n145\n00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:33.220\nEven OSPF doesn't do that.\n\n146\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.960\nIn OSPF, we update topological database,\nin this case our topology table.\n\n147\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.300\nThat gets updated by our neighbors, right?\n\n148\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.420\nThis is what we use to communicate\nwith our neighbors, to update those.\n\n149\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.230\nAnd we only have the best answer\nprovided into the routing table.\n\n150\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.520\nOnly winners, winners.\n\n151\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.880\nAll right, so that neighbor table\nin topology are kept in RAM.\n\n152\n00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.306\nWell, the routing table's there too,\nbut it's not up-to-date or\n\n153\n00:07:56.306 --> 00:07:58.816\nmaintained to the use of hello and\nupdate packets.\n\n154\n00:07:58.816 --> 00:08:02.552\nSo with hello and\nupdate packets between me and my neighbor,\n\n155\n00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:05.495\nI update my neighbor table and\ntopology table.\n\n156\n00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:08.011\nFrom there I'll update my routing table.\n\n157\n00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:16.081\nAll right, so to enhance the EIGRP\n224.0.0.10, do you know how often?\n\n158\n00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:18.345\nEvery five seconds.\n\n159\n00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:19.065\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.040\n>> Every five seconds, so\n\n161\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.874\nI'm gonna send a hello every five seconds.\n\n162\n00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:25.280\nWith OSPF it's every 10 seconds,\ncuz they do something similar to this.\n\n163\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.810\nNot exactly like this.\n\n164\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.170\nBut similar because with EIGRP and\nOSPF we never send updates, right?\n\n165\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.770\nSo, if we never send updates,\nhow do we know if a change occurs?\n\n166\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.320\nWell that's why we send the hellos.\n\n167\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.990\nIf our neighbor stops responding we're\nlike, something must have happened,\n\n168\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.508\nlet's figure it out.\n\n169\n00:08:41.508 --> 00:08:44.850\nOkay, so EIGRP Keeps everything in RAM,\n\n170\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.350\nso if I reload my router,\nwe have to redo all this.\n\n171\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.100\nSo we may not wanna just reload or reboot\nour router every time something happens.\n\n172\n00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.840\nYou know, the three R's that Microsoft\ntaught us, reload, reboot, reset?\n\n173\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.300\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Right,\nwhatever, reset, reload, reboot.\n\n174\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.890\nRight, that's what Microsoft said there\nwas a problem, due to the three R's.\n\n175\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.010\nThat's not so anymore, right?\n\n176\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.040\nWe don't wanna do that with our Cisco.\n\n177\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.560\nSuccessor routes.\n\n178\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.430\nOkay, and I already talked about these.\n\n179\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.140\nSuccessor routes are in\nthe topology table.\n\n180\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.950\nYou do not pull anything\nout of the topology table.\n\n181\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.430\nYou copy something out of the topology\ntable and put it into your routing table.\n\n182\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.860\nSo this is copied out and\nput into the routing table.\n\n183\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.490\nSo, who decided what do we use,\n\n184\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.010\nwhat algorithm did we use to determine\nwho was successor and feasible successor?\n\n185\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.660\n>> Dual.\n\n186\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.410\n>> Dual is the correct answer.\n\n187\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.460\nDiffused update algorithm.\n\n188\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.460\nIf found the best path,\nfound the other one,\n\n189\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.550\nthis guy's a loser, this guy's a winner.\n\n190\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.040\nHe goes into the routing table.\n\n191\n00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.290\nWe'll use him if we have no other choice,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.070\nAll right, a successor route may be backed\nup by feasible successor, and remember,\n\n193\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.710\nsuccessor routes are both in the topology\ntable and in the routing table.\n\n194\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.530\nNow if I lose a route and\nthere's no feasible successor,\n\n195\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.840\nI'm gonna send a query.\n\n196\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.030\nSo EIGRP is a distance\nvector advanced protocol.\n\n197\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.780\nSo part of its DV,\n\n198\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.970\ndistance vector qualities is we're\ngonna flood the network, all right?\n\n199\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.080\nSo when we have a problem,\nwe're gonna query process.\n\n200\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.950\nIt's used to discover a replacement for\na failed route\n\n201\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.290\nFailed route if a feasible successor\nis not identified in the current.\n\n202\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.720\nSo we're gonna actually\nflood our current network\n\n203\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.030\nif we don't find a feasible successor,\nlooking for it.\n\n204\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.260\nSo we don't wait,\nwe are proactive with the IGRP.\n\n205\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.470\nAnd that's why we're so fast, and\n\n206\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.300\nthat's part of its distance\nvector qualities right there.\n\n207\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.170\nOkay, so let's get to the easy part of all\nthis, and then there's still a little more\n\n208\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.260\ncomplication in the background\nwe have to go over.\n\n209\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.360\nAnd then we're going to configure,\nand verify, and do IPN, and IPV6.\n\n210\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.730\nBut nonetheless,\nto configure EIGRP is really easy.\n\n211\n00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.530\nWe say router EIGRP and we make up\na number between one and 65,353.\n\n212\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.630\nOkay, so we make up a number,\ndoesn't matter what number it is.\n\n213\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.850\nHowever, every router that you\nwant to share information with\n\n214\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.470\nmust have the same number.\n\n215\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.350\nCan a router be a part of two automatisms?\n\n216\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.140\nSure it can.\n\n217\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.840\nAbsolutely it can.\n\n218\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.780\nIt can be a part of as many as you want.\n\n219\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.790\nAnyways, you typically would only have\none, but you might have more than one.\n\n220\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.670\nNotice these all have 100.\n\n221\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.070\nRouter eigrp 100.\n\n222\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.020\nNow the rest of\nthe configuration at this point,\n\n223\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.640\nwe'll get into a little bit different\nof a configuration in a second,\n\n224\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.900\nis that router eigrp 100 and\nthen our network statements are classhold.\n\n225\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.450\nSo notice there done just like what we\ndone with rip because Cisco sat there and\n\n226\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.750\nsaid lets put this great routing\nprotocol out, but everyone said\n\n227\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.430\nwell if it's hard to configure those\npfs nobody is going to use it.\n\n228\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.770\nEveryone was using rip for a reason not\nbecause it was great it's scaled and\n\n229\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.190\ncan figure how to turn on.\n\n230\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.000\nSo by making EIGRP, saying type in router\nEIGRP and a number that you like, and\n\n231\n00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.090\nthen typing the same network statements\nyou have into rip now it'll start working,\n\n232\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.680\nand that was a true statement at the time.\n\n233\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.980\nSo anyways, 172-16 because notice over\nhere 172-16 and ten network, alright,\n\n234\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.761\nclassful network numbers can I use inverse\n[INAUDIBLE] that we did with access lists\n\n235\n00:11:55.761 --> 00:12:02.210\nback in ICNV1 And that we're going\nto use with DOS PF, yes we can.\n\n236\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.670\nNetwork 192.168.10 and 10 yes, we can.\n\n237\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.160\nThe one thing guys, I've got to be\nhonest with you, EIGRP is simple, so\n\n238\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.950\nyou having to configure it maybe is\na little easy for ICND 2 troubleshooting.\n\n239\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.190\nThe one thing you're going to do, there's\na few things, we'll go through them all,\n\n240\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.130\nbut one of them, they'll have 100 here\nThis one'll say 200, this one'll say 300,\n\n241\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.560\nand let's say what's\nwrong with this picture?\n\n242\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.670\nAll right, they have different autono\nsys numbers, that'll never work.\n\n243\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.060\nOr you don't have all your\nnetwork statements in.\n\n244\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.490\nOr your network statement has a typo.\n\n245\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.350\nOr your network statement, underneath your\nrouter process, has a passive interface,\n\n246\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.750\nwhich we'll take a look at.\n\n247\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.510\nVery few little problems\nwe can have with the EIGRP.\n\n248\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.690\nVery easy to troubleshoot, so\n\n249\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.780\nI tell my students thank god if\nyou get any EIGRP troubleshooting,\n\n250\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.440\nbecause there's very little things\nthat can go wrong compared to OSPF.\n\n251\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.530\nSo anyways, now,\nlet's talk about this for a second.\n\n252\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.542\nIf I'm running 12.x code or lower,\ntypically we run in 12.2, 12.3,\n\n253\n00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.310\n12.4, something like that, and\nthen we went up to 15 code.\n\n254\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.350\nBut nonetheless,\none of the things that EIGRP,\n\n255\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.580\nit wouldn't advertise subnets\njust like with version 2.\n\n256\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.430\nWe had to go in there and\ndo the no autosummary.\n\n257\n00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.350\nWe don't have to do that with EIGRP\nin fifth starting and 15th code.\n\n258\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.880\nI mean this outlet is purpose on\nthis is more than a decade ago\n\n259\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.730\nto summarize class for boundaries,\nthe autosummary that was ridiculous.\n\n260\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.590\nAnyway, so in this case here,\nif we had 12x here or\n\n261\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.050\nwe have auto-summary enabled,\nthen this guy is 172165, this guy is 6.\n\n262\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.960\nThey are both going to say,\nHey, 17216 is over here.\n\n263\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.670\nOkay, so prior to 15,\nwe did not advertise subnets and\n\n264\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.320\nthis is a discontiguous network.\n\n265\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.560\nThat didn't work.\n\n266\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.330\nSo, what did we do?\n\n267\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.910\nWe had to do the 'no auto-summary'\ncommand, no auto-summary.\n\n268\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.230\nSo if you saw the RIP1 or if you\nunderstand this already that's fine.\n\n269\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.800\nOnce I do the no auto-summary, and\nyou should do this no matter what.\n\n270\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.830\nNow, so if you're on your exam or\nor whatever you're doing,\n\n271\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.440\nand you wanna know if this is a problem,\n\n272\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.250\ncuz this would be a troubleshooting\nspot because I've seen it both ways.\n\n273\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.310\nEven though this exam is\nsupposed to be built on 15.2.\n\n274\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.590\nIt might be running a twelve four.\n\n275\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.610\nHow can you tell?\n\n276\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.190\nVery simple.\n\n277\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.650\nI'm going to go to each router.\n\n278\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:14.270\nAnd to troubleshoot EIRGP and\nwe'll go through this, it's not a problem.\n\n279\n00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.300\nI'm just going to do a show run.\n\n280\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.760\nAnd at the very top it's going to\nhave a couple things, not very many.\n\n281\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.470\nAnd it's going to say the version number.\n\n282\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.830\nIf it says 15 X something.\n\n283\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.110\nThen you know you don't have to\nworry about the summary command.\n\n284\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.864\nIf it sells 12 something,\nthen type in no auto summary.\n\n285\n00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:35.060\nNow the path calculation,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n286\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.890\nSo I'm router C here.\n\n287\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:45.330\nI've got a neighbor table, a topology\ntable And a routing table, right.\n\n288\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.840\nSo I'm first gonna come up and\nfind out who my neighbors are.\n\n289\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.940\nLet's take a look here.\n\n290\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.280\nSo if I'm a router C,\n\n291\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.360\nI'm directly connected to E to\nrouter A off of the Ethernet 0.\n\n292\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.848\nI'm directly connected to\nrouter B off of Ethernet 1.\n\n293\n00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:05.370\nDamn it, Ethernet 1,\nthere we go, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.790\nAnyways, so I've got E0 E1.\n\n295\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:13.210\nNow, for them to get to this network here,\nthey're advertising this network 10.1.1.0.\n\n296\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.388\nSo they're directly connected\noff of here to 10.1.1.0 network.\n\n297\n00:15:19.388 --> 00:15:21.641\n10.1.1.0.\n\n298\n00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:25.600\nNow, Router A is advertising, this is\ncalled the advertised distance, and\n\n299\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:33.210\nRouter A is saying To get to 10 1 1 0\nthrough me it's going to cost you 1000,\n\n300\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.380\nwhatever $1000, 1000 Euros, whatever.\n\n301\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.400\nAlright router B says to get to 10 1 1\n0 it's going to cost you 1500, well we\n\n302\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.580\nhaven't decided that we are going to go\nthrough router B just because of that.\n\n303\n00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:53.300\nThe other thing we've got to calculate\nis our time to get to router A and B.\n\n304\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.520\nSo we're gonna use that smooth round\ntrip time in order to determine, right?\n\n305\n00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.459\nWhat is our delay to get to A and B?\n\n306\n00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:06.788\nWe're going to then add that to what\ncame to us as an advertise distance.\n\n307\n00:16:06.788 --> 00:16:11.937\nSo A says to get to \"10.1.1.0\" To go\nthrough it may cost you a thousand.\n\n308\n00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:15.468\nWe add what it costs me to get to\nA to come up with what's called\n\n309\n00:16:15.468 --> 00:16:16.800\na Feasible Distance.\n\n310\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.754\nThis is my true cost to get to 10.1.1.0.\n\n311\n00:16:24.754 --> 00:16:27.949\nNow they changed this name a little bit,\nAdvertised distance,\n\n312\n00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:32.910\nbecause people see that, say, AD, that's\nthe trustworthiness of a routing protocol.\n\n313\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.320\nSo they've changed the name and\n\n314\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.975\nyou might gonna see it as,\nReported Distance, it's the same thing.\n\n315\n00:16:38.975 --> 00:16:43.640\nThey recalled it that because everyone's\nlike FD, FD or AD, AD, AD, I'm so\n\n316\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.780\nconfused, Advertised Distance,\nAdministrative Distance, which one is it?\n\n317\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.780\nRight, so this will be,\nand sometimes referred to,\n\n318\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.550\non the exam objectives as\nReported Distance, same thing.\n\n319\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.832\nMy Reported Distance to get to\n10.1.1.0 through me is 1,000,\n\n320\n00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:58.431\nthrough router B it's 1,500.\n\n321\n00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:03.610\nI add my cost to them and\ncome up with my Feasible Distance.\n\n322\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.369\nThat's the only thing that matters,\nis the Feasible Distance.\n\n323\n00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:15.310\nSo then I copy the winner into\nthe routing table, so we can see that.\n\n324\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.572\nSo here's my successor and\nthen my feasible successor.\n\n325\n00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:23.660\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat another configuration here.\n\n326\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.949\nI did this two different\nways on this one here.\n\n327\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.370\nSo on the branch here Router EIGRP 100.\n\n328\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:38.234\nThe number is irrelevant as long as\nthey're the same on every router you're\n\n329\n00:17:38.234 --> 00:17:40.671\ngonna share EIGRP information with.\n\n330\n00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:45.110\nSo notice I typed in 10.0.0.0 and\n192.168.1.0.\n\n331\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.330\nI chose the classical manner\non how to do it here.\n\n332\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.800\nOn the corp router, though,\n\n333\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.058\nright, I just made sure\nthe autonomous system is the same.\n\n334\n00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:58.590\nNotice this 172.16.1.0.0.0.255.\n\n335\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.891\nIf you don't understand the inverse mask,\n\n336\n00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:04.090\nrun back to ICD 1 into access\nlist are the same thing.\n\n337\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.900\nWe'll also use the same thing in OSPF.\n\n338\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.781\nNow, this one here, I'm directly also\nconnected, 172.16.1.0 and 192.168.\n\n339\n00:18:13.781 --> 00:18:19.790\nSo this could've been\n172.16.0.0.0.0.255.255 as well,\n\n340\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.080\nor in this one here, 192.168.1.0.\n\n341\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.200\nSo notice I use the inverse mask.\n\n342\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.090\nIs there any difference?\n\n343\n00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.950\nNo.\n\n344\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.263\nI'm gonna show you like three or\nfour different ways to configure OSPF, and\n\n345\n00:18:29.263 --> 00:18:30.317\nwhat do you end up with?\n\n346\n00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:32.100\n0's in the routing table.\n\n347\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.090\nIt doesn't matter how you configure,\nas long as you do it correctly.\n\n348\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.580\nThese are two different\nways to do the same thing.\n\n349\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.020\nOne of these ways is not\nbetter than the other.\n\n350\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.970\nI don't even tell people\nto do inverse pass.\n\n351\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.840\nWhy?\nIf you can do it without them, do it.\n\n352\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.480\nYou have to do this because you'll\nsee this on the exam objectives.\n\n353\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.750\nNo big deal.\n\n354\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.320\nLet's spend some time verifying.\n\n355\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.250\nSo we have the same router here,\nsame configuration.\n\n356\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.870\nI'm on the branch here.\n\n357\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.430\nThe branch router has one neighbor.\n\n358\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.640\nNotice that this is just how I'm listed\nin there, I'm 0, then you'd have 1-2-3.\n\n359\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.710\nHere's my address of my neighbor,\nthe interface they're off of.\n\n360\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.010\nHow long they've been in my table,\nthe uptime.\n\n361\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.080\nHere's my my smooth round trip time,\n1596 milliseconds.\n\n362\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.750\nThat's kind of high, actually.\n\n363\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.562\nBut then again,\nthis is a serial interface.\n\n364\n00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:22.570\nRound trip time out, round trip time out.\n\n365\n00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.900\nSo, what this means is, how long would\nit take before I would time out,\n\n366\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.450\nif I didn't get an answer.\n\n367\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.660\nNow, this queue count is what\nyou want to keep an eye on.\n\n368\n00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.340\nAnd it's not something you're gonna look\nout on LAN links and notice that it's 0,\n\n369\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.850\ntypically it'll always be zero on LANs,\nbut on serial links, what you're gonna do\n\n370\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.530\nis say, when I send out a hello every\nfive seconds, I expect a response, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.430\nDon't diss me, man,\nyou gotta respond to me.\n\n372\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.870\nAnd if I don't,\nmy queue count is backing up,\n\n373\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.920\nwaiting, I'm waiting for\nan acknowledgement.\n\n374\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.560\nSo when you have a serial line,\ntypically this is where I've seen this in\n\n375\n00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.930\nproduction, if I had a serial\nline that's noisy and\n\n376\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.620\nhaving problems, I can go out there and\nsee my queue count incrementing and\n\n377\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.670\nthen I know I've got a problem,\nI've got to call in my noisy line, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.790\nAnd the sequence numbers\ndon't really mean anything.\n\n379\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.040\nOn this one here,\nlet's take a look at the same thing.\n\n380\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.920\nFrom the corp, so notice this,\nthat I've actually got a better,\n\n381\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.240\nsmooth round trip time so this would\nactually tell me to call in over here.\n\n382\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.430\nThat I'm probably noisier over here,\npossibly.\n\n383\n00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.990\nBut none the less, my smooth round\ntrip time is a lot less, right?\n\n384\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.460\nAnd then the rest of this the same.\n\n385\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.540\nKeep eye on your smooth round trip times,\nand when you have a LAN,\n\n386\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.190\nif you’re on a gig [INAUDIBLE]\nit’s not really an issue today.\n\n387\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.780\nIf you still have serial links, and\nthat’s going to be an issue, and\n\n388\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.330\nwe’re using serials here.\n\n389\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.870\nShow IPEIGRP interface.\n\n390\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:47.727\nNotice that I don’t have any peers here\nbecause off a here there are no routers.\n\n391\n00:20:47.727 --> 00:20:53.254\nSo I have one peer off of F00, unreliable,\nreliable I don't have any retransmits,\n\n392\n00:20:53.254 --> 00:20:58.175\nmean smooth round trip time so there's\nmy 1596, the same thing as I saw in\n\n393\n00:20:58.175 --> 00:21:02.565\nmy neighbors, and then the rest of\nthis is just fine but this is just,\n\n394\n00:21:02.565 --> 00:21:07.990\nyou're gonna come in here and take a look\nat this to see if you see your neighbors.\n\n395\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.420\nJust see if you guys are talking,\njust see if it's incrementing.\n\n396\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.550\nSo show IP EIGRP neighbors,\ninterfaces, I typically don't\n\n397\n00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.420\nuse this command because if I'm seeing the\nneighbors, I know that they're in there.\n\n398\n00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.500\nNow, show IP route.\n\n399\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.700\nOkay, so we're gonna see directly\nconnected, there's my link.\n\n400\n00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.384\nThis is D for dual saying hey,\n172.16, now let's dissect this.\n\n401\n00:21:27.384 --> 00:21:29.427\n90 is what?\n\n402\n00:21:29.427 --> 00:21:34.940\nThe Administrative Distance, don't get\nthat confused with Advertised Distance.\n\n403\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.200\nOkay?\nNow this 156, 160, that's my metric,\n\n404\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.030\nbut in this case it's my Feasible\nDistance, which is the reported distance\n\n405\n00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.200\nto me plus my cost to that router,\nbecomes my Feasible Distance.\n\n406\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.160\nThis is my complete cost.\n\n407\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.780\nA complete cost.\n\n408\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.910\nNow if I lose this guy and\nI don't have a path,\n\n409\n00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.140\nI'm gonna look for an Advertised Distance,\n\n410\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.530\na Reported Distance, of less than\nmy Advertised Distance now, right?\n\n411\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.260\nSo I'm not gonna look for\none that's higher.\n\n412\n00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.000\nI'm gonna only get a Feasible Distance\nthat's lower than my\n\n413\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.440\nReported Distance, now.\n\n414\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.346\nThat gets a little confusing,\nI understand that.\n\n415\n00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:17.971\nAll right, so we can see that\nwe have 172.16.1.0 off of 000,\n\n416\n00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:21.760\nwe can see it right here and\nhe's going to 1.2.\n\n417\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.200\nOkay, this is not my Advertise Distance,\nmy Administrative Distance is 90,\n\n418\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.060\nthis is my composite metric,\n\n419\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.310\na band with a delay at the line from\nend to end to get to 172.16.10.\n\n420\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.540\nOkay, so the topology table,\nthis is important.\n\n421\n00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.070\nNow, the topology table is gonna\nshow me every link in the network.\n\n422\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.660\nThis thing can be huge.\n\n423\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.810\nThere is nothing inside your\nsystem that won't be in here.\n\n424\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:53.410\nOk, p by the way is passive,\nwhich is good.\n\n425\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.550\nSo P stands for passive.\n\n426\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.450\nYou think that's passive, what it means\nis I've found all the best paths,\n\n427\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.450\nI am not actively looking so A is bad.\n\n428\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.600\nI'm actively looking for\na path through that route.\n\n429\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.750\nYou get some things called stuck in\nactive, as well, can't get them out,\n\n430\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.910\nit's really hard sometimes.\n\n431\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.000\nBut nonetheless, p stands for passive.\n\n432\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.750\nNow check this out, if someone wants\nto say, hey, here is an output and\n\n433\n00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.410\nthey don't have the host name here,\nwhich router did this come from?\n\n434\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.080\nWell you're gonna look for\nthe via connected, via connected.\n\n435\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.072\nSo I can see on via connected to 1.0 and\n10.1.1.0 So\n\n436\n00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:30.010\nthere's 192.168.1.0 and 10.1.1.0.\n\n437\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.635\nSo, obviously it's the branch.\n\n438\n00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:33.156\nBut look for the via connected.\n\n439\n00:23:33.156 --> 00:23:34.317\nBut here's my other one.\n\n440\n00:23:34.317 --> 00:23:36.998\nCheck this out, this is important to you.\n\n441\n00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:39.361\nBecause there gonna show you\nsomething like this and then say,\n\n442\n00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:41.940\nwho's gonna be your feasible\nsuccessor if you lose this route?\n\n443\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.800\nOkay, so let's take a look.\n\n444\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.948\nSo you have one successor, so\n\n445\n00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:48.709\nthis would tell me if I had to\npaths to the same network or more.\n\n446\n00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:51.599\nMy feasible distance,\nthat's my feasible distance,\n\n447\n00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:55.230\nthat's what we saw on the routing table,\n156160, all right?\n\n448\n00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.870\nSo check this out,\nthat's my Feasible Distance.\n\n449\n00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.093\nAnd I'm gonna write this is\nas my Reported Distance, so\n\n450\n00:24:01.093 --> 00:24:03.228\nwe don't get that confused with AD.\n\n451\n00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:07.283\nSo the Reported Distance coming\nfrom the router off of 000, says,\n\n452\n00:24:07.283 --> 00:24:10.115\nto get through me, you're 128256 away.\n\n453\n00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:14.617\nAnd then I added my cost to that router\nto come up with my feasible distance.\n\n454\n00:24:14.617 --> 00:24:19.304\nOkay guys, if I lose this one,\nI'm going to have to find a feasible\n\n455\n00:24:19.304 --> 00:24:23.340\nassessor that has a reported\ndistance of less than that.\n\n456\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.380\nNot higher or equal to.\n\n457\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.960\nThe only way I'm going to pick\na feasible successor if it comes up,\n\n458\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.050\nis lower than the one I had,\nhave, or have now.\n\n459\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.890\nHad or have now, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.750\nSo when you look at an option, go look for\n\n461\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.770\na reported distance that's\nless than what you have now.\n\n462\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.000\nAll right, that's the answer to that.\n\n463\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.180\nThat one's kind of confusing,\nI get that one.\n\n464\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.210\nNow, it's very important that we\nunderstand passive interfaces not so\n\n465\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.210\nmuch in your config.\n\n466\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.380\nThey're gonna rip you on\ntroubleshooting on this CCNA.\n\n467\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.270\nAnd they're gonna put access\nlists on your routing protocols.\n\n468\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.050\nThey're gonna put passive interfaces.\n\n469\n00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.877\nThey're gonna give you wrong systems.\n\n470\n00:24:58.877 --> 00:25:00.770\nThey're gonna have wrong network numbers.\n\n471\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.451\nThey're gonna give you wrong k values,\nright?\n\n472\n00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:05.338\nThose are the things we're gonna\ntake a look at, we'll get there so\n\n473\n00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:06.098\njust hang with me.\n\n474\n00:25:06.098 --> 00:25:08.620\nEGRP analysis,\ndirectly connected networks.\n\n475\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:14.280\nOn all of the interface I'm going to\nsend out here 2240010 and 224, but why?\n\n476\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.330\nThere's no routers out there.\n\n477\n00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.860\nThere never will be any routers out there.\n\n478\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.940\nSo let's take a look.\n\n479\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.190\nSo this is gonna reduce\nsome traffic overhead.\n\n480\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.640\nReally, it stops your host from having\nto digest these multi-casts and\n\n481\n00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.420\ndeleting them which is really\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n482\n00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.630\nBut nonetheless, there's a couple\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n483\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.800\nThe first thing is,\nI come in here, configure it.\n\n484\n00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.070\nNotice I used a inverse mask here,\nbut then just a class address here.\n\n485\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.890\nI can do that.\n\n486\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.780\nThat's the greatest thing about\nEIJRP because, why did I do that?\n\n487\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.720\nIt felt good.\n\n488\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.890\nI can just do whatever I want.\n\n489\n00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.800\nAnd as long as I configure it correctly,\nI get D's in the routing table.\n\n490\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.260\nAnd then past interface gig 0,0.\n\n491\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.390\nAnd I did the same thing over here.\n\n492\n00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.950\nThere's another way to do this,\nlet's take a look at the next slide.\n\n493\n00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.820\nSo I configured them both,\nuse inverse mass and\n\n494\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.720\nnot, it doesn't matter as\nlong as these are the same.\n\n495\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.160\nRight network numbers in there,\n\n496\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.080\nthat's a 172.17 now,\nnotice I updated that network statement.\n\n497\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.690\nOkay, let's take a look here,\non this guy here, check this out.\n\n498\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.690\nSo here I am on R1 over here and I say\nshow running config, this guy's EIGRP 110,\n\n499\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.070\ndoesn't matter as long as the other one's\n110, but check this out what I typed here.\n\n500\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:24.560\nI don't know if I went through this\non the version two one or not.\n\n501\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.350\nIt says passive-interface default.\n\n502\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.610\nPast, you know what that says\nis hey turn on the EIGRP, but\n\n503\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.850\ndon't multicast out any interfaces.\n\n504\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.500\nSo you effectively disable the EIGRP.\n\n505\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.920\nNow why would you do that?\n\n506\n00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.190\nBecause, you're on the exam, I just don't\ndo this in productions, it's ridiculous,\n\n507\n00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.580\nhave you ever done that Ronnie?\n\n508\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.240\n>> I have not.\n\n509\n00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.880\n>> Yeah,\nhave you known anyone that's done that?\n\n510\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.030\n>> No.\n>> Yeah, so the only time I've seen this,\n\n511\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.490\nit used to be on the CCNP exams,\n\n512\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.790\nI seen that when I was teaching CCNP and\nnow they brought it down here.\n\n513\n00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.160\nThey say, turn it all off,\nand then turn her on.\n\n514\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.420\nThere's your troubleshooting right there,\nguys.\n\n515\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.140\nI'm telling you.\n\n516\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.800\nPay attention to what\nI'm saying right now.\n\n517\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.090\nSomeone's gonna go in and\nturn on passive interface default.\n\n518\n00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.190\nYou could see this with either\nthe show run or show ip protocols, and\n\n519\n00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.300\nit's gonna show it to you in there.\n\n520\n00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.640\nThat's the only place you're gonna see it,\nright?\n\n521\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.610\nAnd so your going to see\npassive interface default and\n\n522\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.870\nyour not going to see any no commands,\ncuz no here.\n\n523\n00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.040\nSo now I'm enabling the interface,\nI want it on.\n\n524\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.890\nWith a no passive interface\n0001 in this example.\n\n525\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.750\nAll right, so that's this guy.\n\n526\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.930\nActually, this should be,\nall right so I made a typo.\n\n527\n00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.939\nAll right, [LAUGH], all right so\n\n528\n00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:29.960\nanyways turn them all off turn\non the ones that you want.\n\n529\n00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.660\nOkay?\nSo, basically that's a way to do it.\n\n530\n00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.640\nI'm not telling you to do it that way.\n\n531\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.000\nThey will absolutely do that\non the objectives for you.\n\n532\n00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.785\nLook for the Passive Interface default,\nmake sure that you have the no\n\n533\n00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:45.310\npassive-interface Serial, and\nthe correct ones listed under there.\n\n534\n00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.800\nSo let's say I didn't make a typo here,\nand this was serial 0/0/0, and\n\n535\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.000\nthen you see this config, and\nthey're saying why doesn't this work?\n\n536\n00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.590\nWell, cuz with the no command,\nwe enabled the wrong interface, didn't we?\n\n537\n00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.140\nCuz that would show serial 000.\n\n538\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.370\nI meant to do that Ronnie.\n\n539\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.878\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:28:04.878 --> 00:28:05.387\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n541\n00:28:05.387 --> 00:28:06.177\n>> Now on the metric, guys,\n\n542\n00:28:06.177 --> 00:28:08.043\nlet's take a look here.\nWe use bandwidth and\n\n543\n00:28:08.043 --> 00:28:11.013\ndelay of the line and we use these\nK values we're gonna take a look\n\n544\n00:28:11.013 --> 00:28:13.903\nat.\nOkay, and so bandwidth basically, metric\n\n545\n00:28:13.903 --> 00:28:18.333\nequals bandwidth plus delay times 256.\nI'm hoping that you guys don't\n\n546\n00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:22.650\nhave to remember this, but we might,\nwe're could take a look at it.\n\n547\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:27.170\nSo, bandwidth equals 10 to the seventh,\nat minimum of the advertised bandwidth and\n\n548\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.220\nlink bandwidth and\nthen advertised delay and link delay.\n\n549\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.770\nOK?\nSo then we take that bandwidth and\n\n550\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.170\ndelay and times it by 286.\n\n551\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.990\nThat's quite a metric, guys,\nthat's quite a metric.\n\n552\n00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.010\nThis, remember, bandwidth and\ndelay in the line.\n\n553\n00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.690\nNow, we can do equal-cost load balancing,\nand we're going to do that by default,\n\n554\n00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.310\nwe're going to go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n555\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.770\nWhen we go out and do EIGRP,\nwe're going to turn it on and\n\n556\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.530\nsee our equal load balance.\n\n557\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.490\nSo equal load balancing up to four routers\n\n558\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.490\nby default with a metric\nequal to the minimum metric.\n\n559\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.870\nSo if by default we will load\nbalance across four, but\n\n560\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:04.820\nwe can configure it up from sixteen to\nthirty-two depending on the IOS now on\n\n561\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.860\nunequal cost paths I can configure it and\nwe get this thing called a variance.\n\n562\n00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.060\nAnd we can do something\nup to a 128 times worse.\n\n563\n00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.690\nI wouldn't probably do that because\nthat would be a trickle but\n\n564\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.550\nyou can do something like two or\nthree times worse and it would go out and\n\n565\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.850\nfind those and\nlow balance then accordingly.\n\n566\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.190\nyou gotta be careful with that,\nit gets a little convoluted.\n\n567\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.650\nSo let's take a look at those.\n\n568\n00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:33.390\nRouting protocol,\nnow this is the show ip protocols command.\n\n569\n00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.980\nI can run this from User Mode.\n\n570\n00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.890\nRouting protocols EIGRP 100.\n\n571\n00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.317\nOkay my metric weight,\nhere check this out.\n\n572\n00:29:42.494 --> 00:29:45.320\nBandwidth, and delay.\n\n573\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.220\nOkay.\n\n574\n00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.110\nYour next troubleshooting spot, guys.\n\n575\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.490\nI'm gonna have two routers.\n\n576\n00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.650\nWhy aren't these guys\nforming an adjacency?\n\n577\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.480\nWell I'm gonna check my\nautonomous assistant number.\n\n578\n00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.500\nI'm gonna check my network statements.\n\n579\n00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.730\nI'm gonna check my passive interfaces.\n\n580\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.130\nI just make sure I don't have\nthe wrong passive interfaces on.\n\n581\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.280\nI'm telling you you're gonna\nget all three of those.\n\n582\n00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.970\nThe fourth thing you're gonna\nget is the k values don't match.\n\n583\n00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.220\nThe default k values are K1 and\nK3 as we can see here.\n\n584\n00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.860\nSomeone's gonna go over there and\nturn on K2, K4, K5, so\n\n585\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.970\nyou're gonna say you\nhave a K value mismatch.\n\n586\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.330\nIf those don't match\nthen you're not going to.\n\n587\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.270\nNow that's pretty rare, that, you should\nnever see this in reduction, right?\n\n588\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.640\nNo one should ever play with those, but\n\n589\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.850\nif they did,\nthen that's where you're gonna look.\n\n590\n00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.170\nSo IP protocols is your friend.\n\n591\n00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.950\nI can do anything, cuz notice this, I see\nwhat I'm routing for so I see the network\n\n592\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.800\nnumbers that I configured for\nEIGRP which we saw up here of course.\n\n593\n00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.930\nMy k value is this hop count is not,\nwe don't use hops for our metric.\n\n594\n00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.440\nThat's how far can a rod update packet go,\n100 hops.\n\n595\n00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.650\nYou can change that to 2db5,\n\n596\n00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.580\nbut that's because you only do that\nif you had a bad network design.\n\n597\n00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.480\nAll right,\nnow this variance now becomes important.\n\n598\n00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.010\nOne means equal cost load balancing,\n\n599\n00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.350\nand how many paths can we do\nequal cost load balancing across?\n\n600\n00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.450\nWell RIP, EIGRP an OSPF all do\nfour equal cost paths by default.\n\n601\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.790\nNow if I change that to a two then it's\ntwo times the variance difference.\n\n602\n00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.190\nIn other words, two times worst value, so\n\n603\n00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.240\nyou typically want to be careful in\nhow you want to play with these.\n\n604\n00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.940\nI haven't set one to more\nthan like three I think.\n\n605\n00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.370\nSo you wanna do two or three and\nplay with it and see what you got.\n\n606\n00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.120\nOkay?\n\n607\n00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.552\nBe very careful that that variance\nbecomes very important to you.\n\n608\n00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:23.640\nAll right guys, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo our lab now.\n\n609\n00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.770\nWant to take a break in between here?\n\n610\n00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:26.850\n>> Let's go ahead and do that, then.\n\n611\n00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.310\nWhat we have seen here\nin EIGRP is that we've\n\n612\n00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.380\ntalked about the basic\ninformation that we need to know.\n\n613\n00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.130\nWhen getting ready for the CCNA of EIGIRP.\n\n614\n00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:40.980\nAll right this is that CISCO Proprietor\nProtocol that's now kind of open and\n\n615\n00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.580\nout there, but\nit's implementation is actually very hardy\n\n616\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.660\nin the way that's it actually implemented\nit gets us to a route free network and\n\n617\n00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.550\nwe had that you remember there\nis a lot of details behind it.\n\n618\n00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.470\nSo when getting it set up it's\nactually very easy even though\n\n619\n00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.930\nit's a fairly complex system and\nactually works very well for us.\n\n620\n00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.700\nNow, we're about to get ready for\nour lab, but\n\n621\n00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.700\nwe want to make sure that you actually\ngo through this information first and\n\n622\n00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.890\nif any of it sounds foreign,\nmake sure you actually repeat it again and\n\n623\n00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.780\nalso take a look in Todd's book as well to\nhelp you to bone up on that information.\n\n624\n00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.550\nBut this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off then.\n\n625\n00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.800\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n626\n00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.880\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n627\n00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.100\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA routing and switching

00:00:19.873\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ntaking a look at ICND2 content getting\n\n4\n00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:24.360\nready for the CCNA Routing and Switching\nexam that Cisco has just released.\n\n5\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.860\nTo help us to actually make sure that\nwe're focusing in on what we need to we\n\n6\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.760\nhave Mr. Todd Lammle here in our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.010\nThank you for being here.\n\n8\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.980\n>> Thank you, Ronnie,\nlet's dive right back into our lab.\n\n9\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.170\nWe just finished EIGRP, but we've\ngotta go, I didn't even mention IPV6.\n\n10\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700\nIPV6 for EIGRP is even easier\nthan what I showed you with IPV4.\n\n11\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290\nIt's a separate table, so if you have\na neighbor table, topology table, and\n\n12\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.220\nrouting table, for AJRP, version 4, then\nyou have those same things or versions,\n\n13\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.630\nso we just use more RAM.\n\n14\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.180\nBut let's go ahead and take the\nconfiguration, if you can believe it or\n\n15\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.250\nnot, is even easier, if anything\ncould get any easier than that,\n\n16\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.930\nlet's take a look at my lab here.\n\n17\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.640\nSo if we look at this, guys,\nwe're gonna see what we have here.\n\n18\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.720\nThis is as big as I can get it.\n\n19\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.200\nSo I have my IPv6 that I'm going to\nconfigure in here, and I don't have all\n\n20\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580\nthese in here, so I'm gonna have to put\nthose in there now that I think about it.\n\n21\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.690\nBut I did draw it out here.\n\n22\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.849\nNotice that I have two\nserial links over here.\n\n23\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.560\nOkay, two serial links between the LA and\nthe Corp here.\n\n24\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.786\nAnd then we're going to\nhave the IPv6 in here, so\n\n25\n00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.125\nI'm gonna have to end up stopping here\nwhen we get halfway through the lab,\n\n26\n00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.510\nwe're gonna pause while I\nput in my IPv6 addresses.\n\n27\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.684\nBut nonetheless I'm gonna add all of\nthese in here and I've got my IPv4,\n\n28\n00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:39.988\ntwo links between LA and San Francisco.\n\n29\n00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:43.399\nWe're gonna use these both with EIGRP,\nOSPF, I'm gonna just change the bandwidth,\n\n30\n00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.671\nright now they're equal path.\n\n31\n00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.485\nLet's go out into Corp router now,\nso I'm gonna put this behind us for\n\n32\n00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:54.460\na second, and let's go out and\ntake a look at our routers here, okay, so\n\n33\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580\nthere's my Corp router.\n\n34\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.440\nSo if I was to do a show IP route and\n\n35\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.190\nwe were running RIP from a few\nepisodes back and take a look.\n\n36\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.120\nSo now that I added that second link\nin there, look what popped out.\n\n37\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.319\nSo now I have two paths\nto network 30 via RIP,\n\n38\n00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.120\nadministrative 120 one hop away\nvia 10.10 and 10.6, right?\n\n39\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.466\nSo out different serial\ninterfaces over here.\n\n40\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.440\nAll right, now also down here\nto get to network 20, right?\n\n41\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.450\nWe can get there via 10.10 and 10.6 which\nis out Corp Serial0/2/0 and Serial0/1/0.\n\n42\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.550\nSo now Corp has two paths\nto each remote network.\n\n43\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.660\nLet's go back out here now to the LA\nrouter, and take a look what it found.\n\n44\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390\nFirst off, underneath, hold on,\nI wanna show you something.\n\n45\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.530\nUnderneath show run router rip,\nI think I should be able to take that in.\n\n46\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.090\nNo, I guess not.\n\n47\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.864\nShow run.\n\n48\n00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:57.090\nHm, it should've worked.\n\n49\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.770\nThere it is, router rip.\n\n50\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.340\nNotice I have the, I thought I had\nthe distribute network under there.\n\n51\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.758\nI didn't, passive interface, I've got\na passive interface underneath there.\n\n52\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.960\nI'm past Serial0/0, and\nI have my different networks,\n\n53\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.920\nthe no auto summary which I need.\n\n54\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.030\nOkay, so I got, definitely have\na default route configured on here.\n\n55\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.971\nI thought, maybe,\nI was advertising it out, but nonetheless,\n\n56\n00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:23.642\nwe can see that I have\ntwo paths to 172.16.10.0.\n\n57\n00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:26.170\nNow to understand where that's\ncoming from let's take a look here.\n\n58\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.820\nHere's 172.16.10.0 subnet here.\n\n59\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.228\nSo LA has two paths to get to 10.0,\n\n60\n00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:37.366\nit's going to have two paths to\nget to 192.168.10.0 and 40.0.\n\n61\n00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:42.528\nSo let's take a look at that, so we should\nhave, yep, to 10.0 we have two paths to\n\n62\n00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:48.220\n172.16.10.0, 192.168.10.0,\nand 192.168.40.0.\n\n63\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.560\nAll the remote networks I\nhave two paths to get to now.\n\n64\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.420\nSo those are under RIP, but\nlet's go ahead and turn on EIGRP.\n\n65\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.200\nWe'll make it simple.\n\n66\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.480\nOkay, so I'm in the Corp router.\n\n67\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.760\nSo let's say,\nwhat number do you want to use Ronnie?\n\n68\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.330\nWhat number feels good to you?\n\n69\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.274\nEigrp node screen 165535.\n\n70\n00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:06.405\n>> Let's pick 15.\n\n71\n00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.770\n>> 15, Ronnie likes 15.\n\n72\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.220\nNow, when you guys are on\nyour exam objectives or\n\n73\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.790\npractice questions or whatever,\nyou're like what do I type in here?\n\n74\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.650\nWell this is pretty easy.\n\n75\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.740\nDo show, you do show run and\nsee what's in there, but\n\n76\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.440\nwe have a pretty big config here.\n\n77\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.500\nDo show ip int brief, right.\n\n78\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.290\nThis is gonna tell me what to type in.\n\n79\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.780\nSo basically here I am,\nI already typed in router eigrp 15 and\n\n80\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.670\nit's saying hey dummy type\nthese networks in here.\n\n81\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.700\nAll you do, this is all about me.\n\n82\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.150\nI don't care about my neighbors.\n\n83\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.168\nDon't worry about what your neighbors\nare doing, it's all about you.\n\n84\n00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:40.838\nI'm just gonna type this in.\n\n85\n00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:44.710\nI can type these in different ways,\nnotice I have the 172.16s and\n\n86\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.310\nthen I have this 20 which we use for our\nport channels, which I don't even know if\n\n87\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.330\nI still have that port channel configured,\nI thought I got rid of it.\n\n88\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.150\nNonetheless, I've got all my serials here.\n\n89\n00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.638\nSo I'm gonna say network,\nnow I could do this and I'd be done.\n\n90\n00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:05.970\nNetwork 172.16.0.0, and\nthat would cover everything.\n\n91\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.870\nThat was easy.\n\n92\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.410\nI could have easily used inverse masks and\ndone it further, but why?\n\n93\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.650\nI could do it just to show you, so\nyou understand it when you see it, but\n\n94\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.170\nother than that, it gives us no\nmore flexibility or functionality.\n\n95\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.900\nThe other one was, that's it cuz I'm not\nusing the 20, but I'm gonna type this in.\n\n96\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.580\nOkay, and you're like,\nwell why are you doing that?\n\n97\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.100\nBecause I need to go under\nmy fast ethernet zero and\n\n98\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.729\nput my address back in there which\nwe took off after our last lab.\n\n99\n00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:36.520\nOkay, so now I had already covered it.\n\n100\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.840\nNow hold on a second, Ronnie,\ndo I need to do the no-auto, I'm not sure.\n\n101\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.710\n>> It depends on the version of the iOS.\n\n102\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.801\n>> Right, so\nwhat do I type in to find out?\n\n103\n00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:47.030\n>> Show version?\n\n104\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.669\n>> Show version will work, show flash\nwill work, how about a do show run?\n\n105\n00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.635\n>> Right at the top, that's fine.\n\n106\n00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:57.047\n>> Okay, in this case, right at the top\nit's gonna tell me, I'm version 12.4,\n\n107\n00:05:57.047 --> 00:06:01.166\nnow this router was 15, but I upgraded\nit cuz it wasn't supporting IPV6.\n\n108\n00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:04.335\nSo, I actually upgraded it\nby downgrading it, whatever.\n\n109\n00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:10.060\nSo, now look at where I'm at, so I need\nto go under router eigrp 15 again and\n\n110\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.445\nsay no auto because I'm at version 12.4.\n\n111\n00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:14.260\nDo you see that?\n\n112\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.600\nPay attention.\n\n113\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.920\nWhat version are you on?\n\n114\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.950\nIf you're at 15, leave it alone.\n\n115\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.680\nIt doesn't an auto summarize by default.\n\n116\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.870\nIf I'm not, do a no auto.\n\n117\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.220\nIt's no auto here,\nlet me type out the full command.\n\n118\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.300\nI feel bad not showing them\nthe whole thing, right?\n\n119\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.530\nAll right, now let's go here.\n\n120\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:37.590\nI just gotta type in config t,\nrouter eigrp 15 is what we said.\n\n121\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.185\nNow again, I forgot to look at my\nnetwork numbers, but it's fine.\n\n122\n00:06:41.908 --> 00:06:46.028\nNetwork do show ip int brief, and\n\n123\n00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:50.970\nit says, hey dummy, type these in.\n\n124\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.250\nIt tells you.\n\n125\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.360\nIt doesn't matter what your neighbors\nare doing, it only matters what's right in\n\n126\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.860\nfront of you with the do show ip int\nbrief, do show ip route connected.\n\n127\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.560\nThose, it says type these numbers in.\n\n128\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.750\nIf you are doing dynamic routing, type in\nwhat you're directly connected to only.\n\n129\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.663\nSo in this case here, I gotta find out\nhow to find out how to do no auto still.\n\n130\n00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:12.950\nSo network, now, I can type this\nin a couple different ways.\n\n131\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.745\nI can type it in very simply, 192.168.0,\n\n132\n00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:20.636\nnot 0.0 because I've\nactually typed it in twice.\n\n133\n00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:25.280\nBut let's do this, I can do this, and I\ncan cover everything with one line, right?\n\n134\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.472\nBecause I'm making that third octet mean\nany value which will cover than 10 and 40.\n\n135\n00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:36.672\nI couldn't do this with one\nline without the inverse mask,\n\n136\n00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:43.955\nnot that it matters, but I could do it\nbecause it's fun, and then network 172.\n\n137\n00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:48.619\nNow, again this is where the errors occur,\nmake sure, so obviously I did\n\n138\n00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:53.077\nsomething right, but double check\nyour network statements, guys.\n\n139\n00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:53.703\nTypos happen all the time.\n\n140\n00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:56.119\nI almost typed in 192.16.00.\n\n141\n00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:56.676\nRight?\n\n142\n00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.940\nI mean, it's easy to make a typo.\n\n143\n00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.160\nYou're, really,\nthere's not many points here.\n\n144\n00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.520\nYour network statements.\n\n145\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.370\nYour autonomous system\nmust to be the same.\n\n146\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.390\nAnd let's do a, do show run,\nand verify my version number.\n\n147\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.320\nAnd he's 15.1, so\nthat's why he came up right away.\n\n148\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.020\nI don't need to do\nan [INAUDIBLE] summary here.\n\n149\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.780\nAnd do we have a discontinuous network?\n\n150\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.584\nWe do, we do.\n\n151\n00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:21.456\nBecause I have a 192 and\n168 over here, 192 and 168 over here,\n\n152\n00:08:21.456 --> 00:08:22.760\nacross 172.16 networks.\n\n153\n00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.794\nOkay?\nSo by doing that, I'm done here.\n\n154\n00:08:26.794 --> 00:08:29.480\nSo that was it, we just had to put\nour network statements in there.\n\n155\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.680\nI'm all set.\n\n156\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.700\nHopefully, maybe, I made a mistake.\n\n157\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.900\nTroubleshooting opportunity.\n\n158\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.842\nOkay?\n\n159\n00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:45.280\nRouter, eigrp 15.\n\n160\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.130\nOkay, now, again,\nI didn't do a do show ip int brief.\n\n161\n00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:52.730\nOkay.\nFast ethernets.\n\n162\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.760\nNotice I have,\nI'm not using the top one up here.\n\n163\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.530\nThat was my connection over\nmy other router when we were\n\n164\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.900\ndoing hsrpn and what not.\n\n165\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.940\nSo I'm not going to\ngonna that statement so,\n\n166\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.420\nIf I did I could put positive interface\ndefault and not turn that guy back on.\n\n167\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.220\nSo, that sounds fun.\n\n168\n00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.330\nFast ethernet.\n\n169\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.680\nWe've got a 20.1 and 172.\n\n170\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.650\n16s.\nWe've got a few in here, don't we?\n\n171\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.640\nI'm gonna use,\nlet's use one wildcard again.\n\n172\n00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.121\nSo I'm gonna say network 192.168.0.0.\n\n173\n00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:23.080\nIf you guys use the 0.0 here, you're\ngonna have to use your inverse mass.\n\n174\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.490\nBecause you have to type in\nthree octets for class C.\n\n175\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.718\nSo this will not work by\njust pressing Enter here.\n\n176\n00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:34.790\nSo, I'm going to have to do 0.0\nspace any value, space any value.\n\n177\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.870\nOkay?\n192.168.0.0 will not give you a CCNA.\n\n178\n00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.150\nYou will fail your exam.\n\n179\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.180\nYou have to type either 192.168.20.0,\npress Enter.\n\n180\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.703\nType in network 192.168.30.0, press Enter.\n\n181\n00:09:46.703 --> 00:09:51.228\nOr notice I used the inverse mask with 285\nin the third octet to cover any value.\n\n182\n00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:54.260\nMake sure it's,\nyou're clear on that one, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.856\nThe other one is network 172, 16.\n\n184\n00:09:56.856 --> 00:09:59.350\nI can use inverse mask,\nbut I don't have to.\n\n185\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.418\nAnd do show run.\n\n186\n00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:04.160\n[LAUGH] It's gonna tell\nme that it's working, but\n\n187\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.610\nif I look up here version 15 1.\n\n188\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.750\nAll right, so I'm good to go, and\nthat is all there is to eigrp.\n\n189\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.510\nI am up and running, my friends.\n\n190\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.262\nLet's go down here to the corp.\n\n191\n00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:23.770\nDid I turn on, so, I thought I,\nlet me do a show IP int brief.\n\n192\n00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.388\nI have a, This is very common to get,\n\n193\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.230\nSo, you know what was funny,\nis I had the same configuration with Rip.\n\n194\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.300\nIt didn't find the loop, but\nEIGRP found the loop, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.255\nWelcome to the EIGRP.\n\n196\n00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:42.460\n10.1, okay, so\nI've got a connection there.\n\n197\n00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.950\nI'll come back and fix that later.\n\n198\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.332\nBut nonetheless,\nEIGRP found the loop that RP would not.\n\n199\n00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:52.240\nCan you, and literally,\nnow let me ask you a question.\n\n200\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.580\nI'm running RIP in the background.\n\n201\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.060\nIt's taking up all my bandwidth,\nCPU processes, and whatever.\n\n202\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.595\nIs that still gonna have\nRIP on my routing table?\n\n203\n00:11:02.624 --> 00:11:03.180\nOkay.\n\n204\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.700\nLet's take a look.\n\n205\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.490\nShow IP route.\n\n206\n00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:08.265\nAnd notice, I only see D's.\n\n207\n00:11:08.265 --> 00:11:09.655\nAnd notice I still have the same thing.\n\n208\n00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:13.035\nTwo paths to network 30,\ntwo paths to network 20 from the corp.\n\n209\n00:11:13.035 --> 00:11:14.165\nWhat happened to the RIP?\n\n210\n00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:14.825\nIs it not running?\n\n211\n00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:15.785\nWell, let's take a look at that.\n\n212\n00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.475\nShow IP protocols.\n\n213\n00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:19.365\nAnd there's rip.\n\n214\n00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:20.695\nHe's running in all his glory.\n\n215\n00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:24.070\nWe've got all of these send two,\nreceive two.\n\n216\n00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.510\nAnd we've got our timers,\nhold down flush timers.\n\n217\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.150\nWe've got our maximum paths.\n\n218\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.342\nWe've got our routing for our networks,\nour passive interface, FastEthernet 0, 0.\n\n219\n00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:35.440\nAnd we've gotta come back and\ndo passive interfaces on EIGRP.\n\n220\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.060\nThat's what we need to do,\nthat'll stop my loop.\n\n221\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.470\nAll right.\nNow, let's come down here with EIGRP.\n\n222\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.050\nFirst off, we're gonna check\nour autonomous system number.\n\n223\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.720\nThere's my K values.\n\n224\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.300\nMake sure you guys can see this.\n\n225\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.640\nMake sure your K values\nmatch to your neighbors.\n\n226\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.730\nI'm not even gonna show you how to change\nthem because you'd never change them,\n\n227\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.770\nalthough it wouldn't be\nthat hard to figure out.\n\n228\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.480\nNetwork path four, and\nour variance is one.\n\n229\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.170\nSo, we're load balanced.\n\n230\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.690\nSo, remember, on our equal cross\npaths we automatically load balance.\n\n231\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.400\nWe're gonna come back, and\nI'm gonna make that a not Equal.\n\n232\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.610\nAll right.\n\n233\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.530\nSo, our administrative distance is 93.\n\n234\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.720\nYou're coming outside in our Tonto system,\nthen we'd be 170.\n\n235\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.710\nSo let's go up here and,\ncuz these guys are connected over here,\n\n236\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.670\nthey're really unhappy,\nthey're kind of bitching at me.\n\n237\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.380\nSo I'm gonna say config t Interface.\n\n238\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.421\nI'm sorry, not interface,\nrouter EIGRP 15, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:31.126\nCheck this out.\n\n240\n00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:36.570\nPassive-interface default.\n\n241\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.710\nThat'll fix it,\ncuz I just effectively disabled EIGRP.\n\n242\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.020\nAll right?\n\n243\n00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.850\nSo, you can see the something so\nis down, cuz I just I took it off now.\n\n244\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.783\nWhat it's complaining about is the corp\nwho it's has been talking to every five\n\n245\n00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:49.440\nseconds can no longer talk to.\n\n246\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.437\nSo let's do that over here, too.\n\n247\n00:12:52.343 --> 00:12:54.610\nI'm under the ERGRP already.\n\n248\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.590\nPassive-interface.\n\n249\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:03.110\nNow, if you're at work and\nyou're lonely, I recommend this command.\n\n250\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.260\nOkay?\nPassive-interface default.\n\n251\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.210\nThat way someone will call you, right?\n\n252\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.480\nI guarantee he'll call you.\n\n253\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.150\nIt might not be someone very happy, so it\nmight not be what you're looking for but\n\n254\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.210\nit would definitely give you\nsome company that afternoon.\n\n255\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.200\nNow, what we gotta do here is figure\nout which ones we want to turn on.\n\n256\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.837\nAnd on this one here, so I'm gonna\nsay no passive interface at 0/0/0.\n\n257\n00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:27.370\nAll right?\nNow, it's turned off on everything but\n\n258\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.400\none interface going to my corp router.\n\n259\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.370\nI just happen to know what they are.\n\n260\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.740\nI mean I could show it to\nyou on their thing, but\n\n261\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.445\nif anybody's been sticking around,\nthen we should be able to see it.\n\n262\n00:13:36.445 --> 00:13:37.470\nOkay?\n\n263\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.450\nSo let's come over here.\n\n264\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.850\nSo, if I look at this, where's my picture?\n\n265\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.040\nSo, we can see that I put on default,\nand that's even on the loopback.\n\n266\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.690\nSo, I wanna turn off my loopback, too.\n\n267\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.160\nI forgot about that one.\n\n268\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.090\nAnd I've got my loopback\nover here as well.\n\n269\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.405\nSo these are all loopback zeros.\n\n270\n00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:54.860\nAnd I wanna turn off zero,\none, zero and two zero.\n\n271\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.920\nBut let's stay on San Francisco for\n\n272\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.158\na second cuz I forgot about\nmy poor little loopback guy.\n\n273\n00:13:59.158 --> 00:14:00.845\nOkay?\n\n274\n00:14:00.845 --> 00:14:05.393\nNo passive loopback zero.\n\n275\n00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:06.669\nOkay?\n\n276\n00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:11.894\nAnd then, no passive\n\n277\n00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:15.960\ns0/1/0 and\n\n278\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.520\ns0/2/0.\n\n279\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.850\nAnd also, come on.\n\n280\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.600\nAnd also loopback zero.\n\n281\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.690\nOkay.\n\n282\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.290\nSo, effectively, guys, I did more\nwork than if I'd just went off and\n\n283\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.340\nturned off my fast ethernets.\n\n284\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.060\nRight?\n\n285\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.360\nSo, all right, so.\n\n286\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.190\nI'm gonna also do it on this guy here,\nbecause he's what's giving me my problem.\n\n287\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.690\nSo, check out what we got here.\n\n288\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.150\nThis is actually some pretty\ngood little stuff, isn't it?\n\n289\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.590\nSo dual said there was a neighbor change.\n\n290\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.640\n170 10 10 is down, say good bye.\n\n291\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.510\nOur neighbor moved.\n\n292\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.400\nMayflower came and picked him up and\nmoved him to another city.\n\n293\n00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.190\nNow they came back up,\ndual says hey, neighbor change!\n\n294\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.100\nRight now this happened\nquicker than with OSPF because\n\n295\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.510\nwe flood the network\nwhen there is a problem.\n\n296\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.320\nAnd we're gonna find it and\nimmediately come back up.\n\n297\n00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.760\nSo we're faster convergence\nthan with OSPF.\n\n298\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.518\nOkay, so now that we're up,\nI didn't do passive-interface on this guy.\n\n299\n00:15:12.518 --> 00:15:17.813\nSo, router eigrp 15.\n\n300\n00:15:17.813 --> 00:15:21.632\nPassive-interface f0/0.\n\n301\n00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:25.059\nI could have done default and\nthen turned on three interfaces, but\n\n302\n00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.880\nlet's not do that.\n\n303\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.462\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:29.310\nSo, the default command?\n\n305\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.810\nI never have used that in production.\n\n306\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.310\nOnly when teaching the NP for the exams,\nor for the CCNA now, for the exams.\n\n307\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.810\nOkay.\n\n308\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.150\nSo let's take a look at here for a second.\n\n309\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.020\nI wanna come, lets do it from the corp.\n\n310\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.663\nLet's do it from the corp.\n\n311\n00:15:41.663 --> 00:15:42.970\nI just thought about something.\n\n312\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.350\nSo take a look at this.\n\n313\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.612\nshow IP int brief.\n\n314\n00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:50.616\nOkay?\n\n315\n00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:55.434\nSo, we have got fast ethernet,\nwhich is Up down.\n\n316\n00:15:55.434 --> 00:15:57.187\nI probably didn't connect him up.\n\n317\n00:15:57.187 --> 00:15:58.069\nThat's fine.\n\n318\n00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:00.800\nAll I care about is these serials.\n\n319\n00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.070\nSee these serials right here?\n\n320\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.388\nSerial 0/1/0 and 2/0?\n\n321\n00:16:04.388 --> 00:16:06.710\nThese are both going to my LA router.\n\n322\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.300\nSo let's take a look.\n\n323\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.200\nShow interface has 00, not 0, 1 0 and 2 0.\n\n324\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.550\nOkay, take a look here.\n\n325\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.940\nBandwidth is, now Cisco routers\nsee a serial link as a T 1.\n\n326\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.190\nIt's been that way since 1990.\n\n327\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.460\nThink about and say you have a T 1,\nas a matter of fact, it was really funny,\n\n328\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.430\nof you must be wealthy you have\na Cisco router cuz you have T 1's.\n\n329\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.082\nYou got to remember that a T 1\nfrom like LA to New York and\n\n330\n00:16:29.082 --> 00:16:30.597\n[INAUDIBLE] 20 grand a month.\n\n331\n00:16:30.597 --> 00:16:32.140\n>> Hm.\n>> Right, it was a lot of money.\n\n332\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.121\nAnyways, so now there are nothing, but\nlook at this, all I have to do is change\n\n333\n00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:42.872\nthe bandwidth on here and to tell it that\nit's not 1.544Mbps and now I'm different.\n\n334\n00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:46.476\nI'm not going to change this one though,\nso let's go in here,\n\n335\n00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:51.254\nthey're both the same, I wanna say,\nconfig t, interface s0/2/0, right?\n\n336\n00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:53.018\nThat's my other interface.\n\n337\n00:16:53.018 --> 00:16:57.252\nAnd I'm gonna say, bandwidth of 56.\n\n338\n00:16:57.252 --> 00:16:59.490\nI just made it a 56k line.\n\n339\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.342\nWelcome to 1984.\n\n340\n00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:02.089\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n341\n00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:04.330\nso I wonder if that did anything.\n\n342\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.730\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n343\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.670\nYou didn't say that it did anything,\ndon't know.\n\n344\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.220\nShow IP route Wow,\nwhat happened to my dual links?\n\n345\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.700\nWhere's my dual links?\n\n346\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.719\nThere's my networks to 10, 20, all right?\n\n347\n00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.820\nOff 10.6, 30's off 10.6,\nthis guy's off to San Francisco.\n\n348\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.660\nNotice they're not putting it\ninto alphabetical order like\n\n349\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.510\nyou'd see in the exam objectives,\nyou'll see them, 10, 20, 30, 40.\n\n350\n00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.660\nI'm like, wow isn't that nice?\n\n351\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.370\nIt would be really nice to be able\nto reorder these but you can't.\n\n352\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.870\nAnyways, I lost it.\n\n353\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.900\nLet's go see what happened to that link.\n\n354\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.770\nAll right?\n\n355\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.100\nLet's type in a coupe of our commands,\nshow ip eigrp nei.\n\n356\n00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.950\nWell there's my neighbors.\n\n357\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.290\nI definitely see my three neighbors.\n\n358\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.190\nLet's see if I can get it all in here.\n\n359\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.630\nWell [LAUGH] Look at this\nround trip timeout 2604.\n\n360\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.840\nWell, that's pretty bad, right?\n\n361\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.540\nThat's really bad.\n\n362\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.810\nSo our smooth round trip time,\nnotice has gone up here.\n\n363\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.730\nIt'll probably keep incrementing here.\n\n364\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.820\nNotice over here,\nthey're one millisecond, one millisecond.\n\n365\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:13.400\nOn a 56K, this one is now higher, so\nmy feasible distance just went up.\n\n366\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.830\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look here.\n\n367\n00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.190\nSo we're looking at my neighbor table and\nthis is how they were entered, 0,\n\n368\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.940\n1, and 2.\n\n369\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.900\nAnd we can see 0, 1, 2 in the interfaces.\n\n370\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.630\nHere's my hold time, uptime, and\nI don't have any Q counts or anything.\n\n371\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.560\nWe're not really having any\nreal data going through, so\n\n372\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.070\nit's not really a problem.\n\n373\n00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.980\nLet's update this and\nsee if it has changed.\n\n374\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.630\nNot really.\nShow ip eigrp topology.\n\n375\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.470\nNow, we're seeing something here.\n\n376\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:44.123\nSo first off, to get to 40, via 10.2,\n\n377\n00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:49.761\nthere's my feasible distance,\nreported distance.\n\n378\n00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:55.510\nOkay, to 10.0, actually pretty close\nto the same, it's a little bit less.\n\n379\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.610\nThe reported distance is less\nthan my loopback interface.\n\n380\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.930\nTo get to 30, check this out guys.\n\n381\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.890\nI see two paths.\n\n382\n00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.350\nI wonder whether or\nnot my routing table, okay?\n\n383\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.350\nSo I have feasible distances of 2297856.\n\n384\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.750\nReal numbers a lot higher than we\nshowed in our fake PowerPoint life.\n\n385\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.640\nAnyways, here is my 128256.\n\n386\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.585\nWell, look at this.\n\n387\n00:19:17.585 --> 00:19:25.200\nVia serial 1/0 and 2/0,\nmy reported distances are 128256.\n\n388\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.061\nThey're both the same.\n\n389\n00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:32.430\nHowever, my composite,\nmy feasible distance, check this out.\n\n390\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.470\nIt's almost twice.\n\n391\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.430\nWell, it should be.\n\n392\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.972\nIt's probably four times the amount\nbecause one's a T1 one's a 56k,\n\n393\n00:19:37.972 --> 00:19:39.866\nhow many 56k's are in a T1, right?\n\n394\n00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:42.640\nIt's like four or five or\nsomething, it's a lot.\n\n395\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.370\nI can't remember.\n\n396\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.018\n56?\n\n397\n00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:46.912\n>> Or 60 or something like that.\n\n398\n00:19:46.912 --> 00:19:48.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's a lot,\n\n399\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.570\nI can't even remember because\nthe answers who cares.\n\n400\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.570\nSame thing here.\n\n401\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.077\nThe p stands for good, so\nwe know about our feasible successors.\n\n402\n00:19:56.077 --> 00:19:58.760\nIf my serial0/1/0 went down,\n\n403\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.760\nthen this would automatically take over,\nbecause I have another good link there.\n\n404\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.650\nBut then we can see\nthe advertised distance for\n\n405\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.340\nboth of them is the same, but\nit's gonna cost me more to get there.\n\n406\n00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.230\nSo we can see that now there\nare feasible successors,\n\n407\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.530\nthis is a pretty cool little lab here.\n\n408\n00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.749\nAll right, so now if I come over here\n\n409\n00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:28.550\nOkay, so I can see that I'm\nstill getting to network\n\n410\n00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:34.311\n172.16.10.0 via 10.9 and 10.5 and to 10.0.\n\n411\n00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:36.494\nSo this guy still sees he's\ngiving in the same ways.\n\n412\n00:20:36.494 --> 00:20:38.620\nBecause you know why?\n\n413\n00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.770\nBecause I'm only reading the bandwidth\nin one direction, right?\n\n414\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.740\nBecause it's not true bandwidth,\nI fudged it over the LAP.\n\n415\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.540\nSo I wanted to show you that,\nthat if the true bandwidth was 56 k,\n\n416\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.910\nit would show it on both sides,\nbut this guy doesn't see that.\n\n417\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.916\nSo if I come in here and show ip\neigrp topology, okay, so we can see\n\n418\n00:20:55.916 --> 00:21:01.850\nour reported distance, and feasible\ndistance is exactly the same, right?\n\n419\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.960\nCuz we did not change\nthe bandwidth on this side.\n\n420\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.320\nI have to change it on this side.\n\n421\n00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.340\nSo I'm just wanting to show you that,\nso when you go and\n\n422\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.250\nyou do your lab, why you're not seeing it\non both sides, I'd have to come in there,\n\n423\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.269\nI really need to tell this one that it's\nbandwidth, and I can go ahead and do that.\n\n424\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:20.756\nInterface s020 bandwidth 56.\n\n425\n00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:23.490\nAnd now, it's going to show up the same.\n\n426\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.370\nJust in case you were doing your lab,\nI wanted to run out and\n\n427\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.770\nshow it to you in case you ran\nout there and didn't see that.\n\n428\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.307\nIn real life you wouldn't see that\nbecause you set the bandwidth but\n\n429\n00:21:31.307 --> 00:21:33.555\nyou gotta remember to\nset it on both sides.\n\n430\n00:21:33.555 --> 00:21:35.360\nAnd that really dictates what it is.\n\n431\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.520\nNow hold on a second, so\nnow I've got it set on both sides.\n\n432\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.590\nSo we're gonna see this so\nnow I'm gonna see the topology.\n\n433\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.700\nI still see there's that in the route.\n\n434\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.180\nBut hold on we're gonna fix this, let's\nload balance over unequal cost paths.\n\n435\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.030\nI'm not load balancing over that\neven though we see them in there.\n\n436\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:58.430\nLet's go up here and\nhopefully I'm right here, okay?\n\n437\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.521\nSo, now we see them and\nnow they're different, right?\n\n438\n00:22:01.521 --> 00:22:02.775\nNow we see them here.\n\n439\n00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:05.450\n[COUGH]\nOkay,\n\n440\n00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.100\nso, what about, so\nI should see the routes.\n\n441\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.990\nI should see them out of there.\n\n442\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.710\nOkay.\n\n443\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.000\nAnd so\nnow I don't see them in there anymore.\n\n444\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.740\nOkay, so I've put them on both sides.\n\n445\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.590\nYou're going to have to remember to\ndo that if you're gonna tell OSPF or\n\n446\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.630\neigrp that the bandwidth\nis different that it is.\n\n447\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.690\nAnd that is the way we\nwould low bounce the OSPF.\n\n448\n00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.330\nWe have to fudge that.\n\n449\n00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.860\nNow with that being said,\nlets change the variance.\n\n450\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.260\nLets chance the variance on both sides.\n\n451\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.705\nOK, so lets do here, oops, show ip proto.\n\n452\n00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:41.040\nOkay, there's my rip I don't care about.\n\n453\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.560\nAnd in real life, turn off rip,\ndon't let that run in the background.\n\n454\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.960\nEIGRP 15,\nlook at auto summarization is disabled.\n\n455\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.810\nI didn't do it, but you wanna check here.\n\n456\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.190\nThis is another way to do\nanother set of show run, right?\n\n457\n00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.180\nI can see it here.\n\n458\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.310\nAlso, okay, for troubleshooting.\n\n459\n00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.540\nLet's just spend a few\nmore minutes on this.\n\n460\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.532\nFirst off, I want you to check here,\nyou've got some update filters here.\n\n461\n00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:04.350\nWe're gonna go through this in\na troubleshooting session tomorrow but\n\n462\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.230\nwe might have a distribute list,\nan access list,\n\n463\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.370\nthat's stopping something from routing.\n\n464\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.850\nYou're going to have different K1 values.\n\n465\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.980\nYou're going to have a different\nautonomous system number.\n\n466\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.737\nWe use RIDs now.\n\n467\n00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:15.351\nHere, so we're gonna find out our rids.\n\n468\n00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:19.690\nAnd then we have our maximum\npass 4 with a variance of 1.\n\n469\n00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.857\nMake sure our k values are the same,\nhop count is there.\n\n470\n00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:29.865\nOkay, maximum pass 4, make sure you don't\nhave a typo in your network numbers here,\n\n471\n00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:32.660\nand then which ones\nare passive interfaces.\n\n472\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.140\nYou're going to have a wrong\npassive interface, I guarantee it.\n\n473\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.310\nI can almost guarantee that one.\n\n474\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.710\nSo in this case here,\nwhat are we doing now?\n\n475\n00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.470\nWe're setting the variance.\n\n476\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.676\nSo we want to change this variance from\none to two and we'll see what happens.\n\n477\n00:23:43.676 --> 00:23:49.748\nThat router eigrp 15,\nit's variance yes, variance 2, okay?\n\n478\n00:23:49.748 --> 00:23:52.825\nNow I'm gonna change it on this side.\n\n479\n00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:07.440\nNow, I don't know if this is gonna work,\nso we're gonna try it.\n\n480\n00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.660\nI only do one number at a time and\nI really suggest you guys do that too.\n\n481\n00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.850\nSince we only needed 56 I don't know\nthat's only two times the variance.\n\n482\n00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.680\nI don't know if that will work or not.\n\n483\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.110\nIf I had said it was 256 maybe\nI would've put a four or\n\n484\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.460\nsomething there I'm thinking.\n\n485\n00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.900\nBut let's go ahead and take look here.\n\n486\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.092\nLet's give it a second.\n\n487\n00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:27.500\nAnd I'm going to do show IP route and see.\n\n488\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.350\nNow, I didn't like that at all.\n\n489\n00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.410\nSo, I didn't get anything.\n\n490\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:41.340\nSo we gonna keep playing with that,\nbecause we're quite a bit different now.\n\n491\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.342\nSo, we can see the numbers are different\nbut I can't tell if I'm load balancing\n\n492\n00:24:46.342 --> 00:24:50.200\nunless I do a show IP route and see\nthem in there which I'm not seeing that.\n\n493\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.615\nOkay so I'm gonna do a config t.\n\n494\n00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:57.033\nEIGRP variance, whoops.\n\n495\n00:24:57.033 --> 00:25:00.166\nEIGRP router.\n\n496\n00:25:02.445 --> 00:25:05.865\nOkay, let's go to four,\nso it's four times.\n\n497\n00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:09.195\nAlright, now in production,\nI don't, I'm on tape.\n\n498\n00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:13.335\nI only have so much film, or bits,\nbut we're running out of bits.\n\n499\n00:25:13.335 --> 00:25:15.105\nAlright, so\nI'm gonna change this variance to four.\n\n500\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.320\nAnd both sides,\nif that doesn't work we'll go to eight.\n\n501\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.010\nBut again you guys are going to do it\none at a time until it matches exactly.\n\n502\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.020\nAlright so, show IP route.\n\n503\n00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.750\nI don't see anything yet.\n\n504\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.231\nLet's keep going.\n\n505\n00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:44.890\nEight times.\n\n506\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.060\nThat might do it, I'm thinking.\n\n507\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.460\nWhat do you think?\n\n508\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.780\nDo show IP route.\n\n509\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.386\nThat should.\nNope.\n\n510\n00:25:55.386 --> 00:26:00.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n012.\n\n511\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:07.651\n>> I only have so much time, I'm in\na hurry, happy hour starts pretty soon.\n\n512\n00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:15.170\n[LAUGH]\nHe's just not happy is he.\n\n513\n00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.225\nWhy don't I set my bandwidth\nYou go on the interface S 0 2 0\n\n514\n00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:26.519\nbecause let me be honest with you\nsetting it to 56K was a little extreme.\n\n515\n00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:29.060\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n516\n00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:29.760\nWhoops.\n\n517\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.130\nBandwidth 512, interface S 0 2 0,\nbandwidth 512 so if we do that,\n\n518\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.300\nit should be four times the variance\nis what I'm thinking, all right.\n\n519\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.450\nSo, do show IP route.\n\n520\n00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.533\nAnd, there we go.\n\n521\n00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:43.273\n>> Okay.\n>> Now,\n\n522\n00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:46.410\nagain, I don't know which one is perfect.\n\n523\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.480\nIf I was in production at a customer,\nI would sit here and make it perfect.\n\n524\n00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.720\nI would just do one variance at a time\nuntil I got it and not go any further.\n\n525\n00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.615\nYou're gonna cause\nyourselves some problems, so\n\n526\n00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:57.165\nI'm just telling you to be careful here.\n\n527\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.150\nSo now that we have it here.\n\n528\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.720\nAll right, you guys want to get\nto the easy part of all this?\n\n529\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.400\nI know we've been going for a while.\n\n530\n00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.420\nI've just got a little bit more to say.\n\n531\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.290\nI need to put this on pause for\na couple minutes while I configure IPv6.\n\n532\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.230\nSo we're gonna pause, and then we're gonna\ncome back and I'm gonna configure IPv6.\n\n533\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.740\nSo don't go away, we're not signing off,\nwe're just gonna pause for a second.\n\n534\n00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.820\nAll right, let's have some fun.\n\n535\n00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.130\nI went out and I configured\nIPv6 on all my interfaces, and\n\n536\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.210\nI even turned on rip\nng to test my network.\n\n537\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.030\nAnd I found a problem, and I want us\nto troubleshoot it and look at it.\n\n538\n00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.160\nThen we're gonna turn on EIGRP.\n\n539\n00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.260\nI'm telling the,\nv6 this is the easiest thing ever.\n\n540\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.270\nSo much easier than ip version four.\n\n541\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.520\nAnd it just works.\n\n542\n00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.345\nAs long as you do your addressing right or\nyou put it on the right interface.\n\n543\n00:27:43.345 --> 00:27:46.030\n[LAUGH] So here's what we go guys,\nlet's take a look.\n\n544\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.370\nI got my San Francisco router,\n\n545\n00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:53.062\nI've got a loopback with 192.168.40\nI got the 192.168.10 over here.\n\n546\n00:27:53.062 --> 00:27:56.920\nOver here on LA I've got\nthe 192.168.20 and the 30.\n\n547\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.650\nNow, so that being said, let's take a look\nat the subnet set I created for IPv6.\n\n548\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.480\nSo you notice that we\nhave the 2001.db8.3c4d,\n\n549\n00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.910\nthat's the documentation and reference.\n\n550\n00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.280\nSo we're gonna use that prefix.\n\n551\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.790\nThis is subnet four on my loopback,\n\n552\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:15.120\nsubnet two on my lan over here,\nsubnet three over here and subnet five.\n\n553\n00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.540\nSo we've got two, three,\nfour, and five over here.\n\n554\n00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.760\nThose are my remote subnets.\n\n555\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.110\nSo if I'm over here on the LA router,\nI should see subnets two and\n\n556\n00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.440\nfour come across for me.\n\n557\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.220\nIf I'm on San Francisco,\nI should see subnets three and five, and\n\n558\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.490\nthen the core router should\nget all four of those.\n\n559\n00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.790\nRight and I don't even think\nI'm using that bottom subnet.\n\n560\n00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.710\nSo I'm really concerned\nabout these four here.\n\n561\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:34.870\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n562\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.020\nSo let's start with my corp router and\nI'm going to do a show IPv6 route and\n\n563\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.840\nthen I'm going to yes, I'm going to go in.\n\n564\n00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.880\nOkay, so let's take a look here.\n\n565\n00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.990\nHere's a rip injected route.\n\n566\n00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.050\nNow you can't really necessarily\ntell that this is IPv6,\n\n567\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.220\nexcept we have IPv6 addresses in here.\n\n568\n00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.280\nNow I want to make a couple things\nclear for you for the objectives.\n\n569\n00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.990\nThis did not come across\nfrom a unicast address.\n\n570\n00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.750\nThis came across from well,\nthis link local but it is unicast headers.\n\n571\n00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.930\nBut this came across from\na specific unicast my link\n\n572\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:12.380\nlocal is where I get my routing\nprotocol updates with IPv6.\n\n573\n00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.530\nFrom your link local,\nnot from your address on your interface.\n\n574\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.090\nOkay, now look at this, what is this?\n\n575\n00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.740\nReally, administrative\ndistance of 120 in hop count?\n\n576\n00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.630\nYeah, it's called rip ng for\nnext generation,\n\n577\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.660\nit really should be called rip next\npiece of crap, because that's all it is.\n\n578\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.550\nIt's just as bad as the original one,\n\n579\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.700\nthere's nothing good about\nthis routing protocol.\n\n580\n00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.830\nWe send our complete routing\ntable out every 30 seconds.\n\n581\n00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:34.930\nShould I go on?\n\n582\n00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.160\nAll right you get the idea.\n\n583\n00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.480\n2001 so notice I see subnet\ntwo here four and five.\n\n584\n00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.580\nSo if I go back to my picture here,\nlet's go back bring this up.\n\n585\n00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.710\nI see there's subnet two there's four and\nthere's five.\n\n586\n00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.470\nSo I'm not seeing anything\ncoming from this guy.\n\n587\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.730\nSo that was kind of one of the things.\n\n588\n00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.010\nI found the problem, then I was like hey,\n\n589\n00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.970\nwhy am I not seeing,\nI'll just leave it for you guys.\n\n590\n00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.585\nSo let's go up and take a look on LA.\n\n591\n00:30:01.585 --> 00:30:03.950\nBecause that's where the problem is.\n\n592\n00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.290\nNow I'm gonna show you how\neasy this was to configure.\n\n593\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.560\nI put the addresses in,\nI was only gone a couple minutes,\n\n594\n00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.710\nI know you can't tell that.\n\n595\n00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.210\nBut, I was only gone a couple minutes.\n\n596\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.650\nI put the IPv6 addresses, up arrow, change\nthe subnet, up arrow, change the subnet.\n\n597\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.670\nIt was It was relatively quick.\n\n598\n00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.260\nTurned on rip ng to verify my network,\nsaw everything but one, came up here,\n\n599\n00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.390\nsaw the problem and\nthen we started filming again.\n\n600\n00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:24.930\nAll right.\n\n601\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.900\nSo under here I have my loop back.\n\n602\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.280\nAnd this is all I did guys.\n\n603\n00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.210\nSo I put in this address,\nhe was subnet five.\n\n604\n00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.950\nAll right.\nI put it in, gave him a colon, colon one.\n\n605\n00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.770\nAnd then I said this I didn't\ndo anything from Google config.\n\n606\n00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.120\nI went to the interface and\nI said, IPv6 rip 1 enable.\n\n607\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.540\nThat's it,\nI turned on rip ng at this point.\n\n608\n00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.090\nNow, I know this isn't into\nyour EIGRP section [LAUGH] but\n\n609\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.250\nI just want to show it to you.\n\n610\n00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.060\nAnd again you don't know what's\ngonna be on the objectives, so\n\n611\n00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.550\ndon't be sending me bad emails.\n\n612\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.424\nYou'll probably do it anyways.\n\n613\n00:30:52.424 --> 00:30:55.900\n[LAUGH] Anyways, notice this one\nhas an autoconfig default but\n\n614\n00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.970\ndidn't take an I statically configured\none in here for network three.\n\n615\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:05.660\nBut so what's my problem here, on\nFastEthernet 0/0 if I look at the drawing,\n\n616\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.514\nI'm not even using FastEthernet 0/0,\nI made a mistake in there,\n\n617\n00:31:08.514 --> 00:31:09.960\nI'm using FastEthernet 0/1.\n\n618\n00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.770\nSo although I put it out there and\nturned on rip, I came and\n\n619\n00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.700\nI shut this down because\nI wasn't seeing anything.\n\n620\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.100\nI was like ,why am I not seeing anything?\n\n621\n00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.480\nYeah, I'm connected to F0/1.\n\n622\n00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.740\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n623\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.610\nSo here's my IPv6 address.\n\n624\n00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.050\nI didn't put rip under there.\n\n625\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.100\nI put it under the wrong interface.\n\n626\n00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.180\nSo pay attention to what\nyour wrong interfaces is.\n\n627\n00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.290\nMy figure's wrong.\n\n628\n00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.910\nI'd have to view CDP to figure this out.\n\n629\n00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.390\nAnd that's how I did that.\n\n630\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.395\nI use CDP to figure I'm\ngoing to F0/1 not F0/0.\n\n631\n00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:40.401\nAll right so\nconfig t interface F0/1 IPv6 rip and\n\n632\n00:31:40.401 --> 00:31:44.951\nthen a number you make up\nit doesn't matter just\n\n633\n00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:48.843\nit's a process id so let's take a look.\n\n634\n00:31:48.843 --> 00:31:49.887\nSo it's just a string.\n\n635\n00:31:49.887 --> 00:31:51.211\nAs a matter of fact I\ncould put a name in there.\n\n636\n00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:52.384\nLike sales or something like that.\n\n637\n00:31:52.384 --> 00:31:57.605\nBut if I did that, I would use an address\nfamily or something like that,\n\n638\n00:31:57.605 --> 00:32:01.380\ncuz I could reference either IPv4 or\n6 this way.\n\n639\n00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.300\nIPv6 rip 1 enable, that's it, done.\n\n640\n00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.260\nThat's it, don't think too much,\nall right?\n\n641\n00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.100\nNow I wanna show you something, It did do\na process underneath the global config so\n\n642\n00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.330\nhere we see our bi whole config,\nI put an IP address,\n\n643\n00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.740\nIP six address under the interface and\nI turned on rip.\n\n644\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.792\nThat's it.\nThat's rip next generation.\n\n645\n00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:25.680\nAll right, so, now, I turned off that,\nI have it underneath here.\n\n646\n00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.040\nNo big deal.\n\n647\n00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.200\nPretty simple.\n\n648\n00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.100\nHave it on each interface.\n\n649\n00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.810\nThere's my EIGRP config we did\nearlier in this lab the rip.\n\n650\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.540\nAnd there it is right there.\n\n651\n00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.680\nSo there's the static route that\nwe did in a lab a while ago.\n\n652\n00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.005\nYou get quite a config on here.\n\n653\n00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> IPv6 router rip 1.\n\n654\n00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.600\nNotice it did put a global config.\n\n655\n00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.380\nIt's no big deal.\n\n656\n00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.870\nNow, let's go ahead.\n\n657\n00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.760\nLet me run back here,\nmake sure it's working.\n\n658\n00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.550\nHold on.\nAnd then we're gonna turn on EIGRP\n\n659\n00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.720\nreal quick.\n\n660\n00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.220\nV6.\n\n661\n00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.460\nOkay?\n\n662\n00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.180\nSo notice on here I just see the three.\n\n663\n00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.380\nI should see ipv6 route.\n\n664\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.390\nOkay?\nNow I see all four in there.\n\n665\n00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.130\nRight?\nI just didn't have it\n\n666\n00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.330\nunder the right interface.\n\n667\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.480\nGotta be able to troubleshoot this.\n\n668\n00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.230\nWe'll get into more\ntroubleshooting tomorrow.\n\n669\n00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.730\nSh ipv6 proto, and\n\n670\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.080\nwe can see we get a little bit different\ninformation on here, don't we?\n\n671\n00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.240\nThe routing protocols connect,\nwe have connected, we have rip 1 so\n\n672\n00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.820\nit's saying hey, I'm advertising\nyou're connected and that works out.\n\n673\n00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.360\nSerial 020 and these are my three so\n\n674\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.090\nI just want to make sure,\nnotice there's no network numbers,\n\n675\n00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.860\nit's harder to screw up IPv6 with your\nrouting protocols, same with EIGRP.\n\n676\n00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.520\nAnd I can do redistribution.\n\n677\n00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.180\nSo not a lot of stuff here guys.\n\n678\n00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.280\nVery easy, let me show you how easy it\nis to do the IGRP no network numbers,\n\n679\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.240\nno inverse masks and so on so.\n\n680\n00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.180\nConfig t now I'm gonna say router ipv6\n\n681\n00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:52.340\nrouter eigrp and then and\nthen a number, 'Im just gonna use 1.\n\n682\n00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.380\nNow notice on that global config.\n\n683\n00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.020\nNow I'm not going to put\nanything underneath here, but\n\n684\n00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.300\ncheck out what i have to do.\n\n685\n00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.347\nThis is important, this will probably be\non your because it is in the curriculum,\n\n686\n00:34:03.347 --> 00:34:03.849\nno shut.\n\n687\n00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:08.090\nIt is shut down by default I\nhave to enable the process.\n\n688\n00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.320\nNow all I do now is put a rid underneath\nhere, not really important, for\n\n689\n00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.360\nOSPF it is, but not for here.\n\n690\n00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.270\nNow I just go to each and\n\n691\n00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.770\nevery interface and I put on,\nI don't use any network statements.\n\n692\n00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.340\nAs a matter of fact I can't even.\n\n693\n00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.660\nSo I said, well no I want to make it hard,\n\n694\n00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.710\nno you can't it's IPv6\nyou can't make it hard.\n\n695\n00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.490\nGood luck with that though.\n\n696\n00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.270\nAlright, so I am going to say\ninterface I am on Corp so\n\n697\n00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.920\nI have zero I just have my\nthree serial interfaces.\n\n698\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.970\nIPv6 Okay, we can see eigrp and\nthen we use number 1.\n\n699\n00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:41.140\nSo you use the same process ID here,\nit's the only thing that's important.\n\n700\n00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.670\nEigrp 1, that's it.\n\n701\n00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:47.210\nNo network numbers,\n\n702\n00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.840\ndon't have to worry about any other thing,\nautonosystem, just going to make that one.\n\n703\n00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.520\nThe same on my neighbor's interfaces.\n\n704\n00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.580\nSo I am gonna use the same number\neverywhere, the same as global config,\n\n705\n00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.400\ndo a no shut and use that same number.\n\n706\n00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.135\nOkay, so I'm just gonna come up here,\ncheck this out, 1/0, up arrow twice.\n\n707\n00:35:02.135 --> 00:35:07.682\n[SOUND] I could do this while I'm asleep.\n\n708\n00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:14.040\nThat's it for routing with IPv6 and EIGRP.\n\n709\n00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.050\non this router, that's it.\n\n710\n00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.840\nGo to each interface.\n\n711\n00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.440\nNow I did go to global config and\ndo a no shuttle and process id.\n\n712\n00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.530\nI didn't have to do that with REM.\n\n713\n00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.530\nI do have to do that with GIRP.\n\n714\n00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:26.400\nOk so as long as you know\nwhich interfaces you're on.\n\n715\n00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.180\nLets just say config T, router Oops.\n\n716\n00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.918\nIpv six, thank you, router eigrp one,\nI'm going to use the same number.\n\n717\n00:35:35.918 --> 00:35:37.663\nNo shot.\n\n718\n00:35:37.663 --> 00:35:41.240\nThat's all I need to do here.\n\n719\n00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.650\nInterface, I've got an f or a zero.\n\n720\n00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.420\nIpv six, eigrp one.\n\n721\n00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:54.672\nThe interface s zero zero zero ipv6,\nand the interface loopback 0.\n\n722\n00:35:57.504 --> 00:36:04.730\nThere, so now I can see that I'm up to\nSerial0/0/0, NBRCHANGE IPv6, right?\n\n723\n00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.090\nDon't have to worry about\ndiscontiguous networks.\n\n724\n00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.510\nNo such thing with the v6, right?\n\n725\n00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.860\nSo let's come over here to,\nhere we go, over here.\n\n726\n00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.000\nOne last router.\n\n727\n00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.250\nIs this the fastest\nthing you've ever seen?\n\n728\n00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.490\nConfig router from here,\n\n729\n00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.481\nipv6 router, eigrp1, no shut.\n\n730\n00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.570\nOkay.\nInterface S010 I'm over here.\n\n731\n00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.410\nIPV6 EIRGP1.\n\n732\n00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.440\nInterface S 010.\n\n733\n00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.280\nI think I got that right.\n\n734\n00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.780\nNo I didn't.\n\n735\n00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.110\nWhat did I tell it.\n\n736\n00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:44.610\nIt's close.\n\n737\n00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.560\nAnd then up arrow and interface s0/2/0.\n\n738\n00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.965\nIf I did this all right, I think I did.\n\n739\n00:36:53.965 --> 00:36:55.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Did I get all three interfaces?\n\n740\n00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.150\nI need my interface F0/1.\n\n741\n00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.210\n>> Don't not get the right one.\n\n742\n00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.070\n>> And interface loop back zero.\n\n743\n00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.190\nMan, I can't make this thing fail!\n\n744\n00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.530\nMan, the minute I start typing things in,\nI am a successful Cisco guy.\n\n745\n00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.100\n>> Yes, you are.\n\n746\n00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.980\n>> What's that syslog?\n\n747\n00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.890\nI am a successful admin?\n\n748\n00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:14.937\n>> I am root?\n\n749\n00:37:14.937 --> 00:37:18.657\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's go down here to corp.\n\n750\n00:37:19.857 --> 00:37:21.140\nLook at this.\n\n751\n00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.160\nI am rocking and rolling.\n\n752\n00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.560\nNow, we're gonna get through tomorrow.\n\n753\n00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.360\nWe're gonna do a troubleshooting\nsection you're gonna look for.\n\n754\n00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.690\nI'm gonna give you some hints right now.\n\n755\n00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.750\nLook for access lists,\nlook for passive interface.\n\n756\n00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.700\nDon't forget passive interfaces.\n\n757\n00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.800\nEven on here, when you put a passive\ninterface on an interface,\n\n758\n00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.180\nlook for wrong statements,\nwrong system numbers and so on.\n\n759\n00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.820\nShow IPv6 route baby.\n\n760\n00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.350\nWhat happened to my rip?\n\n761\n00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.940\nIt's running in the background\ntaking up all my bandwidth.\n\n762\n00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.870\nWell, I'm using EIGRP here.\n\n763\n00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.350\nLook at this.\n\n764\n00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.940\nSo I see my EIGRP in here.\n\n765\n00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.690\nThis D stands for dual.\n\n766\n00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.320\nRight?\nHere's my, take a look.\n\n767\n00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.060\n90, and that's my composite metric,\na bandwidth is delay of the line.\n\n768\n00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.170\nRight, it's my feasible distance, right?\n\n769\n00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:03.490\nNow, I don't think we have,\nwe're load balancing.\n\n770\n00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.240\n>> No, we aren't.\n\n771\n00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.580\n>> So\nwhat did we get the one to work with?\n\n772\n00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.880\nIt was eight or something like that?\n\n773\n00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.680\n>> Yeah, it did.\n\n774\n00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.928\n>> So, I'm gonna show IPV6\n>> show\n\n775\n00:38:11.928 --> 00:38:17.400\nipv6 proto variance 1.\n\n776\n00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.780\nSo why do I have to do this?\n\n777\n00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.530\nI did it on the other one.\n\n778\n00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.650\nBecause it's its own routing protocol.\n\n779\n00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.690\nSo I'm gonna have to change this to,\n\n780\n00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.670\non both sides Config,\nwhat did we change it to?\n\n781\n00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.590\nI am trying to remember, we will find out.\n\n782\n00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.300\n>> Either a 9 or a 12.\n\n783\n00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.570\n>> I think it was an 8 and again,\nwe are not gonna randomly do this.\n\n784\n00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:44.370\nAll right, so ipv6 router eigrp 1,\nand then variance, lets try 8.\n\n785\n00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.890\nI think we had it at 12 but\n8 should probably work.\n\n786\n00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:55.270\nAnd then over here do the same thing on\nLA if that doesn't work I'm pretty sure\n\n787\n00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:00.550\ncuz we changed it to 512 so 8 should have\nbeen eight times worse right router EIGRP.\n\n788\n00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:04.855\nNow notice IPv6 router notice\nwhere I'm putting this guys not on\n\n789\n00:39:04.855 --> 00:39:06.426\nthe interface Global.\n\n790\n00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.580\nOkay, so, how can we tell?\n\n791\n00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.030\nWe can come over here and\nsee if we are load bouncing with.\n\n792\n00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.699\nHow exciting is that gonna be?\n\n793\n00:39:16.699 --> 00:39:19.842\n[NOISE] Show route.\n\n794\n00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.180\nBam baby.\n\n795\n00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.750\nWhoa that is one sexy routing table!\n\n796\n00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.130\nThat is hot!\n\n797\n00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:29.320\nWoohoo!\nI'm going to go\n\n798\n00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.040\ntake this to a bar hey\nbaby check this out!\n\n799\n00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.880\nThis is hot guys, make this work!\n\n800\n00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.200\nGo out there and build this.\n\n801\n00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.340\nHow fun is this?\n\n802\n00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.140\nNow I would like to spend some more\ntime on here, but we gotta run.\n\n803\n00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.785\nThe thing is we will come back with\ntrouble and I'm going to screw this up and\n\n804\n00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:44.416\nwe have to fix it.\n\n805\n00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:44.999\nHow fun is that?\n\n806\n00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:48.169\nSo stick around, we're going to come back\nand do some awesome troubleshooting.\n\n807\n00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.510\n>> All right so in this episode,\n\n808\n00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.060\nTodd actually did show us\nthe remainder of the configuration for\n\n809\n00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.300\nEIGRP, especially with IP version six,\nand a bit of troubleshooting as well.\n\n810\n00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.880\nRemember that when we took a look at here,\nof course, is the enablement of EIGRP\n\n811\n00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.850\non each of the interfaces, remember\nthat you do have a router configuration.\n\n812\n00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.930\nBut that is just to enable it, or\nto actually set the variance command.\n\n813\n00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.310\nAll of the other configurations,\na fairly simple line for\n\n814\n00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:17.440\nus to type in on each of the interfaces\nthat we need it to be configured on.\n\n815\n00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.720\nTo make it work with all the other routers\nthat are running, EIGRP and NIPV6.\n\n816\n00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.640\nSo, thank you again Todd for\nactually showing us that.\n\n817\n00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.810\nThank you also for joining us.\n\n818\n00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.630\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n819\n00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.380\n>> I'm Todd Lammle.\n\n820\n00:40:32.380 -->

TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.570\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're talking a look at ICND2 content,\n\n5\n00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.470\ngetting ready for\nthat new CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n6\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.950\nAnd in our studios we have Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.000\nTodd Lammle to help make sure that\nwe cover everything that we need to.\n\n8\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.370\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n9\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.440\n>> All right, Ronnie, we're gonna\ndive into a pretty deep subject that\n\n10\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.470\nwe're gonna start easy, I'm gonna just\nturn on some RIP, so I have no routing\n\n11\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.900\nprotocols running, I have my IP 4, let's\ntake a look at our diagram here, guys.\n\n12\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.480\nI have IP4 and IPV6, but\nI have no routing turned on.\n\n13\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.360\nNot static, not default.\n\n14\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.958\nWe've got to troubleshoot RIP version 2,\nEIGRP, EIGRPv6.\n\n15\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:57.349\nOSPF version 2 and OSPF Version 3,\nas well as look at,\n\n16\n00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:04.950\n[LAUGH] it's a lot, IP service level\nagreements, spanning and access lists.\n\n17\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.610\nOkay now the good new is,\nI've already done most of this.\n\n18\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.720\nWhen I did RIP, we troubleshoot that.\n\n19\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.080\nI even did RIP mg if\nyou guys remember that.\n\n20\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500\nIt's not in the objectives but\nwe may as well do it because it's fun.\n\n21\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.830\nAnd then we'll do OSPF.\n\n22\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.500\nWe'll do it in this way RIP,\nand then OSPF and then NGIP.\n\n23\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.979\nThat way we don't have to turn anything\noff because the autonomous systems will\n\n24\n00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.190\njust bring them better.\n\n25\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.231\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna run through this but\n\n26\n00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.720\nwe do gotta run through access list IP\nVersion four and IP version six as well,\n\n27\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.940\nI'm gonna create some distribute lists.\n\n28\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.680\nI'll get through this as,\ntry as painful as painless as possible.\n\n29\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.805\nAs painful as possible,\nI will do this in the most painful way,\n\n30\n00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.490\njust like on the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.557\nAll right so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna start with RIP,\n\n32\n00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:48.080\nlooking at the thing.\n\n33\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.910\nNow remember I just turned off the,\nthe figure,\n\n34\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.070\nwhy because if I'm doing RIP,\nit's all about me baby.\n\n35\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.050\nI don't care about my neighbors,\n\n36\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.650\nthe only really time I care about my\nneighbors is when we get to OSPF right?\n\n37\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.910\nAnd we're creating adjacencies.\n\n38\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.580\nAnd if I have two Cisco's,\nI really don't even worry about it then.\n\n39\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.792\nBut on the CCNA, it's always a problem.\n\n40\n00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:11.320\nAll right, so, I don't have any protocols,\nI shouldn't so let me come up here.\n\n41\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.580\nShow IP proto, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.290\nIP routing is, we don't have anything.\n\n43\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.330\nOkay so I'm gonna say config T router rep.\n\n44\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930\nYeah, I can turn on router rep first so,\nturn on my routing process and\n\n45\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.940\nI'm gonna turn on IP version six as well\nfor RIP MG, next piece of junk, right?\n\n46\n00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.022\nIsn't that what it stands for?\n\n47\n00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:35.950\n[LAUGH] Anyways, in this case here,\nthen I'm gonna do a do show IP Int brev.\n\n48\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.540\nThis is how I teach my students to do\nthis, turn on your routing process,\n\n49\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530\nyou're in your routing process,\nthen you type show ip int brev, says hey,\n\n50\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.250\ntype this dummy, it's right here.\n\n51\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.220\nI can't hardly screw this up.\n\n52\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.100\nOkay, so\nI still have a tunnel in here, right?\n\n53\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.040\nSo I have some tunnel in here, but\nI'm just gonna ignore that for right now.\n\n54\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.960\nBut I'm gonna say network 192.168.10.0 and\nI can't do\n\n55\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.640\ninverse masks with RIP,\nI could do that with EIGRP,\n\n56\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.600\neven when you don't need to, so why and\nbut if you see them on the exam.\n\n57\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.220\nSo we're gonna do them because they\njust like to show them on the exam to\n\n58\n00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.410\nstress people out.\n\n59\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.046\nAnd then network 172.16.0.0.\n\n60\n00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:13.970\nAnd then we're gonna do no auto and\nversion 2.\n\n61\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.820\nNo auto summary is all, and I'm done.\n\n62\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.630\nI'm done with routing on here, right.\n\n63\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.120\nSo we might as well go and\nturn on RIP, right?\n\n64\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.680\nSo well, I mean not RIP,\nIP version 6, right.\n\n65\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.185\nSo I'm gonna say ipv6, so\nlet me go back to global config.\n\n66\n00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:35.700\nIPV6 router, okay, and then notice I\ncan run rip OSPF, network mobility and\n\n67\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.950\nEIGRP which is something I can do\nnetwork mobility but let's turn on RIP.\n\n68\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.840\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.730\nOops.\nI gotta choose a number.\n\n70\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.070\nSo unlike, so I'm just gonna say,\nI could use the name Todd.\n\n71\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.142\nRight, I could use an actual name but\nI'm just gonna use a number.\n\n72\n00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:51.390\nI'm gonna actually try to\nuse a number this time.\n\n73\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.870\nAnd I, you really don't have\nany configs under here, but\n\n74\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.940\nif we look under here we can do thing,\nyou know change the,\n\n75\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.230\nyou know put a distribute list in,\nwe're gonna come to that in a minute.\n\n76\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.030\nAnd you can change your timers.\n\n77\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.706\nI don't recommend coming in here and\nreally changing this, but look,\n\n78\n00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:07.320\ncheck out this one thing, maximum paths.\n\n79\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.650\nDo you guys remember that's how many equal\npaths cost that you could load in, so\n\n80\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.100\nwe can do, again,\nwith the new 15 code up to 32.\n\n81\n00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.530\nIt does four by default, right,\nload bounds four by default with EIGRP or\n\n82\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.590\nOSPF and RIP, but\nwe can set this to 32, as we can see.\n\n83\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.860\nI think 16 would be the answer on the exam\nif they'd ask you something like that.\n\n84\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.860\nI'm gonna get out of this,\nit's giving an error and\n\n85\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.130\nwe're gonna have to go to our interfaces.\n\n86\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.330\nSo I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do,\ndo show, [COUGH] there it is.\n\n87\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.110\nAnd I want to find my interfaces.\n\n88\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.260\nSo FastEtherent 0/0,\nI'm not even using my loopbacks on here,\n\n89\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.340\nI don't even have them assigned.\n\n90\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.460\nI don't care about the tunnel.\n\n91\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.980\nSo I've got a Serial0/0/0 and Ethernet0/0.\n\n92\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.030\nNow if we're just regular RIP, IP version\n4 RIP, don't care about interfaces, do I?\n\n93\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.470\nUnless I have the passive\ninterface command.\n\n94\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.430\nNow that's an important piece so I'm going\nto add that so I'm putting a lot in here.\n\n95\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.926\nI'm doing IP4 config, IPV6 config,\nI'm gonna go back to IP4 and\n\n96\n00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.632\nadd passive interfaces, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:08.876\nSo I'm in the IP version 6 so\nI'm gonna say interface F00.\n\n98\n00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.330\nIPV6 okay.\n\n99\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.140\nSo we're doing RIP, okay, so there it is,\nIPv6 RIP, and then the number.\n\n100\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.880\nWow.\n\n101\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.565\nThat's it.\nI didn't even have to know,\n\n102\n00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:24.360\nI thought I should have got that right,\nwhat did I miss here?\n\n103\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.940\n>> Enable?\n\n104\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.530\n>> Enable.\nYou're right.\n\n105\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.120\nI forgot one thing.\n\n106\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.778\nYou know why?\n\n107\n00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:31.230\nBecause [INAUDIBLE] only\nuses in production, right.\n\n108\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.380\n[LAUGH] The only time I do\nthis is when I'm teaching.\n\n109\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.550\nAnd but anyways,\nIVP6 RIP one enabled, that's it.\n\n110\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.550\nSo I'm just gonna go to interface\ns0/0/0 up arrow and I'm done.\n\n111\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.080\nNow let's go back.\n\n112\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.920\nI'm in, let's go back under the routing\nprotocol for IP version 4, right.\n\n113\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.320\nAnd that's just router RIP instead\nof IP version 6 router RIP, right?\n\n114\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.740\nAnd then the process id.\n\n115\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.850\n>> Now Tom, before you get to the IP\nversion 4, did we need to go and\n\n116\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.360\nissue the IP unicast\nbatch routing command?\n\n117\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.200\n>> No, because, well one of the things\nthat I've done before I started\n\n118\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.290\ntroubleshooting the section is I had\nall my IP four addresses out, and\n\n119\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.230\nI put all my IPV6 addresses out.\n\n120\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.140\nSo it was a good question,\nI didn't mention that, I think I did,\n\n121\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.470\nbut nonetheless it's important for us to\nunderstand that IPV6 is up and running,\n\n122\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.570\nbut no routing.\n\n123\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.200\nIPV4 was running with no routing.\n\n124\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.704\nSo all of my addresses were good,\nI verified all that.\n\n125\n00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:24.690\n>> Good.\nExcellent.\n\n126\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.154\n>> We really don't have to\ntroubleshoot that so much,\n\n127\n00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.623\nwe just have to troubleshoot\nwhy it's not working.\n\n128\n00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:30.601\n>> Right.\n>> Right, okay so\n\n129\n00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:34.830\nnow that I'm under router RIP here,\nVersion 4, right, because it's router RIP.\n\n130\n00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.448\nI wanna do the passive interface and\nI wanna say default.\n\n131\n00:06:39.448 --> 00:06:44.298\nOkay, so, [LAUGH] you know this\ncommand just drives me crazy,\n\n132\n00:06:44.298 --> 00:06:48.240\nand they love this on the objectives,\nright.\n\n133\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.590\nSo you turn this on and you're like,\nyou turned on RIP version 4.\n\n134\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.190\nIP version 6 is running in\nthe background right now.\n\n135\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.720\nAnd you don't have passive interface\ncommand with IP version 6.\n\n136\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.240\nWhy?\nBecause it's only enabled per interface so\n\n137\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.290\ndon't turn on the interface\nyou don't want it on.\n\n138\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.450\nIn this case here I just turn\nit off on all of them, right?\n\n139\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.220\nSo I'm gonna say no\npassive interface /0/0/0.\n\n140\n00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.455\nThis is what you are gonna\nsee on the objectives, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:12.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n142\n00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.478\nif I do a do show IP proto protocols.\n\n143\n00:07:18.478 --> 00:07:24.880\nOkay so I'm running rip right and\nI can see all my passive\n\n144\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.945\ninterfaces right there all of right and\nthen, but I am routing for networks.\n\n145\n00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.430\nAnd this is your trouble\nshooting spot here guys.\n\n146\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.480\nRight so first off you want to,\nwhat interface am I routing for\n\n147\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.180\nserial 000, if you're missing\nsomething come down here and\n\n148\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.620\ncheck your network statements\nif you can see this.\n\n149\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.770\nCome down here and\ncheck your network statements and\n\n150\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.200\nif they're not there then you add them and\nyour interface will show up here,\n\n151\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.760\nnotice this says send and receive two.\n\n152\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.090\nNow the other thing we're gonna take\na look at here is these filters up here.\n\n153\n00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.070\nThis is where I'm gonna add\nwhat's called a distribute list.\n\n154\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.012\nIt's just adding an access list\nunder the routing process.\n\n155\n00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:59.044\nWe'll do that in a minute, but\nyou're going to look here,\n\n156\n00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:03.001\nyou're gonna check your timers with\nRIP You are going to check your version.\n\n157\n00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:05.830\nIt's got maximum paths 4,\nrouting for networks.\n\n158\n00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.430\nAnd then these are all your passives.\n\n159\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.570\nThat is awesome.\n\n160\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.168\nThat is just awesome.\n\n161\n00:08:11.168 --> 00:08:12.010\nGood enough!\n\n162\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.667\nWe've screwed up that router.\n\n163\n00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:16.828\nOur damage is done here.\n\n164\n00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:18.289\nLet's go down to corp.\n\n165\n00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.258\nTake a look here.\n\n166\n00:08:20.258 --> 00:08:21.080\nAgain, this is all about me.\n\n167\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:27.390\nConfig t, router rip, we're gonna\ndo version four first, I'm just\n\n168\n00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:33.200\ngonna say passive interface default\nfirst because I can and it feels good.\n\n169\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.860\nSo I turned on rip and then I've\nturned off every interface, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.253\nDo show IP int brief.\n\n171\n00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:45.082\nSo we've got some interfaces here for\nsure, but it's okay.\n\n172\n00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:48.920\nWe got FastEthernet, the 10,\nand these are all 172.16.\n\n173\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.820\nThis multilink that we\nused in our WAN chapter is\n\n174\n00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.400\nnot even being used because I\ntook it off the interfaces.\n\n175\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.530\nSo although it's there, it's not used.\n\n176\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.460\nNeither are any of these.\n\n177\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.521\nSo under here,\nnow I can type in my network statements.\n\n178\n00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.078\nA 10.0.0.0 class full.\n\n179\n00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:09.248\nAnd I really don't have a lot here,\nguys, considering how much is here.\n\n180\n00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:15.787\n2.16.0.0, no auto-summary, and version 2.\n\n181\n00:09:15.787 --> 00:09:19.920\nSo I've added all these that I care about,\nthese other virtual interfaces I don't.\n\n182\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.920\nAnd then I've got my fast ethernet.\n\n183\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.460\nAnd then, but I've got them all\nturned off right now, don't I?\n\n184\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.920\nSo I did passive interface default.\n\n185\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.530\nSo I'm kind of creating problems and\n\n186\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.940\nthen solving them so\nyou guys know what to look for.\n\n187\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.854\nSo I'm gonna say no\npassive-interface s0/0/0,\n\n188\n00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:42.020\ns0/1/0, and s0/2/0.\n\n189\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.600\nOkay, so it would have been a lot easier\njust to type in the one, but in this case,\n\n190\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.440\nthat's what they like.\n\n191\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.480\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n192\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.480\nDo show IP proto calls.\n\n193\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.110\nProto, not a do.\n\n194\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.550\nI was not, show IP proto.\n\n195\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.080\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.380\nProtocols and you know so\nwe got a lot of stuff here.\n\n197\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.410\nI love this.\n\n198\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.648\nHere's my trouble shooting spots, guys.\n\n199\n00:10:04.648 --> 00:10:07.550\nMy router is rip,\nmake sure your timer's here though.\n\n200\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.840\nThey're gonna hit you on\nthat in this CSNA and.\n\n201\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.262\nInvalid after 180,\nhold down 180, flushed 240.\n\n202\n00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:14.240\nThose kind of match.\n\n203\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.690\nYou can easily change those.\n\n204\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.890\nI would not, but\nthey like to do things like that.\n\n205\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.600\nAnd then they don't match and\nRIP gets all screwed up.\n\n206\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.940\nIt's easy to screw up rip.\n\n207\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.372\nAll right, the trigger,\nthe key-chain here,\n\n208\n00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:27.889\nyou can do authentication with rip\nversion two, just remember that.\n\n209\n00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.922\nSo if the authentication doesn't\nmatch you're not going to get it.\n\n210\n00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:33.488\nSo if I come over here and\nI see nothing here, do a show IP\n\n211\n00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:38.298\nproto on someone else and they show\na key chain here which is the password,\n\n212\n00:10:38.298 --> 00:10:42.124\nthen you're not gonna obviously\nbe able to share routes.\n\n213\n00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:45.544\nThat's not a big objective,\nnever has been, but man you don't know,\n\n214\n00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:46.407\nyou don't know.\n\n215\n00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.740\nAll right, so we're gonna check\nthat everything's version 2 and\n\n216\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.663\nthat all my interfaces that\nI'm using are running rip, and\n\n217\n00:10:52.663 --> 00:10:55.370\nif not I'm gonna come down here and\ncheck my networks.\n\n218\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.450\nPretty straightforward.\n\n219\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.000\nRemember, check your filter up here.\n\n220\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.770\nThis is the distribute list.\n\n221\n00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.870\nWe will do that, but\njust telling you all the places to look.\n\n222\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.530\nIt's really not that much once\nyou do this a couple times.\n\n223\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.404\nOkay, let's do LA, config t,\n\n224\n00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:14.575\nrouter rip, passive interface default.\n\n225\n00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:17.270\n[LAUGH]\nThat cracks me up.\n\n226\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.890\nBut so fun.\n\n227\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.030\nMake sure you do this at home.\n\n228\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:26.190\nAnd now I'm gonna do show int brief,\nall right?\n\n229\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.610\nAnd see all my networks here.\n\n230\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.466\nI've got 192.168.20 and 172.16.\n\n231\n00:11:30.466 --> 00:11:33.694\nNo big deal, so network 170,\ndid I spell that right?\n\n232\n00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.368\n172.16.0.0.\n\n233\n00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:40.349\nNetwork 192.168.20.0.\n\n234\n00:11:40.349 --> 00:11:41.176\nWhoops.\n\n235\n00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:41.832\nBoy.\n\n236\n00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:43.179\n0.09 now.\n\n237\n00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:44.397\nSo notice I made a typo there.\n\n238\n00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:47.533\nIt did take that and\nit is going to change it to zero zero.\n\n239\n00:11:47.533 --> 00:11:49.720\nI'd never even seen it take that before,\nthat's awesome.\n\n240\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.990\nAnd version 2.\n\n241\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.135\nAll right, so if we did a do show run,\nwhich we're gonna do right now,\n\n242\n00:11:55.135 --> 00:12:01.850\ncuz I've got everything on passive, so\nlet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n243\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.940\nSo notice it changed it, right?\n\n244\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.230\nSo, it always will.\n\n245\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.740\nIf you type in the sub-net number,\nif I were to type in 172.16.10.0,\n\n246\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.960\nit would change it to 172.16.0.0.\n\n247\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.870\nSo, I'm in inversion two, no auto summary,\nthis is pretty much what I want it to look\n\n248\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.270\nlike, but if I have passive interface\ndefault and again, I can see this with\n\n249\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:25.640\na show IP proto, I gotta do the do, so\n\n250\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.140\nI'm running rip and routing for networks,\nbut all my interfaces are passive here.\n\n251\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.330\nSo that again,\nthat's where we're gonna look.\n\n252\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.230\nI'm sending version 2,\nreceiving version 2.\n\n253\n00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.690\nNotice I just don't have any networks\nunder here that I'd seen, right?\n\n254\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.670\nSo if you see something like this,\nyou would check for\n\n255\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.560\nyour network statements here and\nthen come down under passive interfaces.\n\n256\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.110\nThe other thing you're gonna\ncheck is your filters.\n\n257\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.900\nWe'll go ahead and\nput one in there so you can see that.\n\n258\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.540\nWhoops, come on.\n\n259\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.932\nOkay.\nAnd then I need to do,\n\n260\n00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:58.656\nI'm under router rip,\nno passive interface,\n\n261\n00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:02.920\nS0/1/0 and serial 0/20, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:10.050\nSo add two of those and then if I\ndo the show proto, show IP proto.\n\n263\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.240\nAnd I'll come down here and\nsee that routing for\n\n264\n00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.930\nnetworks that I don't\nhave those as virtual.\n\n265\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.680\nThat there's my interfaces right there,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.540\nAnd then I'm sending and\nreceiving, too, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.040\nSo, pretty straightforward.\n\n268\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.590\nI'm going to show you guys something,\nthough.\n\n269\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.810\nI'm going to come under here.\n\n270\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:34.940\nSo something I hadn't shown you before and\nsee if I can get down here.\n\n271\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.655\nI'm going to say config t and\nI'm going to create a default route.\n\n272\n00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:46.915\nAnd you need to look for\nthis on your exam objectives, as well.\n\n273\n00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:49.205\nAnd I'm going to send it out my f00,\nright?\n\n274\n00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:51.925\nYou can send a default\nroute out a LAN interface.\n\n275\n00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:54.880\nYou really want it on a point-to-point\nlink, though, because it will cause\n\n276\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.519\na tremendous amount of traffic if this\nwas a lot of hosts out there, and\n\n277\n00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.221\nstuff like that.\n\n278\n00:13:58.221 --> 00:14:00.246\nNow, I'm going to go into router rip, and\n\n279\n00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:03.868\nwe haven't done IPv6 on the other two\nrouters, don't let me forget that.\n\n280\n00:14:03.868 --> 00:14:04.665\n>> Okay.\n\n281\n00:14:04.665 --> 00:14:11.454\nAnd I want to type in this right here,\ndefault-information.\n\n282\n00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:15.714\nSo I want to tell my other rip routers in\nIP version 4 that I have the default route\n\n283\n00:14:15.714 --> 00:14:17.380\nout of the autonomous system.\n\n284\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:24.805\nSo I'm going to say default and\nI want to default information,\n\n285\n00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:28.879\ndefault information originate.\n\n286\n00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:32.057\nRight, that's it,\nthe default information originates here.\n\n287\n00:14:32.057 --> 00:14:35.323\nSo now if I go in and was to look\nin my other San Francisco network,\n\n288\n00:14:35.323 --> 00:14:39.270\nthey should have the default route\ninjected into the routing table, right?\n\n289\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.710\nSo I do show ip route,\nI should have it here as well.\n\n290\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.840\nIt says I set it here, so\nI'm going to have that.\n\n291\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.020\nIt's directly connected.\n\n292\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.530\nBut I'm gonna go look at those.\n\n293\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:55.640\nNow, before I run up and do tha,t since\nI'm down here, I didn't add my rip ng.\n\n294\n00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.641\nSo I'm gonna type exit and say IPv6,\n\n295\n00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:04.390\nrouter rip one.\n\n296\n00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.580\nJust turn that on,\nthat's all I need to do.\n\n297\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.630\nAnd then I'm gonna come up to here.\n\n298\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.650\nOops, I need to go to my interface.\n\n299\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.939\nIt's do, show IP int brief.\n\n300\n00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:21.695\nAnd I've got FastEthernet 0/0 and\nthen my three serials.\n\n301\n00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:23.695\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\nturn that on.\n\n302\n00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:28.015\nSo I'm gonna say interface f0/0 IPv6\n\n303\n00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:34.686\nrip 1 enable, that's it,\nyeah, I had to remember.\n\n304\n00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:39.365\nAnd then interface s/0/0/0 and\nthen interface\n\n305\n00:15:39.365 --> 00:15:44.500\ns0/1/0 and interface s0/2/0.\n\n306\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.790\nHopefully you guys can build this lab,\n\n307\n00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.120\nbecause to patch CCNA you really\ngotta be able to do this.\n\n308\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.670\nSo then I turn on rip ng.\n\n309\n00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.023\nVery simple guys.\n\n310\n00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:56.390\nYou don't need passive interfaces.\n\n311\n00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.024\nRemember I put on passive interfaces,\nturn them off.\n\n312\n00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:02.475\nLet's go up and\nwe're gonna verify now IP version four.\n\n313\n00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:03.644\nEverything should be working.\n\n314\n00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:05.780\nI went through all the things\nthat could be wrong.\n\n315\n00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.060\nWe are going to start with OSPF.\n\n316\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.340\nThat will just take a few more minutes.\n\n317\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.950\nLet me run up here and do a show IP route.\n\n318\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.080\nThis is my IP version four table.\n\n319\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.670\nNotice, I have a gateway of last resorts.\n\n320\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.560\nNow, what you guys want to look for\n\n321\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.790\nand the reason I put this in here, that\ndidn't really go out of my tunnel system.\n\n322\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.910\nThat went to my corporate LAN,\nthat my DMZ or whatever, right.\n\n323\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.130\nSo the thing is, you're going to say,\nokay, Gus, his last resort is 10.1,\n\n324\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.300\nthat goes to my corporate network.\n\n325\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.400\nThis didn't tell me where that went to.\n\n326\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.700\nSo, either why can't you\nget to the internet?\n\n327\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.860\nWell, that's not my internet connection.\n\n328\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.330\nSo, you need to look at the network and\n\n329\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.060\nunderstand what your\ngateway to last resort is.\n\n330\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.960\nBecause notice we'll see down here\nat the bottom, we'll see that,\n\n331\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.540\nshould see that inserted\nin here somewhere.\n\n332\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.650\nThere it is, on top.\n\n333\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.260\nSee the rip with the asterisk, right.\n\n334\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.440\nAnd we can't tell that that's wrong.\n\n335\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.370\nSo in order to find that this is wrong,\n\n336\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.620\nyou're going to have to see\nsome sort of network map.\n\n337\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.970\nYou're going to look at that and\nsee where this default route.\n\n338\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.800\nSo, the reason I'm telling you this is,\nbecause you deemed it.\n\n339\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.490\nNow, when I go to ospf,\nit's going to do the same thing.\n\n340\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.080\nI'm just going to leave that in there,\nthat default route.\n\n341\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.410\nI'm going to put default\ninformation originate under ospf.\n\n342\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.230\nIt's going to insert those in there and\nwhat you want to\n\n343\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.450\ndo in your troubleshooting is,\nverify that that route.\n\n344\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.840\nBecause it's going to go the wrong way.\n\n345\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.570\nI'm telling you right now,\nit's going to go the wrong way.\n\n346\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.680\nYou're going to look at that.\n\n347\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.580\nSo what am I looking at here?\n\n348\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.760\nI'm going to look for my default routes.\n\n349\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.230\nI'm going to look in here, make sure it\ngoes the right way, show IP proto and\n\n350\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.510\nwe're not even in IPv6 yet.\n\n351\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.990\nLook for my filters here.\n\n352\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.680\nMy distribute lists and again,\nwe'll get into those in a minute.\n\n353\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.080\nLook for my timers here.\n\n354\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.570\nIf there's a key-chain, version.\n\n355\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.860\nIf I have the right interfaces.\n\n356\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.840\nThe right passive interface.\n\n357\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.370\nYou're going to see wrong\npassive interfaces set.\n\n358\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.690\nYou're going to have passive\ninterfaces on your interfaces.\n\n359\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.890\nPossibly key-chain.\n\n360\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.120\nPossibly wrong version.\n\n361\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.880\nPossibly hold time.\n\n362\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.410\nPossibly an access list here and\nthen, possibly a wrong default route.\n\n363\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.552\nIf that's not enough,\nwe're just getting started.\n\n364\n00:17:54.552 --> 00:17:58.800\nAll right, so none of this is hard\nthough and all of this is fun.\n\n365\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.840\nIt's fun, right, Ronnie?\n\n366\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.360\n>> It is.\n>> Show ipv6 route.\n\n367\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.420\nI got to spell ipv6 right.\n\n368\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.420\nOkay, and so we can see,\nhere's my rip routes, right.\n\n369\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.270\nSo, I can see that's my subnet one,\nwhich is off my corp router.\n\n370\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.330\nIf we looked at my drawing,\nthere's my seven and eight.\n\n371\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.930\nThose are the two WAN links\nconnecting Corp to LA and then, so\n\n372\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.360\nwe can see that in that show IPv6 proto.\n\n373\n00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.490\nI like that.\n\n374\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.220\nOkay so,\nthis one's a little easier to read.\n\n375\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.450\nThere's not a lot here, though.\n\n376\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.770\nCheck this out.\n\n377\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.690\nWe don't have it again.\n\n378\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.810\nNo passive under here, but we can\nredistribute to another routing protocol.\n\n379\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.770\nThat is not in the objectives,\nso maybe next time.\n\n380\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.190\nAnyways, we can see we have\nIPv6 routing protocol is rip 1.\n\n381\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:47.340\nWe can do a show\n\n382\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.610\nIPv6 route and show IPv6 protocol.\n\n383\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.190\nRight, so there's some other commands.\n\n384\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.810\nSh ipv6 rip and then,\n\n385\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:02.480\nwe can type in one I believe, and\nthat's going to give us some information.\n\n386\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.780\nAdministrative distance.\n\n387\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:09.000\nRemember, there is nothing new in\nthis routing protocol for rep, okay.\n\n388\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.200\nRonnie, any questions you could come\nup with that maybe they want to ask me?\n\n389\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.760\n>> No, I can't think of anything.\n\n390\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.250\nBut just remember that we have to make\nsure that we get the configurations on\n\n391\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.980\nthere that we need to.\n\n392\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.000\nAnd pay attention to that\ndefault information originate.\n\n393\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.870\nI'm pretty sure that'll pop up.\n\n394\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.806\n>> It does,\nbecause it's going to send you the wrong-\n\n395\n00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:28.477\n>> Yeah, gotcha.\n\n396\n00:19:28.477 --> 00:19:29.278\n>> Default route.\n\n397\n00:19:29.278 --> 00:19:32.070\nThat's what you need to remember, because\nyou're going to look at a config, go.\n\n398\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.770\nI don't have a default lab\nconfigured on here, you're right.\n\n399\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.210\nIt's being injected from another router\nand it's pointing in the wrong direction.\n\n400\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.983\nThe other thing I want to point\nout on the screen here is,\n\n401\n00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:43.886\nthe multi-cask group for IP version six.\n\n402\n00:19:43.886 --> 00:19:49.420\nFor rip ng FF02 is my router multi\ncast group, it's a local multi cast.\n\n403\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.330\nRight, colon colon none is RIP version 2.\n\n404\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.283\nColon colon 10.\n\n405\n00:19:53.283 --> 00:19:56.708\nWell, it's not 10 but\ncolon colon 10 is EGRIP v6, but\n\n406\n00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:59.320\nit's going to be a colon colon A,\nisn't it?\n\n407\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.460\nAnd then for ospf it's going to be FF\nzero two colon colon five is correct.\n\n408\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.770\nOkay, so\njust wanted to show that one thing.\n\n409\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.440\nAlso we use UDP port 521.\n\n410\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.400\nNothing new under the sun here guys.\n\n411\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.710\nSo that's RIP.\n\n412\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.420\nAgain, I went through all\nthe troubleshooting spots for that.\n\n413\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:20.080\nI don't know how big that's going to be,\nbut I promise you I've covered everything.\n\n414\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.150\nAll right, so let me bring this up here.\n\n415\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.260\nLets, now, we're going to leave\nrip running, because we can.\n\n416\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.350\nWe've got rip for IP version four\nwe've got rip for IP version 6 and\n\n417\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.220\nour network is up and running.\n\n418\n00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:31.980\nIt's awesome.\n\n419\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.330\n>> Did you configure IPv6 for\nthe LA router?\n\n420\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.550\nI can't remember.\n\n421\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.787\n>> I thought I did.\nMaybe I didn't.\n\n422\n00:20:36.787 --> 00:20:37.475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't.\n\n423\n00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:40.050\n[LAUGH] Well,\nit was your job to tell me to.\n\n424\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:40.820\n>> I just remembered.\n\n425\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.016\n>> Okay, so let's make sure.\n\n426\n00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:48.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Show ipv6 route.\n\n427\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.630\nNo, I only have directly\nconnected in there.\n\n428\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.685\n>> No.\n>> Nice job, Ronnie.\n\n429\n00:20:50.685 --> 00:20:51.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, right.\n\n430\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.568\nConfig t.\n\n431\n00:20:52.568 --> 00:20:59.918\nIPv6 router rip and our process ID\nshow IP int brief do show IPv6.\n\n432\n00:20:59.918 --> 00:21:03.593\nNot show IP In sys brief is fine,\n\n433\n00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:09.050\nbecause I just want to\nsee what my interface is.\n\n434\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.060\nI don't care about the IP addresses.\n\n435\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.190\nI want to see I'm using\nFastEthernet0/0 and two serials.\n\n436\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.920\nRight, I'm typing in IPV6.\n\n437\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.740\nIt wouldnt've worked as well,\nbut this one works fine.\n\n438\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.710\nSo I'll go ahead and do it,\njust so we can see it.\n\n439\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.840\nI don't know if that's any easier to read.\n\n440\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.970\nI don't know, maybe.\n\n441\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.616\nWhen you see FastEthernet 0/0,\nnothing on 0/0, but 1/0 and 2/0.\n\n442\n00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:37.500\nI'm using the loopback,\nI guess I could add that or not.\n\n443\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.700\nSo interface FastEthernet 0/0.\n\n444\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.580\nWhat am I typing in here?\n\n445\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.946\nIPv6 rip 1 enable.\n\n446\n00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:49.002\nInterface s0/1/0.\n\n447\n00:21:49.002 --> 00:21:52.770\nInterface s0/2/0.\n\n448\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.750\nWell, this is pretty easy.\n\n449\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.740\nI think that was it, right?\n\n450\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.720\nBut I can add the loop back.\n\n451\n00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.180\nI might as well.\n\n452\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:57.680\nWhy not?\n\n453\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.050\nThat's it, right?\n\n454\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.246\nDo show IPv6 rip.\n\n455\n00:22:02.246 --> 00:22:03.086\nOkay.\n\n456\n00:22:03.086 --> 00:22:09.310\nSo after the zero nine we can\nsee the interfaces on here.\n\n457\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:14.070\nDo show IP V6 proto\n\n458\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.760\nrip and we can see our interfaces\nthat are involved in that process.\n\n459\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.870\nDo show IPv6 route okay and\n\n460\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.560\nnow we can see our rip injected routes\nthese are my remotes on that here.\n\n461\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.590\nOne thing to bring in mind guys,\nnotice that I do not communicate.\n\n462\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.750\nThis is my IPv6 address.\n\n463\n00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.570\nThis is the subnet, notice it's subnet,\ncolon, colon, means that's all host bit 0.\n\n464\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.850\nSo, that's my subnet and\nthat's my network ID and\n\n465\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.670\nI'm communicating to get to that\nnetwork via the link local address.\n\n466\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.680\nWe're going to see that on\nevery routing protocol.\n\n467\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.070\nYou don't communicate using the next hop.\n\n468\n00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.100\nYou communicate using the,\nwell it is the next hop, but\n\n469\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.040\nit's the link local address, okay?\n\n470\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.340\nSo when you ping this, interesting enough,\n\n471\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.610\nthis is going to be my\nneighbor off of serial 0 1 0.\n\n472\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.860\nSo, let's go ahead and\nping that guy, right.\n\n473\n00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.754\nMake sure that I can.\n\n474\n00:23:02.754 --> 00:23:08.280\nSo, I'm going to say ping and\nlet me bring up here,\n\n475\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.790\nmake this a little my gosh,\nit couldn't have been any bigger.\n\n476\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.810\n[COUGH]\nOkay, so\n\n477\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:20.440\nI'm going to grab this guy and I got my\nping down there, at least I thought I did.\n\n478\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.950\nYep, that's my extended ping, so\n\n479\n00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.070\nlet me come back up here and\nI'm going to highlight this.\n\n480\n00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.620\nHold on.\n\n481\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.610\nThis is how you do IPv6 guys.\n\n482\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.960\nMark Right, and I'm going to grab\nthis link local address, right.\n\n483\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.820\nThat's his link local.\n\n484\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.520\nThat's my neighbor.\n\n485\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.660\nThat's the corps router office serial,\n010.\n\n486\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.990\nOkay, so\nwatch what happens when I ping him.\n\n487\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.460\nI'm going to say, copy.\n\n488\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.410\nOkay, say ping and then paste.\n\n489\n00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.081\nAnd it's going to ask me,\nwell, which interface,\n\n490\n00:23:47.081 --> 00:23:49.310\nbecause see that's a link local address.\n\n491\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.286\nIt has no idea how to get there.\n\n492\n00:23:51.286 --> 00:23:52.836\nIt knows it's directly connected,\n\n493\n00:23:52.836 --> 00:23:54.991\nbut it doesnt know off which\ninterface it is right?\n\n494\n00:23:54.991 --> 00:24:00.393\nSo I'm going to just say it's off of Zero\nOne Zero i believe [LAUGH] We'll find out.\n\n495\n00:24:00.393 --> 00:24:01.608\nInvalid interface.\n\n496\n00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:05.070\nNo, it's not invalid, it just doesn't\nlike me to type out the whole thing.\n\n497\n00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.490\nSo now I pinged it.\n\n498\n00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.570\nSo when you do a link local, now if I\nwas to just use the next hop, right,\n\n499\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.575\nif I was to go get their IP address, copy\nand paste in here, it wouldn't ask me it,\n\n500\n00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:16.460\ncuz it would route to it, right, and\nunderstand, hey, it's off that interface.\n\n501\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.790\nIn this case here, when you ping\nthe link local it says, well,\n\n502\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.570\nwhich interface is that link local off of,\nright?\n\n503\n00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.630\nAnyways, okay, so we got that.\n\n504\n00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.060\nLet's go ahead and do OSPF and\nOSPF V3, all right?\n\n505\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.130\nSo config t.\n\n506\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.548\nNow I'm gonna say router ipv6 again,\nipv6 router ospf, and 1.\n\n507\n00:24:40.548 --> 00:24:45.760\nAgain, I always use the same number,\nright, I like to do that.\n\n508\n00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.060\nNow I can put a rid underneath here,\nand let's go ahead and do that.\n\n509\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.580\nSo I'm gonna say router-id,\nand check this out, 0.0.0.\n\n510\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.250\nAnd notice on my rid, I'm just gonna do,\nwell, let's do this one as 3.\n\n511\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.860\nAnd I'll do the corp as 1 and\nSan Francisco as 2.\n\n512\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.140\nSo 1, 2, 3, and this will be my number 3.\n\n513\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.090\nSo notice I'm setting them in this way.\n\n514\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.240\nAnd I'm doing this for a reason, cuz I\nsaw this as an example in the objectives.\n\n515\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.480\nSo just wanted you to get used to\nseeing something simple like that.\n\n516\n00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.670\nAll right, so I set the router ID.\n\n517\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.560\nThat's pretty much all\nI'm gonna do under here.\n\n518\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.600\nAgain, no passing interface is needed\nbecause we set it on interfaces only.\n\n519\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.240\nAnd even in IP version 4,\nI don't have to use passing interfaces\n\n520\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.270\nbecause I can set IP,\nOSPF on the interfaces as well.\n\n521\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.040\nAnd that's what you see on the objectives,\nthey're configured that way.\n\n522\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.930\nNow let's go ahead, and now I need\nto see what interfaces I'm using.\n\n523\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.598\nI know what they are,\nthey're serial 0/1/0, 00/2/0,\n\n524\n00:25:39.598 --> 00:25:42.321\nwe have the loopback we're using,\nand the Fast Ethernet's 0/0.\n\n525\n00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:43.338\nAll right, so I'm gonna say interface f00.\n\n526\n00:25:43.338 --> 00:25:47.362\nAnd I'm gonna say ipv6 ospf.\n\n527\n00:25:47.362 --> 00:25:52.650\nOkay, and then my process ID.\n\n528\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.226\nAnd then I need my area.\n\n529\n00:25:54.226 --> 00:25:59.500\nOkay, ipv6, process ID, area 0, that's it.\n\n530\n00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.210\nSo then I go to each interface.\n\n531\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.630\nAnd again, very easy, because, 0/2/0,\n\n532\n00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.860\nbecause the thing is is,\nif I wanted to change this and\n\n533\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.300\nput this guy in a different area,\nall you do is that.\n\n534\n00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.560\nAnd that interface is now in area 1.\n\n535\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.880\nI don't have to do the network statements\nor anything like that, so very simple.\n\n536\n00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.450\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo the loopback, why not.\n\n537\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.233\nThese show up as sos32s, right?\n\n538\n00:26:24.233 --> 00:26:26.205\nBut on IPv6 it's gonna be different.\n\n539\n00:26:26.205 --> 00:26:28.870\nOkay, I think that's about it, Ronnie.\n\n540\n00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.820\nI think I'm done, okay?\n\n541\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.970\nDo show ipv6 route, okay?\n\n542\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:34.704\nI'm not going to see anything in here now.\n\n543\n00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:39.350\nI'm gonna still see my rips, because I\ndon't have any adjacencies, all right?\n\n544\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.690\nBut I can still check my configuration,\nright?\n\n545\n00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:48.510\nSo there is, now I have rip,\nand here's my ospf.\n\n546\n00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.880\nShow IPv6 proto,\nshow IPv6 protocols, all right?\n\n547\n00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.450\nSo all of them are in area 0.\n\n548\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.370\nSo this would be separated,\nif I had an area 1,\n\n549\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.150\nthen we'd see another list down here\nof all the interfaces in that area.\n\n550\n00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.980\nThese are some really great commands,\nright?\n\n551\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.260\nSo we can do the neighbors and so on.\n\n552\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.950\nBut let's see, I got IPv6 running up here,\nwith OSPF and rip.\n\n553\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.210\nI think we're looking good.\n\n554\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.240\nSo let's come down here to San Francisco.\n\n555\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.360\nSo these aren't gonna work yet.\n\n556\n00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.870\nAnd I did that one as 3,\nthis guy's gonna be rid of 2.\n\n557\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.091\nAll right, so I'm making these,\n\n558\n00:27:20.091 --> 00:27:25.000\nthere's a reason I'm making those\nrids that number, just pay attention.\n\n559\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.720\nconfig t, ipv6 router ospf 1.\n\n560\n00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.800\nOkay, again,\nI use the same number every time.\n\n561\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.530\nThis isn't important.\n\n562\n00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.110\nWhen you get DIGRP it is,\nbut that's the only time.\n\n563\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.760\nThe other ones I just use 1 all\nthe time just cuz it's easy.\n\n564\n00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.170\nAnd I'm gonna say router-id 0/0.\n\n565\n00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:44.898\nOkay, and then my interfaces,\n\n566\n00:27:44.898 --> 00:27:49.783\nipv6 router ospf area 0.\n\n567\n00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.210\nWhat did I type in?\n\n568\n00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.120\n>> No, not router.\n\n569\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.450\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.070\nJust testing you,\n\n571\n00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.961\nRonnie, see if you're paying attention.\n\n572\n00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:02.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's not sleeping over here.\n\n573\n00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.580\nI forgot my process id.\n\n574\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.860\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n575\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.190\n>> That's what, I did it backwards.\n\n576\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.790\nWait a minute, I'm not in my interface,\nwhat happened?\n\n577\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.510\nThat's what had happened.\n\n578\n00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.285\nI said I typed it.\n\n579\n00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:13.360\nCuz when I made a mistake,\nit took me back.\n\n580\n00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.483\nCuz I said ipv6 router,\n\n581\n00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:18.040\nit took me out to global config\nwhere the router's configured.\n\n582\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.260\nSo I believe that's right, okay.\n\n583\n00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.930\nInterface s0/0/0, and\nI don't know if that loopback's working or\n\n584\n00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.555\nnot, but if it is, I think it is,\nwe just added it in there.\n\n585\n00:28:28.555 --> 00:28:34.480\nOkay, that's all there is to it,\ndo show ipv6 proto, verify my config.\n\n586\n00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.220\nEverything's in area 0, there's my\ninterfaces with process 1, I set my rid.\n\n587\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.575\nMan, OS payoff is easy with IP version 6,\nright?\n\n588\n00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:46.400\nActually, with IP version 4 it's easier\nnow that, I know we've been able to do\n\n589\n00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.780\nthe interfaces for a while, but it's still\nsomewhat new compared to how old OSPF is.\n\n590\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.770\nAnd that's a much easier way than\npeople having to put network\n\n591\n00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.350\nstatements in, right?\n\n592\n00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.990\nOkay, and now we don't have any\nadjacencies yet, right guys?\n\n593\n00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:05.965\nSo let's say config t,\nrouter, ipv5 router ospf 1,\n\n594\n00:29:05.965 --> 00:29:09.920\nokay, rid 0.0.0.1, okay?\n\n595\n00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:17.430\nAnd then my interfaces are f0/0,\nipv6 ospf 1 area 0.\n\n596\n00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.400\nI'm gonna make him area 1, why not.\n\n597\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.770\nAnd then, whoops,\nI wanna do interface s0/0/0.\n\n598\n00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.750\nAnd he's gonna be area 0,\ninterface s0/1/0.\n\n599\n00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:35.380\nAnd notice my adjacencies are coming up,\nof course.\n\n600\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.820\nAnd then interface s0/2/0.\n\n601\n00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.960\nSo I got a separate area.\n\n602\n00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.260\nWe're just really throwing caution\nto the wind here, aren't we?\n\n603\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.890\n[LAUGH] So I put those all in there.\n\n604\n00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.670\nI don't have any loopbacks on here.\n\n605\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.810\nWe're looking pretty good here.\n\n606\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:52.110\nNotice my, I'm seeing my neighbors.\n\n607\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.870\nRemember, we don't see their IP address.\n\n608\n00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.220\nThis is their rid, right,\nthe number by which they're known to OSPF.\n\n609\n00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.620\nSo before I put these on the interfaces,\nI set the rid.\n\n610\n00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.600\nAnd now my rid is not,\n\n611\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.530\nwell first off, with IP version 6, the rid\nstill has to be a 32-bit number, right?\n\n612\n00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.820\nSo, but in this case here\nI'm telling it what it is.\n\n613\n00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.290\nSo it's not gonna be an IPv6 address.\n\n614\n00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.480\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo some verifications and\n\n615\n00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.140\ntalk about some troubleshooting spots and\nwhat you're gonna look for.\n\n616\n00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.199\nShow ipv6 route,\nlet's see how we're doing here.\n\n617\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.300\nNotice I still have a rip in there,\nbut I've got some Os up here, right?\n\n618\n00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.910\nI wonder where that rip's coming from.\n\n619\n00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.980\nI might have a bad, we're gonna\nhave to go take a look at that,\n\n620\n00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.330\nbecause this is\na troubleshooting opportunity.\n\n621\n00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.810\nWhy is this rip route in here?\n\n622\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:43.690\nSo all these other ones, here's Subnet\n5 here, but off of serial 0/2/0.\n\n623\n00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.940\nSo we'll go take a look at that.\n\n624\n00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.390\nBut hold on, gonna run through\nsome other commands first.\n\n625\n00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.280\nShow ipv6 proto.\n\n626\n00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:57.220\nOkay, so notice I see area 1,\nright, area 0.\n\n627\n00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.740\nSo there's my rip 1, here's my ospf 1.\n\n628\n00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.180\nAll right, so I didn't remember,\nI guess I left DIGRP on.\n\n629\n00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.900\n[LAUGH] It didn't really matter,\nbecause if you just turn on a routing\n\n630\n00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.040\nprotocol on one router, it doesn't have\nanybody to make an adjacency with.\n\n631\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.860\nI didn't even know it was running.\n\n632\n00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.600\nAnyways, routing protocols ospf 1, Area 0.\n\n633\n00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.030\nI have these interfaces.\n\n634\n00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.260\nArea 0/0/1 is down here.\n\n635\n00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.550\nI'm an area border router now.\n\n636\n00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.530\nPretty simple, show ipv6 ospf, Enter.\n\n637\n00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.900\nI want to show you guys this.\n\n638\n00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.764\nThis is an important command here, and\nit's the same thing with IP version 4,\n\n639\n00:31:35.764 --> 00:31:36.506\nactually.\n\n640\n00:31:36.506 --> 00:31:42.540\nType show ip ospf, Enter, right,\nand show ipv6 ospf, Enter.\n\n641\n00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:47.125\nAll right, routing process ospf v3, right,\n\n642\n00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:51.490\nprocess 1, with my rid is 0.0.0.1.\n\n643\n00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.660\nI'm an area border router.\n\n644\n00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.311\nI'm pretty special.\n\n645\n00:31:55.311 --> 00:31:56.425\nThis is pretty cool.\n\n646\n00:31:56.425 --> 00:32:01.730\nAll right, so\nI have a BACKBONE(0) in Area 1.\n\n647\n00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.704\nOkay, number of interface in this area is\n3, right, I put my 3 serials and so on.\n\n648\n00:32:05.704 --> 00:32:07.660\nSo this gives me a lot\nof good information.\n\n649\n00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.710\nMinimum L, okay, so\nlet's take this though, show ip ospf.\n\n650\n00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.517\nThis is gonna give me my Ipv4.\n\n651\n00:32:14.517 --> 00:32:17.490\nDid we not turn on ospf for IP version 4?\n\n652\n00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.596\nI guess we just turned it [LAUGH] on for\nIP version 6.\n\n653\n00:32:20.596 --> 00:32:22.640\n>> [CROSSTALK] six.\n>> [LAUGH] That's awesome.\n\n654\n00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.240\nScrew it.\n\n655\n00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.347\nWe don't want IP version 4.\n\n656\n00:32:24.347 --> 00:32:25.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I only want IP version 6.\n\n657\n00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.440\nTake IPv4 off.\n\n658\n00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.900\nI don't even want it on here.\n\n659\n00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.830\nThis is great.\n\n660\n00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.570\nAll right, show IP version 6 ospf.\n\n661\n00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.060\nLet's take a look at our neighbor table.\n\n662\n00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.955\nOkay, we are fully adjacent.\n\n663\n00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:42.680\nKay and Ronnie list the four states\nto get us to fully adjacent.\n\n664\n00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.510\nSo we end up in down state, then we\ninitialize and we end up in two way state.\n\n665\n00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:52.250\nFrom there, I talk to the exchange\nhellos and we've got our rids.\n\n666\n00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.870\nWe know who our rids are.\n\n667\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.500\nAll right,\nnow we're gonna have an election.\n\n668\n00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.830\nAnd we need to end up in what state now,\nwhat's the next state?\n\n669\n00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.675\n>> Exstart.\n\n670\n00:32:59.675 --> 00:33:02.775\n>> Exstart, what would be the reason\nwe wouldn't get out of Exstart?\n\n671\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.625\nOkay, why would we be stuck in Exstart?\n\n672\n00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.980\n>> I don't know, [LAUGH] I can't remember.\n\n673\n00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.895\n>> Okay,\nremember the Sally didn't like Bob's wife.\n\n674\n00:33:13.895 --> 00:33:14.570\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n675\n00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.990\n>> I can't believe you forgot this.\n\n676\n00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.010\nBob showed up with a small-\n>> That's right.\n\n677\n00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:24.095\n>> His transmission unit\njust wasn't working for us.\n\n678\n00:33:24.095 --> 00:33:25.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So maximum transmission,\n\n679\n00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.170\nthe MTUs didn't match.\n\n680\n00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.100\n>> Didn't match.\n>> Right, she had an expectation that\n\n681\n00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.100\nhe couldn't meet.\n\n682\n00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.020\nAll right, so if your MTUs don't match,\nyou don't get Exstart.\n\n683\n00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:34.790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n684\n00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:38.790\nThen it's-\n>> Exstart, exchange.\n\n685\n00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.020\n>> Right.\nThis one our links saved databases.\n\n686\n00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.480\n>> The DDP?\n\n687\n00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:48.110\n>> Yeah, and our database,\nand then what's the next one?\n\n688\n00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.789\nExchange.\nAnd then Exstart,\n\n689\n00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:52.948\nExchange, I think I'm\nmissing one in there.\n\n690\n00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:53.960\nThat gives up to full.\n\n691\n00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.790\nI'm gonna have to look.\n\n692\n00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.580\nI'm gonna look that one up.\n\n693\n00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.000\nI think I might be missing one.\n\n694\n00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.970\nThere was four in there.\n\n695\n00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.730\nAnyways, and then we end up in full state.\n\n696\n00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:08.320\nNow the dashes here are our\nbecause of serial links, right?\n\n697\n00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.860\nSo, you notice we have our interface IDs\nand these are the serial interfaces,\n\n698\n00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.685\n[COUGH]\nso this the rids, right.\n\n699\n00:34:19.685 --> 00:34:22.905\nSo you guys, I don't know if you notice\nwhat this is, you guys see what this is?\n\n700\n00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:26.115\nDoes anyone, let me type this up so\nit goes above there, what is that?\n\n701\n00:34:27.425 --> 00:34:29.255\nWhat is the interface ID?\n\n702\n00:34:29.255 --> 00:34:30.623\nThat's weird isn't it?\n\n703\n00:34:30.623 --> 00:34:34.602\nNot really, cuz [INAUDIBLE] links in IPV6,\nI'd rather have them do this,\n\n704\n00:34:34.602 --> 00:34:38.517\nthan pull out the whole IPV6 network\naddress, because I would see this as\n\n705\n00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:43.382\n172.16.10.6 and 10.5 or something like\nthat, these are the actual subnet\n\n706\n00:34:43.382 --> 00:34:47.260\nnumbers of the IP version 6 that I\nput in there, I used 5 and 6, right?\n\n707\n00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:54.300\nSo the point is is that we see two\n5 because I have two links, right?\n\n708\n00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.808\nSo anyways, so we see 5 and 6,\nall right, so we see Serial0/0/0,\n\n709\n00:34:58.808 --> 00:35:00.795\nSerial0/1/0 and 2/0.\n\n710\n00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:05.313\nAll right, so\nthose are my interface IDs and\n\n711\n00:35:05.313 --> 00:35:10.823\nthen let's go ahead and\ndo show ipv6 ospf topology.\n\n712\n00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.762\nI want to see this, that's why I type\nit with the grp database, right?\n\n713\n00:35:19.762 --> 00:35:20.660\n>> Right.\n\n714\n00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.340\n>> All right, so\nnow these are my different links.\n\n715\n00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.710\nNotice they're off my rid.\n\n716\n00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.520\nSo this is my Corp,\nthis is the SamCicso, this is the LA.\n\n717\n00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.160\nSo, see, what happened is I\nnamed those routers, right?\n\n718\n00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.800\nSo now I can look at these and\nunderstand where they came from and\n\n719\n00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.900\nthe links that are on there and\nget the information about them.\n\n720\n00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.110\nAll right, and\nget my different links IDs, right?\n\n721\n00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.640\nSo, anyway, so\nI will see every link in the network and\n\n722\n00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.480\nI'm actually seeing the,\nhere they are right here.\n\n723\n00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.130\nSo here's my subnets, right?\n\n724\n00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.470\nI have a 3 in there somewhere.\n\n725\n00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.080\nI think I didn't advertise the 3, right?\n\n726\n00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.150\nNo, there it is, 2, 3,\nnow 1 is off of corp here.\n\n727\n00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.560\nBut there's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, right?\n\n728\n00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.320\nThere's every link in the network.\n\n729\n00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.440\nSo if you had a 100 links,\nthey have to be in here, all right?\n\n730\n00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:16.020\nSo let's turn on OSPF [LAUGH] version 4,\nand then troubleshoot that\n\n731\n00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:22.090\na little bit because we need to\nlook at the interfaces, okay?\n\n732\n00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:26.840\nSo after this, we're gonna turn on\nIP version 4, troubleshoot it, and\n\n733\n00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.570\nthen we'll break the segment and\nstart it again cuz we\n\n734\n00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.160\ngot a lot more troubleshooting yet to do,\nbut just bear with me one more time.\n\n735\n00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.460\nLet's turn on IP version 4.\n\n736\n00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.300\nWe're gonna use the interface IDs,\nand I'm gonna screw it up and\n\n737\n00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.260\nsee if Ronnie can fix it.\n\n738\n00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.310\nWhat do you guys say?\n\n739\n00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.020\nAll right, sounds fun.\n\n740\n00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.260\nStick around.\n\n741\n00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:41.760\nConfig t.\n\n742\n00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.430\nRouter ospf 1.\n\n743\n00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.040\nI'll just use the same network number.\n\n744\n00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.450\nNow, I don't need the passive interface or\nanything like that, but\n\n745\n00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.370\nI can go ahead and set my RID,\nand I need to do this here.\n\n746\n00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.380\nAnd we'll go ahead and do this.\n\n747\n00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.130\nI like that idea,\nyou can set them the same, right?\n\n748\n00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.010\nSo let's see if we can set them the same.\n\n749\n00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.200\nSo that's the same one I'm using for IPv6\non this router, let's see what happens.\n\n750\n00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.411\nSo now I'm gonna go into interface f0/0,\nand\n\n751\n00:37:09.411 --> 00:37:13.270\nip ospf process id 1, area 1.\n\n752\n00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.330\nI'm doing the same thing, right?\n\n753\n00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.200\nRemember, this has nothing\nto do with IP version 6.\n\n754\n00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.810\nThey don't even see each other.\n\n755\n00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.500\nThey're like ships in the night, right?\n\n756\n00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.900\nSo what they mean is they're passing,\nbefore you have radar,\n\n757\n00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.340\nthey're ships in the night\npassing in the dark.\n\n758\n00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.740\nThat term's been around for\na really long time, rIght?\n\n759\n00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:36.250\nAnyways, so I'm gonna just configure\nit the same way with IPv4, right?\n\n760\n00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.360\nAnd then I'm gonna go to int s0/0/0.\n\n761\n00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.995\nAnd I'm just gonna put that in there, a 0.\n\n762\n00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.910\nMan, how easy is this, guys?\n\n763\n00:37:50.288 --> 00:37:52.470\nI'm done.\n\n764\n00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.800\nDoesn't get any easier than that.\n\n765\n00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.640\nNo passive interface,\nI don't want something on an interface,\n\n766\n00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.770\nI just don't put ospf on there.\n\n767\n00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.830\nDone, and done, and done, all right?\n\n768\n00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.340\nSo we'll come up here real quick.\n\n769\n00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:08.787\nOkay, so router ospf 1 Rid is,\n\n770\n00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:15.800\nrouter id is 0.0.0.2, I believe.\n\n771\n00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.750\nI like to keep the name simple.\n\n772\n00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.310\nYou can use a quad address here like this.\n\n773\n00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.530\nYou can usually put some sort of 172.16\nfor a rid, obviously something like that.\n\n774\n00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.100\nThe higher it makes it, but\n\n775\n00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.590\nkeeping them low like this makes it\neasier to understand, doesn't it?\n\n776\n00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:39.165\nOkay, now that being said, then I'm\ngonna go to interface f0/0 IP ospf 1,\n\n777\n00:38:39.165 --> 00:38:44.280\neverything's area 0 on these guys.\n\n778\n00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.150\nInterface s0/0/0, up arrow.\n\n779\n00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:51.650\nInterface, I don't know if I\nused looped back zero or not.\n\n780\n00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:52.456\nWe'll find out.\nNope.\n\n781\n00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:52.956\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n782\n00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:56.066\n>> You know what let's go ahead and do it.\n\n783\n00:38:56.066 --> 00:38:58.206\nAll right, I believe he's a 30.\n\n784\n00:38:58.206 --> 00:38:59.316\nLet's see if I don't screw\n\n785\n00:38:59.316 --> 00:38:59.996\nup my network here.\n\n786\n00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.210\nAnd since he's a loop back address,\nI'm gonna put this in here.\n\n787\n00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.840\nNow I have a loop back address and\n\n788\n00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.086\na rid underneath the process ID,\nwhich one becomes my router ID?\n\n789\n00:39:11.086 --> 00:39:12.950\nThe loopback.\n\n790\n00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.010\n>> Should be the RID.\n\n791\n00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.600\n>> Which one becomes the RID?\n\n792\n00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.530\nThe loopback?\n\n793\n00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.800\nYou mean the one in the process ID.\n\n794\n00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.200\nHe is correct,\nthat does take precedence, right?\n\n795\n00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.860\nAnd we'll find that out.\n\n796\n00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.580\nBut that's definitely true.\n\n797\n00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.480\nSo I go in when we've configured that,\nlet's run over here to this.\n\n798\n00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.370\nAlmost done, guys, hang in here.\n\n799\n00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.870\nWe've got to do more troubleshooting.\n\n800\n00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.760\nThis is extremely important.\n\n801\n00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.940\nI know you've been going\nthrough a lot of episodes.\n\n802\n00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.910\nDon't stop now,\nthis one's extremely important, all right?\n\n803\n00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.480\nConfig t.\n\n804\n00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.324\nrouter ospf 1.\n\n805\n00:39:43.324 --> 00:39:46.612\nrouter-id 0.0.0.3.\n\n806\n00:39:46.612 --> 00:39:48.694\nint f0/0.\n\n807\n00:39:48.694 --> 00:39:50.340\nip ospf 1 area 0.\n\n808\n00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.580\nVery simple, guys.\n\n809\n00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.804\nLook back 0 interface.\n\n810\n00:39:55.804 --> 00:39:57.771\nI didn't put an IP\naddress on there either.\n\n811\n00:39:57.771 --> 00:40:01.388\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> IP address, I thought I did.\n\n812\n00:40:01.388 --> 00:40:05.630\nI don't really wanna put these on here,\nbut I wanna show you.\n\n813\n00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:08.110\nNow notice I'm putting\na 32 bit address on here.\n\n814\n00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.040\nThey're loopbacks.\n\n815\n00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.490\nThey're for diagnostics, but\nalso for RIDs with those PF.\n\n816\n00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:19.363\nSo you typically use a 32 bit\naddress with something like this.\n\n817\n00:40:19.363 --> 00:40:23.949\nAnd then #int s0/1/0 And interface s0/2/0.\n\n818\n00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:25.488\nAll right.\n\n819\n00:40:25.488 --> 00:40:27.270\nAnd, badabing, badaboom.\n\n820\n00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.380\nLet's run down to the corp and\ndo the verification.\n\n821\n00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.350\nWe should be up and running.\n\n822\n00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.780\nSo notice I see network RID three, twice.\n\n823\n00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.440\n>> One on each link.\n\n824\n00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.810\nYep.\nOne for each link going to LA.\n\n825\n00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.830\nAnd then one going to San Francisco.\n\n826\n00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.520\nAll right.\n\n827\n00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.600\nShow IP proto.\n\n828\n00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.020\nWe're going to run through\nthe same commands.\n\n829\n00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.140\nI want to go through this with you.\n\n830\n00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.655\nFirst off there's rip,\nall right, I hit my space bar.\n\n831\n00:40:53.155 --> 00:40:54.235\nAnd then there's OSPF.\n\n832\n00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:58.625\nAnd let's talk about this.\n\n833\n00:40:58.625 --> 00:41:00.525\nOkay, what are you gonna look for?\n\n834\n00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:01.975\nI can put a distribute list on here.\n\n835\n00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:04.655\nI'm going to do that in the next episode.\n\n836\n00:41:04.655 --> 00:41:09.595\nMy RID, I'm an area border router so\nI'm connected to 0 and 1.\n\n837\n00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:15.710\nMaximum paths which interfaces,\nwhich one in to area 1.\n\n838\n00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.360\nSo notice I still broke them up.\n\n839\n00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.050\nThe area 0 to area 1.\n\n840\n00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.800\nNow, this reference bandwidth.\n\n841\n00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.490\nOkay, so didn't necessarily\nsee this in objectives, but\n\n842\n00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.690\nwhat this says is we're gonna reference\nthat our bandwidth is 100 megabits.\n\n843\n00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.140\nNow you can change this I\ndon't recommend this, but\n\n844\n00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.370\nthey're saying your minimum\nbandwidth on links is a 100 mg.\n\n845\n00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.160\nIt better be today.\n\n846\n00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.260\nIt used to be 56k, I think it was.\n\n847\n00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.810\nSo I mean that was years and\nyears ago, 15 years ago or\n\n848\n00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.700\nso they had the reference\nbandwidth way lower.\n\n849\n00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.262\nSo with Cisco this is different.\n\n850\n00:41:47.262 --> 00:41:50.490\nAll right, this is basically, what are we\nreferencing all our bandwidth with.\n\n851\n00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.680\nSo I'd change that, but\nI would be careful.\n\n852\n00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.950\nNotice my gateways.\n\n853\n00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:58.080\nThis is the name known by OSPF, right.\n\n854\n00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.540\nShow ip ospf.\n\n855\n00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.100\nAgain, we did this one with IP version 6.\n\n856\n00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.760\nHere's my process ID.\n\n857\n00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.970\nWe're running version 2.\n\n858\n00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:11.440\nMy rid, I'm in area border router and\n\n859\n00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.860\nso we get our lots of really\ngood information from here.\n\n860\n00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.550\nIf I had, if I was a DR or\na BDR would see that.\n\n861\n00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.956\nSo if I did this, hold on a second.\n\n862\n00:42:24.117 --> 00:42:29.980\nShow IP, is it show IP OSPF interface F00.\n\n863\n00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.850\nThat's what I want to see.\n\n864\n00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.680\nSo check this one out.\n\n865\n00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.420\nThis is where you're gonna\ndo your trouble shooting.\n\n866\n00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.977\nSo, first I'm gonna check my IP address so\nI'm not working to a neighbor.\n\n867\n00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:42.870\nI need to find out why.\n\n868\n00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.060\nSo, I go to my interface and\ncompare it to theirs.\n\n869\n00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.940\nOkay.\nSo, the first thing that\n\n870\n00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.180\nI'm gonna do is check my IP address.\n\n871\n00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.560\nMake sure we're in the same subnet.\n\n872\n00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.830\nThe next thing is we're in the same area.\n\n873\n00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.190\nAll right.\n\n874\n00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.169\nNow, I'm also gonna check my hello and\ndead timers.\n\n875\n00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.500\nThese have to match.\n\n876\n00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.640\nNow, we went through\nthis in the OSPF episode,\n\n877\n00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.000\nbut I'm just telling you again, okay.\n\n878\n00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.730\nSo, here's the DR, so\n\n879\n00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.680\nthis tells me the DR which is me\nbecause there was no other router.\n\n880\n00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.060\nNow, that's not important.\n\n881\n00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.250\nThe DR and DDR is not really\na troubleshooting spot cuz it's not gonna\n\n882\n00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.250\nmake your network not converge.\n\n883\n00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.170\nIt's not gonna make your network not\ncreate an adjacency with your neighbor.\n\n884\n00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.030\nOkay so we are on a hello and dead.\n\n885\n00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.600\nNotice my cost is one.\n\n886\n00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.420\nOn a fast ethernet, a 100 mg or\nhigher based on our bandwidth reference,\n\n887\n00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.250\nit's always going to be a one, right?\n\n888\n00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.000\nOkay.\n\n889\n00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.230\nNow in this case here, area, so\nwe can see what area we are in.\n\n890\n00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.790\nSo, we want to check our RIDs.\n\n891\n00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.750\nSo what you're going to do.\n\n892\n00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.730\nStep one.\n\n893\n00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.380\nSubnet.\nI haven't really seen\n\n894\n00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.480\nthat as a problem but\nwe're gonna check the area.\n\n895\n00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.780\nMake sure that you have the same IP\naddresses, then check your area.\n\n896\n00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.060\nThese are your two directly\nconnected neighbors with OSPF.\n\n897\n00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.940\nThen you're gonna check your hello and\ndead timers.\n\n898\n00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:58.300\nAnd then your cost is important but\nthat's not real big troubleshooting.\n\n899\n00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.300\nSo let's do this.\n\n900\n00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:06.020\nLet's do a show run, I think, show run and\nI think I can do include OSPF.\n\n901\n00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.240\nIt didn't like that.\n\n902\n00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.225\nShow run OSPF.\n\n903\n00:44:09.225 --> 00:44:10.500\nDidnt' like that.\n\n904\n00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.050\nShow run, I forget which one it is.\n\n905\n00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.350\nAll right, let's go down here.\n\n906\n00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.670\nHere's where we're gonna do\nour trouble shooting here.\n\n907\n00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.970\nSo here's my OSPF,\nI really don't have anything under here.\n\n908\n00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:23.990\nNow what I'm going to look for\n\n909\n00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.650\nin my neighbors,\nnow I'm going to check my RID here though.\n\n910\n00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.320\nBut remember,\nthat also showed up in show IP OSPF,\n\n911\n00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.630\nshow IP OSPF Interface, we can find our\nRID in multiple different locations.\n\n912\n00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.590\nBut what you're really going to look for\nis your interface, so\n\n913\n00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.740\nif I came up here and found.\n\n914\n00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.290\nLet me come up here.\n\n915\n00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.570\nI was on FastEthernet0/0.\n\n916\n00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.190\nHere's my IP address.\n\n917\n00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.850\nHere's my configuration.\n\n918\n00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.450\nMy process ID has to match\nthe process ID at global config.\n\n919\n00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.960\nBig deal, but\nthis is gonna tell me my area.\n\n920\n00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.470\nAnd so I'm gonna look at this and\nthen I'm gonna be able to check my rid.\n\n921\n00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.200\nBut the other thing I would see on here\nwhen we went to the other process is\n\n922\n00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.990\nif I had a different hello or\ndead timer, that would show right here.\n\n923\n00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.810\nOkay, so by looking at my interface,\nchecking my subnet,\n\n924\n00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.500\nchecking my area,\nchecking my hello and dead timers.\n\n925\n00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.120\nAnd then if I had authentication, that's\ngonna show into the router process ID.\n\n926\n00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.610\nAll right, so that's gonna wrap us up for,\nwe did rip, rip and\n\n927\n00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.850\nripng, OSPFe2 and OSPFv3.\n\n928\n00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.320\nAnd we're not done though\nbecause I'm gonna come back and\n\n929\n00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.240\ndo some distribute lists for those.\n\n930\n00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.662\nBut we're gonna do EIGRP distribute lists.\n\n931\n00:45:28.662 --> 00:45:32.340\nWe're gonna do spanning,\nservice level agreements and so on.\n\n932\n00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.570\n>> All right, well that's gonna wrap\nit up for us in trouble shooting.\n\n933\n00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:39.170\nRemember that what we saw here in\nthis episode is the basics on what we\n\n934\n00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.830\nhave to do.\n\n935\n00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.860\nTodd brought us through the configuration.\n\n936\n00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.230\nFrom no routing protocols at all and\nimplementing them and\n\n937\n00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.740\nthen showing us those trouble shooting\nspots in all those protocols.\n\n938\n00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:54.470\nWhether we talked about about rip,\nor ripng, or OSPF for\n\n939\n00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.640\nIP version 4, and of course IP version 6.\n\n940\n00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.570\nShowing us each one of those as\nwe've configured them and seen them,\n\n941\n00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.880\nnot only in the routing table, but\nalso the show IP protocols as well.\n\n942\n00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.260\nMake sure you do understand\nthat as you go into that exam,\n\n943\n00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.140\nyou don't have time to sit there and\njust figure it out.\n\n944\n00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.900\nYou need to be able to look at\nwhat you're given, and be able to\n\n945\n00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.030\ndetermine from the information that you're\nseeing there, of what may be wrong.\n\n946\n00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.580\nSo these are all great spots for\nus to make sure that we focus in on.\n\n947\n00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.660\nPractice this lab to make\nsure you also go on and\n\n948\n00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.290\ncheck out Todd's book on this section as\nwell, as he actually probably has even\n\n949\n00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:32.490\nmore information there, to help you to\npinpoint exactly what you need to do.\n\n950\n00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.600\nAll right, well that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off, then.\n\n951\n00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.470\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie

He also goes into details about neighbor adjacencies not forming and shows how to compare the configurations for the matching values we must see. He also assigns an access-list to a routing protocol and well as demonstrates access-list application. He turns his attention to switches and demonstrates using SPAN and SLA testing to round out the list of tools that we can use to help troubleshooting routing and switching on cisco devices.",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're tackling ICND2 content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.660\nGetting ready for that CCNA Routing and\nSwitching exam that Cisco's just released.\n\n6\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.120\nAnd here to help us make sure that we\nare focused in on those objectives\n\n7\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.400\nis gonna be Mr Todd Lammie.\n\n8\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.430\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.220\n>> All righty,\n\n10\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.790\nlet's dive right back in where we\nleft off in Troubleshooting Part 1.\n\n11\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.670\nWe had done RIPng,\nwe did a default route, and\n\n12\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.491\nwe advertised that out with\na default information originate.\n\n13\n00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:50.870\nWe did RIPng, RIP version 2 and RIPng,\nOSPF version 2 and OSPF version 3.\n\n14\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.220\nNow I didn't go through and\n\n15\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.260\nshow you the problems like I did in\nthe OSPF section and solve them.\n\n16\n00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.230\nBut we went through them on what\nyou're supposed to look for.\n\n17\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.480\nSo what I'm doing in these troubleshooting\nsections is we're building\n\n18\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.910\nthe configurations, telling you where\nall your troubleshooting spots are.\n\n19\n00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.800\nSo remember in OSPF we're looking for\nour directly connected neighbor.\n\n20\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.100\nSo in RIP it was all just, and\nEIGRP which we're about to get into,\n\n21\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.280\nit's just all about me, I'm not even\nworried about my neighbor connections.\n\n22\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.260\nBut in OSPF I am,\nespecially if I have a non-Cisco router.\n\n23\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.920\nI have to worry about am I in the right\nsubnet of my directly connected neighbors.\n\n24\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.820\nAm I in the right area?\n\n25\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.310\nDo we have duplicate rids?\n\n26\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.570\nDo I not have the interfaces\nconfigured correctly?\n\n27\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.880\nAre different.\n\n28\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.525\nAnd so those are the things we're\ngoing to pay attention to on there.\n\n29\n00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:39.180\n[LAUGH] All right, David.\n\n30\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.558\nOne of the guys out there\nreally tests David on it.\n\n31\n00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.370\nAnd we're gonna test David with some ERG,\n\n32\n00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.720\nbut I do wanna show you one thing,\nlet's go dive back into our configuration.\n\n33\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.310\nLet's start with the corp\nwhat we left off with OSPF.\n\n34\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.178\nSo we were doing show IPv6 route.\n\n35\n00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:59.200\nOkay, so I've got,\nI do got a rip in there.\n\n36\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.180\nWe're gonna have to trouble\nshoot that in there.\n\n37\n00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.100\nI don't think I have\nsomething configured correct.\n\n38\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.220\nLet's go ahead and troubleshoot.\n\n39\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.010\nThat's what this section is all about.\n\n40\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.360\nHopefully I can fix it.\n\n41\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.950\n[LAUGH] So this is subnet 5.\n\n42\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.750\nWe can see that, and\nwe can see that the fe80 will have to go,\n\n43\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.210\nthis is off of serial0/2/0 and 1/0.\n\n44\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.210\nThis is coming from my LA router so\nI have subnet.\n\n45\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470\nSo let's go look at my drawing here and\nsee where Subnet 5 is.\n\n46\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.640\nNetwork drawing with IPv6 is helpful,\nso I've got 4, 3, up here, 5 is up here.\n\n47\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.450\nThat was coming across on RIP.\n\n48\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.379\nThat didn't come across on OSPF,\nwas that what it was?\n\n49\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.880\nI don't know if I put\nan OSPF statement on there.\n\n50\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.130\nSo what we're saying is this subnet\nis being advertised down here\n\n51\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.990\nas RIP NG, right?\n\n52\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.070\nLet's go see if it's being advertised\nin IP version 4 under RIP, or OSPF.\n\n53\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.720\nSo we can see subnet 5 right there, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.170\nSo show IP route.\n\n55\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.660\nIt's going to give me my IP4 table.\n\n56\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.990\nAnd I don't see any RIPs there so\nthere's 30, it is network 30.\n\n57\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.842\nIt is coming across across\na couple different links here so\n\n58\n00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:17.960\nwe should have a slash-32 serial 000\nshouldn't be showing that to me.\n\n59\n00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.920\nDid I wonder if I figure that twice wrong.\n\n60\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.945\nOkay, I might have added some stuff so\n\n61\n00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:28.170\nlet's go check our loopbackss cuz this\ndoesn't look right to me, all right?\n\n62\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.470\nSo we've got our 63s down here.\n\n63\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.700\nSo let's run up here and\ndo a show IP int brief.\n\n64\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.130\nOkay, I've got a 192 and\n6830 on the loop back.\n\n65\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.230\nI've got my 10s.\n\n66\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.620\nThose all look right.\n\n67\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.901\nDo a show IP B6 int brief.\n\n68\n00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:49.360\nAnd so I can see that serial\n\n69\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.440\n0/1/0 is my link local.\n\n70\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.380\n720 subnet 8 and my fast ethernet is 3.\n\n71\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.540\nThat's why it's showing up twice here.\n\n72\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.700\nAnd then, I don't think,\nI put that underneath here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.620\nSO that shouldn't have been 3,\nI don't know what I assigned my loop back.\n\n74\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.140\nI assigned it as 5, that's right,\nso 3 and 5, so I've got 7, 8,5.\n\n75\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.490\nAnd then 3 on my FastEthernet.\n\n76\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.590\nOkay, those look okay.\n\n77\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.010\nLet's go and check this one, though, cuz\nI think I put a dupe in here somewhere.\n\n78\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.970\nShow ipv6 route, interface brief.\n\n79\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.610\nOkay, I've got subnet 2, 4 and\n6, and 7 and 8 over there.\n\n80\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.535\nSo I got 6 and 4,\nthose look right, Show IP route.\n\n81\n00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:42.690\nOops, not show IP route,\nshow IP int brief.\n\n82\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.980\nOkay, I got 10, 10, so\nI got a 30 over here.\n\n83\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.560\nSo I got 30 twice.\n\n84\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.870\nThat's kind of the problem I would think,\nguys.\n\n85\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.210\nSo looking at my drawing here,\nthis guy is supposed to be 40.\n\n86\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.830\nMy bad.\n\n87\n00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.838\nWhen we were over here configuring,\nI was kind of making them up as we went.\n\n88\n00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:58.010\nIP address 192.168.40.1.\n\n89\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.440\nOkay, I think that might help.\n\n90\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.430\nNo shot.\n\n91\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.970\nOkay and I guess I have that under router,\nwe're using router rip,\n\n92\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.125\nand network 1I2,\nlet me make sure it's under there.\n\n93\n00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:18.714\n40.0.\n\n94\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.990\nOkay, so that still didn't tell me why.\n\n95\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.830\nLet's do show IP V6 inst brief and\n\n96\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.230\nlet's see if I have something\nunderneath the loop back.\n\n97\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.060\nYou have subnet 4, subnet 6 and subnet 2.\n\n98\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.420\nOkay, that didn't tell me why I\nwas seeing subnet 5 over here.\n\n99\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.460\nOkay show, okay here it is.\n\n100\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.640\nSo we've got subnet 378 and\n5 under the loop back.\n\n101\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.560\nYou know what?\n\n102\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.180\nI might not have assigned it though.\n\n103\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.030\nSo show run interface loop back 0.\n\n104\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.540\nOkay, no, ipospf 1 area 0,\nipospf 1 area 0.\n\n105\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.100\nSo it's both ipv4 and ipv6.\n\n106\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.960\nAnd there is my IPv6 address.\n\n107\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.680\nNotice I used the eui-64 on here,\nit will just use your Mac address, right?\n\n108\n00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.550\nAnd then we got rip 1,\n\n109\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.230\nI'm telling you that looks,\nthat loop equals configured correct to me.\n\n110\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.490\nSubnet 30, didn't help that I\nhad another 30 over there but\n\n111\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.330\nthat was an IPv4 problem and\nwe're seeing an IPv6 problem.\n\n112\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.395\nArea 0, area 0, IPv6 and 4.\nI don't know, looks okay to me,\n\n113\n00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:29.760\nhope we can solve this problem.\n\n114\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.540\nShow IP route.\n\n115\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.070\nAll right, so this looks fine here,\nI've got network 30 now showing up,\n\n116\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.640\nonly twice now with IP version 4, cuz last\ntime we were seeing it three times being\n\n117\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.070\nadvertised twice, so\nI was like something's not right here.\n\n118\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.420\nAnd here's network 40 being subnetted,\ncoming across from 10.2.\n\n119\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.050\nNow that's the San Francisco router.\n\n120\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo show IPV 6 route, now hope it\ndoesn't show me a rip route anymore.\n\n121\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.350\nIt still does for network 5.\n\n122\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.310\nSo 122.\nIt's coming across 1 and 2.\n\n123\n00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.120\nI'm not getting that\nadvertised from over there.\n\n124\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.120\n>> And it's also showing\nit to you on OSPF I think.\n\n125\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.060\n>> Yeah, I think it shows it to me twice,\nbut it shouldn't.\n\n126\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.340\nI'm not seeing the 40.\n\n127\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.170\nLet me see what subnet\nis that guy over there.\n\n128\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.732\nThis is subnet 4, so\nlet's see where subnet 4 is.\n\n129\n00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:22.476\n>> Yep.\n\n130\n00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:26.250\n>> And see, do you see a subnet 3, 6, 4r?\n\n131\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:33.950\nIt's coming across here, just so you know\nbut not coming across here rip as well.\n\n132\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.965\nSo he show up as rip and OSPF.\n\n133\n00:07:37.592 --> 00:07:41.940\nWe are 5 so I'm seeing 6 twice\ncoming across from there that's.\n\n134\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.916\nThat's fine, 7.\n\n135\n00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:46.865\nAll right, let's leave that for\na minute and come back to that.\n\n136\n00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:51.806\nLet's go back over here and turn on now,\nthat we fixed our IP version 4,\n\n137\n00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:53.111\nthat's helpful.\n\n138\n00:07:53.111 --> 00:08:00.280\n[LAUGH] Let's turn on, router EIGRP And\n\n139\n00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.079\nnotice I'm just using one for everything.\n\n140\n00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:05.763\nIt keeps it really easy for me.\n\n141\n00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:07.310\nI've got a lot of stuff going on, right?\n\n142\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.310\nI want to make sure\nthat this is right now.\n\n143\n00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.600\nI can put my network\nstatements underneath here.\n\n144\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.370\nThat's fine.\n\n145\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.560\nWe can do that and for IP version six\nwe'll put those under the interfaces.\n\n146\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.650\nSo, I'm gonna do do show ip int brief.\n\n147\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.305\nAnd there's my interface and so\nI just type tarping them in.\n\n148\n00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:28.830\n10.0.0.0.\nNow remember,\n\n149\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.240\nI can type this in\na couple different ways.\n\n150\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.070\nNotice I'm typing in the subnet now,\nso I'm gonna go 0.0.0.255, right?\n\n151\n00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.550\nSo that covers all three\nof these subnets here.\n\n152\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.390\nNow, I'm not saying you need to do this.\n\n153\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.140\nBut you will see this on\nthe objectives where you will see\n\n154\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.260\nreverse mass with the eigrp.\n\n155\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.540\nI just don't see the purpose\nof that in production.\n\n156\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.570\nIt just causes some complexity.\n\n157\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.120\nSo I've covered network 10 and\nI've covered all of 172.16 on here.\n\n158\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.090\nAll right?\n\n159\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.180\nThere's really nothing else I have to run.\n\n160\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.150\nHowever, do I have to do\nthe know auto summary command?\n\n161\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.190\n>> Depends on the version.\n\n162\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.890\n>> How can we find out the version?\n\n163\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.350\n>> You can just do a show run.\n\n164\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.520\n>> Okay let's do a do show run.\n\n165\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.730\nWow it says I'm running 12-4.\n\n166\n00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.480\n>> That means yes you will [LAUGH].\n\n167\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.930\n>> So\nI'm gonna have to do a no-auto summary.\n\n168\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.120\nVery good point,\nvery good test objective right there.\n\n169\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.555\nDo show run tells me at the very top.\n\n170\n00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:23.070\nDo show version shows\nflash Write either one.\n\n171\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.630\nBut in this case here I'm\ngonna do a no-auto summary.\n\n172\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.010\nIf I'm running 15X then I don't\nhave to do a no-auto summary.\n\n173\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.540\nEIGRPs are pretty simple, Ronnie.\n\n174\n00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.650\nThey're not a lot of stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.570\nBut, I like to cause problems.\n\n176\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.920\nI like to do what the test will do.\n\n177\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.363\nTest is gonna do this, right?\n\n178\n00:09:41.363 --> 00:09:48.040\nSo now we're gonna say on here\nno passive-interface S000.\n\n179\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.400\n010 and 020, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.300\nSo turn them all off,\nturn on the ones that you want.\n\n181\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.706\nHey don't shoot the messenger here right?\n\n182\n00:09:58.706 --> 00:10:01.952\n>> [LAUGHTER]\n>> All right, now while we're here,\n\n183\n00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:04.864\nwhy don't I configure IP version 6.\n\n184\n00:10:04.864 --> 00:10:06.199\n>> Yes.\n\n185\n00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:07.890\n>> So how do I do that?\n\n186\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.090\nFor EIGRP?\n\n187\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.870\nSo I'm picking on him David.\n\n188\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.870\nYes it is time for him to do those shots.\n\n189\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.566\nDave send us over a bottle.\n\n190\n00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:18.070\nAll right, tequila, rum a bit of tequila,\na bit of rum, I'm not a big tequila guy.\n\n191\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.472\nI was at a bad time in Mexico one time.\n\n192\n00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:21.282\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:25.830\n>> That sticks with you for decades,\nwhen you have one of those bad times.\n\n194\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.233\n>> ipv6 router?\n\n195\n00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:32.231\nIpv6 router eigrp, and we'll use\nthis same number, doesn't matter,\n\n196\n00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:35.030\nbut I'm going to do it, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.590\nSo, anything else to put under here?\n\n198\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.300\nThere is.\n\n199\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.502\nI'm not gonna do it cuz since he didn't\nknow it, I\"m just gonna leave it,\n\n200\n00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:43.230\nall right?\n\n201\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.668\nSo now we gotta go to our interfaces.\n\n202\n00:10:44.668 --> 00:10:48.652\nAnd IPV6,\n\n203\n00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:54.160\nEIGRP, EIGRP1, I think that's it right?\n\n204\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.140\nThat it, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.850\nInterface s0/1/0 and interface s0 /2/0 and\n\n206\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.580\nI still want to send it out f0/0 right,\nbecause I need\n\n207\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.940\nto advertise that network even if I'm\nnot sending anything out there so\n\n208\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:17.410\nnow I've got all eigrp6, ibv6,eigrpv6\nsending out all my interfaces.\n\n209\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.660\nIt is Passive for\nIP version 4, under f0/0.\n\n210\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.060\nI don't use passive interface with IP\nversion 6 because I just don't configure\n\n211\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.400\nthat interface if I want it passive.\n\n212\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.710\nI'm pretty much done here.\n\n213\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.570\nI've done IP version 4 for\nEIGRP and EIGRPv6.\n\n214\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.160\nPretty straightforward.\n\n215\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.410\nIt's not gonna work though,\n\n216\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.650\nbecause Ronnie forgot to do\nsomething under global config.\n\n217\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.305\nI'm gonna come back and\nfind out what that is.\n\n218\n00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:45.060\nAll right, so let's come up here.\n\n219\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.130\nShow, not show, config t,\n\n220\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.040\nrouter eigrp 1, all right,\nand our network numbers do\n\n221\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.380\nshow ip Int br and\nIP version 4 so, so boring.\n\n222\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.960\nIP version 6 is so much more fun.\n\n223\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.329\nNetwork 192.168.10.0 and\n\n224\n00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:15.860\nnetwork 172.16.0.0, I can do that.\n\n225\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.560\nAnd then, I can even do this,\nif I wanted to.\n\n226\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.850\n>> You misspelled network.\n\n227\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.500\n>> I did.\n\n228\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.490\nI do that a lot.\n\n229\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.260\nOkay, so I use the inverse mask.\n\n230\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.220\nDoes it matter?\n\n231\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.270\nNot in the least.\n\n232\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.830\nWhat do you think?\n\n233\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.770\nDo I need a new auto?\n\n234\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.190\nJust cuz it shows that adjacent comes up,\ndoesn't mean it's actually working.\n\n235\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.200\nSo What do you think?\n\n236\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.370\nWhat do we need to do?\n\n237\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.410\n>> Need to find out the version.\n\n238\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.810\n>> I'm gonna do a, show run.\n\n239\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.190\nI can do do show version.\n\n240\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.800\nAnd in this case here it\nsays I'm running 15.1.\n\n241\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.010\n>> So, no.\n>> So, I don't need a no auto.\n\n242\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.780\nOkay.\n\n243\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:53.150\nNow, I think our IP4, it came up and\ndo show ip eigrp nei.\n\n244\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.970\nAnd I, oops, how'd that happen?\n\n245\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.160\nHey, come back here.\n\n246\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.880\nOkay, that's my first one listed.\n\n247\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.890\nThis is my neighbor's address,\nthe interface, the hold time,\n\n248\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.160\nmy smooth round trip time,\nfive milliseconds.\n\n249\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.660\nPretty fast.\n\n250\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.740\nTime outs.\n\n251\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.800\nIn sequence numbers.\n\n252\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.770\nSo we're looking good.\n\n253\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.150\nWhat you really want to look for\nis these q counts.\n\n254\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.720\nNow, you really don't have a q count issue\nbecause what that says is I'm sending out\n\n255\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.630\na hello every five seconds,\nI expect an acknowledgment.\n\n256\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.790\nDon't ignore me, don't diss me.\n\n257\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.760\nAnd if so that's gonna.\n\n258\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.490\nNow when I have bad serial\nlinks I see that increment.\n\n259\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.020\nI don't really see those on LAN links.\n\n260\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.230\nThat would indicate some kind of\nissue with your LAN interface.\n\n261\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.860\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.370\nNow, in this case here we're looking good.\n\n263\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:46.245\nBut, what about if I do show IPV6?\n\n264\n00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:47.090\neigrp neighbour.\nDO show IPV6.\n\n265\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.770\neigrp neighbor.\n\n266\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.490\nNothing.\n\n267\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.580\nSo let's fix that Ronnie.\n\n268\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.452\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n269\n00:13:54.452 --> 00:13:57.638\nipv6 router eigrp 1, okay?\n\n270\n00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:59.186\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n271\n00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:04.370\n>> Okay, and then we're gonna go to our\ninterfaces, we kind of know what they are.\n\n272\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.778\nInterface, we've got three of them here.\n\n273\n00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:11.390\nInterface f0.0 IPV 6\n\n274\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:18.310\nEIGRP1 interface loop back 0 and\ninterface s0/0.\n\n275\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.550\nAnd let's find out if this works.\n\n276\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.080\nMaybe it will, I don't know.\n\n277\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.490\nWe didn't see an adjacent pop up.\n\n278\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.800\n>> Not yet.\n>> Have to do a no auto?\n\n279\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.945\nNo?\nForgot to do the no auto.\n\n280\n00:14:28.945 --> 00:14:31.089\n[CROSSTALK] Type it in,\nsee if it takes it.\n\n281\n00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:32.640\nNope, not from there it doesn't.\n\n282\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.330\nGlobal config.\n\n283\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.110\nActually it did,\nI think it puts it in there.\n\n284\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.280\nBut nonetheless, let's do this.\n\n285\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.240\nLet's come back here.\n\n286\n00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.360\nSo we did a show ip eigrp neighbor,\nthat's looking good.\n\n287\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.130\nI'm just gonna up arrow and\nchange this to V6.\n\n288\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.089\nWhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n289\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.410\nWe're missing something.\n\n290\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.920\nNow, this is unique for EIGRPV 6.\n\n291\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.760\nOkay?\n\n292\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.960\nSo underneath.\n\n293\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.930\n>> Remember.\n\n294\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.080\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n295\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.030\nWhoops, I just went to IP version 4.\n\n296\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.794\nIpv 6, eigrp 1.\n\n297\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.640\nIpv6 router eigrp 1.\n\n298\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.070\nWe're getting a little confused here.\n\n299\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.128\nThe command is no shut.\n\n300\n00:15:19.128 --> 00:15:19.958\n>> That's right.\n\n301\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> No shut all right?\n\n302\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.770\nSo, yeah, I know.\n\n303\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.880\nSo, I think I left it here.\n\n304\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.580\nNo I didn't, config t.\n\n305\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:33.830\n>> Now you got to do it on the other side\n>> Yup, ipv6 router eigrp 1.\n\n306\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.410\nNo shut.\n\n307\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.130\nAnd, badabinga badaboom.\n\n308\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.432\nThere we go.\n\n309\n00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:42.200\nAnd there's my neighbor.\n\n310\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.260\nYou can't see it from down there.\n\n311\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.200\nMy FE80, right?\n\n312\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.258\nRemember, I'm talking with my link locals.\n\n313\n00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:55.160\nAll right, so\nI do show ipv6 eigrp neighbor.\n\n314\n00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:57.817\nAll right?\nThere's my link local and\n\n315\n00:15:57.817 --> 00:15:59.122\nI'm just gonna up arrow.\n\n316\n00:15:59.122 --> 00:16:00.573\nBecause we're running both.\n\n317\n00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:02.776\nThis is so cool that I'm running both.\n\n318\n00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:06.850\nGuys Do it, put IPv6 one.\n\n319\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.461\nIt's fun.\n\n320\n00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:14.240\nThere's my IPv4 information my neighbor,\nand there's my IPv6 to San Francisco.\n\n321\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.020\nWe are looking good guys.\n\n322\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.320\nLet's do our other interfaces\nreally quick, knock this out.\n\n323\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.590\nDid I do all my interfaces on here?\n\n324\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.020\nI think I did.\nYes, I did.\n\n325\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.680\nSo easy to do IPV6.\n\n326\n00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.220\nSo, I think you're still, yeah, LA.\n\n327\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.400\n>> I was stuck.\n\n328\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.180\nIt was congested.\n\n329\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.140\nIt must be rush hour out there [LAUGH].\n\n330\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.190\nConfig T we'll do.\n\n331\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.674\nGosh, we'll just do IP version 4.\n\n332\n00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:50.002\nHow worrying router eigrp 1 network\nI gotta do my Do int show ip brief.\n\n333\n00:16:50.002 --> 00:16:53.690\nThere's my interfaces, so\n\n334\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.885\nI'm going to remember FastEthernet 0/0 and\nmy two serials and I have my loopback.\n\n335\n00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:07.160\nSoIi'm going to say network 192.168.20.1,\nmy gosh can I do that?\n\n336\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.950\nI can cuz I can do this.\n\n337\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.300\nI'm not saying to do this,\njust as you see this alright?\n\n338\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.180\nThat could be a troubleshooting spot.\n\n339\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.540\nNow hold on so if you see something\nlike that with a quad zeros and\n\n340\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.480\nsomeone put a zero here.\n\n341\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.210\nYou see the difference here?\n\n342\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.660\nWhoops, there it is up here.\n\n343\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.400\nYou see the difference,\nif I was to type this last line in,\n\n344\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.100\nI'm saying that 0 must be a 0 here.\n\n345\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.660\nDon't do that, right,\nyou're not gonna ever have a host that's,\n\n346\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.940\nin this example 20.0's\na network statement, right.\n\n347\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.720\nSo that's gonna have to\nbe the actual address.\n\n348\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.550\nSo I'm not even gonna type this in,\nso okay.\n\n349\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.050\nNow I also need the 172.16.\n\n350\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.740\nSo I'm going to say network 172.16.0.0,\nI can do the inverse mass, but\n\n351\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.850\nI don't want to.\n\n352\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.790\nI don't need to do the no auto,\nso I do a do show run.\n\n353\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.497\nI can see I'm running 15.1,\n\n354\n00:17:59.497 --> 00:18:03.374\nand passive Interface

00:18:16.890\nThat's it.\n\n362\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.240\nThat's just those, just my two.\n\n363\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.550\nAll right, so, show IP brief.\n\n364\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.390\nOkay, so I got those down.\n\n365\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.800\nShow IP EIGRP neighbor, and\n\n366\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.530\nthere's my neighbors coming off both my\ninterfaces, serial 010 and serial 20.\n\n367\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:40.290\nSo both of those are good, show IPE.\n\n368\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.390\nEIGRP.\n\n369\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.890\nI think I can do interfaces.\n\n370\n00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.010\nThis is gonna tell me where's\nmy fast ethernet zero zero.\n\n371\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.070\nWell, show IP proto.\n\n372\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.990\nGuys a passive.\n\n373\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.000\nRight?\nIt's a passive.\n\n374\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.780\nSo he's a nothing.\n\n375\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.120\nSo there's my OSPF version four,\nand there's my EIGRP.\n\n376\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.740\nNonetheless, down here he's,\nI was looking at the wrong one, but\n\n377\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.390\nnonetheless he was\npassive on all of these.\n\n378\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.870\nSo when you do shut off your protocols,\nand\n\n379\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.050\nyou're running all these protocols,\nyou gotta make sure you get down to them.\n\n380\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.450\nNow, don't do this in production,\ndo this for fun, at home on your networks.\n\n381\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.690\nOkay?\nSo here's my EIGRP.\n\n382\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.530\nWe're going to get to these lists here\nin a second, these distribute lists.\n\n383\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.920\nNotice, so\nhere's my troubleshooting spot, guys.\n\n384\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.730\nMy K values must match.\n\n385\n00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.860\nMy autonomous system\nnumber must match ERGRP1.\n\n386\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.770\nNot a lot here guys, not like OSPF where\nyou got your hello and dead timers.\n\n387\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.810\nYou've got your area, your IP,\nyour key chains and stuff.\n\n388\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.000\nBut, on here too we can have that, but\n\n389\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.850\nhere we have they K values must match,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.550\nSo now, that being said I'm routing for\nthese networks.\n\n391\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.290\nI'm gonna check down here and make sure.\n\n392\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.780\nNotice I have a 32bit address here.\n\n393\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.930\nI type that in with the 0.0.0.0.\n\n394\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.770\nNot saying to do that, but\njust keep an eye out for that.\n\n395\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.020\nAnd so notice you're routing for\nall your networks.\n\n396\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.740\nIf not, then you've got to\ntype in a network statement.\n\n397\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.640\nCheck your passive interfaces.\n\n398\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.780\nAgain, we're gonna come right back\nup to that distribute list here.\n\n399\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.830\nAll right, so show IP route.\n\n400\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.210\nNow a couple things that we're gonna see.\n\n401\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.450\nRemember when I did that default\ninformation originate, right?\n\n402\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:18.900\nNoticed this O under OSPF because one\nof the things that I didn't show you\n\n403\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.770\nis if I do this Show run OSPF.\n\n404\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.540\nI think, gosh darn it.\n\n405\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.850\nShow run router OSPF1.\n\n406\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.890\nI'm trying, I'm going to make that work.\n\n407\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.427\nI'm telling you.\n\n408\n00:20:33.427 --> 00:20:34.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think you need.\n\n409\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.680\n>> I just can't remember what it is.\n\n410\n00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.260\n>> I think you need the pipe in there.\n\n411\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.278\n>> Maybe.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:41.190\n>> That pipe, [INAUDIBLE] from Colorado.\n\n413\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.050\nYeah, you're from Colorado, that's right.\n\n414\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.104\n>> From Colorado,\npie does have a different meaning there.\n\n415\n00:20:46.104 --> 00:20:49.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, notice under router ospf 1,\n\n416\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.710\ndefault information originate.\n\n417\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.785\nSo I put that under there\nbecause I have that here, and\n\n418\n00:20:54.785 --> 00:21:00.435\nthen we saw those that default\nroute that I have is the wrong one.\n\n419\n00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:03.585\nSo what I wanted to show you was,\nhey, I came up here and had it?\n\n420\n00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:05.765\nI'm like, where did that default route?\n\n421\n00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.045\nIt said it was a external type two.\n\n422\n00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:11.665\nWhich told me that someone had\nadvertise that route to me.\n\n423\n00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:14.195\nBig trouble shooting spot for\nyour routing here guys.\n\n424\n00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:16.560\nSo you gotta default\ninformation originate.\n\n425\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.570\nAnd your default route is\nprobably down here somewhere\n\n426\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.330\nbut we'd have to check to make sure\nit goes to the right place, so\n\n427\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.720\nlook at this, so\nwe saw that with rip so watch this.\n\n428\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.860\nI can't do a show up with rip and\nsee it anymore because this has\n\n429\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.282\na lower administrative distance and\nnotice that everything's d with dual here.\n\n430\n00:21:37.282 --> 00:21:42.020\nThis external, and\nI can get there through default route out.\n\n431\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.580\nYou have got to go back and make sure\nthat's heading in the right direction.\n\n432\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.110\nSo look for this, hold on,\nwhat I'm going to do here.\n\n433\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.462\nSo I'm going to come under here, and\nwe have to turn on IPv6 still over there.\n\n434\n00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.040\nFault information originate.\n\n435\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.220\nOkay, now let's go up here.\n\n436\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.846\nI don't know how fast and\nlong this is gonna take.\n\n437\n00:22:13.803 --> 00:22:15.800\nStill see the 0 in there.\n\n438\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.140\nBut, I should be able to see it It\nshould show up here, either way.\n\n439\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.420\nThe bigger thing is that default\ninformation originate works with RIP and\n\n440\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.640\nOSPF, I think I have to do a different\n\n441\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.740\none with the IGRP which I don't\ntypically do because I don't need to.\n\n442\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.230\nBut none the less, look for\nthese inserted default routes in here,\n\n443\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.220\nthis is our troubleshooting spot.\n\n444\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.630\nIt's inserting it, and\nit's telling you to go the wrong way.\n\n445\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.650\nThat's what we're gonna look for.\n\n446\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.403\nSo lets take a look now,\nI've got to do this IPV6 on here first.\n\n447\n00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:51.049\nConfig T, router IPV6,\n\n448\n00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:56.940\nrouter EIGRP1 okay.\n\n449\n00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.070\nNo shut, right.\n\n450\n00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.690\nThat's a big point.\n\n451\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is shut down by default.\n\n452\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.020\nAll right,\nI don't have to do much else under here.\n\n453\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.990\nThen I go to interface,\nall my interfaces, ipv6 eigrp 1.\n\n454\n00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:16.960\nint s0/1/0 [INAUDIBLE] Interface s020.\n\n455\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.550\nThose are popping up now.\n\n456\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.800\nAnd interface loopback, 0, okay?\n\n457\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:31.140\nSo if I come down here, I should be\nable to see all this, show IP route.\n\n458\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.320\nOkay, I'm seeing.\n\n459\n00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.170\nI should see everything with those.\n\n460\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:36.790\nWhere's 30.1?\n\n461\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.610\nDid I not put that's, wait a minute,\ndid I just set that up?\n\n462\n00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.380\nThat should show up.\n\n463\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.260\nThat's not loopback though.\n\n464\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.190\nSo, that should show up twice.\n\n465\n00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.368\n>> Right there, 'OSPF' Yep.\n\n466\n00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:54.050\nBecause OSPF is going to show it,\nand then show IPv6 route.\n\n467\n00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:03.377\nAnd then, so here's my networks for my\nloopbacks right, and then my d for dual.\n\n468\n00:24:03.377 --> 00:24:05.676\nRight, so my loop backs\nare gonna show up under OSPF,\n\n469\n00:24:05.676 --> 00:24:08.806\nbut if I turn it off then they won't,\nthey're just gonna be under dual.\n\n470\n00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:10.330\nNotice our link locals here.\n\n471\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:18.060\nShow, ipv6 eigrp neighbor.\n\n472\n00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:22.646\nOkay, so now we see my two neighbors and\n\n473\n00:24:22.646 --> 00:24:25.105\nthis was the order they\nwere putting them in, 012.\n\n474\n00:24:25.105 --> 00:24:27.420\nSerial 0/0/0 goes to San Francisco.\n\n475\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.647\nThis one here, 1/0 and 2/0,\nthey have the same link local address,\n\n476\n00:24:33.647 --> 00:24:37.401\nnotice, and\nthey're both going to my LA routers, okay?\n\n477\n00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:46.004\nAnd then show ipv6\ntopology eigrp6 topology.\n\n478\n00:24:46.004 --> 00:24:50.139\nI was thinking, I'm gonna get\nconfused with database with OSPF.\n\n479\n00:24:50.139 --> 00:24:54.820\nNow P on the left hand side is good.\n\n480\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.330\nP stands for passive.\n\n481\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.570\nAll right, that means I've found\nthe best path to that network, and\n\n482\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.640\nI'm not actively looking.\n\n483\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.140\nSo if it's A,\nI'm actively searching for a new route.\n\n484\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.020\nRight, so we can see that we\nhave two successors here.\n\n485\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.510\nRight, and\nnotice that this is my what, Ronnie?\n\n486\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.470\nWhat are these two numbers here?\n\n487\n00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.717\n>> The successor is, of course, the best\npossible one and then, those two numbers?\n\n488\n00:25:17.717 --> 00:25:18.573\n>> But, I have two successors, yeah.\n\n489\n00:25:18.573 --> 00:25:22.343\n>> Okay, one is the administrative,\nor not administrative.\n\n490\n00:25:22.343 --> 00:25:22.877\n>> Nope.\n\n491\n00:25:22.877 --> 00:25:23.541\n>> Advertised distance.\n\n492\n00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:24.784\n>> Yeah, advertised distance,\n\n493\n00:25:24.784 --> 00:25:27.750\nwell that's a lot of times why we\ncall it the reported distance, right?\n\n494\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.810\nBut advertised distance\nwas a real name and\n\n495\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.310\nthey just started calling it\nreported distance not too long ago.\n\n496\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.570\nSo we have the reported distance or\nadvertised distance.\n\n497\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.360\n>> And the feasible.\n\n498\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.320\n>> And then, this is my feasible distance,\n\n499\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.239\nwhich is the reported distance\nplus my cost to that neighbor.\n\n500\n00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:43.956\nSo the reported distance is\nsaying it costs me 128256,\n\n501\n00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:45.747\nI add my cost to them, right?\n\n502\n00:25:45.747 --> 00:25:47.959\nAnd then that comes up\nwith my feasible distance.\n\n503\n00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.790\nAll right, let's add an access list wahoo.\n\n504\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.890\nSo if I said show ip eigrp topology\ntable again, we have all P's here.\n\n505\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.116\nI got one of them that's down 10.5/32.\n\n506\n00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:07.796\nI don't even know what that is,\nI don't even have a 10.5.\n\n507\n00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:09.876\nMaybe that's why it's inaccessible.\n\n508\n00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:11.262\nSomeone break into my network?\n\n509\n00:26:11.262 --> 00:26:13.710\n>> I don't know.\n>> Someone put a 10.5 in there?\n\n510\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.226\nI don't remember putting a 110 and\n21610.5.\n\n511\n00:26:17.226 --> 00:26:18.187\nHm.\n\n512\n00:26:18.187 --> 00:26:20.003\n>> I do notice-\n>> Wait, maybe that's one of my serial.\n\n513\n00:26:20.003 --> 00:26:21.628\n17216.\n\n514\n00:26:21.628 --> 00:26:22.251\nMy link went down.\n\n515\n00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:23.587\nLook at that.\n\n516\n00:26:23.587 --> 00:26:24.770\n020.\n\n517\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.450\nYou know what?\n\n518\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.978\n>> Inaccessible.\n\n519\n00:26:26.978 --> 00:26:28.010\n>> Let's do this.\n\n520\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.980\nShow eigrp neighbors,\nshow ip edigrp neighbor table,\n\n521\n00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.290\nand let's take a look at this.\n\n522\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.480\nI don't have a queue count on that.\n\n523\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.972\nIt's showing it right there, 10.5 is\nthe other side of serial 010, right?\n\n524\n00:26:45.972 --> 00:26:46.952\n10.5, 10.6.\n\n525\n00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:48.680\nSaid it was inaccessible.\n\n526\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.390\nSmooth round trip time is pretty low.\n\n527\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.510\nIt's a little higher on 2/0.\n\n528\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.330\nBut, what I'm looking for\n\n529\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.970\nis my queue counts to tell if I've got\na serial issue, and I'm not seeing it.\n\n530\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.765\nShow ip route.\n\n531\n00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:04.440\nAnd you know the way to get\nrid of some of this stuff.\n\n532\n00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.260\nShow ip route eigrp.\n\n533\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.980\nLet's just cut to the chase.\n\n534\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.558\nTo get to 20.0,\nwhich is the LAN off of L.A.\n\n535\n00:27:12.558 --> 00:27:17.377\nand 10.0 will have a single link,\nno, these look find to me.\n\n536\n00:27:17.377 --> 00:27:21.586\nBecause I have two links over to\nthe 20.0 network when I, off of LA and\n\n537\n00:27:21.586 --> 00:27:23.070\none off of there.\n\n538\n00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.990\nAll right, well, let's fix this.\n\n539\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.620\nLet's create a problem.\n\n540\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.330\nI mean, these look fine to me, I don't\nknow why that showed that there but\n\n541\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.320\nit's not anymore.\n\n542\n00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.247\nI had definitely gone down at one point,\nright?\n\n543\n00:27:31.247 --> 00:27:34.795\nWell, welcome to serial links, right?\n\n544\n00:27:34.795 --> 00:27:38.030\n[LAUGH] It's like being at work, Ronnie.\n\n545\n00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.740\nAll right, so here's what I wanna do.\n\n546\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.150\nI wanna screw this up.\n\n547\n00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.540\nAll right.\n\n548\n00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.620\nConfig t.\n\n549\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.700\nAnd we're gonna say ip.\n\n550\n00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.746\nLet's create an ip list.\n\n551\n00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:48.480\nThen we're gonna create an ip list and\nthen we're gonna create an ipv6 list.\n\n552\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.898\nI'm not gonna go too in depth here\nguys cuz we're gonna run out of time.\n\n553\n00:27:51.898 --> 00:27:53.775\nI wanna create a couple of I lists.\n\n554\n00:27:53.775 --> 00:28:01.890\nSo I going to say ip access\nlist extended tests.\n\n555\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.640\nNow remember they are case sensitive.\n\n556\n00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.448\nNow watch what I do because I'm\njust getting to the point here but\n\n557\n00:28:06.448 --> 00:28:08.015\nI want you guys to watch these okay.\n\n558\n00:28:08.015 --> 00:28:12.548\nSo we're gonna say deny ip any any, right?\n\n559\n00:28:12.548 --> 00:28:14.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean that's gonna do it.\n\n560\n00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:20.680\nOr how about we do this, deny tcp any any.\n\n561\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.841\nSo we're basically dropping tcp,\nand then I'm gonna say permit,\n\n562\n00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:27.770\nthis way I can ping,\npermit ip any any, right?\n\n563\n00:28:30.258 --> 00:28:35.101\nOkay, so this is deny anything from the\nTC Protocol, any source, any destination,\n\n564\n00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:37.170\npermit ip any, any, right?\n\n565\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.620\nSo let's put this on a routing protocol,\nwhat do you say?\n\n566\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.570\nWell, what are we using?\n\n567\n00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.910\nWe're using,\nin our routing tables now we have GRP.\n\n568\n00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.710\nSo if I come down here and\nlook, down here, for\n\n569\n00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.020\nme to get to those networks I did D.\n\n570\n00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.930\nD for duel to get to 20.\n\n571\n00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.895\nSo let's try to tell it before I add them.\n\n572\n00:28:54.895 --> 00:28:57.823\n172.16.10.5.\n\n573\n00:28:57.823 --> 00:28:59.231\nThat's my neighbor.\n\n574\n00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:00.810\nMy gosh, Ronnie.\n\n575\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.900\nI told you to set the administrative\nfunctions on here.\n\n576\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.760\nWow, man.\n\n577\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.910\nSo let's go over here and\nlet's set this up.\n\n578\n00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.640\nThis is how you should\ndo it in production.\n\n579\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.485\nLet me show you.\n\n580\n00:29:10.485 --> 00:29:13.029\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I got my access list,\n\n581\n00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:14.461\nhere's what you should do.\n\n582\n00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:21.530\nHit t, line vty, 0 space ?,\nlet's spell vty right.\n\n583\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.540\n0 space ?, 988, no login.\n\n584\n00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.526\nIt's just easier for you if you don't\nhave any passwords for your Telnet.\n\n585\n00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:34.120\nI know there's security, but\nit's all about us, admin guys, right?\n\n586\n00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.600\nSo let's go down here and test this.\n\n587\n00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.300\nAnd, make sure I can get in here.\n\n588\n00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.953\nUp arrow, okay.\n\n589\n00:29:40.953 --> 00:29:44.605\nWait a minute, didn't I do this\n[INAUDIBLE] password one second.\n\n590\n00:29:44.605 --> 00:29:45.710\nWhere am I trying to go to?\n\n591\n00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.520\nAm I going the wrong place?\n\n592\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.120\nWell, ping, show cdp.\n\n593\n00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.470\nSo, okay, question guys, ha, cdp question.\n\n594\n00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.335\nHow could I find out who\n172.16.10.5 is from here?\n\n595\n00:30:02.335 --> 00:30:04.135\n>> show cdp.\n\n596\n00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.055\n>> Actually, here's a problem.\n\n597\n00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:07.765\nI know what the problem is show ip int b.\n\n598\n00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:11.385\nIf we look at that, I'm 10.5 and\nI'm trying to tell that to myself.\n\n599\n00:30:11.385 --> 00:30:12.915\nSo what I meant to do is [LAUGH].\n\n600\n00:30:12.915 --> 00:30:14.955\nThis is why you should set up host names.\n\n601\n00:30:14.955 --> 00:30:15.725\n>> Six.\n\n602\n00:30:15.725 --> 00:30:17.131\n>> All right, so watch this, guys.\n\n603\n00:30:17.131 --> 00:30:19.205\nSo config t, and\n\n604\n00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:23.720\nby the way, this was on the objective,\nand this is why I just thought of this.\n\n605\n00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.369\nCuz I just screwed that up and said,\nif I would've used a host name, but\n\n606\n00:30:26.369 --> 00:30:28.102\nif I screwed up a host name,\nwhat am I gonna do?\n\n607\n00:30:28.102 --> 00:30:36.126\nSo we're gonna say ho LA is 17216.10.6,\nall right?\n\n608\n00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:40.589\nSo, host name LA 8.\n\n609\n00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:42.150\nDo I put the IP address first?\n\n610\n00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:42.880\n>> I think.\n\n611\n00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.760\n>> Yeah, that's what it is.\n\n612\n00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.772\nNo.\n\n613\n00:30:44.772 --> 00:30:46.765\n>> It's not?\n\n614\n00:30:46.765 --> 00:30:52.190\n>> Hostname LA.\n\n615\n00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.180\nWait a minute.\n\n616\n00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.760\n>> No, that's for this network.\n\n617\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.420\n>> What's missing?\n\n618\n00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.340\nNot hostname.\n\n619\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.890\nI want IP host.\n\n620\n00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.620\nI'm sorry.\n\n621\n00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.739\nIP hostname.\n\n622\n00:30:59.739 --> 00:31:00.491\nI'm setting the hostname.\n\n623\n00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.659\nDid I change my host name?\n\n624\n00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:09.230\nIP ho 17216 LA is 172.16.10.6.\n\n625\n00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:14.280\nNow, this is a problem on the exam\nobjectives I just saw today\n\n626\n00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.460\nI was looking at.\n\n627\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.030\nOkay, so what you're gonna do is go,\nif I did this, ping LA,\n\n628\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.150\nI just pinged LA and using the host name.\n\n629\n00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.200\nThe problem is you're gonna do that,\nyou're gonna see that,\n\n630\n00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.010\nand you've got to do show ho and\n\n631\n00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:38.530\nto see your IP addresses to host names and\nmake sure those are correct.\n\n632\n00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.050\nOkay so,\nI actually just remembered this, but\n\n633\n00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.280\nthis is something you want to check,\nshow ho.\n\n634\n00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.870\nSo, let's telnet it.\n\n635\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:50.853\nNow I just have to type in LA,\nand it's not case sensitive.\n\n636\n00:31:50.853 --> 00:31:54.360\nNo it's not, what do you mean\nyou can't complete command?\n\n637\n00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.200\ntelnet la.\n\n638\n00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.776\nThere, I'm in.\nWhy didn't it,\n\n639\n00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:02.290\nshouldn't have to type in the IP address.\n\n640\n00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:02.803\nHold on.\n\n641\n00:32:02.803 --> 00:32:03.524\nI'm wanna exit out.\n\n642\n00:32:03.524 --> 00:32:04.084\nI wanna fix this.\n\n643\n00:32:04.084 --> 00:32:05.849\nLA telnet.\n\n644\n00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:08.696\nOkay.\n\n645\n00:32:08.696 --> 00:32:09.468\n>> That's right.\n\n646\n00:32:09.468 --> 00:32:10.281\n>> I don't know.\n\n647\n00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:12.330\nYou shouldn't have to type in Telnet.\n\n648\n00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.750\nSo I got that set.\n\n649\n00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:14.500\nAll right.\n\n650\n00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.930\nNow, so we can Telnet up there,\nlet's fix that.\n\n651\n00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.890\nAnd I can fix that with\nthis awesome list I made.\n\n652\n00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.350\nSo, show access list.\n\n653\n00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.280\nAll right?\nShow access list.\n\n654\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.410\nSo basically, it's a named access list,\nnamed Test with a capital T.\n\n655\n00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.920\nAnd it's deny tcp any any, and\nso we're allowing IDP and UDPN,\n\n656\n00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.850\nin our INCP and\neverything in this command here.\n\n657\n00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.880\nIt allows everything but tcp.\n\n658\n00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.780\nSo if I just came here, and I don't even\nknow which interface that came in on.\n\n659\n00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.290\nYou know what's interesting?\n\n660\n00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.370\nLet's do this for a second.\n\n661\n00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:52.550\nLet's come back here, and find out what\ninterface I come in, with a trace LA.\n\n662\n00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.020\nLet's see if that works.\n\n663\n00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.970\nYeah, it did.\n\n664\n00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.210\nIt went through 10.6.\n\n665\n00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.080\nOkay?\n\n666\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.820\nSo now we know which way it's gonna go.\n\n667\n00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.350\nSo I'm going to come up here to my\ninterface which is 10.6, do show interface\n\n668\n00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.840\nbrief, so show ip int brief.\n\n669\n00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.560\nAnd 10.6 is serial 010.\n\n670\n00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.730\nSo I'm going to make this easy,\nthen we're going to do distribute lists.\n\n671\n00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.268\nIp access, I gotta show you guys this.\n\n672\n00:33:20.268 --> 00:33:24.340\nGroup test in.\n\n673\n00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.990\nOkay, so I'm only showing you this so\nyou get an idea of the access list so\n\n674\n00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.880\nyou know how to put it on an interface.\n\n675\n00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.492\nSo if I come back down here now\nthat it's on the interface.\n\n676\n00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:40.250\nTelnet LA.\n\n677\n00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.460\nNow I got a destination unreachable.\n\n678\n00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.530\nBecause I have that access list on there.\n\n679\n00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.690\nPretty simple problem.\n\n680\n00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.590\nYou're going to see this.\n\n681\n00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.850\nSo how do I know,\nhey what can I do to that?\n\n682\n00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.180\nCan I ping though LA?\n\n683\n00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.960\nI can ping it.\n\n684\n00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.130\nWhat?\n\n685\n00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.630\nBut I can't Telnet to it.\n\n686\n00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.990\nThat's gonna tell you right there that\nyou have some sort of access list.\n\n687\n00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.040\nSo if I can ping it.\n\n688\n00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.660\nSo I'm gonna come up here to LA and\nI'm gonna see this, so I'm gonna do this.\n\n689\n00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.584\nShow access list.\n\n690\n00:34:07.584 --> 00:34:12.500\nAnd first off, we can see the log here.\n\n691\n00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.800\nI had two matches on the denies and\n\n692\n00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.870\n22 matches on permits cuz the routing\nprotocols are running in the background.\n\n693\n00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:18.780\nWe're gonna fix that too.\n\n694\n00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.890\nAll right.\n\n695\n00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:22.060\nSo that being said, so\nI can see this here.\n\n696\n00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.780\nI can't Telnet it in with IP version 4.\n\n697\n00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.160\nI would be able to with IP\nversion 6 if I get the address.\n\n698\n00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.360\nNow, in this case here, let's add this to,\n\n699\n00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.070\nlet's if I just said permit IP on here,\nbut\n\n700\n00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:39.710\ndenied TCP, I'm still gonna get my routing\nprotocols cuz they're gonna use IP, right?\n\n701\n00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.940\nSo we gotta do something\na little bit more on here.\n\n702\n00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.400\nSo I'm gonna create another list.\n\n703\n00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.170\nAt first I'm gonna take 010.\n\n704\n00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.770\nInterface is 010.\n\n705\n00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:55.470\nOkay, you gotta remember these commands.\n\n706\n00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:59.300\nNo ip access-group Test in.\n\n707\n00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.800\nAnd you have to type out\nthe whole thing to get it off.\n\n708\n00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.690\nAll right, so let's create another list.\n\n709\n00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.490\nAnd I want to [LAUGH]\nshow you guys something.\n\n710\n00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.690\nThis is pretty fun, this is kind of,\nthis is kind of scary actually.\n\n711\n00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.510\nThis is a bug.\n\n712\n00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.040\nI'm gonna show you something that\nyou can screw up your network and\n\n713\n00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.360\nno one will ever find this.\n\n714\n00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.490\nSo if you get laid off, this might\nbe something that you want to do.\n\n715\n00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.570\nNo, don't do that.\n\n716\n00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.690\nI'm just kidding.\n\n717\n00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:29.396\nBut if I was to create this access list,\nIP access list\n\n718\n00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:34.730\nextended and\nI'm going to make it a little t test.\n\n719\n00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:41.780\nAnd I'm just going to deny, I'm going\nto deny, I can just deny IP any any.\n\n720\n00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.560\nRight?\nI mean that's just denying it right?\n\n721\n00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.790\nBut, I'm not going to put\nthis on an interface.\n\n722\n00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.640\nYou might as well just shut off\nthe interface for something like this.\n\n723\n00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.660\nAnd that is at the end of every\nlist anyways, but check this out.\n\n724\n00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.990\nSo, we're running eigrp right?\n\n725\n00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:02.116\nSo I'm gonna say, router eigrp 1,\nand distribute list.\n\n726\n00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:05.519\nIt should allow me to do this.\n\n727\n00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.240\nTest, and see if it lets me do this.\n\n728\n00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.780\nYep.\n\n729\n00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:15.830\nDistribute list test, the word,\naccess name, lowercase.\n\n730\n00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:16.950\nAnd then in or out.\n\n731\n00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.550\nAnd I'm gonna say, in.\n\n732\n00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.390\nOkay?\n\n733\n00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.810\nNow it gives me an error.\n\n734\n00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.400\nIt says you can't do that.\n\n735\n00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.370\nUse an extended list.\n\n736\n00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.220\nI'm like, okay.\n\n737\n00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.429\nBut let's go ahead and see what this did.\n\n738\n00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.950\nIf it did anything under eigrp.\n\n739\n00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.970\nIt might've been a RIP issue.\n\n740\n00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.060\nI think i used it with rip.\n\n741\n00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.630\nAnyways, so\nlet's go take a look here in see.\n\n742\n00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:41.170\nI didn't lose my things,\nbut let's go ahead and see.\n\n743\n00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.760\nIt gave me an error and\nsays, hey you can't do this.\n\n744\n00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.480\nYou can only use standard named ACLs.\n\n745\n00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.320\nOkay.\n\n746\n00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.300\nI got that.\n\n747\n00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:48.840\nBut let's do this.\n\n748\n00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:54.180\nShow IP proto, okay, look under rip.\n\n749\n00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.780\nAnd let's go down to EIGRP.\n\n750\n00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.040\nAnd it didn't do it there, all right,\nso the error that I found, so,\n\n751\n00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.960\nlet's try this under rip, okay?\n\n752\n00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.820\nSo if I solved this error earlier,\nand I put it on and it set it.\n\n753\n00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.200\nAnd it said incoming net filter and\nit said, is.\n\n754\n00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.500\nAnd it didn't say anything here.\n\n755\n00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.780\nAnd it brought my network down, right?\n\n756\n00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.760\nSo let's go ahead and put this under OSPF.\n\n757\n00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:28.460\nAnd so I'm gonna say config t,\nrouter ospf.\n\n758\n00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:33.670\nAnd again, this is why I use\nthe same number all the time.\n\n759\n00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.640\nMan, could you imagine going in trying to\nremember if you used different numbers on\n\n760\n00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.730\nevery router for every routing protocol?\n\n761\n00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:44.550\nAll right, distribute list 1 in.\n\n762\n00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.450\nOkay.\nIt didn't give me an error that time,\n\n763\n00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.780\nthat's interesting.\n\n764\n00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.610\nIf I'm under a router or SPF 1.\n\n765\n00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.200\nDo show IP proto.\n\n766\n00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.660\nAll right.\n\n767\n00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.790\nSo I've seen this give me, there it is.\n\n768\n00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.670\nIt did work on here.\n\n769\n00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.000\nDid I use the right access list though?\n\n770\n00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.850\nDarn it.\nHold on a second guys.\n\n771\n00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.540\n>> You needed a named access list.\n\n772\n00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.590\n>> I didn't mean one.\n\n773\n00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.220\nI meant test in.\n\n774\n00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:10.820\nOkay.\n\n775\n00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.680\nNow it gave me an error.\n\n776\n00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.960\nNow it's seven to one which\nis kind of funny because\n\n777\n00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.950\nI didn't have an access lists one.\n\n778\n00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.380\nSo by setting on there it's\ngoing to cause a problem\n\n779\n00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.260\nbecause I put an access lists\non there that did not exist.\n\n780\n00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.580\nThat's a problem.\n\n781\n00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.560\nAll right, but this one is too.\n\n782\n00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.460\nThis one says, hey, you gotta error.\n\n783\n00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.550\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n784\n00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.144\nDo show IP proto.\n\n785\n00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:33.913\nIt did the same thing.\n\n786\n00:38:33.913 --> 00:38:35.380\nNow it's still saying 1, hold on a second.\n\n787\n00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.736\nAm I under OSPF still?\n\n788\n00:38:37.736 --> 00:38:43.870\nNo distribute-list 1 in, okay.\n\n789\n00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.880\nThat being said,\nthen I did distribute-list test, okay.\n\n790\n00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.810\nIt's saying got an error.\n\n791\n00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.390\nDo show ip proto.\n\n792\n00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:56.003\nOkay, now it didn't do it, [LAUGH].\n\n793\n00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:57.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not making it work,\n\n794\n00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.670\nI guess it depends on what iOS you're on.\n\n795\n00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.030\nBut listen, be careful with this, it gives\nyou an error, but what I've done is,\n\n796\n00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.790\nI've seen it set on that interface.\n\n797\n00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.140\nIt comes back and says just the incoming\nfilter is, it's not set, but\n\n798\n00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.140\nmy routing protocol went down.\n\n799\n00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.640\nIt's possible because\nI'm running the eigrp.\n\n800\n00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.250\nBut, the point is, is even though I set\nthat as an extended, it gave me an error.\n\n801\n00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.100\nIt put it on their virtually,\ndidn't see it in the config.\n\n802\n00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.400\nBut I did see it brought down.\n\n803\n00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.300\nSo at times it can bring down your\nnetwork, just keep that in mind.\n\n804\n00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.498\nObviously that's not an objective\nbecause that was a bug.\n\n805\n00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:30.470\nSo all right, so now we're under here.\n\n806\n00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.740\nHold on,\nlet me create another access list then.\n\n807\n00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.480\nSo we're on route on here.\n\n808\n00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.100\nSo I'm gonna say exit.\n\n809\n00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.290\nAnd we're almost done here guys.\n\n810\n00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.130\nWe're gonna do IPv6 list, and\nthen I've got spam and that so\n\n811\n00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.100\nI'm rushing through here right now.\n\n812\n00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:52.363\nSo I'm gonna say access\n\n813\n00:39:52.363 --> 00:40:00.790\nIP access list standard block eigrp.\n\n814\n00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:07.370\nAnd so I can say this is a standard list,\nso in this case here,\n\n815\n00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:13.456\nI'm gonna say deny IP from I172.16.10.5.\n\n816\n00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:17.980\nRight, this is standard, that's it.\n\n817\n00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.330\nI can't do the protocol.\n\n818\n00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.950\nI don't need the host command.\n\n819\n00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.240\nI can't put the host command.\n\n820\n00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.350\nI didn't need the host command,\nI can't put a protocol with standard.\n\n821\n00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.750\nOkay, so I'm denying 10.5.\n\n822\n00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.140\nBut I'm also gonna do 10.9,\nright, as well.\n\n823\n00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.061\nAnd then permit any, okay.\n\n824\n00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:39.000\nSo my list is denying corp from coming in.\n\n825\n00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.500\nI might as well have not put a permit any,\nI don't have anything coming in there.\n\n826\n00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.783\nAnd then I'm gonna say router\n\n827\n00:40:46.783 --> 00:40:52.070\nEIGRP1, distribute list.\n\n828\n00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.650\nThere we go, distribute list,\nI didn't make that named.\n\n829\n00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.180\nI could have made that named but\nI didn't, so one in, okay.\n\n830\n00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.209\nSo in this case here we\nshould lose our connection.\n\n831\n00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.290\nWe should.\n\n832\n00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.440\nBut anyways, so I could,\nI didn't make a named list here.\n\n833\n00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.230\n>> Didn't you call it block.\n\n834\n00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.860\n>> No, I did, yes I did.\n\n835\n00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.340\nDog gone it.\n\n836\n00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.720\nNonetheless, I did create\na problem here because,\n\n837\n00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.120\nagain, I applied an access\nlist that doesn't exist.\n\n838\n00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.670\nIt's not gonna like that.\n\n839\n00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.080\nSo, I'm going to say, no.\n\n840\n00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.442\nAnd then I'm going to say,\ndistribute list block-\n\n841\n00:41:28.442 --> 00:41:30.758\n>> _eigrp.\n\n842\n00:41:30.758 --> 00:41:33.080\n>> Eigrp in.\n\n843\n00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.050\nAll right, now so what we're going to\nlook for is we're going to do this, and\n\n844\n00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:42.960\nthis is what we're going to look for,\nsh ip pr.\n\n845\n00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.020\nOkay, we don't see one there, so\nI'm looking here, none under RIP.\n\n846\n00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.660\nBut I am seeing my EIGRP go down.\n\n847\n00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.240\nSo OSPF, and\nnow we're gonna see it right here.\n\n848\n00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.500\nThis is what you guys are gonna look for\nwhen you're troubleshooting.\n\n849\n00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.800\nIncoming update filter block_eigrp.\n\n850\n00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.110\nFor EIGRP,\nyou're gonna block your K numbers and\n\n851\n00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.480\nyour autonomous system number and\nwhich network you're routing for.\n\n852\n00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.810\nSo why aren't we getting this?\n\n853\n00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:07.640\nI have a distribute list on here,\nall right.\n\n854\n00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.960\nSo we're gonna have to go\nunder the routing protocol.\n\n855\n00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.480\nSo if we did a show run we'd\nsee it under the protocol.\n\n856\n00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:18.020\nNow the other thing that I can do\nis create an access list, IPv6.\n\n857\n00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.020\nNow I can't create a lot of\ndifferent access lists here.\n\n858\n00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.540\nOops, I didn't mean to do that.\n\n859\n00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.900\nAccess list, right,\nit's only letting me create this one.\n\n860\n00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.100\nSo it's just a word,\nit's creating in an extended list, okay.\n\n861\n00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.806\nBlock_Corp.\n\n862\n00:42:30.806 --> 00:42:37.262\nNow remember,\nthese are case sensitive, Okay,\n\n863\n00:42:37.262 --> 00:42:42.373\nnow so what I'm going to do is come\nin here and say deny TCP, okay, so\n\n864\n00:42:42.373 --> 00:42:48.850\nI'm going to block the telnet using IPv6,\nso we're gonna try to telnet with IPv6.\n\n865\n00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.000\nThis is gonna take a couple minutes.\n\n866\n00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.760\nAll right, deny TCP and I'm just\ngonna do any, any any to make it, and\n\n867\n00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.290\nthen permit IP any any.\n\n868\n00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:02.170\nAll right now I can go and deny and\nchoose that IP, go out and\n\n869\n00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.030\nget their IP6 addresses and\nthat's what you really should do.\n\n870\n00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.194\nAnd then I'm gonna go under,\n\n871\n00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:11.965\nI should be able to add this in here\nto line, let me do an exit here.\n\n872\n00:43:15.362 --> 00:43:18.845\nOkay line vty0 I think it was 988.\n\n873\n00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:27.310\nOkay, so we're gonna put an access\nclass on here, all right.\n\n874\n00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:36.260\nAnd we named it Block Corp, so in.\n\n875\n00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:40.823\nSo I'm blocking corps IPv6 address\nfrom telemating in, right.\n\n876\n00:43:40.823 --> 00:43:44.609\nI'm actually blocking anything from\ntelemating in or any or TCPIP, but\n\n877\n00:43:44.609 --> 00:43:46.580\nin this case I put on the VT wise.\n\n878\n00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:52.320\nNow in this case here, check out\nwhat I put underneath the interface.\n\n879\n00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.230\nSo if I was to go to Serial 0/1/0,\nI would add a IPv6 access list with the,\n\n880\n00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:03.340\nI forget what it is,\nwith the traffic filter.\n\n881\n00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.189\nSo check this out, IPv6,\nyou notice right there.\n\n882\n00:44:07.189 --> 00:44:11.926\nSo to add an IPv6 access list to\n\n883\n00:44:11.926 --> 00:44:17.035\nan interface, traffic filter.\n\n884\n00:44:17.035 --> 00:44:22.165\nOkay, and\nthen I'm gonna do the same thing,\n\n885\n00:44:22.165 --> 00:44:25.420\nblock core, okay, and in.\n\n886\n00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.800\nOkay, so access class to put it on there.\n\n887\n00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.930\nTraffic filter block corp in, so\nI probably wouldn't be able to do any type\n\n888\n00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:38.380\nof telnet in here, so if I tried to\ntelnet, so here's how I get my IP address.\n\n889\n00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.770\nI'm gonna use the link local.\n\n890\n00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.040\nI could use the link local or\nI could use the interface IP address.\n\n891\n00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.150\nSo IPv6 interface s010.\n\n892\n00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:52.790\nOkay, and there's my addresses,\nthere's my link local,\n\n893\n00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.870\nand here's my global unicast address.\n\n894\n00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.325\nNow remember why are these so\n\n895\n00:44:57.325 --> 00:45:02.344\nbig it's because I used the EUI 64,\nso here's my FFFE.\n\n896\n00:45:02.344 --> 00:45:05.167\nI know this is getting intense guys but\nbear with me,\n\n897\n00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:06.970\nI am doing CCNA objectives here.\n\n898\n00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.770\nSo I'm gonna highlight this.\n\n899\n00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:13.830\nThis isn't that bad guys,\nif you learn to highlight, copy.\n\n900\n00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:19.270\nAll right, so notice so\nI said add the prefix in EUI64 so\n\n901\n00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:22.160\nit took the MAC address,\nput an FFFE in there.\n\n902\n00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.549\nSo now, let me try to ping this.\n\n903\n00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:30.090\nI probably can't do any,\nno cuz I did a permit IP, right.\n\n904\n00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.940\nSo let me try pinging here and pasting.\n\n905\n00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.069\nYeah, I can ping it so let's tenet.\n\n906\n00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:43.067\n[SOUND] That is awesome.\n\n907\n00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:46.680\nSo we can ping it, but\nour VTYs stopped it.\n\n908\n00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.130\nHow awesome is that?\n\n909\n00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.060\nShow IPv6 interface,\nwhoops it's not on here.\n\n910\n00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.600\nCheck this out, guys.\n\n911\n00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.490\nAlmost done.\n\n912\n00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.509\nShow IPv6 interface.\n\n913\n00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.844\nSo I wanna see it on the interface s0/1/0.\n\n914\n00:46:02.844 --> 00:46:08.380\nAnd so I should see, right here,\nthis is where you're gonna look,\n\n915\n00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.320\ninbound access list is Block Corp, right.\n\n916\n00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.370\nAnd then what's the command\nto put it on the interface?\n\n917\n00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.650\nThe traffic-filter, to put it on\nthe VTY inlet, it's access class.\n\n918\n00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.920\nOkay, I wanna show you two more things.\n\n919\n00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.805\nThey're fun though, I promise.\n\n920\n00:46:23.805 --> 00:46:25.390\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But this is all fun.\n\n921\n00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.220\nRodney this has been\nthe best day of your life.\n\n922\n00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.380\n>> It sure.\n\n923\n00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.117\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n924\n00:46:29.117 --> 00:46:29.966\n>> Yeah.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n925\n00:46:29.966 --> 00:46:32.454\n>> It was better than that\nroot canal you got earlier.\n\n926\n00:46:32.454 --> 00:46:33.121\n>> That's true.\n\n927\n00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:33.667\n[LAUGH].\n\n928\n00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:34.232\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n929\n00:46:34.232 --> 00:46:36.940\nAll right, so\non here guys I'm on a switch.\n\n930\n00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:42.810\nAll right, a guy says he can't walk\nin to the sales server, whatever.\n\n931\n00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.570\nIt doesn't even matter.\n\n932\n00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:49.350\nI put my analyzer in to the port and\nI can't see any traffic because\n\n933\n00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:54.220\ntraffic doesn't come out all ports,\nit goes out of the destination port.\n\n934\n00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.760\nSo if that's the case, okay,\nI know this has been a while.\n\n935\n00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.050\nIf you need to take a break, put us on\npause, because you need to see this.\n\n936\n00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.450\nI'm gonna do service level agreements and\nspanning right now.\n\n937\n00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.470\nOkay, this is important, so\nif you need to take a break, go ahead.\n\n938\n00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:09.405\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n939\n00:47:09.405 --> 00:47:11.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't get a break.\n\n940\n00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.870\n>> That's true.\n\n941\n00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:13.100\n>> Gosh, all right.\n\n942\n00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.360\nSo here's how I do the spanning.\n\n943\n00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:19.090\nSo I'm going to come in here and then\nbasically what I want to do is I want to\n\n944\n00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.740\nwatch a source coming in and I want to\nwatch the port that it goes out of.\n\n945\n00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.320\nSo I want to pick the source and\ndestination ports.\n\n946\n00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.090\nNow I can just pick a source port and\n\n947\n00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:31.398\nspan the whole thing if you don't\nmind your CPU or something.\n\n948\n00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:32.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or something.\n\n949\n00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.810\nSo config t.\n\n950\n00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.519\nSo I'm going to say monitor.\n\n951\n00:47:36.519 --> 00:47:40.100\nMonitor, session.\n\n952\n00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.770\nAnd then the sessions number,\nI can do 66 different ones.\n\n953\n00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:48.610\nI highly recommend only doing one on\na switch, this is very CPU intensive.\n\n954\n00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.140\nAnd now I can do source or\ndestination or filter a VLAN.\n\n955\n00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.430\nBut I'm gonna do a source in this case,\nso I'm gonna pick my source.\n\n956\n00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.715\nAnd then I'm gonna say,\nit's coming off of interface f0/1.\n\n957\n00:47:58.715 --> 00:48:04.168\nAnd then, let's see what the question\nmark is, I can't remember.\n\n958\n00:48:04.168 --> 00:48:07.733\nAnd then I want to,\nI want to receive or transmit, right.\n\n959\n00:48:07.733 --> 00:48:09.358\nIn this case here I always pick both.\n\n960\n00:48:09.358 --> 00:48:13.889\nBut you guys pick what you want, okay.\n\n961\n00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:15.967\nMonitor session 1, right,\n\n962\n00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:20.790\nreally highly recommend that you're\nusing one session on a switch,\n\n963\n00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:26.793\nsource interface f0/1 in both directions,\nbut I also wanna see the destination.\n\n964\n00:48:26.793 --> 00:48:30.620\nOkay, so I'm gonna come back here,\nand I'm gonna change its port.\n\n965\n00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.678\nHe was port, I don't know, 2.\n\n966\n00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:36.382\nAnd I wanna look at both directions,\nbut he's not the source,\n\n967\n00:48:36.382 --> 00:48:37.820\nhe's gonna be the destination.\n\n968\n00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:42.530\nOkay, f/02, what did I miss here?\n\n969\n00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.290\nOkay, enable ingress.\n\n970\n00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:50.580\nI thought I did interface,\nI guess I don't do that s0/0, that's fine.\n\n971\n00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.500\nI guess I don't do it, but\n\n972\n00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.840\nI could do another range of interfaces\nthat I'm watching or ingress.\n\n973\n00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.120\nI'm just gonna hit Enter here.\n\n974\n00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.975\nSo I'm basically watching, whoops,\nsource and destination here.\n\n975\n00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:03.839\nPretty simple, do show monitor.\n\n976\n00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:06.985\nAnd then I'll be able to see my traffic,\nwhat I'm doing.\n\n977\n00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:11.040\nSo I'm watching both directions for\nFastEthernet0/1.\n\n978\n00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.670\nI'm watching the destination port 0/2.\n\n979\n00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.850\nI'm looking in the native VLAN.\n\n980\n00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:20.510\nSo I should've changed this and\nlooked at a different VLAN here, and\n\n981\n00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.900\nI could've looked at the ingress and\nchanged that as well.\n\n982\n00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.320\nSo show monitor,\nthat's really all we need to do here.\n\n983\n00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.550\nSo span is very important.\n\n984\n00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.130\nSpan is very important in a\ntroubleshooting manner in a sense that if\n\n985\n00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:38.090\nyou're looking at a switch, and\nyou wanna be able to watch a source and\n\n986\n00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.720\ndestination talk to each other,\nyou really gotta do spanning.\n\n987\n00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.418\nBut then turn it off.\n\n988\n00:49:41.418 --> 00:49:43.815\nTurn it off when you're done.\n\n989\n00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:45.500\nAll right,\nI wanna show you guys one more thing.\n\n990\n00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.430\nLet's go back to our router.\n\n991\n00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.538\nSo let me be able to ping.\n\n992\n00:49:52.719 --> 00:49:54.159\nOkay, so that looks awesome.\n\n993\n00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:55.980\nWe got our IPv6 list working.\n\n994\n00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.570\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was pretty fun.\n\n995\n00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.216\nYou guys, make sure you get this working\nat home before you take your test,\n\n996\n00:50:00.216 --> 00:50:02.358\ncuz who knows what they're gonna\ngive you on something, but\n\n997\n00:50:02.358 --> 00:50:03.663\nit's gonna be something like this.\n\n998\n00:50:03.663 --> 00:50:05.647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you're gonna look for\n\n999\n00:50:05.647 --> 00:50:10.320\na distribute list, you're gonna look for\nwrong K values on the edge of your IP.\n\n1000\n00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.607\n>> Right.\n>> Wrong number, and\n\n1001\n00:50:11.607 --> 00:50:13.176\nwe'll summarize all that,\nbut that was fun, man.\n\n1002\n00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.291\nThat was fun.\n\n1003\n00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:15.591\nThis stuff is fun.\n\n1004\n00:50:15.591 --> 00:50:20.013\nOkay, so what I wanna do,\nthough, is watch and\n\n1005\n00:50:20.013 --> 00:50:24.670\nget an idea of what's\nhappening with my network.\n\n1006\n00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:27.310\nAnd with that I can use something\ncalled a service level agreement.\n\n1007\n00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.860\nThis is gonna tell me what it's taken for\na path.\n\n1008\n00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.820\nSo I can set up a path permanently that\ntells me, hey, keep an eye on this and\n\n1009\n00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.800\nthen give me the details and\nI can look those up.\n\n1010\n00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.910\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna come\nin here and I'm gonna ping 192.168.10.1.\n\n1011\n00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.592\nOkay, [LAUGH] I just wanted to\nmake sure I could ping it first,\n\n1012\n00:50:44.592 --> 00:50:48.010\ngo through all this and\nnot being able to ping it.\n\n1013\n00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.470\nOkay, here's what you guys gotta do for\nthe objectives, okay?\n\n1014\n00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:55.320\nSo this is gonna tell you,\nit's gonna help you diagnose problems,\n\n1015\n00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.790\nbandwidth, high traffic, and so on.\n\n1016\n00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.960\nOkay, this is a CCNA objective.\n\n1017\n00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.650\nSo I'm gonna say IP service\nlevel agreement, and\n\n1018\n00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.910\nI can pick a number between 1 and\n2.1 billion, right?\n\n1019\n00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.290\nSo we've got a lot here.\n\n1020\n00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.880\nI'm just gonna pick one.\n\n1021\n00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.900\nThis isn't gonna take up a lot\nlike the span did on the switch.\n\n1022\n00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.420\nI'm watching traffic flow so\nwe're watching how this works.\n\n1023\n00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:24.250\nSo I'm gonna say, I'm gonna do an ICMP\necho forever and give me the stats for it.\n\n1024\n00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.485\nSo ICMP.\n\n1025\n00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:31.641\nI can do I, ICMP, I can do jitter,\nI love that, echo.\n\n1026\n00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:37.950\nAnd I'm gonna say 2 10.1, okay, and\nthen I wanna say the frequency.\n\n1027\n00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.770\nSo frequency is every 10 seconds,\nall right?\n\n1028\n00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.060\nDefault is 60.\n\n1029\n00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:49.540\nThat might be okay, I'm gonna do it\nevery 10 seconds so we get some data.\n\n1030\n00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.490\nActually, let's do it every 5\nseconds just so cuz we're in a data.\n\n1031\n00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.220\nI don't know if you would do\n5 in production, but okay.\n\n1032\n00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.480\nSo now we need to schedule it,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n1033\n00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.760\ntake a look at how to schedule this.\n\n1034\n00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.160\nSo it's ip sla schedule,\nlet's go ahead and get into here, and\n\n1035\n00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.677\nthen I'm gonna do what is\nthe life of the schedule.\n\n1036\n00:52:07.677 --> 00:52:12.444\nNow I can choose for\nhow long I want, or I can do forever,\n\n1037\n00:52:12.444 --> 00:52:17.340\nbut wait, I'm not done, and\nwhen do I wanna start this?\n\n1038\n00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.930\nAll right, so\nnow I can choose the start time, so\n\n1039\n00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:22.280\nI can choose the amount of\ntime that I wanna run this.\n\n1040\n00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.740\nAnd I can choose the start time,\nand so how long I wanna run it, and\n\n1041\n00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:30.650\nthe start time, but\nI'm gonna say forever start time.\n\n1042\n00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.100\nAnd I can do pending after\na certain amount of time, and\n\n1043\n00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.170\nI'm just gonna do it now, okay?\n\n1044\n00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:37.430\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n1045\n00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:42.002\nSo now I'm doing a service level agreement\nfrom this router to that IP address.\n\n1046\n00:52:42.002 --> 00:52:43.270\nAnd we're taking a look, and\n\n1047\n00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.671\nit's gonna help us understand\nwhat we can do with that.\n\n1048\n00:52:45.671 --> 00:52:50.745\nNow in this case here,\nI'm gonna do a do show ip sla config,\n\n1049\n00:52:50.745 --> 00:52:57.362\nand take a look, it helps if I do do,\nshow ip service level agreement config.\n\n1050\n00:52:57.362 --> 00:52:59.667\nAnd then we can take a look\nat our configuration here.\n\n1051\n00:52:59.667 --> 00:53:04.869\nIt's ICP echo to 10, 10.1 and so on.\n\n1052\n00:53:04.869 --> 00:53:08.682\nAnd the schedule is every 5 seconds,\nand we're starting it now,\n\n1053\n00:53:08.682 --> 00:53:10.395\nand it is gonna last forever.\n\n1054\n00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:17.438\nAnd then do show IPSLA stat,\nI think that's what I want.\n\n1055\n00:53:17.438 --> 00:53:20.348\nYeah, so okay,\nthis is gonna give me my stats, and\n\n1056\n00:53:20.348 --> 00:53:23.492\nthe latest around trip\ntime is one millisecond.\n\n1057\n00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.190\nAll right, so now we're gonna be able\nto see our successes and our failures,\n\n1058\n00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.820\nand this is gonna tell us how\nmuch the network worked and\n\n1059\n00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.940\ngive us some statistics\nthat we can look at.\n\n1060\n00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.700\nSo what did we type in here,\nIP service level agreement.\n\n1061\n00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.120\nAnd we can use this to test a path,\nand then give us statistics on it.\n\n1062\n00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.670\nAnd tell us how good it's\ngonna be in our network.\n\n1063\n00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.740\nAnd keep an eye on it, and\ntell us what type of failures we have.\n\n1064\n00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.230\nAll right, Ronnie,\nwe did a lot in these two sections.\n\n1065\n00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:52.690\n>> We sure did.\n\n1066\n00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:54.790\nIn this section,\nremember what we took a look at, right?\n\n1067\n00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:59.380\nWe briefly went back and we showed\nyou a little bit more of OSPF and\n\n1068\n00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.650\ntroubleshooting there, but\nthen we jumped right into EIGRP.\n\n1069\n00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:05.540\nAnd made sure that we could\nactually enable that and\n\n1070\n00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.130\nmake sure that it also ran.\n\n1071\n00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:10.720\nRemember that in the EIGRP there's\na couple of, I won't say tricky, but\n\n1072\n00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.250\na couple of things you may not notice,\njust like I didn't.\n\n1073\n00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:18.960\nIf you're gonna run that command\nitself in the IPv6 router EIGRP and,\n\n1074\n00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.740\nof course, the autonomous-system number,\nmake sure you select a no shut.\n\n1075\n00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.200\nOr you type in no shut, or it's not gonna\nwork, no matter how often you type in\n\n1076\n00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.885\nthe IP addresses and get all the other\nthings to work on every interface there.\n\n1077\n00:54:31.885 --> 00:54:34.680\nThe other things, of course,\nthat we also talked about, of course,\n\n1078\n00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.840\nis the idea of troubleshooting\nof neighbors do not come up\n\n1079\n00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.600\nto take a look at the routing\nprotocols themselves.\n\n1080\n00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.650\nVerify that all those things that\nmatch that need to such as, of course,\n\n1081\n00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:47.260\nthe autonomous system number.\n\n1082\n00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:52.000\nAnd of course, those K values, and\nalso we talked about span just briefly,\n\n1083\n00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.640\nright, being on a monitor traffic\nbetween the ports that we need to.\n\n1084\n00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.570\nRemember that the recommendation is one,\nespecially on a production network.\n\n1085\n00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:02.690\nProbably not all is probably a bad\nthing for us to be able to do.\n\n1086\n00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:07.560\nAnd the one thing that was actually\nvery neat as far as some of the things\n\n1087\n00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.340\nyou don't get on every place in the world\nis the idea that a distribute list, right.\n\n1088\n00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.200\nMost of us may not have actually seen\nthat work in a routing protocol before.\n\n1089\n00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.360\nSo go back and take a look at it.\n\n1090\n00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.200\nIt was kind of a neat thing to be\nable to see that we can actually\n\n1091\n00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.210\nimplement that on a routing protocol.\n\n1092\n00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:25.280\nAnd then of course,\nwe also had the SLAs as well,\n\n1093\n00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.860\nthe Service Level Agreements that\nallow us to be able to monitor the way\n\n1094\n00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.870\nthose routing protocols are really\nworking and how successful that they are.\n\n1095\n00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.810\nAnd seeing all the traffic that's going\nthrough our particular devices, too.\n\n1096\n00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.130\nSo there is a lot of\ninformation right here.\n\n1097\n00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.910\nIf any of it doesn't sound familiar,\nwell, that means you need to go ahead

00:00:20.671\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ntaking the ICND2 content Getting ready for\n\n4\n00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.371\nthat new CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n5\n00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.743\nAnd in our studio today is gonna be Mr.\nTodd Lanley as he comes and\n\n6\n00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:30.127\nactually directs along the paths\nthat we actually need to take.\n\n7\n00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:31.442\nThank you for being here.\n\n8\n00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.125\n>> All right Ronnie,\nwe've got some great material today.\n\n9\n00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.609\nI think it's a little bit\neasier than maybe the edge RPO,\n\n10\n00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.960\nthe depth of OSPF that we had to\ngo through with, and with IPv6.\n\n11\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.416\nSo we're gonna to look at\nsome great WAN technologies.\n\n12\n00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.179\nNo frame relay, right?\n\n13\n00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.920\nSo we're gonna exchange that though for\na little bit more tunneling and some EGP.\n\n14\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.471\nSo let's go ahead and get started taking\na look at some wide area networks today.\n\n15\n00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.632\nAll right, so for the objectives again,\n\n16\n00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:02.420\nI'm hyper-focusing the wide area\nnetworks of the objectives, okay.\n\n17\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.750\nSo you have some topology\noptions when looking to build\n\n18\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.270\nyour new corporate networks.\n\n19\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.613\nFirst you have the star.\n\n20\n00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:11.923\nThis is typically referred\nto as the hub and spoke.\n\n21\n00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:13.614\nThis has been around forever, and\n\n22\n00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.247\nthis is kind of how we did it\nwith frame relay for sure.\n\n23\n00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:17.320\nAnd we can still do this.\n\n24\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.470\nWe have the corporate network and we go\nout in all directions to our branches.\n\n25\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.397\nFully meshed network where we have\nconnection between every other connection.\n\n26\n00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.943\nThe drawbacks are configuration,\ncomplexity, and number of circuits so\n\n27\n00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:34.506\nthere's and expense here, but\nyou have the most full tolerance, right?\n\n28\n00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:35.531\nSo it costs the most.\n\n29\n00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:40.505\nSo for the hub and spoke, we have network\nsimplicity, low number of circuits and\n\n30\n00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.084\nthis was a big benefit for\nme in this case.\n\n31\n00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:48.112\nThe drawbacks were sub-optimal traffic\nflow and no redundancy in this case.\n\n32\n00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.792\nSo we typically a lot of customers.\n\n33\n00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.360\nI'm going back a long time.\n\n34\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.005\nWe're using the partially masterpology.\n\n35\n00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:58.467\nSo we can build some sort of\nnetwork kind of like these today.\n\n36\n00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:02.841\nBut, these are considering we're\nusing some sort of serial, and\n\n37\n00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:06.290\nwe're not really using\nserial connections today.\n\n38\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.710\nSo most of my customers have some\nsort of MPLS that we'll run BGP on or\n\n39\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.450\nsomething like that.\n\n40\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.421\nNow we have some different types of ways\nto connect up for wide area networks.\n\n41\n00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.373\nWe have our typical T1,\nT3 something like that over here.\n\n42\n00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.055\nSo this will be like a T3, T1, whatever.\n\n43\n00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:24.156\nAnd we have a CSU/DSU.\n\n44\n00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:27.450\nThe CSU/DSU usually sits in the slot\nof the router of course, and\n\n45\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.280\nthen that connects us up to the service\nprovider, high speed service providers.\n\n46\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.833\nBut we also now have a lot of places,\nespecially if you're in a metro area,\n\n47\n00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.583\nwill have a metro ethernet.\n\n48\n00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:40.820\nAnd we don't even really\nhave the optical converter.\n\n49\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.360\nSometimes we'll see that, sometimes not.\n\n50\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.133\nThe fiber comes into the building and\nthen we're handed an ethernet cable.\n\n51\n00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.940\nSo a lot of my branches that\nI I have ethernet cables.\n\n52\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.052\nWe don't even get the fiber or\nneed an optical converter.\n\n53\n00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:55.649\nBut, that's gonna be sitting in\nthe building somewhere right.\n\n54\n00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.665\nAnd then DSL modem.\n\n55\n00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:58.699\nSo we have this.\n\n56\n00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.793\nThis is obviously our soho right?\n\n57\n00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:06.622\nAnd a lot of business, because we can get\nsome pretty good speeds with cables and\n\n58\n00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:09.580\nDSLs today, but we do a lot of wireless,\n\n59\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.360\nso we do a lot of outdoor,\nlong distance gigabyte wireless.\n\n60\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.147\nSo that's not listed in here, but as a,\nI don't even see it in the objectives.\n\n61\n00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:21.291\nBut absolutely it's an alternative.\n\n62\n00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.973\nSo more and more wireless or\nWAN replacement for sure.\n\n63\n00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:30.758\nAll right, so WAN connectivity,\nhere we have the old ISDN.\n\n64\n00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:34.026\nSo, this would be considered\npublic switch telephone network.\n\n65\n00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:35.542\nWe have dial up or ISDN.\n\n66\n00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:37.064\nStill some people on it.\n\n67\n00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:42.036\nI was seeing something about AOL still\nhas a few million dialup subscribers,\n\n68\n00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:43.118\nunbelievable.\n\n69\n00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:46.007\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways, ADSL, some sort of ADSL and\n\n70\n00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:47.999\nwe'll use some PPPoE client.\n\n71\n00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.519\nWe'll actually configure\nthat in this section.\n\n72\n00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.000\nCoax cable,\ncertainly we have some sort of coax.\n\n73\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.140\nCoax actually gives us high bandwidth,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.890\nAnd then here's our wireless, right?\n\n75\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.288\nSo we do have Last Mile Wireless listed\nhere so we can get really good speeds.\n\n76\n00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:06.290\nRight now we're getting gigabit.\n\n77\n00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.966\nSo we have 400 meg\nthroughput on this wireless.\n\n78\n00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:14.878\nThat's what we're seeing in a lot of our\ncustomers that we're putting this in.\n\n79\n00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:19.010\nAnd then still have T3 lease lines for\nother rural areas.\n\n80\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.771\nAnd then obviously we have the fiber\ncable out here that's going to connect.\n\n81\n00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:25.129\nSo we see a lot of more fiber.\n\n82\n00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.133\nWe have a lot of customers\nwith our wireless and\n\n83\n00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:34.481\nto be able to do a large scale wireless,\nwe need a lot of fiber.\n\n84\n00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:39.279\nSo we install just hundreds of miles\nof fiber before we can put in all\n\n85\n00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.689\nour wireless networks, right.\n\n86\n00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.283\nBut because the wireless has got,\nthe electronics are so\n\n87\n00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:48.065\nmuch better in the radios that we're able\nto get longer distances without worrying\n\n88\n00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:51.610\nabout interference and other things,\nso we're able to overcome that.\n\n89\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.206\nSo it's very viable alternative for\nother WAN technologies.\n\n90\n00:04:55.206 --> 00:05:00.197\nSo looking back a little bit, looking\nback into the past we definitely had\n\n91\n00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:03.191\nsome WAN options of dedicated lease lines.\n\n92\n00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.845\nOver in Europe they're called T1s, E1s.\n\n93\n00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:08.324\nSo T1s, E1s, T3s we definitely got faster.\n\n94\n00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:13.151\nThere's still some use of those and\nthen we have our circuit switch.\n\n95\n00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.719\nPublic switched telephone network,\nISDN, this is also referred to as POTS,\n\n96\n00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.134\nplain old telephone service.\n\n97\n00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.329\nThere's still some of that.\n\n98\n00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.309\nUnfortunately if you are in a rural area,\nand we haven't gotten out there with\n\n99\n00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:27.002\nwireless yet, then you're probably\nstuck with some POTS, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:31.172\nNow frame relay, X.25 ATM,\nreally not much available.\n\n101\n00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:34.321\nTypically, frame relay might\nbe running as a last mile, but\n\n102\n00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:36.743\nyou wouldn't as a customer,\neven know that.\n\n103\n00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:39.759\nIt'll just connect you\nup to your MPLS network.\n\n104\n00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.350\nX.25 and ATM are long gone.\n\n105\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.755\nAnd then broadband VPN.\n\n106\n00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:48.648\nSo typically, I'm not gonna use\nanything listed here today.\n\n107\n00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:52.275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to use some sort of wireless\n\n108\n00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:55.907\nlast mile connective system fiber,\nmetro ethernet and\n\n109\n00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:59.554\nthen if I can't do that then\nI'm gonna end up over here.\n\n110\n00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:01.283\nI'm gonna take my broadband and\n\n111\n00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:04.749\ndo what's called a VPN which\nwe'll talk about in this section.\n\n112\n00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:09.859\nAll right now so on my serial\nthough there still is some of this.\n\n113\n00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:11.319\nI don't have a lot of\ncustomers with it but\n\n114\n00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.086\na couple of people tell me\nthat they still have it.\n\n115\n00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:17.293\nCuz I'll ask If I get any students that\nI teach every once in a while still.\n\n116\n00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.419\nAnd hardly any of them,\nit used to be like five years ago,\n\n117\n00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.322\nnine out of ten raised their hand.\n\n118\n00:06:22.322 --> 00:06:24.713\nNow one out of ten raises their\nhand that they have serial.\n\n119\n00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:27.319\nRight so let's take a look.\n\n120\n00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.371\nSo this is the easiest thing to do\nif you have two Cisco routers right.\n\n121\n00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:36.854\nThen you have a feed out thirty\nfive connection here all right,\n\n122\n00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.895\nconnecting up to CSU/DSU.\n\n123\n00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:42.105\nBut again, the CSU/DSU is typically\ninside the router in a slot but\n\n124\n00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:43.243\nit doesn't have to be.\n\n125\n00:06:43.243 --> 00:06:44.971\nBut in this case here, it's not.\n\n126\n00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.733\nThis provides clocking of the line.\n\n127\n00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:47.975\nI think we talked about that.\n\n128\n00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:51.750\nIf you don't understand that, that is an\nobjective that we have to provide clocking\n\n129\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.460\nfor a non-production environment.\n\n130\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.756\nAll right, that is an objective that\nis in our episode for CISCO IOS.\n\n131\n00:06:57.756 --> 00:07:01.167\nA V.35, so, I am gonna connect over here.\n\n132\n00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.762\nThis is the provider's dedicated link.\n\n133\n00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:05.858\nAll right,\nwe have a dedicated point to point link.\n\n134\n00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:08.760\nSo there are more cost involved\nin something like this but\n\n135\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.156\nreally it's very simple.\n\n136\n00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:11.438\nSo I am gonna come down here.\n\n137\n00:07:11.438 --> 00:07:13.275\nI'm just going to go\ndown here on both sides.\n\n138\n00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:16.885\nI’m going to choose the interface\nthat this connected to and\n\n139\n00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:21.133\nI’m gonna put an IP address in\nthere 172.218.01 this will be\n\n140\n00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:25.626\n172.218.02 we are in the 00\nsubnet here and then no shutdown.\n\n141\n00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:26.953\nBam.\n\n142\n00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:28.842\nIf you have two Cisco routers,\nthis is gonna work.\n\n143\n00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:31.149\nWhat encapsulation are we running Ronnie?\n\n144\n00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.305\nHDLC.\n\n145\n00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:34.188\nYes, Ronnie is correct.\n\n146\n00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:38.694\nI’m gonna say Cisco's so right here\nit actually, I wrote it down there.\n\n147\n00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:40.638\nSo, he was just reading the screen, guys.\n\n148\n00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:41.499\nCome on.\n\n149\n00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:42.488\n>> You better believe it.\n\n150\n00:07:42.488 --> 00:07:44.089\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the Cisco\n\n151\n00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.176\ndefault encapsulation.\n\n152\n00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:49.431\nAnd when we go in to do our lab\nhere in a few minutes, to do PPP,\n\n153\n00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:51.526\ncuz we don't have to do HTLC.\n\n154\n00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:52.645\nIt runs by default.\n\n155\n00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:54.424\nAnd HTLC is awesome.\n\n156\n00:07:54.424 --> 00:07:56.125\nIf you have two Cisco routers,\nleave it alone.\n\n157\n00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.865\nHere's what's awesome about it.\n\n158\n00:07:57.865 --> 00:07:59.171\nIt's featureless.\n\n159\n00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:00.175\nIt does nothing.\n\n160\n00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:03.760\nThere's no, it's connection oriented,\nbut it's This is no overhead, right?\n\n161\n00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.886\nSo it's awesome.\n\n162\n00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:10.899\nBut if you want features like dynamic\nadversary, right, stuff like that.\n\n163\n00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:16.960\nClient for your DSLs, stuff like that,\nthen we're not gonna be able to use HDLC.\n\n164\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.251\nAnyways, two Cisco routers.\n\n165\n00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.008\nIf I don't have two Cisco routers,\n\n166\n00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:24.945\nthen I'd be running something called\npoint to point protocol, which is HDLC.\n\n167\n00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:28.539\nBut it's a non-proprietary\nversion of HDLC.\n\n168\n00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:32.589\nSo it still is HDLC, but on top of it,\nthey put two protocols, okay.\n\n169\n00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.552\nNCP and LCP, and\nwhat those do is provide features.\n\n170\n00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:40.055\nHDLC is featureless,\nwhich makes it awesome, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:44.235\nIt's clean, it's fast, right,\nnow, but it's proprietary, right.\n\n172\n00:08:44.235 --> 00:08:47.285\nBut every vendor has it, so\nif you have two other Junipers or\n\n173\n00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:49.555\nwhatever, they're gonna run HDLC and\nit's proprietary, as well.\n\n174\n00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:54.263\nNow that being said, if I have two,\na Cisco and a non-Cisco, or typically,\n\n175\n00:08:54.263 --> 00:08:59.200\ncuz I want features, like I wanna bundle\nserial links, then I'm gonna run PPP.\n\n176\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.330\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nrun NCP runs and allows me,\n\n177\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.333\nthat's where it says up here.\n\n178\n00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:09.680\nIt allows me to have multiple\nrouted protocols, IP, IPv6,\n\n179\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.196\nacross the same data link, right.\n\n180\n00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:14.400\nSo HDLC is proprietary.\n\n181\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.620\nThe reason it's proprietary is cuz the\nheader that tells us what protocols can go\n\n182\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.640\nacross there.\n\n183\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.840\nAnd so there was nothing that stipulated\nwhat it was, cuz this was derived,\n\n184\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.099\nwhich is another word for stolen.\n\n185\n00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:24.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In our industry,\n\n186\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.076\nwe use the word derived instead of\nstolen and that's really what it is.\n\n187\n00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:30.498\nSo from IBM's STLC, right, so\n\n188\n00:09:30.498 --> 00:09:35.447\nCisco stole it, everyone stole it,\nor I'm sorry, derived it.\n\n189\n00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:36.172\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n190\n00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:38.702\nit's proprietary because there was no,\nyou gotta remember,\n\n191\n00:09:38.702 --> 00:09:40.430\nIBM didn't have a layer 3 network layer.\n\n192\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.127\nSo they had to have a proprietary,\nthat's the history if anybody cares.\n\n193\n00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:49.110\nAnyways, NCP is now\na non-proprietary header, right.\n\n194\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.695\nSo this was created by the ISO,\nright, which created the OSI.\n\n195\n00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:56.208\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then they came out and said,\n\n196\n00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:58.317\nhey let's make a non-proprietary HDLC,\nright.\n\n197\n00:09:58.317 --> 00:10:01.461\nAnyways, so then what's the one\nthat gave us features, though, and\n\n198\n00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:03.740\nthis is what you need to remember.\n\n199\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.760\nIf you ever get asked on the objectives,\nhey,\n\n200\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.500\nwhat gives you, I don't know, compression?\n\n201\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.410\nWhatever, anything.\n\n202\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.420\nWhat gives you something,\nsome sort of feature?\n\n203\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.691\nIt would be the answer is LCP,\nLink Control Protocol.\n\n204\n00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:15.344\nLet's take a look.\n\n205\n00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:19.630\nAll right, so here's\nthe Link Control Protocol right here and\n\n206\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.130\nit sits right above HDLC, so\nwe still have HDLC as i mentioned.\n\n207\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.810\nLCP sits on top of it and says,\nhey, mister HDLC, you're bland,\n\n208\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.420\nyou're vanilla, you're not even\nFrench vanilla, you're a nothing.\n\n209\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.860\nLet me give you some features.\n\n210\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.281\nAnd then NCP says, and\nlet me do a non-proprietary header so\n\n211\n00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:40.060\nwe can run multiple routed protocols, IP\nor IPv6, right, across the same data line.\n\n212\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.360\nNow so the features are, and we're\nactually gonna configure a few of these.\n\n213\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.480\nAnd that is, we're gonna have built-in\nsecurity mechanisms using two terrible\n\n214\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.780\nauthentication mechanisms called PAP and\n\n215\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.940\nCHAP, password authentication protocol\nwhich says, hey, my name's Bob.\n\n216\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.410\nWhat's your name, and is your password\nCisco and it sends it all in clear text.\n\n217\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.700\nAnd they say, yeah, my password's\nCISCO too, now we're authenticated.\n\n218\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.490\nIt's just hello, and we're authenticated,\nso it's pretty pathetic.\n\n219\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.534\nSo it actually was a lot better than the\none we had before, which was we used SLIP,\n\n220\n00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:14.130\nSerial Line IP, right,\nwhich everything was in.\n\n221\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.100\nAnd we had to have a static IP address.\n\n222\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.065\nIf you know what the SLIP is,\nthen you're old too,\n\n223\n00:11:18.065 --> 00:11:19.590\nif you're watching this, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.579\n[LAUGH] So anyway, when we got to PAP that\nwas kind of an upgrade and then they said,\n\n225\n00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:26.924\nwell, let's do challenged\nhandshake authentication protocol,\n\n226\n00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.640\nwhich is a three-way handshake and\nit was encrypted.\n\n227\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.922\nIt was hashed right, but it's an MD5 hash.\n\n228\n00:11:31.922 --> 00:11:36.225\nCapture the hash with a analyzer and\npaste it into Google and\n\n229\n00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:40.712\nthe rainbow table out there will\ngive you the answer, right.\n\n230\n00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:44.152\nIt's pretty simple, but anyways,\nit's a three-way, right, so\n\n231\n00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:47.712\nit's really not a great authentication,\nbut on point to point links,\n\n232\n00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:51.050\nI don't know how much you'd\nworry about that today.\n\n233\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.557\nReally, when these came out,\nwhen we used these is,\n\n234\n00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:55.860\nbecause we're using dial up modems.\n\n235\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.450\nAnd people can dial in and\ndo piggybacking on your modems, right.\n\n236\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.480\nAnd this CHAP stopped that from happening,\n\n237\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.430\nbecause it authenticated at\nthe beginning of the session.\n\n238\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.220\nBut then someone,\nonce you got authenticated,\n\n239\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.390\ncould dial up and get in to your dial\nup session and piggyback on that.\n\n240\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.377\nWell, what happened is, they said every\nonce in a while, we're just gonna stop and\n\n241\n00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:14.870\nre-authenticate again.\n\n242\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.950\nSo that was kind of like ooh,\nwe're really secure now, right.\n\n243\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.215\nAnyways, it gave us compression.\n\n244\n00:12:19.215 --> 00:12:22.499\nI don't use that too much, but\none of the things we're gonna use,\n\n245\n00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:25.208\nit's new in the objectives\nthat started in 2016.\n\n246\n00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:31.002\nMultilink, PPP multilink and then,\nwe can run on point to point links and\n\n247\n00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:36.300\ndial-up and ISDN, right,\nif that means anything to you.\n\n248\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.190\nAnd then, here's the hard part, Ronnie.\n\n249\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.730\nI mean, you guys, this is gonna be tough.\n\n250\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.578\nTo configure PPP,\nyou have to go into the interface.\n\n251\n00:12:44.578 --> 00:12:49.190\nYou have to say global config,\nget into the interface and say encap PPP.\n\n252\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.490\n>> That's it?\n>> I mean that's riveting, right?\n\n253\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.528\nYou guys are like, whoa.\n\n254\n00:12:53.528 --> 00:12:59.410\nAll right, so what happens when I do this,\nright, well, my link goes down, right.\n\n255\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.860\nIn this case here, when we go to our lab,\nI'm running HDLC right now.\n\n256\n00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.170\nWhen I go on my serial links and\ntype PPP on this one end,\n\n257\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.140\nthe link's gonna go down because I have to\nhave matched encapsulations, all right,\n\n258\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.750\nPPP on both sides.\n\n259\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.650\nI can't have HDLC on one side and\nPPP on another.\n\n260\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.070\nSo if I just wanna run PPP and\ndidn't wanna worry about authentication,\n\n261\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.050\nthen this is all I would have to do,\nit's pretty simple, right.\n\n262\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.858\nAnd the reason I would do this above HDLC\nis cuz I want features of some sort,\n\n263\n00:13:24.858 --> 00:13:25.472\nall right.\n\n264\n00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:31.090\nNow [COUGH] to configure it with\nauthentication, it's not that hard.\n\n265\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.856\nIt's just a couple steps.\n\n266\n00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:37.756\nBut we're gonna use that local database\nwe used when we did our SSH lab in\n\n267\n00:13:37.756 --> 00:13:39.770\nthe Managing Cisco iOS.\n\n268\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.980\nSo here's that local database.\n\n269\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.890\nNow what I put in here is the username.\n\n270\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.747\nSo I say username and the name, and\n\n271\n00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:48.286\nthis is gonna be the router that's\ngonna create a data link to me.\n\n272\n00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.460\nAll right,\na point to point data link to me.\n\n273\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.800\nThat's their host name, case sensitive,\nso this is who's coming in to me.\n\n274\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.733\nNow on my corp router,\nI have three serial links coming in.\n\n275\n00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:01.373\nBut one of them is two going to the same\nrouter, so I need two usernames.\n\n276\n00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.727\nOne for San Francisco, one for\n\n277\n00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:04.978\nLA cuz I have to serial port\nto port links coming in.\n\n278\n00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:06.890\nThen I'm gonna type a password.\n\n279\n00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.180\nWell, I'm gonna keep it simple here.\n\n280\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.650\nNow we can encrypt this with the service\npassword encryption but it's clear text,\n\n281\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.050\nif you don't do that.\n\n282\n00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.690\nSo one of the things is, if we take a look\nhere, the very first troubleshooting spot.\n\n283\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.440\nRemember, troubleshooting is half\nyour job, guys, of everything.\n\n284\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.800\nSo once I put in my username,\nmy passwords must match, all right.\n\n285\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.770\nThat's your troubleshooting\nstep number one.\n\n286\n00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.340\nThere's really not a lot here.\n\n287\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.298\nI create a username.\n\n288\n00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:35.390\nIt's got to be case sensitive to\ntheir hostname and then password and\n\n289\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.230\nthen the matching passwords on both sides.\n\n290\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.312\nNow I'm gonna come underneath\nthe interface here and in encap PPP,\n\n291\n00:14:42.312 --> 00:14:43.630\nI turn that on.\n\n292\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.670\nNow I typically don't use pap.\n\n293\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.850\nI don't recommend pap.\n\n294\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.230\nIt is an objective, so I will turn it on.\n\n295\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.110\nBut we'll go ahead and take a look at it.\n\n296\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.070\nI don't like using pap, but\nwe're gonna say PPP authentication chap.\n\n297\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.730\nAnd then, for the objectives you can say,\nwell, if chap fails let's try pap.\n\n298\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.600\nThat's what this says,\ntry chap and then pap.\n\n299\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.960\nAll right, that's the objectives.\n\n300\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.830\nI don't recommend this at all.\n\n301\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.970\nAll right, and\nthis authentication isn't that great,\n\n302\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.830\nwhere I would even bother doing\nit today for the most part.\n\n303\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.750\nBut it is in the objectives.\n\n304\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.750\nNow one other thing on the objectives\nwe're gonna take a look at.\n\n305\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.210\nWe're not gonna run out and do our labs\nquite yet, but in just another slide.\n\n306\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.500\nOne of the things that we're gonna\ndo is debug PPP authentication, and\n\n307\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.030\nwe're gonna watch the CHAP\nauthentication take place, right.\n\n308\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.006\nSo I'm gonna go out there and\nwe're gonna turn on CHAP and\n\n309\n00:15:31.006 --> 00:15:34.360\nwe're gonna watch that three\nway handshake occur, all right.\n\n310\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.832\nAnd remember, the one thing you wanna\nremember about CHAP is it authenticates at\n\n311\n00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:41.338\nthe beginning of the session and\nthen periodically throughout the session.\n\n312\n00:15:41.338 --> 00:15:43.120\nIt doesn't happen all that much.\n\n313\n00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.720\nOne more thing, and\nthen we're gonna do both these labs.\n\n314\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.435\nWe're gonna go turn on PPP.\n\n315\n00:15:47.435 --> 00:15:51.590\nWe're gonna authenticate PPP and then,\nwe're gonna configure Multilink PPP.\n\n316\n00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.924\nNeither of these are hard.\n\n317\n00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:58.831\nOnce you go through it and do the lab,\nthen you're gonna go, okay, I got it.\n\n318\n00:15:58.831 --> 00:16:03.583\nAnd Multilink PPP combines\nmultiple physical links\n\n319\n00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:08.445\ninto a logical bundle Called\na multilink PPP bundle.\n\n320\n00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:10.410\nWe do this for over serial links.\n\n321\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.630\nNow, when after I do this,\n\n322\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.780\nI'm gonna take it off because we got\nother labs we've got to do after this.\n\n323\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.440\nBut I'm gonna then take this off because\nto do multilink PPP you take the IP\n\n324\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.640\naddresses off the interfaces.\n\n325\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.640\nThere's layer two and then we do\na virtual layer three connection.\n\n326\n00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.230\nTo do this, so we create a virtual one and\nthis gives us load balancing over\n\n327\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.490\nmultiple serial links,\nwhich gives us increased redundancy.\n\n328\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.270\nSo, again, this is going to cost more\nmoney because then I have more than one\n\n329\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.780\nlink to the same location.\n\n330\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.210\nBut, you know, we can use that bandwidth.\n\n331\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.010\nAnd then it also uses something\ncalled link fragmentation and\n\n332\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.060\ninterleaving to be able\nto transmit the data.\n\n333\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.710\nThat being said, I'm going to then take\nthis off, and I'm going to turn on EIGRP\n\n334\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.950\nand I'm going to do the same\nthing without configuring PPP.\n\n335\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.470\nI'm gonna show you, it's not an objective,\n\n336\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.870\nbut I just gotta show you\ncuz it's the coolest.\n\n337\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.790\nEIGRP is a very cool routing protocol.\n\n338\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.220\nAnd it's got a lot of features\nthat people don't use, and\n\n339\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.420\none of them is multi-linking, all right?\n\n340\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.580\nSo I'm just gonna show that to\nyou real quick because I can.\n\n341\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.860\nAll right, so before we go out there,\n\n342\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.800\ncuz there's actually another thing,\nwe're gonna stay with the PPP.\n\n343\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.780\nAnd this is the PPPoE client,\nokay, so you can use\n\n344\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.960\nthis in your corporation if you've got\nsome sort of DSL coming in here, right?\n\n345\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.770\nWe've got Dslam coming in and we're\ngoing to connect up to the router and\n\n346\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.950\nwe're gonna make this a PPPoE client.\n\n347\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.220\nWe're gonna configure this interface and\nnow instead\n\n348\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.870\nof having just one host connected here,\nnow I can connect this from my business or\n\n349\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.650\nmy home, where I can connect\nmultiple PCs on the ethernet segment\n\n350\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.370\nthat is connected to the Cisco IOS,\nwhich is acting as the client.\n\n351\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.860\nOkay, so let's go ahead, and we're going\nto go ahead and take a look at that now.\n\n352\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.500\nSo, the first thing that I'm going\nto do is I'm going to run out here,\n\n353\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.750\nand I'm going to bring these up, and\nI'm going to go ahead and start with the,\n\n354\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.410\nhopefully I'm still logged into these\nguys, I'm gonna run out here and\n\n355\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.790\nI'm gonna go do the San Francisco and\nLA routers.\n\n356\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.510\nWell, let's look at my drawings so\nyou guys make sure you understand this.\n\n357\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.500\nOkay, so you can see I have three\nserial links, two between Corp and LA.\n\n358\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500\nI've got my IPv4 and my IPv6 configured.\n\n359\n00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.170\nSo I've got my San Francisco\nsingle link and dual links here.\n\n360\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.170\nAnd then we'll do multi-link PPP over\nhere and multi-link with EIGRP as well.\n\n361\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.020\nAll right, and so let's go and\nthen we'll build a PPPoE client.\n\n362\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.650\nAll right, so first off, let's just\ngo turn on PPP and then we'll do\n\n363\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.950\nauthentication and then we'll do\nmulti-link PPP and then build the client.\n\n364\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.150\nThis won't take long at all.\n\n365\n00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.302\nOkay, so\nI'll start up here in San Francisco,\n\n366\n00:18:42.302 --> 00:18:46.700\nconfig t, so I'm using serial 000.\n\n367\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.020\n000, I think I said\nthe right amount of zeros.\n\n368\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.410\nSo I'm gonna say interface s0/0/0,\ncap to keep it easy guys.\n\n369\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.830\nFirst off, let me do this.\n\n370\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.000\nDo show run,\nI think I should be able to do this.\n\n371\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.540\nInclude or begin,\nI think either one would work.\n\n372\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.790\nHopefully this works, shoot.\n\n373\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.360\nDo show run,\nI wanna show you guys something.\n\n374\n00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:16.135\nOkay, there's my serial 0/0/0,\nit's the only one I'm using.\n\n375\n00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:21.540\nNotice I have my IP address and\nmy IPv6 address on there.\n\n376\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.320\nWhat, it doesn't say I'm running HDLC.\n\n377\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.098\nSo I must be running,\nI don't know, ATM, frame relay?\n\n378\n00:19:29.098 --> 00:19:30.760\n[LAUGH] Okay,\n\n379\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.570\nif a Cisco router says nothing under\na serial interface, you're running HDLC.\n\n380\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:40.248\nAll right, so I can see this with\nthe do show interface s0/0/0, and\n\n381\n00:19:40.248 --> 00:19:44.402\nit's gonna say right here,\nway up here, encapsulation HDLC.\n\n382\n00:19:44.402 --> 00:19:46.951\nSo if you look at the running config and\nit says nothing,\n\n383\n00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:49.540\nthen you know you're running HDLC.\n\n384\n00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.710\nAnd notice there's nothing else here.\n\n385\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.470\nWhen I get to PPP,\n\n386\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.160\nyou're gonna see other things there\nbecause I have features, right?\n\n387\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.090\nSo it's got goals, this has nothing.\n\n388\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.560\nThis doesn't do anything,\nwhich makes it awesome.\n\n389\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.640\nSo I'm in serial 0/0 and\nI'm just gonna say, encap ppp.\n\n390\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.260\nAnd this should not go\ndown if I have logging on.\n\n391\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.420\nThere we go.\n\n392\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.650\nSo I'm going to go down.\n\n393\n00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.830\nAnd that's all I have to do over here.\n\n394\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.280\nI haven't done authentication yet.\n\n395\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.570\nSo let's go over to LA,\nwe were in San Francisco.\n\n396\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.315\nAnd we got two serial links here,\ninterface s0/1/0.\n\n397\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.370\nAnd if we did a do show run and\nshow interface, we'd see the same thing.\n\n398\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.405\nThey all run on PPP cuz\nI never touched them.\n\n399\n00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:35.485\nEncap ppp interface F 0/2/0,\nup arrow twice,\n\n400\n00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:40.410\nencap PPP and we just wait for\nthe fun to start, the fireworks.\n\n401\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.080\nThe phone starts ringing, San Francisco\nand LA are down now, what are we gonna do?\n\n402\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.520\nWell I can bring them up pretty quickly.\n\n403\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.610\nSo I turned EIGRP on here,\njust to keep my network running.\n\n404\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.590\nSo all my links are down and\nEIGRP is complaining to me.\n\n405\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.405\nInterface S,\nI've got three interfaces to do here.\n\n406\n00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:04.083\nEncap ppp, interface s0/1/0.\n\n407\n00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.883\nI did 2 0, but that's fine.\n\n408\n00:21:05.883 --> 00:21:08.902\nEncap ppp, interface s0/1/0.\n\n409\n00:21:11.388 --> 00:21:12.909\nOkay, encap ppp.\n\n410\n00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:18.030\nAll right, so\nlet's give it a second to come up.\n\n411\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.310\nIt doesn't take very long, and\nthen EIGRP is done as well.\n\n412\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.960\nAll right, so pretty simple.\n\n413\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.940\nDo show interface,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n414\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.850\nDo show run.\n\n415\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.990\nWe can do a begin serial interface.\n\n416\n00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:39.370\nAnd, now we can see that we're running,\nhere's our serial, ip4, ipv6 address.\n\n417\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.730\nI have my clock rate cuz I'm DCE,\n\n418\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.890\nand you can see if you're DCE with\nthe show controllers command.\n\n419\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.030\nThat's an objective, don't forget this.\n\n420\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.630\nAnd then encap ppp.\n\n421\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.740\nLet me stop that because if\nyou have a serial objective,\n\n422\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.040\none of the things is is where\nyou put your clock rate.\n\n423\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.740\nDo show controllers, now, don't ever\ntype do show controllers, enter, or\n\n424\n00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.020\nyou just won't understand it.\n\n425\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:05.220\nSo we'll take a look here, and I'll\nsee right away, oops, that right here,\n\n426\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.750\nDCE V.35, right?\n\n427\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.720\nSo if you see a DCE end,\nthat means you need clock rate.\n\n428\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.920\nIf you see that in production,\nyou've got a serious problem.\n\n429\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.200\nGet a PO and give me a call.\n\n430\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.498\nI will come and fix it for you.\n\n431\n00:22:16.498 --> 00:22:17.491\nJust kidding.\n\n432\n00:22:17.491 --> 00:22:19.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you ever see that,\n\n433\n00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.800\nyou've got a problem.\n\n434\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.060\nAll right, all right, that being said,\nI gotta do, did I do all my interfaces?\n\n435\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.207\nYeah, I think we should all be up, right?\n\n436\n00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:24.963\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n437\n00:22:24.963 --> 00:22:28.610\n>> Do show IP route.\n\n438\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.280\nSee if I see all my networks.\n\n439\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.990\nYeah, we've got two to network 20\nbecause the network 20 is off of LA and\n\n440\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.510\nwe have two links over there.\n\n441\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.921\nAll right, we've got network ten,\nwhich is off of San Francisco.\n\n442\n00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:43.345\nI've got all my WAN links, I've got\ntwo of them off of serial 0/1/0/2.\n\n443\n00:22:43.345 --> 00:22:45.459\nWe are looking good.\n\n444\n00:22:45.459 --> 00:22:49.730\nSo if I come over here to,\nlets take a look here.\n\n445\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.760\nI am in LA.\n\n446\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.570\nShow IP route.\n\n447\n00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.650\nAnd I should have two links to all my\nremote networks because I have two WAN\n\n448\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.210\nlinks to the corp.\n\n449\n00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:05.220\nSo to get to network 10, which is off\nthe corp, there's two ways to get there,\n\n450\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.590\noff of serials 0/0/1 and 0/0/2.\n\n451\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:11.853\nTo get to 172.16.10, which is the far\nWAN link connecting San Francisco,\n\n452\n00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:14.163\nand that's a loopback right there.\n\n453\n00:23:14.163 --> 00:23:18.584\nBut anyways, 192.168.10 is the LAN\noff of San Francisco as well.\n\n454\n00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:20.540\nAll right, so we're looking good,\nlooks like we're up.\n\n455\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.230\nIf I did a show run and\nthen a show int, check this out.\n\n456\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.762\nLet's go look for some features, 1 0.\n\n457\n00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:33.820\nSo we're gonna see a little bit more here,\nso I have my maximum transmission.\n\n458\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.600\nHere's my encapsulation PPP,\nlink control protocol is open.\n\n459\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.370\nAnd then over here, check this out,\nhere's my NCP line.\n\n460\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.280\nIPCP, right, that's the header for\nmy NCP for IP.\n\n461\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.400\nIPV6 and CDP,\nthese are the three protocols\n\n462\n00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.690\nthat we're negotiating to run\nacross those data links from NCP.\n\n463\n00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.140\nAll right, so we can see right here,\nnow we don't have any authentication, but\n\n464\n00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.023\nwe are running PPP.\n\n465\n00:23:57.023 --> 00:24:00.726\nNow if you fail authentication this is\ngonna say right here listening, listening.\n\n466\n00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:03.706\nIt's gonna listen for a while, and then\nit's gonna just come back and say closed.\n\n467\n00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:05.173\nSo it's gonna try,\nit's gonna listen, listen, listen.\n\n468\n00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:08.302\nSo that's a good indication\nthat authentication filed.\n\n469\n00:24:08.302 --> 00:24:12.820\nAll right, so\nlets come back over here and so\n\n470\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.440\nwe're in, I have to come back here and\ncreate a user name.\n\n471\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.640\nSo lets create authentication.\n\n472\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.230\nSo, I'm gonna create my user to corp.\n\n473\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.160\nSo I'm gonna say user name and\n\n474\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.630\nI'm looking at what I'm\nconnected to down here is corp.\n\n475\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.310\nC O R P.\n\n476\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.930\nPassword cisco, lower case,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n477\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.440\nI am just going to type that in.\n\n478\n00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.530\nThat is all I need here and then I'm going\nto go back to my 0 0 0 which connects to\n\n479\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.210\ncorp and I'm already running PPP.\n\n480\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.210\nNow I just have to add\nmy authentication PPP\n\n481\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.330\nauthentication and then,\nis that right ppp authentication?\n\n482\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.700\n>> You have to spell it out though.\n\n483\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.935\n>> Yeah, I think.\n>> You have to spell out authentication.\n\n484\n00:24:54.935 --> 00:24:57.010\n[LAUGH] I don't know why.\n\n485\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.060\n>> Sharp, and then pop.\n\n486\n00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.200\nYeah, it did make it.\n\n487\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.740\nIt did do it.\n\n488\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.720\nI thought that was right.\n\n489\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.370\nNow, it's trying to authenticate.\n\n490\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.270\nIt's trying.\n\n491\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.750\nSo let's go down to corp and take a look\nat that, but it's not, it's gonna fail.\n\n492\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.080\nSo notice it's down.\n\n493\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.650\nAll right.\n\n494\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.200\nSo it came up and\nsaid one size is trying to authenticate.\n\n495\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.110\nSo before I do this, debug, ppp off.\n\n496\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.062\nDebug ppp authentication shows\nme my chap authentication.\n\n497\n00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:25.060\nAll right, so\nyou can see there's a challenge.\n\n498\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.420\nNo other authorization, authorization\nrequires, so you see we're failing.\n\n499\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.380\nSo I have to come under here to config T,\nsee if I can do this, logging sync.\n\n500\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.668\nThat's gonna, no.\n\n501\n00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:42.140\n[LAUGH] I spelled something wrong,\nlog in synchronous.\n\n502\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.630\nI was trying to spell it, and\nI didn't do a no IP domain lookup.\n\n503\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:47.590\n>> There you go.\n\n504\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.110\n>> No IP domain lookup, I want that gone.\n\n505\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.765\nAnd then, I want logging synchronous,\nsync Link.\n\n506\n00:25:55.765 --> 00:25:56.515\nWhat am I missing?\n\n507\n00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:58.335\nI have to put that under the console.\n\n508\n00:25:58.335 --> 00:25:58.955\nHold on.\n\n509\n00:25:58.955 --> 00:25:59.715\nLine console 0.\n\n510\n00:25:59.715 --> 00:26:01.050\nI'm gonna take the time to do this.\n\n511\n00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n512\n00:26:03.975 --> 00:26:05.385\nSo It think I typed that in right.\n\n513\n00:26:05.385 --> 00:26:10.695\nYes, because now if you look, the messages\nare coming above what I'm typing.\n\n514\n00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:12.670\nLogging synchronous is your friend.\n\n515\n00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I did no IP domain, no lookup.\n\n516\n00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:18.070\nWhen I'm in production I do\nno IP domain look up way, and\n\n517\n00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.770\nthen logging synching\nsome of the console line.\n\n518\n00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.809\nNow you can see I can type\nwhile I can see what's going\n\n519\n00:26:25.809 --> 00:26:31.755\non/ I'm gonna type\nusername (San Francisco),\n\n520\n00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:36.060\nPassword (Cisco) lowercase, Okay.\n\n521\n00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.370\nI've got the username, password in there.\n\n522\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.380\nWe're still having problems,\nlooks like it liked that.\n\n523\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.750\nIt says, Using hostname, Using password.\n\n524\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.860\nIt liked it, even though I didn't\ntell it to do authentication\n\n525\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.050\nbecause it came in and said,\nyou've got the right credentials now,\n\n526\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and authenticate you.\n\n527\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.900\nEven though I didn't tell it that\nwe were doing authentication.\n\n528\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:02.830\nNow I'm gonna do username LA,\npassword cisco.\n\n529\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.390\nOkay.\n\n530\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.410\nSo, I'm gonna go under and do it,\nbut we are definitely authenticated.\n\n531\n00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:14.430\nBut I'm still gonna go under my interfaces\nand say ppp authentication chap pa.\n\n532\n00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:22.040\nSo now it's going out there and\ntrying to authenticate from me to them and\n\n533\n00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.370\nthat it did do, IP ID6 as well.\n\n534\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.580\nSo now let's do this.\n\n535\n00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.530\nDo show interface S000 and\nso encapsulation\n\n536\n00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.020\nI'm going to ahead and\nput a wrong password on LA.\n\n537\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.820\nSo we can see what happens\nwhen you don't have that.\n\n538\n00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.520\nThis is a pretty good-sized objective,\nenough for\n\n539\n00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.600\nus to spend this amount of time on it.\n\n540\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.240\nSo, I've got here and then I've\ngot to go do the other interfaces.\n\n541\n00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.530\nOne, zero, and interface s-zero, and\n\n542\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.430\nthat's going to bring those guys down so\nthey're going to start complaining to me.\n\n543\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.400\nSo now LA is unhappy, but anyone in\nLA is always unhappy aren't they?\n\n544\n00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.670\nI would be if I lived there.\n\n545\n00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.820\nI lived there for ten years,\nI have the right to complain about them.\n\n546\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.460\nAlright, so,\n\n547\n00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.624\nit looks like we're down, I better do\nthis if I want to get anything done.\n\n548\n00:28:16.624 --> 00:28:23.388\nNo ip domain look\n\n549\n00:28:23.388 --> 00:28:30.210\nin line con 0 logging sync.\n\n550\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:30.810\nOkay, good.\n\n551\n00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.200\nSo I'm gonna say, and this is gonna\nstop corp from complaining right away.\n\n552\n00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.380\nCorp password.\n\n553\n00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.850\nLet's put in the wrong\npassword because it's fun.\n\n554\n00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:40.430\nLet's make it Todd.\n\n555\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.250\nThat's what it should\nbe in the first place.\n\n556\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:49.120\nSo it's gonna come down there and\nfail, definitely went down.\n\n557\n00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.000\nAll right, but anyway,\nCorp's still complaining.\n\n558\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000\nHe's down.\n\n559\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.295\nAnd then I'm gonna go\nunderneath these interfaces\n\n560\n00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.598\n1/0 PPP, authentication.\n\n561\n00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:04.529\nChap.\nSee if it takes it if I just do,\n\n562\n00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:05.700\nI didn't type it in enough.\n\n563\n00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.200\nHave to do.\n\n564\n00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.220\n>> Authen, at least, yeah.\n\n565\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.420\n>> Yeah, like that.\n\n566\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.074\nAnd then int s0/2/0.\n\n567\n00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.640\nOkay.\n\n568\n00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.620\nSo I got those all set so when the\npasswords wrong over here, which we know.\n\n569\n00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:26.388\nSo let's come over here and see,\nboy this guy is really unhappy.\n\n570\n00:29:26.388 --> 00:29:30.750\n[LAUGH]\nAll right.\n\n571\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.675\nI'm not even going to be\nable to see it on this guy.\n\n572\n00:29:32.675 --> 00:29:35.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> You see the word failure.\n\n573\n00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.750\nThat's the key.\n\n574\n00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.810\n>> He's failing.\n\n575\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:38.850\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n576\n00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.270\nDo show Interface says 010.\n\n577\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.170\nOkay and we're gonna see,\nit should say listening if I'm right.\n\n578\n00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.150\nEncapsulation PPP LCP closing.\n\n579\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.050\nSo I didn't get it listening at the time.\n\n580\n00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.720\nIt says LCP is closing, listen for a while\nnow, it says hey look I give all ready.\n\n581\n00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.240\nRight.\nSo I didn't even get it in time.\n\n582\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.390\nAll right, so\nwe can see what happened there.\n\n583\n00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.038\nSo I'm gonna come back up here to\nusername and see if I can get it.\n\n584\n00:30:04.038 --> 00:30:11.134\nUsername, password, Cisco, and\nlet's see how fast she comes back up.\n\n585\n00:30:13.038 --> 00:30:13.600\nSuccess.\n\n586\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.440\n[LAUGH] It's like I'm happy.\n\n587\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.730\nResponse, pass.\n\n588\n00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.950\nSo it isn't in a hash, but it's okay.\n\n589\n00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:28.410\nSo now he's all happy,\nthey're stopping to complain 1.0.\n\n590\n00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:33.550\nAnd we're gonna see that IP,\nsee there's my LCP is open.\n\n591\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.720\nAnd NCP and my protocols are negotiated.\n\n592\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.260\nSo we're up and\nrunning with authentication.\n\n593\n00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.730\nThere is one thing I don't\nrecommend using PAP.\n\n594\n00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.490\nBut if you do, there was something\non the objectives I wanna show you.\n\n595\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.290\nAnd that is if I'm under the interface and\n\n596\n00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.160\nI can't get to the other side and\nI wanna authenticate anyways.\n\n597\n00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:02.420\nSo if I did this int s0/1/0\n\n598\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.766\nI could type PPP pap.\n\n599\n00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:10.069\nSent username.\n\n600\n00:31:10.069 --> 00:31:18.090\nI just say the username is LA and\nthen password cisco.\n\n601\n00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:23.410\nWithout configuring the other side\nwith pap I can authenticate from here.\n\n602\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.910\nWhy not?\nIt is sent in clear text anyways.\n\n603\n00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.770\nWe are going to make them authenticate and\nwe are going to be able to do a local\n\n604\n00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:33.590\nauthentication without having\nto go out to the other side.\n\n605\n00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.350\nI am not recommending this, but I need\nto remember this for the objectives.\n\n606\n00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.500\nIt is new in the objectives.\n\n607\n00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.570\nWhy would they have anything for pap?\n\n608\n00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.560\nThat is beyond me.\n\n609\n00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.930\nLet's do one more thing and\nthen we'll break up this episode.\n\n610\n00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.120\nAnd then, we'll come back and do tunneling\nand BGP, but I wanna do multi-length PPP.\n\n611\n00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.850\nAll right so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n612\n00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.584\nSo I'm gonna do this between Corp and LA.\n\n613\n00:31:53.584 --> 00:31:57.488\nSo the first I wanna do on Corp, these\nguys are gonna freak out when I do this,\n\n614\n00:31:57.488 --> 00:32:00.909\nall right, but we got our logging\nsynchronous on and everything.\n\n615\n00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:04.903\nSo I'm going to come under here and\nI'm going to say, config t, and\n\n616\n00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:07.380\nthis is how we do it, pretty simple.\n\n617\n00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.630\nAnd I'm going to create int multilink one.\n\n618\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:15.477\nI'm just going to use one, I can use,\nlet's see what numbers we can use, Ronnie,\n\n619\n00:32:15.477 --> 00:32:17.296\n1 to 2.1 billion, right.\n\n620\n00:32:17.296 --> 00:32:19.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Knock yourself out.\n\n621\n00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.150\nI'm just gonna say 1, does that sound good\nand I'm going to make up an address here.\n\n622\n00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:32.350\nIP address 10.1.1.1, and\nthen I'll put one on the other side.\n\n623\n00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.500\nI'm just going to use a slash 24.\n\n624\n00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:41.825\nOkay, so let's go up to LA and\ndo the same thing.\n\n625\n00:32:41.825 --> 00:32:48.778\nMulti-link one, no such thing as MU1,\nIP address 10.1.1.2.\n\n626\n00:32:48.778 --> 00:32:53.010\nThis is a logical interface,\nI'm not in the physical ones.\n\n627\n00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.441\nI'm going to say PPP Multilink,\nso now I am saying,\n\n628\n00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:01.170\nhey this interface is a PPP Multilink.\n\n629\n00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:06.962\nI brought in PPP and then,\nso I am under my interface\n\n630\n00:33:06.962 --> 00:33:13.580\nmultilink one do 'show run mu one no,\ndidn't like that.\n\n631\n00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.087\nDo 'show run'...\n\n632\n00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.810\nLet's go find my multilink.\n\n633\n00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.950\nOkay, there's my multilink bundle name.\n\n634\n00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:30.570\nThere's my usernames and\nthere was my multilink.\n\n635\n00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.278\nAll right, so there's 10.1.1.1 and\n10.1.1.2 on the other side.\n\n636\n00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:34.822\nAnd now,\n\n637\n00:33:34.822 --> 00:33:39.601\nI'm going to take the ip addresses off of\nthe actual physical interfaces, right.\n\n638\n00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:43.043\nSo I'm going to go to the interface,\nsay no IP address and\n\n639\n00:33:43.043 --> 00:33:45.140\ntell them I'm part of this group.\n\n640\n00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.986\nSo I'm 1011 on this side,\n10112 on the other.\n\n641\n00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:54.799\nWe're part of multi group one, so\nlet's go down to interface 010 and\n\n642\n00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.959\n20 here and remove the IP addresses.\n\n643\n00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:06.711\nSo I'm going to say #int s0/1/0,\n#no ip address and\n\n644\n00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:12.987\nthen, I'm goin gto say #ppp multilink and\n#ppp.\n\n645\n00:34:12.987 --> 00:34:19.043\nI got to turn off my debugging,\nbecause CHAP's freaking out,\n\n646\n00:34:19.043 --> 00:34:22.941\n#ppp multilink link group one, okay.\n\n647\n00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:25.930\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n648\n00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:26.710\nLet me do un-debug all.\n\n649\n00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.700\nI don't want to see this anymore.\n\n650\n00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.050\nDo undebug all, okay.\n\n651\n00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.000\nLet's do a do show run and take a look at\nour config one more time and believe it or\n\n652\n00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.442\nnot, we're almost done.\n\n653\n00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:39.579\nSo, I'm just not going to.\n\n654\n00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:43.120\nThere's my multilink and then,\n\n655\n00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.390\nunder my interface here,\nI did serial 1, 0.\n\n656\n00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:51.800\nWe've got ppp authentication, that's\nfine but ppp multilink and multilink,\n\n657\n00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.720\ngroup one.\n\n658\n00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.986\nAnd now, I'm going to do that under\nthe other one, so, interface s020.\n\n659\n00:34:55.986 --> 00:35:00.920\nNo IP address, okay and\n\n660\n00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.810\nthen, say ppp multilink and\n\n661\n00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:09.040\nppp multilink group one.\n\n662\n00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.200\nThat's all I have to do, but\nI have to do this on the other sid,e so\n\n663\n00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.720\nwe're definitely down.\n\n664\n00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.050\nSo, I'm going to come over here to my two\nserial interfaces, so interface s0/1/0.\n\n665\n00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:23.626\nI wasn't sure where I was at, so say,\n\n666\n00:35:23.626 --> 00:35:29.040\nno ip address, ppp multi Multi Ppp.\n\n667\n00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.360\nI think I typed it in right.\n\n668\n00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.631\nMultilink and multilink, group one,\n\n669\n00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:41.220\ninterface S zero two zero,\n\n670\n00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.430\nmultilink and multilink group one.\n\n671\n00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:51.190\nSo with that being said,\nwe should be up and running and\n\n672\n00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.040\nwe can see that it's coming up.\n\n673\n00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.840\nBut we'll have to do some\nverifications to verify this, so\n\n674\n00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.810\nlet's do show ip route and\nlet's see what we see.\n\n675\n00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.440\nSee if I see my links in here, so I can\ndefinitely see my multi links in here.\n\n676\n00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.510\nSo I've got 10 1 and 10 2,\nthey're both directly connected in there.\n\n677\n00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:12.120\nAnd then,\nI want to do show ppp multi link,\n\n678\n00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:17.960\nokay And\nwe can see that the bundle name is corp.\n\n679\n00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.980\nThat's the one it came from and\nthe local username is LA and\n\n680\n00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.550\nI have two links in here.\n\n681\n00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:28.232\nI have no inactive, so\nlet's come down here and almost done guys.\n\n682\n00:36:28.232 --> 00:36:36.540\nGot to be able to do this,\nshow PPP Multi, and we got two in there.\n\n683\n00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:42.420\nSo, if I was to come in here and say,\ninterface S020 and shut that down.\n\n684\n00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.370\nBecause I still have a bundle,\nso my link is up and running.\n\n685\n00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.760\nMy routing's still working,\neven though I've lost that and then,\n\n686\n00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.210\nI come over here and\nsay, show PPP multilink.\n\n687\n00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.730\nI can see this one is inactive now but\nmy bundle is still up.\n\n688\n00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:57.910\nThis is why we do this.\n\n689\n00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.790\nWe bundle two serial links.\n\n690\n00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.310\nAll right, so a couple more things,\nguys I want to show you.\n\n691\n00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.070\nSo I'm going to do no shot here, okay.\n\n692\n00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.620\nSo now, I have my links up there.\n\n693\n00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:13.520\nI want to do a PPP client, but before I\ndo, I want to show you EIGRP real quick.\n\n694\n00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.750\nSo, what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to go into these interfaces and\n\n695\n00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.420\ntake off multilink.\n\n696\n00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.340\nAlright, so\nthis is going to take just a quick second.\n\n697\n00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.050\nSo do show run and then, I'll just\nfigure out what I have to take off.\n\n698\n00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.110\nI can leave my virtual interface there,\nthe multilink interface, so\n\n699\n00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.720\nthere it is there.\n\n700\n00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.470\nI've got serial one zero and\n\n701\n00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.755\ntwo zero here, so all I have to\ndo is come in here, config T.\n\n702\n00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:39.920\nI'm already there,\ninterface [LAUGH] and say no PPP\n\n703\n00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.490\nand no group one, okay.\n\n704\n00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.910\nInterface, no and\n\n705\n00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:56.560\nno, okay, so it bundles down.\n\n706\n00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.080\nBig deal.\nSo I want to put my IP addresses on two\n\n707\n00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.240\nagain, so I'm going to put\nthem back where they were.\n\n708\n00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.727\nIP address 172.16.10.89.\n\n709\n00:38:08.727 --> 00:38:13.344\nYeah and interface SR one zero,\nit's an IP address,\n\n710\n00:38:13.344 --> 00:38:16.660\n.5, because I'm in the 4 subnet.\n\n711\n00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.490\nOkay, so done on corp.\n\n712\n00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.100\nPretty fast.\n\n713\n00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.590\nBack to where we were, all right.\n\n714\n00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.236\nSo come up here real quick, show run.\n\n715\n00:38:29.362 --> 00:38:31.070\nOkay, so there's my multi-link.\n\n716\n00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.970\nI can just leave that there.\n\n717\n00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.522\nI just want to take it off the interfaces,\nright.\n\n718\n00:38:34.522 --> 00:38:36.719\nAnd I config t-\n\n719\n00:38:42.535 --> 00:38:48.320\nNo ppp multi-link and\n\n720\n00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.106\nno ppp multi-group,\n\n721\n00:38:54.106 --> 00:38:57.530\none, okay.\n\n722\n00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.650\nInterface S zero two zero, okay\n\n723\n00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.890\nand then, IP address 1721610.10.\n\n724\n00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:13.620\nSo i'm putting them back to where they\nwere and then, interface s010.5.6 and\n\n725\n00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:20.550\nwe should be back to where we were.\n\n726\n00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:25.650\nThat was fun, 172.16.10.6 so\n\n727\n00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.340\nwe got multilength working, took it back,\nand we should be up and running.\n\n728\n00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.520\nShould be, let's take a look.\n\n729\n00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.660\n>> Now Todd,\nbefore you go onto EIGRP here.\n\n730\n00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.460\nOn the multilink,\n\n731\n00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.920\nthose IP addresses that you set on\nthat multilink that you created,\n\n732\n00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.460\ndoes it matter in the network scheme\nyou can pick any address that you want?\n\n733\n00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.130\n>> Yeah, I picked a one we weren't using.\n\n734\n00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.760\n>> Right.\n>> I could have reused these.\n\n735\n00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.270\n>> Okay.\n>> It's just one subnet.\n\n736\n00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.710\nI was using two different subnets,\nso I just got rid of those two and\n\n737\n00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.420\ncreated a new ten network.\n\n738\n00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.390\nAnd just make sure that ten\nnetwork is your routing protocol.\n\n739\n00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.551\nIf we take a look here we can\nsee I'm back up and running.\n\n740\n00:39:58.551 --> 00:40:01.682\nI've got my EIGRP just\npicked everything back.\n\n741\n00:40:01.682 --> 00:40:03.187\nWe're right back where we were.\n\n742\n00:40:03.187 --> 00:40:05.865\nAll right, so\nEIGRP is running check this out So I know\n\n743\n00:40:05.865 --> 00:40:09.630\nI put everything back the way it was\ncuz I wanted to make sure it's working.\n\n744\n00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.340\nBut I'm gonna change it again.\n\n745\n00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.370\nSo now I have,\nlet's go back to my drawing here.\n\n746\n00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.430\nI wanna show you guys something.\n\n747\n00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.270\nThis is above the objectives, boy.\n\n748\n00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.820\nI know.\nI hate to show you something above\n\n749\n00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.580\nthe objectives.\n\n750\n00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.050\nSo if you're just taking your exam,\nyou can just turn it off right now, right?\n\n751\n00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.970\nAnd come back when we're doing our VPN's.\n\n752\n00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.210\nAnyways on this right here over here what\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna make this one\n\n753\n00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.430\nsubnet just like we did with multi\nlink I'm just gonna use the 172 216 10\n\n754\n00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:36.280\n0 subnet, and I'm gonna use the slash\n29 because that gives us 6 hosts so\n\n755\n00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.360\nI'm gonna put one, two, three four.\n\n756\n00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.030\nSo I'm gonna put these guys in the same\nsubnet, now you can't do this.\n\n757\n00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.830\nA router doesn't let you put two\ninterfaces in the same subnet however on\n\n758\n00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.430\nwan links I can if I have EIGRP on first.\n\n759\n00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.510\nSo if I go and\ntry to put this guy in sub net zero and\n\n760\n00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.160\nthis guy in sub net zero over here,\nit's going to say overlaps, right?\n\n761\n00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.240\nIf I have EIGRP running and\nyou're arterial says,\n\n762\n00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.060\nI wonder if he's trying to do bundling and\nit allows you to do it.\n\n763\n00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.150\nSo you're gonna say let's\nput this guy in one sub net.\n\n764\n00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.790\nAnd I could even leave that running\nbecause I can, because it's fun.\n\n765\n00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.580\nSo I'm gonna come under LA at,\nwell, let's do corp.\n\n766\n00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.820\nAnd we're gonna take those\ntwo serial interfaces and\n\n767\n00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.770\nwe'll make them 172.16.10, 1 and 10, 2.\n\n768\n00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.460\nNow most the time, routers are gonna\nscream and say you can't do this.\n\n769\n00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.938\nAnd on the exam,\nyou can never do this, all right.\n\n770\n00:41:19.938 --> 00:41:22.890\nSo interface s/0/1/0 now you know,\n\n771\n00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.630\nI just typed that in because\nI didn't know where we were.\n\n772\n00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.110\nI'm gonna change the address.\n\n773\n00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:32.910\nFirst off, let me go to interface S0000\nbecause that's in the zero subhead, okay?\n\n774\n00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.020\nSo I'm gonna say no IP address and\nshut down.\n\n775\n00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.660\nAnd we just shut down San Francisco.\n\n776\n00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:48.170\nAnyways interface S zero one zero,\nIP address 1721610.1.\n\n777\n00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.300\nAnd we're gonna do a 248 mask,\ngives us a block size of eight six host,\n\n778\n00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.470\nwe just need four.\n\n779\n00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.570\nOkay and\nthen interface S zero one two zero.\n\n780\n00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.260\nOkay.\n\n781\n00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.420\nAnd then we're gonna put this\nguy in dot two, see if he.\n\n782\n00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.840\nSee, do you notice that\nwe didn't get overlap.\n\n783\n00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.330\nBecause I had GRP running,\n\n784\n00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.180\nand because I'm on serials it says,\nwell let me see what he's doing.\n\n785\n00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.570\nYou're not supposed to do that, right?\n\n786\n00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.720\nDid I put him in the same subnet?\n\n787\n00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.230\nI did, he's dot one and\ndot two on two different interfaces now.\n\n788\n00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.230\nOkay?\n\n789\n00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.970\nNow, let's go over here to LA net and\nmake him dot three and dot four.\n\n790\n00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.232\nSo I'm gonna say config\nt interface s0/1/0.\n\n791\n00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:27.294\nOkay, got it.\n\n792\n00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:30.940\nIp address 172.16.10.3.\n\n793\n00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.520\nOkay 248.\n\n794\n00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.650\nSo he's dot 3.\n\n795\n00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:42.920\nAnd then interface s0/2/0 and dot four.\n\n796\n00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.319\nSo we did one two three four.\n\n797\n00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.420\nWow, didn't get an error or anything.\n\n798\n00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.420\nAnd as a matter fact, bada bing bada boom.\n\n799\n00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.520\nEIGRP comes up.\n\n800\n00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.120\nI gotta be honest with you guys.\n\n801\n00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.760\nI like this a lot better than PPP.\n\n802\n00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.690\nIf I'm in a customer, I can do this.\n\n803\n00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:58.910\nI can control it more.\n\n804\n00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.810\nPPP loses its connection and\n\n805\n00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.180\nit just, it's not,\nI don't think it works as well as this.\n\n806\n00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.440\nThis is my personal opinion.\n\n807\n00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.000\nI obviously don't speak for\nCISCO even though I'm wearing their shirt.\n\n808\n00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.560\nI don't work for Cisco or\nspeak for them in any way.\n\n809\n00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.760\nI like EIGRP bundling than PPP but\nif you don't have two Cisco hours,\n\n810\n00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.910\nyou can't do this, right.\n\n811\n00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.320\nSo do show IP route.\n\n812\n00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.120\nLet's see if it worked.\n\n813\n00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.710\nAnd there's I've got Serial 01020.\n\n814\n00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.810\nI've got my connections.\n\n815\n00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:32.830\nDo show ip int brief, right?\n\n816\n00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:35.558\nAnd let's see if these are up.\n\n817\n00:43:35.558 --> 00:43:38.160\nSo my multi-link is down, right?\n\n818\n00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.720\nVirtual access down.\n\n819\n00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.693\nAnd I've got my two serials are up.\n\n820\n00:43:41.693 --> 00:43:45.395\nOne, two, three and four.\n\n821\n00:43:45.395 --> 00:43:47.969\nRight?\nSo ping 172.16.10.1.\n\n822\n00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.015\nDo ping 172.16.10.1.\n\n823\n00:43:50.015 --> 00:43:51.205\nOkay?\n\n824\n00:43:51.205 --> 00:43:54.685\nSo we obviously can see that\nthis is another way to do it.\n\n825\n00:43:54.685 --> 00:43:57.625\nI prefer this way and I think it's\na much better way to bundle but\n\n826\n00:43:57.625 --> 00:43:59.180\nit's completely up to you.\n\n827\n00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.890\nOkay, so just one more thing to show you\nand we're going to be done with this and\n\n828\n00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.340\nwe're going to pick up another\nwan episode in a second.\n\n829\n00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.330\nAnd that is,\nI'm going to come down here to the L,\n\n830\n00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:13.210\nI'm going to do this the LA router and\nso do, let me show IP route.\n\n831\n00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:18.420\nI should be able to see\nmultiple links in there, yeah.\n\n832\n00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.650\nSo I'm going to do this and\nI want to create a client.\n\n833\n00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.105\nLet me show you what it is to take\na client, so I'm gonna go into interface\n\n834\n00:44:25.105 --> 00:44:30.150\nf0/0, because this is where you put your\nppp client on an ethernet interface right?\n\n835\n00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.020\nAnd I'm gonna say, first off,\nI don't want to go there.\n\n836\n00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.340\nI want to go to a virtual.\n\n837\n00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:38.160\nI'm gonna create interface, let me\nbackspace so I can use my question mark.\n\n838\n00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.490\nInterface dialer All right.\n\n839\n00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.080\nAnd again,\nlet's see what numbers we can use.\n\n840\n00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.930\nIt's up to, there's 1,400 of them.\n\n841\n00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.530\n0 to 1,399.\n\n842\n00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.120\nThat's plenty, so\nwe'll just use one, because we can.\n\n843\n00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.360\nAnd then, I don't know my IP address,\nI'm broadband.\n\n844\n00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.490\nIP address, not DHCP, but negotiated.\n\n845\n00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.410\nIP address negotiated, okay?\n\n846\n00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.380\nSo we need to remember this for\nthe objectives.\n\n847\n00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.860\nWe're working on the objectives right now.\n\n848\n00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:08.610\nWe're taking a Cisco router and\nconnecting it to broadband and\n\n849\n00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:09.580\nnegotiating with PPPoE.\n\n850\n00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.690\nAll right, I just want to be\nclear on what we're doing here.\n\n851\n00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:20.250\nAll right, so now,\nin this case here, encap PPP.\n\n852\n00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.910\ni'm not on ethernet right\nnow I'm on my virtual\n\n853\n00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.130\ninterface because i couldn't not\ntype that in on my ethernet.\n\n854\n00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.532\nSo then i'm going to say dialer pool,\n\n855\n00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:34.460\none, right.\n\n856\n00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.170\nDialer pool one.\n\n857\n00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.490\nAnd then so\nthis is part of dialer pool 1 so\n\n858\n00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.680\nwe actually create what's\ncalled a dialer interface.\n\n859\n00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.600\nNow this goes back a long way\nfrom when we had modem pools, so\n\n860\n00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.160\nwe're using our dialer interfaces.\n\n861\n00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.400\nWe're not gonna dial-up\nanything at this point, but\n\n862\n00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.090\nwe're using those same virtual\ninterfaces right here.\n\n863\n00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:57.299\nNow I'm gonna go into my fast ethernet\ninterface and I'm gonna say no IP address.\n\n864\n00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.630\nAnd now I'm gonna make this guy a pp.\n\n865\n00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:05.150\nNow if we look here,\nwe can't just type ppp, but\n\n866\n00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:09.130\nwe can type pppoe, and\nwhat I want is pppoe-client.\n\n867\n00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.860\nI want to be a client.\n\n868\n00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.430\nAnd I'm gonna use the dialer pool.\n\n869\n00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.540\nNumber 1.\n\n870\n00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.710\nSo, I create my dialer,\nmy dialer interface, my virtual interface.\n\n871\n00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:26.860\nI say negotiate the IP, make it encap PPP,\ncreate a dialer pool 1.\n\n872\n00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:31.050\nAnd then assign that to my ethernet\ninterface that's going to get it.\n\n873\n00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.040\nWhich then will go out and\nnegotiate that addresses.\n\n874\n00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.400\nSo I'm going to assign that to here.\n\n875\n00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.530\nOkay, so\nthat's pretty much all I have to do.\n\n876\n00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.060\nI'm not saying you might have\nto do some authentication.\n\n877\n00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.730\nYou're gonna have to talk\nWith your provider, but for\n\n878\n00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.960\nthe objectives,\nthis is what we want to do.\n\n879\n00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.970\nOne more thing we're gonna look\nat is how do you verify this.\n\n880\n00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.780\nAnd then we're gonna\nclose this session out.\n\n881\n00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:56.300\nAnd I'm going to type in do sh int b,\nand we should be able to see.\n\n882\n00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:03.740\nDo sh ip int b, and there's our dialer.\n\n883\n00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.900\nAnd we didn't get,\nI'm obviously not connected but\n\n884\n00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.970\nthis would then get an IP address right\nhere and we would see this up and up.\n\n885\n00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:14.770\nAnd then do show PPPoE session, okay.\n\n886\n00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.330\nAnd then we would be\nable to see our session,\n\n887\n00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.910\nwe'd get our unique id and\nwe would see the max and so.\n\n888\n00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:24.130\nSo the two commands, do show IP interface\nbreach to see what our IP address\n\n889\n00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:29.300\nnegotiated And then do show pppoe session.\n\n890\n00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.220\nOkay Ronnie, take it away.\n\n891\n00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.240\n>> All right, so remember what we actually\nsaw on this episode when we started\n\n892\n00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.710\ntalking about the wide area networks here.\n\n893\n00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.510\nTodd actually did show us that there's\nnormally, at least in the past, right?\n\n894\n00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.880\nThree different topologies we were paying\nattention to, that idea of the star, and\n\n895\n00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.350\nof course then the fully meshed and\n\n896\n00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:49.600\nthe partially meshed And today we tend\nnot to actually see that any more.\n\n897\n00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.300\nBut you will see that on exam.\n\n898\n00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.350\nSo make sure you do pay attention there\nwhen you start to talk about that as well.\n\n899\n00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:58.510\nAnd we even talked about some of the\ndifferent technologies that we connected\n\n900\n00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.410\nwith over WANs as well.\n\n901\n00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.000\nSo make sure you do go back and\nlook at all of those.\n\n902\n00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.040\nTodd say that today, hey, there's a lot of\ntimes where you're not gonna see any of\n\n903\n00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.000\nthat and what you're gonna see instead is\nsomething like MPLS To be able to connect\n\n904\n00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.060\nthrough and\nto do all the things that we wanted.\n\n905\n00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:16.560\nBut, on the exam itself, really the focus\nhere is gonna be on, of course,\n\n906\n00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.310\npoint to point links and\nsetting that encapsulation.\n\n907\n00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:23.070\nUnderstand that both sides have to be\nset correctly on the encapsulation, and\n\n908\n00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.150\nif you're gonna use some\ntype of authentication,\n\n909\n00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:29.110\nmake sure you understand the setting of\nthat username and password remember that\n\n910\n00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:34.810\nit has to be a mirrored configuration for\nthat authentication to take place.\n\n911\n00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:40.970\nTodd also, of course, here showed us\nthe idea of setting multi-link as well as\n\n912\n00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:46.165\nthe That point to point protocol\nover an ethernet type of\n\n913\n00:48:46.165 --> 00:48:51.205\nconnection to help us if we were setting\nup dialers and dialer pulls as well.\n\n914\n00:48:51.205 --> 00:48:55.250\nBut that's a lot of information and\nthere's actually even more to come.\n\n915\n00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.580\nOn some WAN technology, but\nit's a great place for us to go ahead and\n\n916\n00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:59.980\nend this episode then.\n\n917\n00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.330\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n918\n00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.480\n>> All right, and we'll be right back.\n\n919\n00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.800\nAnd my name

00:00:20.230\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking a look at ICND2 content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.160\nGetting ready for that CCNA routing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.400\nswitching exam that has just\nbeen released by Cisco.\n\n6\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.890\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Mister Todd Lanley.\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.410\nThank you for joining us in our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.040\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.610\nLet's jump right back into WANs.\n\n10\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.837\nWe're going to hit virtual\nprivate networks through GRE and\n\n11\n00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:37.313\nthen talk about GRE and\nVPNs in the GRE tunnel.\n\n12\n00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.175\nBut, so what is a VPN, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.136\nWe talked about instead of\nhaving little serial links.\n\n14\n00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:47.670\nAnd we did mesh, full mesh, partial mesh,\npoint to point, hub and spoke.\n\n15\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.130\nI'm like, man, I don't know if\nwe even need those any more.\n\n16\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.774\nIf we got a gig Ethernet\ninto our building,\n\n17\n00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:57.777\nwhich a lot of people do these days, I\nreally don't need all these serial links.\n\n18\n00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:00.445\nBut if you have them,\nyou know how to configure them now.\n\n19\n00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.236\nYou got to do multilink, and\neven multilink with EIGRP.\n\n20\n00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:06.880\nAll right, that being said let's take\na look at virtual private networks, right.\n\n21\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.180\nSo, what is a VPN, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.050\nNow all of us use it.\n\n23\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.040\nI'm connected to my VPN in my data\ncenter In Arizona, right now.\n\n24\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.950\nThat's how I'm logging in here to\nthe pods that we're doing labs on.\n\n25\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.290\nSo VPN makes my host look like\nit's local to my servers.\n\n26\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.947\nSo I've got another IP address.\n\n27\n00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:30.159\nAnd basically a VPN is a tunnel\nwhich means I have a packet.\n\n28\n00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.175\nSo here's my packet.\n\n29\n00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:32.266\nSo here's my host.\n\n30\n00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.736\nWell this was out in Colorado\nwhere I was doing this.\n\n31\n00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:36.788\nI live up in Evergreen, Colorado.\n\n32\n00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.080\nBut so here's my packet.\n\n33\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.070\nAnd I put another header on here, right?\n\n34\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.668\nSo here's my VPN header right here.\n\n35\n00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:47.081\nAnd it has another destination here and\nsource.\n\n36\n00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:49.543\nSo it tells it where to go.\n\n37\n00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.226\nSo here's my original packet.\n\n38\n00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:53.311\nIt puts another destination on there and\n\n39\n00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.440\nsays okay, you've got to end up here at\nmy VPN concentrator, whereever it is.\n\n40\n00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.017\nAnd it strips off that header and\nnow the packet's sitting there.\n\n41\n00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:03.386\nSo as far as these guys are concerned, the\npacket was generated on that local LAN.\n\n42\n00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.065\nThat's what it looks like, right.\n\n43\n00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.329\nIt comes out of the VPN concentrator,\nthe ASA, whatever\n\n44\n00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.440\nyou are using to terminate and those\nservices look local to you and vice versa.\n\n45\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.620\nNow so the benefit's for the objective.\n\n46\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.654\nSo why use a VPN?\n\n47\n00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:18.525\nReduce cost?\n\n48\n00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:22.530\n[LAUGH] Yeah, a lot.\n\n49\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.630\nBut really, even if we have those\ngigabits, we have remote clients, right?\n\n50\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.700\nAnd so a lot of my customers have remote\nclients that need to come in and work.\n\n51\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.070\nAnd they already RDP in to devices and\nwhatever.\n\n52\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.130\nOr VNC.\n\n53\n00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.120\nAnd so they need to VPN and get in.\n\n54\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.480\nSo regardless,\n\n55\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.550\nif we don't have serial links we're\nstill gonna use VPNs to get in.\n\n56\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.570\nAnd that's gonna give us some security\nover, say, hey we're gonna allow\n\n57\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.940\nsomeone in through NAT [LAUGH] which is\nthe old way to do it, the 1990s version.\n\n58\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.860\nAnyways it allows us to\nhave a lot of scalability.\n\n59\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.940\nAnd the tunneling VPN doesn't\ngive us any security by default,\n\n60\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.190\nit's just an end point.\n\n61\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.110\nIt says hey all my packets need to\ngo here, and then they can go to\n\n62\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.200\nthe internet, they can go wherever, but\nthey have to go to this certain place.\n\n63\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.510\nWell, we can add security\nwith something called IPSec.\n\n64\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.250\nIPSec is a framework, right?\n\n65\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.810\nIt's a protocol suite.\n\n66\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.030\nA suite of protocols that\nwill give us security and\n\n67\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.540\nencryption and authentication,\nconfidentiality and so on.\n\n68\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.310\nNow so with provider VPNs.\n\n69\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.880\nSo we have couple different ones.\n\n70\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.200\nWe have Layer 2 MPLS VPNs.\n\n71\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.970\nAnd these use MPLS labels\nto transport data.\n\n72\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.650\nSo we don't have MPLS in the CCNA.\n\n73\n00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.000\nThe communication occurs between routers\nknown as provider edge networks right?\n\n74\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.390\nSo these are my provider edge networks.\n\n75\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.990\nAll right so the internet providers who\nhave existing Layer 2 networks can opt to\n\n76\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.420\nuse these VPNs instead of a Layer 3 right?\n\n77\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.160\nNow so underneath the Layer 2\nMPLS VP LANs, we have something called and\n\n78\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.490\nI don't see them here VPWS,\nwhich is virtual private wire service.\n\n79\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.382\nAll right, so this is also known,\nokay this is a mouthful right here,\n\n80\n00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:05.896\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.553\n>> Ethernet over MPLS.\n\n82\n00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:11.020\nEthernet over MPLS, or virtual link lines.\n\n83\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.673\nSo this is also known as.\n\n84\n00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:14.128\nLet me write this out for you.\n\n85\n00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:16.135\nE-T-H, little o, M-P-L-S.\n\n86\n00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:17.766\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.951\nThat's an M-P-L-S, all caps.\n\n88\n00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:24.077\nOr virtual leased line.\n\n89\n00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:27.916\nAnd then we also have\nsomething called V-P-L-S.\n\n90\n00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.819\nSo then the end service is virtual,\n\n91\n00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.462\nbecause multiple instances of the service\nshare the same Ethernet broadcast domain.\n\n92\n00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:37.352\nRight?\nSo these are my Layer 2 right here, right?\n\n93\n00:04:37.352 --> 00:04:38.962\nSo that's our Layer 2.\n\n94\n00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:42.835\nOn our Layer 3,\nthis provides service across a backbone,\n\n95\n00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:45.260\nwith service provider routers.\n\n96\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.340\nWe exchange the actual routes.\n\n97\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.850\nSo this is my service across the backbone.\n\n98\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo we have a different IP subnet\nwhich connects each site.\n\n99\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.130\nSo every site is its own subnet right?\n\n100\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.575\nSo my Layer 3 here, these are Layer 3.\n\n101\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.660\nNow, underneath here,\nwhen we're using IPsec,\n\n102\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.010\nlet's go to, now I also have something,\nmy enterprise, right?\n\n103\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.740\nSo these were my provider managed VPNs.\n\n104\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.634\nThis means that the provider's\ngoing to manage these.\n\n105\n00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:18.790\nI'm not gonna manage them, right?\n\n106\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.610\nAnd so that's what we wanna do.\n\n107\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.032\nSo if we have the enterprise managed VPNs,\nthen we're gonna look at this and\n\n108\n00:05:26.032 --> 00:05:29.944\nwe're gonna have something\ncalled remote-access.\n\n109\n00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:32.940\nAccess VPNs, Remote-Access.\n\n110\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.830\nSite-to-Site.\n\n111\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.107\nSo let's see I might have this,\nso Remote-Access Site-to-Site.\n\n112\n00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.961\nAnd extranet which allows\nour customers to get in.\n\n113\n00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:49.538\nNow if we're using IPsec.\n\n114\n00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:50.607\nLet me see if I have this on here.\n\n115\n00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:51.501\nOkay so here we go.\n\n116\n00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:53.148\nSo, I wanted to talk about this.\n\n117\n00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:55.809\nSo we have Site-to-Site VPN options here.\n\n118\n00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:59.990\nWe have the IPsec tunnel, which is that\nframework of open security standards.\n\n119\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.980\nGRE over IPsec,\nenables routing and multicast.\n\n120\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.210\nSo this allows me to run\nIP over an IPsec tunnel.\n\n121\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.810\nSo GRE, right.\n\n122\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.650\nAnd then we've got two Cisco proprietary\nones that I want to mention.\n\n123\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.502\nWe have dynamic, this stands for dynamic,\n\n124\n00:06:19.502 --> 00:06:23.838\nmultipoint virtual private network.\n\n125\n00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:28.012\nIt allows us to scale large and\nsmall IPsec VPNs.\n\n126\n00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:32.991\nAnd this was Cisco's answer to allow\ncorporate offices to connect to branch\n\n127\n00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.106\noffices with low cost, right?\n\n128\n00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:38.100\nZero touch, really easy to configure.\n\n129\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.700\nSo, again,\nCisco proprietary works fairly well.\n\n130\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.020\nThe other one, this stands for\nvirtual tunnel interface.\n\n131\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.432\nSimplified IPsec tunnel\nmode [COUGH] configuration.\n\n132\n00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:56.030\nAnd it's simpler option than GRE or\nLayer 2 tunneling protocol for\n\n133\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.710\nencapsulation and cryptomaps with IPsec.\n\n134\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.730\nOkay?\nSo I don't need the GRE protocol and\n\n135\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.740\noverhead that it brings if I use these.\n\n136\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.110\nSo these are actually newer and\nbetter but they are Cisco proprietary.\n\n137\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.000\nAll right.\nSo now let's go ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.080\ntake a look at our GRE Tunnel and\nbuilding this.\n\n139\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.250\nSo speaking of that, saying hey these\nare better than GRE, let's go back and\n\n140\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.942\ngo to the objectives and\nbuild a GRE tunnel.\n\n141\n00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:21.458\nAnyway so\n\n142\n00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:26.309\nthe following are the main Generic Routing\nEncapsulation characteristics we've got.\n\n143\n00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:30.040\nIt's one of many different\ntunneling protocols, right.\n\n144\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.370\nAnd this is the one in the objectives\nthat you're gonna configure.\n\n145\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.340\nAnd it's really easy, right.\n\n146\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.730\nSo there is more overhead involved in this\nthan some of those Cisco proprietary ones.\n\n147\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.212\nThe zero touch we can just add with\nno configuration with those other\n\n148\n00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.740\nproprietary ones.\n\n149\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.470\nNow the protocol field,\nthey like this in the objectives, and\n\n150\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.810\nthe protocol field in the IP\nheader is protocol number 47.\n\n151\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.758\nRight, it defines my GRE packets.\n\n152\n00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:55.264\nSo basically we create a tunnel.\n\n153\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:56.203\nThis gives me an end point.\n\n154\n00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.547\nSo notice I have my IP header.\n\n155\n00:07:58.547 --> 00:08:00.747\nHere's my packet.\n\n156\n00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:03.652\nSo I have my transport.\n\n157\n00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:05.810\nAnd then here's my GRE\nheader which gives me.\n\n158\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.200\nIn this case here,\nI don't need any encryption.\n\n159\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.030\nI'm not gonna have any encryption in here.\n\n160\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.160\nI can add that encryption in here.\n\n161\n00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.700\nWhoops.\n\n162\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.160\nLet's go ahead and go ahead and\nconfigure the GRE, so\n\n163\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.820\nI'm gonna run out to U, my lab here.\n\n164\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.450\nAnd we're going to configure this, what\nare we going to configure this between?\n\n165\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.550\nWe can do the corp and San Francisco I\nguess, that would be a good idea.\n\n166\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.230\nOkay, so on this case here,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n167\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.235\njust use the current configuration,\nI've got the corp serial configured as\n\n168\n00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:42.410\n17216101, the San Francisco's 172 16 10 2.\n\n169\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.870\nSo this is a very easy to\nbring up this town guys.\n\n170\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.350\nSo config t, so follow along.\n\n171\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.080\nIf you're on a router or a packet tracer\nI think I can do most of these commands.\n\n172\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.840\nI haven't tried this exact one in here,\nbut we can go ahead and\n\n173\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.040\ngive this one a shot.\n\n174\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.430\nAll right?\nSo I'm gonna say interface tunnel Zero.\n\n175\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.355\nLet's see how many tunnels we can create.\n\n176\n00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.950\n2.1 billion again, alright?\n\n177\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.440\nTunnel zero.\n\n178\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.190\nIP address.\n\n179\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.160\nSo I'm going to use a different\naddress game in here.\n\n180\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.040\nSo my tunnel came up.\n\n181\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.510\nNotice logging synchronous\nsaved me here didn't it?\n\n182\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.475\nAlright, so remember that.\n\n183\n00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:19.330\n172.16 I'm sorry, I wanna make the tunnel.\n\n184\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.470\nThat's what I'm using,\n63.1.1.1 on this side.\n\n185\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.910\nAnd I'm gonna just use 63.1.1.2\non the other side, right?\n\n186\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.745\nJust another different addressing scheme,\nall right?\n\n187\n00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:38.500\nTunnel source and 2, so\n\n188\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:45.050\nmy tunnel source is 16 dot 10 dot 1 and\nmy destination is going to be.\n\n189\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.110\nSo I'm gonna change this.\n\n190\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.850\nSo if I look here.\n\n191\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.360\nSo I say who's my telesource here?\n\n192\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.830\nWhich is my interface here,\nand then my destination.\n\n193\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.830\nSo I have some different\nones here I can use.\n\n194\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.416\nI'm gonna say destination of 117.16.10.2.\n\n195\n00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:59.786\nI think I'm doing this right.\n\n196\n00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:03.650\nSo say who my source, so let's do a do.\n\n197\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.140\nLooks like my tunnels\nreally wanna come up.\n\n198\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.910\nDo show run, I'd like to do interface.\n\n199\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.150\nLet's see if that works.\n\n200\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.070\nTunnel, 0, there we go, all right.\n\n201\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.670\nSo I have my IP address.\n\n202\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.160\nMy source is 10.1 which is my interface\ngoing toward San Francisco in this case.\n\n203\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.991\nAnd the tunnel destination is 172.16.10.2.\n\n204\n00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:30.090\nSo I'm gonna create a GR,\nby the way I didn't add GRE in here did I?\n\n205\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.950\nI didn't say GRE because I\ncould say encapsulation,\n\n206\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.070\nI think it's, what is the command.\n\n207\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.510\nGr, I forget the command.\n\n208\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.990\nGre.\n\n209\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.520\nThe reason I forget is because\nyou don't have to type it in.\n\n210\n00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.610\nIt's on my default.\n\n211\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.400\nSo let's go out there and\ndo San Francisco.\n\n212\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.010\nAnd when we do it I'll see the command\nshow when we do the verification.\n\n213\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.760\nSo I'm gonna do config t, and let's just\nbring up the other side, int tunnel 0.\n\n214\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.460\nSo notice I just do t0, and\nthat should bring up the interface.\n\n215\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo let that come down cuz I\ndidn't have log insynchronous on.\n\n216\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.150\nIp address 63.1.1.1.2.\n\n217\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:12.890\nTunnel source, whoops.\n\n218\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.110\nTunnel source.\n\n219\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:23.990\n172 16.10.2, and the destination\nis tunnel destination 172 16 10.1.\n\n220\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.740\nOkay?\nSo\n\n221\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.900\nif I did those right my tunnels should\ncome up and I should do it, and\n\n222\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.240\nthe way I should see this,\npretty simple, show IP int\n\n223\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.280\nbrief, and there's my tunnel and\nlet's see it's up and up.\n\n224\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.530\nSo you've got to be careful here,\n\n225\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.570\nmake sure if you don't have\nthe correct source and destination.\n\n226\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.690\nThen this is going to say probably up here\nbecause the tunnel's always going to want\n\n227\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.690\nto come up, but it'll say down here\nbecause it doesn't know the destination.\n\n228\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.660\nSo my tunnel is up and running, so\n\n229\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.220\nnow we've got a tunnel between San\nFrancisco and L.A. Show interface brief.\n\n230\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.020\nAnd I believe I can type in tunnel here.\n\n231\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.365\nIt wants, It, gosh darnit,\nit doesn't do what I think.\n\n232\n00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:11.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Tunnel zero, come on Todd.\n\n233\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.090\nBut anyways, and so\nI can do show IP and brief tunnel zero,\n\n234\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.520\nnow you're thinking well,\nwhy do I need to that?\n\n235\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.000\nWell if you guys been over my\nconfigs the other day on corp,\n\n236\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.050\nI mean they were pretty long when\nI just show IP interface brief.\n\n237\n00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.630\nWe have at least four or\nfive virtual interfaces in there.\n\n238\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.940\nYou know, so.\n\n239\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.850\nAnd then, show IP route and our tunnel is\nup and running, this isn't a big deal.\n\n240\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.730\nSo we should see it, right here it is.\n\n241\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.070\n63, it's off of there.\n\n242\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.650\nThere she blows.\n\n243\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.060\nSo we can see that she's directly\nconnected for tunnel zero.\n\n244\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.840\nSo that's about it Rodney, it's pretty\ndarn simple to bring up a tunnel.\n\n245\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.260\n>> Alright, Todd well that\nactually sounds pretty easy here.\n\n246\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.810\nIs there anything else we need\nto know about the WANs besides\n\n247\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.040\nthe configuration there for the tunnels?\n\n248\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.870\n>> There is.\n\n249\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.810\nSo we've talked about serial.\n\n250\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.800\nRight and Rodney will give us a great\nsummary when we're done here, but\n\n251\n00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.740\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n252\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.170\nI wanna show you one more\nthing on this tunnel and\n\n253\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.810\nthen we're gonna run into BGP and\nthat's where he was leading me.\n\n254\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.480\nOne last thing guys, wanna learn\nabout BGP it's new new objective.\n\n255\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.360\nIt's the new black of the WAN.\n\n256\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.120\nOur new black.\n\n257\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.050\nAnyway, all right.\n\n258\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.160\nSo here's my tunnel, so\nI say show interface tunnel 0 Right here,\n\n259\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.640\nwe can see the transport is GRE/IP, right?\n\n260\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.710\nWe can change that.\n\n261\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.310\nBut we're just saying, hey.\n\n262\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.540\nWe just want IP traffic across this,\nright?\n\n263\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.790\nSo, show int tunnel zero.\n\n264\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.360\nShow IP route to make\nsure your tunnel is up.\n\n265\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.850\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n266\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.810\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at something else.\n\n267\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.500\nAnd this is border gateway protocol BGP.\n\n268\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.730\nAnd the reason we would use that.\n\n269\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.280\nLet me come back over here.\n\n270\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.720\nIs we want to communicate between\nautonomous systems, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.560\nSo at this point here,\nwhen we talked bout OSPF.\n\n272\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.000\nWhen we talked about EIGRP.\n\n273\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.650\nEven when we had multi-area with OSPF,\nwe had one autonomous system.\n\n274\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.890\nWe created multiple areas within there.\n\n275\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.450\nBut now, I want to communicate\nbetween autonomous systems, right?\n\n276\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.630\nSo IGPs communicate within\nan autonomous system.\n\n277\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.317\nRIP version two OSPF EIGRP is\nwhat we communicated with.\n\n278\n00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:08.970\nEIGRP Is-Is, they've mentioned\nthat a few times in the jaxes,\n\n279\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.480\nbut we never have to configure it.\n\n280\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.980\nJust remember that as a link\nstate protocol in case they ask.\n\n281\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.690\nBut to connect these together we\nare going to use something called EGP.\n\n282\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.430\nBefore that we used exterior\ngateway protocol, and\n\n283\n00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.940\nbefore that we even used OPF.\n\n284\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.420\nnow they don't consider OSPF valid for\ncommunicating between the systems.\n\n285\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.870\nBut that's what an autonomous\nsystem border router is for, right?\n\n286\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:31.220\nAnyways, okay, so couple quick notes\nabout BGP before we run out and\n\n287\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.800\nconfigure it, cuz that's the easy part.\n\n288\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.380\nIt's really not that much\nharder than doing RIP per se,\n\n289\n00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.960\nin a small network, right?\n\n290\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.770\nWhen you're in a CCNA objective\nit's really not that hard.\n\n291\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.780\nTo reliable updates it uses TCP, guys.\n\n292\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.570\nAnd it uses TCT port 179.\n\n293\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.686\nSo BGP is reliable,\n\n294\n00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:55.500\nuses TCP and port 179,\nyou want to remember that.\n\n295\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.280\nOkay, it's very scalable,\nit's very secure,\n\n296\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.610\nsupports routing policies,\nis what that says down here.\n\n297\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:09.530\nSupports routing policies All right,\nso, we exchange routes with other ISPs.\n\n298\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.450\nIt's meant to be used in worldwide\nnetworks and large networks.\n\n299\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.050\nSo, if you have a corporation and you're\nextremely large, like Cisco would have\n\n300\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.840\ndifferent systems, IBM, something\nextremely large, right, would connect up.\n\n301\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.020\nEspecially, if you want to\nconnect to multiple ISPs or\n\n302\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.880\nyou have multiple links between ISPs and\nwe can exchange routes with BGP.\n\n303\n00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.340\nRight, something like that.\n\n304\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.290\nThat's a little big for the CCNA.\n\n305\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.810\nWe'll probably get more\nof that in the CCNP.\n\n306\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.410\nSo they're really just\nscratching the surface here.\n\n307\n00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:45.460\nSo all we have to do is create a very\nsimple little network BGP with the CCNA.\n\n308\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.620\nWe're gonna define the BGP process,\nestablish the neighbor relationships, and\n\n309\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.820\nthen just advertise the network.\n\n310\n00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.280\nSo we found out who are neighbors are,\nadvertise our other networks.\n\n311\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.746\nAnd again for\nthe csena it's pretty darn simple.\n\n312\n00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:59.296\nLet's go full screen on this one,\nand then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n313\n00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:00.340\ntake a look at this config.\n\n314\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.198\nSo this is actually the configuration for\nthe Corp router,\n\n315\n00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:07.580\nI have it listed at ISP here,\nbut either one.\n\n316\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.380\nSo this is my config,\nI have the same IP addresses on there.\n\n317\n00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.800\nI'm just using the single length ISP nr2.\n\n318\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.030\nI don't have two or the corp in R2.\n\n319\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.370\nBut notice I have each one in\na different autonomous system thinking\n\n320\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.900\nthey're whole different enterprises,\nRight?\n\n321\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.070\nAnd so we're using bgp to connect.\n\n322\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.520\nNow I would see these at\na lot of my customers today,\n\n323\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.110\nwhen they have their corporate network and\nthey're connecting up to their branches.\n\n324\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:38.660\nThey might be an autonomous system but\nwe use mpls with bgp, right?\n\n325\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.090\nTo connect all those branches together,\n\n326\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.480\nso it's very common to see\nsomething like this today.\n\n327\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.430\nA lot more common than it was even\nin the last [INAUDIBLE] it was only\n\n328\n00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.250\nthree years ago, but now we do it.\n\n329\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:54.360\nSo this defines my autonomous system\nnumber that I'm connecting to.\n\n330\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.170\nSo I'm saying the corp router\nis autonomous system one, so\n\n331\n00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.890\nwhen I come out here,\nI'm gonna say autonomous system 200,\n\n332\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:05.370\nand autonomous system 100 and that's\ndefined with the router bgp command.\n\n333\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.900\nThen I say who my neighbor is.\n\n334\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.040\nSo I say neighbor,\nthis is there IP address and\n\n335\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.430\nthey're in Moto Thomas system numbers.\n\n336\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.880\nAnd then I say hey neighbors this is\nmy directly corrected networks here.\n\n337\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.480\nOkay.\n\n338\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.550\nSo let's run out and take a,\ntake a quick look here.\n\n339\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:26.094\nSo remember here's my corp and\nthen I'm going to San Francisco and\n\n340\n00:17:26.094 --> 00:17:31.610\nto L.A., AS=100 and AS=200,\npretty simple guys.\n\n341\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.080\nLets go take a look here.\n\n342\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.800\nSo I'm in the corp,\nI'm gonna have to do two things.\n\n343\n00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.700\nOkay, so config t.\n\n344\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.955\nNow I have EIGRP running.\n\n345\n00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:42.930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n346\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.760\n>> Right, I wonder what is gonna happen\nwith BGP on this little network if\n\n347\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.750\nI have EIGRP running?\n\n348\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.440\nLet's find out,\n\n349\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.640\nbecause I didn't even tell you what the\nadministrative distance is of EGP, right?\n\n350\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.730\nSo we're going to find\nthat out in a second.\n\n351\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.610\nSo I'm going to say router bgp,\nI'm system one on the corp router.\n\n352\n00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.050\nAnd I'm going to say the neighbor, so\n\n353\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.145\nwe want to type in neighbor,\nand I've got two neighbors.\n\n354\n00:18:07.145 --> 00:18:09.770\n10.2 is my San Fransisco router right?\n\n355\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:16.690\nAnd then I say remote as and\nthey're gonna be 100.\n\n356\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:22.806\nI'm basically defining them,\nI typed in 10.1, I'm 10.1.\n\n357\n00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:24.980\nI meant to type in 10.2.\n\n358\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.700\nYou know, sometimes the router\nsays hey dummy, don't do this,\n\n359\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.161\nwe've seen that a couple times right, when\nI tried to put a static route to myself or\n\n360\n00:18:31.161 --> 00:18:32.390\nsomething like that.\n\n361\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.630\nSometimes, these are helpful.\n\n362\n00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.350\nSometimes they're annoying,\nin this case they were very helpful.\n\n363\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.360\nRight?\nOkay, so let's go back here and\n\n364\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:38.950\ntake a look.\n\n365\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.580\nSo I'm going to network 10.2, that's my\nSan Francisco router, with an as of 100,\n\n366\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.400\nI'm just gonna up arrow.\n\n367\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.770\nWe're gonna change this to 200 and\nto get to LA it's, they're 10.6, and\n\n368\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.100\nI could put this in twice for them.\n\n369\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.830\nBecause I do have two links,\nI'm just going to use the one for now.\n\n370\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.990\nSo I put in my two networks,\nand I only have two neighbors,\n\n371\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.815\nI only have one network behind me and\nthat's the network\n\n372\n00:19:02.815 --> 00:19:08.270\n10.10.10.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n373\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:13.130\nRight, so it might be your whole\nenterprise behind you might be just 10000,\n\n374\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.900\nright, that's your whole\nnetwork behind you.\n\n375\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.290\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the San Francisco router.\n\n376\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.600\nWe define that as 100 and LA as 200.\n\n377\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.660\nI just have to come back and\ntell it who they're connected to.\n\n378\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.079\nPretty simple, so\nlet's go out here and take a look.\n\n379\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.120\nconfig t.\n\n380\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.110\nrouter bgp,\nI believe I did San Francisco was a 100.\n\n381\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.950\nSo I'm telling they're 100.\n\n382\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.060\nAnd I'm gonna say who their neighbor\nis which is corp, neighbor 172.16.10.1,\n\n383\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.380\nnow I type in the 1 and\n\n384\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.760\nwe gotta type in the whole word\nremote before your hit your tab key.\n\n385\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.740\nAnd then that autonomous system\nwere connecting to is 1.\n\n386\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.140\nAnd that's it but\n\n387\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.310\nI gotta type in the network I wanna\nadvertise to which is 192.168.10.1.\n\n388\n00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:05.955\nAnd then type in the mask.\n\n389\n00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.780\n>> 10.0 for your network.\n\n390\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.790\n>> I think I got that right.\n\n391\n00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.890\nI don't know if it, yeah.\n\n392\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:13.500\nWhoops.\n\n393\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.320\nWhoops.\n>> Your network is.\n\n394\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.360\n>> My network is not.\n\n395\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.880\n>> It should be 10.0.\n\n396\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.450\n>> I don't know what I was typing\nin there, why I was doing that.\n\n397\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.496\nSo when I advertise, no I'm 192.168.10.0.\n\n398\n00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:27.160\n>> Zero.\n>> Yeah.\n\n399\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.140\nI don't know what I was doing.\n\n400\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.105\nI was talking and\nnot paying attention as usual.\n\n401\n00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not the same way I drive.\n\n402\n00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:34.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n403\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.280\nYeah, I'm about done there.\n\n404\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.980\nLet's do show run,\nlet's see if bgp comes up.\n\n405\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.460\nOkay, do show run.\n\n406\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.453\nLet's go ahead, take a look at it,\nat my config here.\n\n407\n00:20:50.915 --> 00:20:53.740\nOkay, and there I am.\n\n408\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.330\nSo, network 192.168.10.0.\n\n409\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.420\nThat's what I'm attached to.\n\n410\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.020\nThat's my directly connected.\n\n411\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.880\nI want to advertise that.\n\n412\n00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.790\nAnd my peer is 172.16.10.1,\nand their as is 1.\n\n413\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.650\nAll right.\n\n414\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.380\nSo if I come down here, let's go to L.A.\n\n415\n00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:15.850\nRouter bgp, and we're 200, right?\n\n416\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.000\n>> Yes.\n>> We're 200.\n\n417\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.040\nAnd my neighbor, remote, neighbor.\n\n418\n00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.845\nSorry, I've to put in the IP address,\n\n419\n00:21:24.845 --> 00:21:26.790\n172.16.10.-\n>> 5.\n\n420\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.040\n>> 5, cuz I'm 6.\n\n421\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.380\nAnd then remote you type up\nthe whole thing and there 1.\n\n422\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.075\nAnd then I'm just gonna\nadvertise my network.\n\n423\n00:21:37.075 --> 00:21:37.730\n192.168.20.0.\n\n424\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.100\nDid not like it when I didn't\nput a /2D52D52D50/ and\n\n425\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.000\nthen I notice PGP is coming up.\n\n426\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.390\nSo that's fine,\n\n427\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.870\nthe other side I didn't mention this\nwas fast, did you see how long it took?\n\n428\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.850\nEIGRP is much faster than this.\n\n429\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.340\nRight?\nThis is an exterior gateway\n\n430\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.700\nprotocol igp's need to\nbe faster than this.\n\n431\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.050\nAll right, so\nSan Fransisco just came up to the corp,\n\n432\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:04.000\nnow that being said,\nI think I had a 30 over here right?\n\n433\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.510\nLoop back.\n\n434\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.200\nSo I also.\n\n435\n00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.340\nI don't know if I have that defined or\nnot but I did, so\n\n436\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.830\nwe'll go ahead and define that.\n\n437\n00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.310\nThen we'll see what happens\nif it's even there.\n\n438\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.490\nAll right.\nSo I've got 10.2 and 10.6 up.\n\n439\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.640\nRight, looks pretty good.\n\n440\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.400\nI could bring up the other link,\n\n441\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.210\nit's just not part of the objectives\nright now so I'm not gonna.\n\n442\n00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.800\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my config.\n\n443\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.210\nOkay, here we go.\n\n444\n00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.890\nNow, we're going to look\nat our routing table, so\n\n445\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.140\nI'm advertising my 10.10.10 network which\nis off my FastEthernet of Corp, that's it.\n\n446\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.040\nAnd then I've got 10.2\nwith Thomas systems.\n\n447\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.590\n100, 200.\n\n448\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.190\nIt did the no auto summary, didn't it?\n\n449\n00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.070\nI didn't do that.\n\n450\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.720\nAll right.\n\n451\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.370\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at some\nverification and wrap this session up.\n\n452\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.640\nShow IP route.\n\n453\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.120\nWhat do you think,\neigrp is gonna be in the run table or bgp?\n\n454\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.540\nBecause running the eigrp and bgp,\nwe define these harms as systems but\n\n455\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.830\nthe eigrp doesn't know\nanything about that.\n\n456\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.810\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n457\n00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.180\neigrp or bgp?\n\n458\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.284\n>> Gonna be eigrp.\n\n459\n00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:10.040\n>> All right, see what Ronnie says.\n\n460\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.217\nWhere's that tequila?\n\n461\n00:23:11.217 --> 00:23:13.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If he's right I have to do a shot.\n\n462\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.121\nIf I'm right he has to do two shots.\n\n463\n00:23:15.121 --> 00:23:17.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well he's the model or\n\n464\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.100\nwhatever you call yourselves over here.\n\n465\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.260\nMy God, they're bgp.\n\n466\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.490\nTwo shots for Ronnie.\n\n467\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.020\n>> No.\n\n468\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.380\n>> Because, if we take a look here,\nwhat's this say right here,\n\n469\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.700\nremember how to get to network\n10 via 10.2, that's fine.\n\n470\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.580\nLook at that administrative\ndistance of 20.\n\n471\n00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.940\nYou have eigrp is 90, right?\n\n472\n00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.590\nAnd so I can see,\nhere's to get to 10 and to 20, right?\n\n473\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.060\nCuz it's really what all I'm advertising\noff those other ones, right?\n\n474\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:49.606\nSo if I go back to\nSan Francisco Show IP route and\n\n475\n00:23:49.606 --> 00:23:54.241\nthen there's actually a couple other\ncommands I want to type in and\n\n476\n00:23:54.241 --> 00:23:55.584\nI got to remember.\n\n477\n00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:59.769\nShow ipb, so\nI can see the 10.10.10 network and\n\n478\n00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:04.676\nI should be able to see the other\none from LA, and that he's 20.\n\n479\n00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:08.200\nAdministrative distance of 20 guys but\nlet's do this though.\n\n480\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.450\nLet's get serious here for one second.\n\n481\n00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.240\nLet's do this.\n\n482\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.000\nI don't know how I did that.\n\n483\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.490\nShow ip bgp and\n\n484\n00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.870\nlet's take a look at\nsome of these commands.\n\n485\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.150\nSo show ip bgp, this gets really intense.\n\n486\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.540\nRemember, we can do this with IPv4 and\nIPv6, and so\n\n487\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.480\nI'm gonna just press enter here.\n\n488\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.660\nAnd this is gonna tell me right,\ntake a look at some of this stuff.\n\n489\n00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.370\nThis is some of the stuff\nthey're gonna hit you with.\n\n490\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.660\nAnd I go into detail a lot on\nmy book on some of this stuff.\n\n491\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.970\nSo the next hop,\nright it's gonna say all zeros.\n\n492\n00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.940\nNow this was one of the things that\nI pushed on my book cuz it was in\n\n493\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.260\nthe objectives.\n\n494\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.990\nIf you see something next top was all 0s,\nthat mean it's locally sourced,\n\n495\n00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.970\nmeans you typed in the network command for\nthat, you need to remember this.\n\n496\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.250\nIt's easy for me to see this\nbecause I just typed this, and\n\n497\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.270\nmaybe you remember that.\n\n498\n00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.240\nBut if you're on your exam objectives and\nyou're looking at a router,\n\n499\n00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.570\nyou're not gonna know what they\ntyped in as a network statement, but\n\n500\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.720\nthat's what this all 0s tells you.\n\n501\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.380\nAll right, and so\nwe can see how we can get to them, and\n\n502\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.980\ntheir autonomous system numbers are listed\nover here, all right, so show ip bgp, ip4.\n\n503\n00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:21.160\nLet's take a look here and see what\nelse we can get here and say summary.\n\n504\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.440\nI think that's the one I wanted,\nall right, yeah.\n\n505\n00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.480\nThis is the one, so this one's\ngonna tell me who my neighbors are,\n\n506\n00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.330\nthe version, their autonomous\nsystem number and their message.\n\n507\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.530\nNow this would tell me if I\ndon't see anything in here.\n\n508\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.330\nRight, I'm gonna see message received and\nsent, right.\n\n509\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.880\nWe're going to communicate reliably,\nright, so we want to see these increment.\n\n510\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.640\nIf we see these at zero then we\nknow that they're not working.\n\n511\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.735\n>> All right, then Todd.\n\n512\n00:25:44.735 --> 00:25:48.255\nTodd, thank you for\nshowing us the demonstration there and for\n\n513\n00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:50.160\nme having to take two\ntequila shots as well.\n\n514\n00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.325\n[LAUGH] I do appreciate that.\n\n515\n00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:54.655\n>> I'm buying. [LAUGH] >> Even\nbetter that means more for us.\n\n516\n00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:58.515\nAll right, so when we took a look\nat this particular episode on wans,\n\n517\n00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:01.935\nwe did talk about the idea of\ndifferent VPNs that are out there,\n\n518\n00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:04.455\nas well as creating the gre tunnel.\n\n519\n00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:07.685\nRemember that, there are two different\ntypes of VPNs that are really called out\n\n520\n00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:09.610\nfor the CCNA routing and switching here.\n\n521\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.940\nAnd that's gonna be those\nenterprise type networks,\n\n522\n00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.530\nas well as the service\nprovider base types of vpns.\n\n523\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.210\nHe might make sure that you wanna\ndistinguish how those actually end\n\n524\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.900\nup coming about as well.\n\n525\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.860\nAnd then in the end here, Todd actually\nshowed us a new objective that we'll\n\n526\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.170\nfind on the CCNA for\nthis exam objective period here.\n\n527\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.710\nHe's gonna be bgp and a configuration.\n\n528\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.770\nNotice that the configuration\nis fairly simple but\n\n529\n00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.390\nbgp itself is incredibly powerful.\n\n530\n00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.020\nIt is the routing protocol that we\ntend to see on the internet itself,\n\n531\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.750\nrouting the entire internet.\n\n532\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.860\nSo think, even though those\nconfigurations are fairly simple,\n\n533\n00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.815\nthey're powerful in what they\nactually end up Up doing here.\n\n534\n00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:51.675\nAnd remember that one thing that he\npointed out where I have to take those two\n\n535\n00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:56.415\ntequilla shots,\nBGP has an administrative distance of 20,\n\n536\n00:26:56.415 --> 00:27:00.005\nin comparison, of course,\nto EIGRP that's gonna be higher.\n\n537\n00:27:00.005 --> 00:27:03.955\nSo you might likely see BGP\nconfigurations in your routing table.\n\n538\n00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.305\nIf that's gonna also work, too, and\n\n539\n00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:09.640\nthen of course the verification commands\nthat we see right there as well.\n\n540\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.240\nAll right, so that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n541\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.720\nSigning for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n542\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.970\n>> And Todd Lammie.\n\n543\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.879\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA routing and switching content.\n\n544\n00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:30.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.670\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking that ICND2 content,\n\n4\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.905\ngetting ready for\nthat CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n5\n00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.865\nTo help us to prepare for that, we have\nMr. Todd Lammie here in our studios.\n\n6\n00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.127\nWelcome back to our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.434\n>> All right thanks, great to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.992\nLet's finish up with our last installment\nof the enhanced switching sections.\n\n9\n00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:36.136\nThis is called first hop\nredundancy protocols.\n\n10\n00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.653\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n11\n00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:41.463\nBut I got some good news as we dive\ninto this guys, the first thing is,\n\n12\n00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:44.976\nbefore we dive in,\nwe're only gonna cover one protocol here.\n\n13\n00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:47.396\nNow I don't really necessarily\nlike what they did.\n\n14\n00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:50.262\nYou're gonna like it if you're\nstudying for exam objectives, but for\n\n15\n00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:51.466\nreal life it's not so great.\n\n16\n00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.811\nWe're gonna only cover\nsomething called HSRP.\n\n17\n00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:58.679\nThey took out what you should use today,\nGLBP,\n\n18\n00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.425\ngateway load balancing protocol,\nthat's the much, much better protocol.\n\n19\n00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:05.834\nAnd they're only using\nthe really old HSRP, but\n\n20\n00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.550\nlet's take a look at what that is.\n\n21\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.652\nSo if you're studying for\n\n22\n00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:12.258\nyour exam objective, this is a very short\nsection, so you're happy about that, but\n\n23\n00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:15.030\nyou're not happy about not learning\nwhat you use in production.\n\n24\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.595\nAll right, that being said, so I have a,\nhere's the problem with IP version 4,\n\n25\n00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.611\nI think as I've gotten\ntoo over the past week,\n\n26\n00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.318\nI think you've all realized that\nI think IP version 4 sucks.\n\n27\n00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:24.720\nIt really does.\n\n28\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.738\nFor example, you can only put one default\ngateway on a host, that's ridiculous.\n\n29\n00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.972\nYou've only always been able to do that.\n\n30\n00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:36.053\nSo what they did is they came\nup with something first, a long,\n\n31\n00:01:36.053 --> 00:01:39.830\nlong time ago, before HSRP,\nthat was called proxy arp.\n\n32\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.212\nNow, proxy arp enabled hosts,\nwith no knowledge that says of routers,\n\n33\n00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:49.992\nrouter options to obtain the mac\naddress of the gateway, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:56.252\nSo, basically what that allowed us to\ndo was to just go ahead and arp for it.\n\n35\n00:01:56.252 --> 00:01:57.497\nSo, what we use to do, and\n\n36\n00:01:57.497 --> 00:02:01.208\nyou don't do this anymore, is you\nwouldn't set a default gateway on a host.\n\n37\n00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:05.020\nSo any time you go say,\nto an IP address on a remote network,\n\n38\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.476\nit would just arp for that IP address.\n\n39\n00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:11.082\nThe routers, CISCO routers,\non their interfaces, and\n\n40\n00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:13.945\nyou can see this with\nthe shell IP interface.\n\n41\n00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:17.700\nYou can see that proxy arp is enabled on\nall CISCO routers by default, that means\n\n42\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.693\nit responds to all arp requests for remote\nnetwork and says, I'm that host, rght.\n\n43\n00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:26.287\nAnd what that did is it created just\na tremendous amount of traffic, right, so\n\n44\n00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:31.317\nthat was a solution, but albeit with IP\nversion four again, another poor solution.\n\n45\n00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.198\nRight, then they came up with HSRP.\n\n46\n00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:37.344\nThis is an okay solution, the better\none was GLBP that Cisco came up with.\n\n47\n00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.680\nHSRP, Cisco proprietary\nGLBP Cisco proprietary,\n\n48\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.639\nGLBP though did load balancing across,\nwhere HSRP does not.\n\n49\n00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.380\nWe'll talk about its load balancing\ncapabilities, or lack of, but\n\n50\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.377\nthere was also something called VRRP,\nwhich was in the last objectives,\n\n51\n00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:55.619\nwhich is a non proprietary\nfirst hop redundancy protocol.\n\n52\n00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.785\nSo all you have to study is HSRP,\none command and you're done.\n\n53\n00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:02.006\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this is a very short section.\n\n54\n00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.012\nAll right, so in this case here,\nif we had a default gateway configured and\n\n55\n00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:06.172\nit went down, we were done.\n\n56\n00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:09.812\nSo basically, what it did is,\nwe said, okay, we come over here,\n\n57\n00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:12.672\nwe're gonna have what's\ncalled a virtual router.\n\n58\n00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:16.421\nSo basically, we have a virtual IP\naddress, virtual MAC address, that\n\n59\n00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.538\nresponds to the host The host is talking\nto this one router or one virtual address\n\n60\n00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:24.555\nthe entire time and it doesn't matter\nif one router goes down like over here.\n\n61\n00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:27.553\nThen this router just\nstarts responding okay.\n\n62\n00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:31.079\nSo basically it allows us\nto have a redundancy, and\n\n63\n00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.135\nyou can have up to 8 routers.\n\n64\n00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:38.656\nOne's active one's standby and the other\nones backup routers aren't doing anything.\n\n65\n00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:40.952\nSo, CISCO would love it if you did that,\nright, for\n\n66\n00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:43.841\nevery LAN you had eight standby,\neight backup routers, right.\n\n67\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.501\nSo, at a minimum,\nthis gave us some redundancy, though.\n\n68\n00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:52.462\nNow, so HSRP defines a group of routers,\none active and one standby,\n\n69\n00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:54.913\nall right, and then one virtual.\n\n70\n00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:58.539\nSo, literally, they ask you in the\nobjectives, what are the three modes, and\n\n71\n00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.022\nthis isn't necessarily true, but\nit's active, standby, and virtual.\n\n72\n00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:07.124\nBut just remember that, so\nHSRP defines groups of routers.\n\n73\n00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:10.458\nNow, [COUGH] so virtual IP and\nvirtual MAC addresses are shared,\n\n74\n00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.187\nand there's something I\nwanna share with you here.\n\n75\n00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:16.435\nAnd I'm gonna show you that\nthe virtual MAC address,\n\n76\n00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:20.273\nyou need to be able to pick this\nout in the objectives for Cisco.\n\n77\n00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:23.461\nSo you got your vendor, so this is\na MAC address, and I split it up here.\n\n78\n00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.576\nAnd then here's the Cisco HSRP.\n\n79\n00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:31.069\nSo what you're gonna look for\nis the 07.ac, 07.ac, in the address.\n\n80\n00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.942\nAnd then you have your HSRP group number,\nall right?\n\n81\n00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:39.611\nSo I have to be able to look and see\nthat's it's a virtual Cisco MAC address.\n\n82\n00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.943\nIt's always gonna be Cisco when it's HSRP,\nbut 07.ac is what we're gonna look for.\n\n83\n00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:47.511\nNow to understand HSRP there's\njust there's just a few things.\n\n84\n00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:50.159\nI probably get into a little\nmore detail in book on here.\n\n85\n00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.871\nFirst off, we have timers.\n\n86\n00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:56.737\nThe timers are every three seconds.\n\n87\n00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:01.855\nIf we don't an update in 10 seconds\nwe're going to go ahead and switch over.\n\n88\n00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:04.505\nI've got to tell you,\non today's networks, that's an eternity.\n\n89\n00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.005\nThat's ridiculous.\n\n90\n00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:10.244\nSo I set my customers up in\nhundreds of milliseconds.\n\n91\n00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:14.938\nIf my default gateway doesn't respond in a\nhundred milliseconds, I'm switching over,\n\n92\n00:05:14.938 --> 00:05:15.812\ncuz he's gone.\n\n93\n00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:19.109\nSo right now default is\nthree seconds hello and\n\n94\n00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:23.680\nten seconds dead,\nthat is absolutely ridiculous, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.226\nSo again, think back to early 1990s.\n\n96\n00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.714\nProbably wasn't such a big deal.\n\n97\n00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:30.036\nReally need to change those, and\nas a matter of fact, in my book,\n\n98\n00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.896\nI'm not gonna say it here,\nit's not an objective,\n\n99\n00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:34.586\nin my book I show you how to change it,\nand what I set them to on my customers.\n\n100\n00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:38.080\nAll right, so the active router\nresponds to default gateway, so\n\n101\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.272\nwhen this guy sends a broadcast, right,\nan ARP request, the router responds\n\n102\n00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:45.978\nto default gateway ARP request with\nthe virtual router MAC address.\n\n103\n00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.970\nWell, hold on a second, what about IPv6?\n\n104\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.792\nWe don't use broadcast,\nhow does this work, then?\n\n105\n00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.621\nThe answer is remember if you\ngo back to the IPv6 section,\n\n106\n00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:55.906\nwe don't have to do this.\n\n107\n00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:59.350\nWe have to do this because of\nthe inadequacies of IP version 4.\n\n108\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.370\nWith IP version 6 I'm gonna gather\nall the routers on my link and\n\n109\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.174\nkeep them all in load balanced\nbetween them automatically.\n\n110\n00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:09.960\nSo forget all this,\ngo to IP version 6 and we're done.\n\n111\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.198\nOkay, so, I know, I'm just old and jaded.\n\n112\n00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:14.716\nGotta get rid of IP conversion four.\n\n113\n00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:18.044\nAlright, assumes active voiding and\npackage for the virtual router.\n\n114\n00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.686\nThe active router sends hello messages,\nknows the virtual router IP address, so\n\n115\n00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:24.375\nagain, this is gonna be,\nI'm going to have two different,\n\n116\n00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:27.804\nI'm gonna be watching on this site,\nright, these guys are connected here,\n\n117\n00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.180\nthe virtual is just The virtuals exist\nin IP routers in that same subnet, and\n\n118\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.522\nanybody watching over here is, well,\nbecause if one of those goes down.\n\n119\n00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:38.121\nLet's say this is the active router but\nI lose my internet connection here.\n\n120\n00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.900\nI have to be able to tell the inside\nnetwork, hey, go through a different path.\n\n121\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.135\nSo we can do that.\n\n122\n00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:45.699\nAnyways, so\nwe're going to make up the virtual router.\n\n123\n00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.649\nThe standby router sends hello messages,\nlistens for\n\n124\n00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:53.455\nperiodic If it doesn't here I'm just gonna\nswitch over and, and assumes active 40 and\n\n125\n00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.844\nif it doesn't here from the active router.\n\n126\n00:06:55.844 --> 00:06:59.929\nNow pretty simple configuration here guys,\npretty simple.\n\n127\n00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:02.145\nReally only need one command.\n\n128\n00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:05.380\nI'm gonna use a couple others only\nbecause they were in the objectives.\n\n129\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.950\nOther than that,\nyou might not wanna do it.\n\n130\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.248\nIt probably doesn't even matter.\n\n131\n00:07:08.248 --> 00:07:10.869\nBut in this case here, I have two routers.\n\n132\n00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.879\nThey're on the same LAN, right.\n\n133\n00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.327\nAnd then they'd be talking to\nthe same server networks or\n\n134\n00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:17.275\nmaybe even separate internets, whatever.\n\n135\n00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:19.555\nSo anyways, we go to our interface.\n\n136\n00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:21.735\nSo this is F00 here.\n\n137\n00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:28.413\nAnd say interface F00 IP address,\nso this is my address 10.1.10.2 and\n\n138\n00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:32.199\nthe standby address is 10.1.10.1.\n\n139\n00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:36.850\nSo really, all I need is this command\nright here, standby 1 And a group number\n\n140\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.091\ndoesn't matter as long as I use the same\ngroup number on the other side.\n\n141\n00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:42.849\nIP and use same virtual address.\n\n142\n00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.395\nIf I just go to both routers and type\nin that standby, they'll just come up.\n\n143\n00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:49.165\nAnd the first one up will be the active,\nthe other one will be the standby.\n\n144\n00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:53.730\nAll right, and that's fine unless you say\nwell, I want this particular router To be\n\n145\n00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.935\nmy active router, then I'm gonna do\nsomething like set my priority higher.\n\n146\n00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.682\nSo if the default priority is 100.\n\n147\n00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:04.648\nSo notice this one now set to 110,\nset to this to 90, which would give me,\n\n148\n00:08:04.648 --> 00:08:06.400\nmake me the active router.\n\n149\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.800\nHowever, if the other one becomes up\nfirst it'll become the active, or\n\n150\n00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.110\nif I go down, let's say I'm upgrading it,\nI bring it down the other one takes over.\n\n151\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.580\nI would not become the active again,\nall right,\n\n152\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.220\njust because I have a higher priority.\n\n153\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.540\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nthe other one would have to come down.\n\n154\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.040\nSo that's why they came\nup with the preempt.\n\n155\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.050\nSo this would make sure that\nthe Router A in this case,\n\n156\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.750\nSan Francisco Router,\nis going to be gonna preempt.\n\n157\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.700\nSo when I come back up, I'm gonna force\nsay no, I am active, cuz it says I'm\n\n158\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.930\nactive unless I go down you're not gonna\nbe active and it says no, I preempt you.\n\n159\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.380\nAll right, that may or may not be\nimportant to you but it is an objective.\n\n160\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.936\nThe other thing we're gonna look at and\n\n161\n00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:48.170\ntroubleshoot because again\nlike in either channel.\n\n162\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.150\nThere was real easy configuration.\n\n163\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.800\nSo really going to spend some time on\n\n164\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.830\ntroubleshooting because\nthe configuration's very simple.\n\n165\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.020\nGotta make sure you're\nrunning the same version.\n\n166\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.150\nRight this is all there\nis to it all right.\n\n167\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.580\nSo let's run out and take a look.\n\n168\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.590\nBut before we do I want to take\na look at show standby here.\n\n169\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.490\nLook at this.\n\n170\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.800\nSo, here's my show standby.\n\n171\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.740\nThat's all you have to type.\n\n172\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.900\nIt shows you your state is active.\n\n173\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.650\nThat's good.\n\n174\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.675\nHere's my virtual IP address and\nlook at this guys, what do you see here?\n\n175\n00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:20.240\n07.ac, that's my virtual Mac address and\nmy Cisco address.\n\n176\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.033\nAll right, so and\nthis was the addresses I was using, so\n\n177\n00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:26.657\nthese are different than those other ones,\ncuz I went out and did a lab and\n\n178\n00:09:26.657 --> 00:09:28.638\nI tested this, and it actually works.\n\n179\n00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:32.641\n[LAUGH] Here was my virtual IP address,\nand then here's my standby router, right?\n\n180\n00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:34.355\nI'm 10.1, this is 10.2.\n\n181\n00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:37.690\nThe standby router's priority was 100,\nI don't even remember if I changed it,\n\n182\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.060\nI probably did.\n\n183\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.200\nYeah, I made myself 110.\n\n184\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.100\nAll right, so active router is local.\n\n185\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.016\nMy standby is 10.2.\n\n186\n00:09:45.016 --> 00:09:47.520\nI'm 10.1.\nAnd the 10.2D4 will configure\n\n187\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.000\nit just like this.\n\n188\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.930\nThe other one shows standby brief.\n\n189\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.480\nI can see my interface over here.\n\n190\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.560\nI have 00 group one PRD 110.\n\n191\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.130\nThe P stands for, I must have set a tree\namp because it saying I preempted.\n\n192\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.500\nSo I probably did that.\n\n193\n00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.366\nThe standby is the virtual IP address\n192.168.10.254 and the address of 10.2.\n\n194\n00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:07.950\nAll right, let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n195\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:16.090\nSo do show, I don't need to do.\n\n196\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.415\nI'm gonna make these bigger.\n\n197\n00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:19.533\nShow ip int brief.\n\n198\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:30.790\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at both of these.\n\n199\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.190\nOkay, so I've got 192.68.10.1 and\n192.68.10.2 connected together, so\n\n200\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.010\nI'm gonna ping 192.168.10.2.\n\n201\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.920\nOkay, so I can get to the other one,\nso I'm gonna go to my interface f0_0,\n\n202\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.055\nand what do I type in here, Ronnie?\n\n203\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.340\n>> For the-\n>> So, stand by.\n\n204\n00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.260\nAnd let's see what numbers.\n\n205\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.390\nWhoops, I didn't want to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.270\nStand by and the numbers 0 through 255.\n\n207\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.850\nAlso, you can do authentication.\n\n208\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.410\nNotice that I got preempt, and\n\n209\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.970\npriority, and version, those\nare the ones we want to care about here.\n\n210\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.110\nSo, I'm going to do standby 1 through 255,\n100 is the default.\n\n211\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.270\nSo, if I set it higher But\nthese are my numbers that I wanna use,\n\n212\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.410\nmy group numbers, 122d5.\n\n213\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.278\nSo how many groups can I have with?\n\n214\n00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:12.870\nThis was a good question.\n\n215\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.498\nThat was an objective.\n\n216\n00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:15.413\n255.\n\n217\n00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:17.677\nNow I wanna mention one more\nthing as I'm doing this.\n\n218\n00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.830\nSo I'm just saying standby 1 IP 10.\n\n219\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:25.172\nWhat am I setting this to?\n\n220\n00:11:25.172 --> 00:11:26.340\n192.\n\n221\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.515\nIt has to be in the same subnet.\n\n222\n00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:30.460\n10.\nI'm gonna set it to the last one in\n\n223\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.350\nthe group.\n\n224\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:37.440\nNow, I can do some sort of load balancing,\nthat's why I'd have multiple groups.\n\n225\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.290\nTypically, I'd only have one group.\n\n226\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.220\nBut in this case here I could create\na group, cuz if I have VLAN10, 20 and 30,\n\n227\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.680\nI could say, hey VLAN10 goes to this\nrouter, VLAN20 goes to this router.\n\n228\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.950\nIt's an administrative form of load\nbouncing, it's terrible, it sucks.\n\n229\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.530\nYou have to do it by hand,\nthere's no redundancy Use GLBP.\n\n230\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.670\nWhen you're done with this exam,\ngo use GLBP.\n\n231\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.310\nOkay, so notice I came up as active here.\n\n232\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.865\nI've gotta come over to this other side.\n\n233\n00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:09.987\nInterface F00.\n\n234\n00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:17.925\nStand by one IP put in\nthe same IP address,\n\n235\n00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:23.800\n10.284 and\nwe're actually going to come up with work.\n\n236\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.020\nSo, that's all I really\nneed to do on both sides.\n\n237\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.890\nAs long as I can\ncommunicate to each other.\n\n238\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.520\nNow check this out.\n\n239\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.080\nSo this guy already came\nup cuz he was the only one.\n\n240\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.290\nHe says, well, I'm the active one here.\n\n241\n00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:38.290\nBut I wanna do a couple other things,\nstandby, Priority 110.\n\n242\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.630\nI'm gonna leave that other one as 100,\nI could have lowered him.\n\n243\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.920\nAnd then I wanna do preempt,\nso it's preempt, and\n\n244\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.730\nI wanna preempt and just preempt.\n\n245\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.400\nSo I set mine as I did\nin the example here.\n\n246\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.560\nLet's see what this came came.\n\n247\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.170\nHe came back as standby.\n\n248\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.210\nAs soon as I set this guy,\nthere he showed up as standby.\n\n249\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.960\nBut he would have anyway,\nbecause I came up first.\n\n250\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.080\nSo if I bring this guy down,\nhe would become active.\n\n251\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.690\nSo if I do this, and I say shut.\n\n252\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.290\nWhoops.\n\n253\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.050\nLet me do it over here.\n\n254\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.170\nI'm gonna say shut here,\nI'm shutting down my port.\n\n255\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.760\nThis guy should,\nhe came up immediately as active.\n\n256\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.800\nThat's perfect.\n\n257\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.790\nNow, when I do a no shut,\nif I didn't have the preempt in there,\n\n258\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.460\nhe wouldn't come back as active,\nhe would just stay as standby.\n\n259\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.720\nRight, so it's gonna come up, and then\nwe'll see him come back as active here.\n\n260\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.800\n>> Now, Todd, with the standby preempt,\n\n261\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.810\ndo I need to put in that\ngroup number in there?\n\n262\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.490\n>> I did.\nDid I not do that?\n\n263\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.411\n>> No, that's why I wasn't sure\nif maybe you knew something.\n\n264\n00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:37.190\n[LAUGH]\n>> I did that on purpose.\n\n265\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.012\n>> Okay.\n>> Because I\n\n266\n00:13:38.012 --> 00:13:40.134\nknew it wasn't gonna come up, right?\n\n267\n00:13:40.134 --> 00:13:41.030\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.250\n>> I did, I do need\n\n269\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.030\nthe standby one preempt.\n\n270\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.540\n>> Okay.\n\n271\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.730\n>> That would make a difference here,\nwouldn't it?\n\n272\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.540\nSo, that was a troubleshooting\nopportunity.\n\n273\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.890\nNow, as soon as I knew that was active.So\nthat was a good thing that he brought up.\n\n274\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.550\nI didn't even notice that really.\n\n275\n00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.190\nBut the point was is, I should have come\nback as active as soon as I came back up\n\n276\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.610\nbecause I had that preempt.\n\n277\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.770\nBut I didn't have the group number and\nI'm surprised they let me do that anyways.\n\n278\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.840\nThe other thing guys I want to do is,\nremember show stand.\n\n279\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.410\nLet's take a look here.\n\n280\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.875\nI think we're going to do that login\nin synchronous eventually, don't I?\n\n281\n00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:10.096\n[LAUGH] I'm so lazy.\n\n282\n00:14:10.096 --> 00:14:13.780\n[LAUGH] Group one, stand-by, right?\n\n283\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.870\nLook at this, what do you guys see there?\n\n284\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.010\n07 ac, that's my virtual address, right?\n\n285\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.930\nAnd also I'm running version one,\nall right?\n\n286\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.350\nSo here's my hello and dead timers.\n\n287\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.460\nGuys, seriously change those, all right?\n\n288\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.710\nI'm not going to change them,\nthey're not the objectives here.\n\n289\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.100\nSo here is my virtual MAC address and\nmy virtual IP address.\n\n290\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.600\nIf I did the same thing I'd see,\nI'd see it over there.\n\n291\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.370\nIt's active router is\n10.2 perimite enabled.\n\n292\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.110\nOkay, so in this case here,\nlet's do this though.\n\n293\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.806\nStandby 1 and\n\n294\n00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:55.725\nthen, whoops.\n\n295\n00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:57.115\nThat's why it didn't take that stand by 1.\n\n296\n00:14:57.115 --> 00:15:01.128\nOkay, and then I'm gonna look at,\nI have authentication,\n\n297\n00:15:01.128 --> 00:15:04.495\nfollow IP, name, preempt, timers, track.\n\n298\n00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:05.775\nSo here I can change my timer.\n\n299\n00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:09.590\nSo I'm gonna come back here and\nsay version two.\n\n300\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.470\nMy version two, let's see what happens.\n\n301\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.520\nIt's in initialized state.\n\n302\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.070\nWell, I should've even been in active or\nstandby by now, so\n\n303\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.010\nlet's go ahead and take a look and see if\nthis is a big deal for the CG objectives.\n\n304\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:27.050\nI don't know, maybe, so\nI'm in an it state, show stand.\n\n305\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:32.030\nSee what this guy did, standby routers\nunknown, active router is local,\n\n306\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.240\nso now I'm the local router,\nI'm the active router here.\n\n307\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.960\nSo we're getting a duplicate address,\n[LAUGH], because we changed version,\n\n308\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.725\nit's not working.\n\n309\n00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:44.586\nIt's saying, hey, we got two duplicate\naddresses on here, group one standby.\n\n310\n00:15:44.586 --> 00:15:47.470\nAll right, source by that guy there.\n\n311\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.383\nSo this gave us a problem.\n\n312\n00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:55.072\nSo I'm going to come over here and\nsay config T standby version 2.\n\n313\n00:15:55.072 --> 00:15:57.389\nI've got to do the interface.\n\n314\n00:16:01.938 --> 00:16:05.727\nOkay, so that should do it and that should\nget rid of our dupe I'm hoping in here.\n\n315\n00:16:09.608 --> 00:16:12.271\nShow, stand what are some\nof the other commands?\n\n316\n00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:14.540\nShow, stand by brief I like that one.\n\n317\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.880\nShow, stand okay.\n\n318\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.400\nSo we're still not working here.\n\n319\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.350\nI've really screwed this up didn't I.\n\n320\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:28.445\nI'm status active,\nvirtual address router is local.\n\n321\n00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:29.350\nLet's go over here.\n\n322\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.020\nSo there is local, active route.\n\n323\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.910\nIt must have come up over here, cuz\nit's showing that I'm the active router.\n\n324\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.550\nAll right.\n\n325\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.170\nSo, active routers local, see there, I\ncame back up, I just caught it in between.\n\n326\n00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.727\nThat didn't come up fast enough for me, I\ngot to be honest with you, because I came\n\n327\n00:16:50.727 --> 00:16:54.389\nover here and went there's something wrong\nhere because stand by routers unknown,\n\n328\n00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.340\nand we need at least ten seconds.\n\n329\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.020\nAgain, what I'm showing you here\nis not good enough for production,\n\n330\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.450\ngood enough for the exam here.\n\n331\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.680\nSo, it's priority and\nbecause I was active, I'm sorry,\n\n332\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.660\npreempted In my group, then I became\nthe active even though this guy was up.\n\n333\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.330\nNow, we're both running version two.\n\n334\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.970\nOne of the things you guys are gonna\ncheck, your version number.\n\n335\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.275\nThat's why I did that, I changed\nthat because that's an objective.\n\n336\n00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:19.382\nYou can change your priorities,\nyou can do a preempt if you want.\n\n337\n00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:22.340\nMake sure they're in the same group,\nand then change your priorities.\n\n338\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.840\nAnd that's about it guys.\n\n339\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.865\nOther than that, take your come\nback erase this and do GLBP.\n\n340\n00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:31.770\n>> [LAUGH] All right well, Todd,\nthank you again for introducing us to\n\n341\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.870\nthat first op redundancy protocols\nthat we've been taking a look at here.\n\n342\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.935\nEspecially in the idea of HSRP.\n\n343\n00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:40.353\nEven though this is an older protocol, and\n\n344\n00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:44.584\nTom recommends the use of GLBP instead,\nyou will find this now on the exam,\n\n345\n00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:49.180\nso you do need to make sure that you can\nconfigure it, and make it actually work.\n\n346\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.360\nTom, did you have one more thing?\n\n347\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.030\n>> Yeah, I do Ronny.\n\n348\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.990\nI wanna go over another couple\nthings just to make sure.\n\n349\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.390\nConfiguring this isn't that hard,\nright, it's very, very simple.\n\n350\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.460\nOne command on each side.\n\n351\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.740\nYou can do priorities, preempt.\n\n352\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.530\nBut, let's take a look.\n\n353\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.440\nLet's go ahead and\njump to my computer here and take a look.\n\n354\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.570\nSo, here's some of the things\nthat you guys wanna look at.\n\n355\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.800\nWrong standby IP address.\n\n356\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.260\nThis is what you're gonna\npay attention for the.\n\n357\n00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:14.780\nMake sure you have,\n\n358\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.800\nif it's not working did you type\nin the same standby IP address?\n\n359\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.870\nReally you got a standby,\nyou've got the group.\n\n360\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.480\nSo it's standby, the group number,\nand then the IP address right?\n\n361\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.210\nSo standby, group number.\n\n362\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.890\nAnd then also I showed you we had\na version dispatch that didn't work.\n\n363\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.115\nCame up and gave us and then blocked.\n\n364\n00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:34.830\nNow, let's go to full screen\non me right here, real quick.\n\n365\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.650\nBecause blocked HSRP on my screen place.\n\n366\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:43.000\nBlocked HSRP packets\nbecause one of the reasons\n\n367\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.850\nwhy they would be blocked is\nif you run an HSRP version\n\n368\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.270\n1 then we gonna be using\na multicast address 224.0.0.2.\n\n369\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.304\nThat's not what's going to be\na problem with the blocked.\n\n370\n00:18:54.304 --> 00:18:56.823\nBut it's using UDP port 1985.\n\n371\n00:18:56.823 --> 00:18:57.543\nOkay?\n\n372\n00:18:57.543 --> 00:18:59.888\nYou have to remember this for\nthe exam exact test.\n\n373\n00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:06.064\nHSRP version 1 224.0.0.2,\nport 1985, and UDP.\n\n374\n00:19:06.064 --> 00:19:10.848\nPort version 2 Is using\nthe same port number\n\n375\n00:19:10.848 --> 00:19:15.643\nas well UDP with 224.0.0.102.\n\n376\n00:19:15.643 --> 00:19:16.526\nSo one more thing.\n\n377\n00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:20.490\nIf we take a look here,\nI just wanna make sure and go over these.\n\n378\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.780\nWe have the show stand.\n\n379\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.360\nOkay.\n\n380\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.470\nAnd this is gonna give us our information\nabout our group, which version we're\n\n381\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:33.940\nrunning, our virtual ip address, our\nvirtual mac address and shows stand brief.\n\n382\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.005\nI think it wanted more than that.\n\n383\n00:19:35.005 --> 00:19:36.810\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n384\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.580\nShow stand brief tells me my interface,\nmy group number, my priority.\n\n385\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:47.116\nIf I'm going to preempt ISP, who my\nstandby is and what my virtual address is.\n\n386\n00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.000\n>> All right.\nThank you, Todd, for\n\n387\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.920\nthat additional information there.\n\n388\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.370\nRemember, that as we close out here,\nthis is a great time for\n\n389\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.060\nus to not only be able to do the HSRP but\nalso to be able to verify and\n\n390\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.390\nsome of the things that Todd\njust showed us here as well.\n\n391\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.760\nThat's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off.\n\n392\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.400\nSigning off for\nIT Pro TV I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n393\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.300\n>> And Todd Lamprey.\n\n394\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.186\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA routing and switching

00:00:19.938\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking a look at ICND2 content.\n\n4\n00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:21.046\nWe're getting ready for\n\n5\n00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:24.490\nthat CCNA routing and\nswitching exam that Cisco's just released.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.835\nIn our studio today we have Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:29.630\nTodd Lammle to help ensure that we are\nfocused in on those examine objectives.\n\n8\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.760\nWelcome back to our studios Todd.\n\n9\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.830\n>> All right, great to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470\nLet's dive right in.\n\n11\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.460\nWe're down to our last few episodes for\n\n12\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.020\nthe new ICV2, with all new material\nhere in the last two episodes, right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n14\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.170\nWe're gonna take a look now\nat implementing basic network\n\n15\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.570\ndevice management and advanced security.\n\n16\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.860\nI don't know how advanced this section is\nbut nonetheless we'll take a look at it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.170\nSo first off we wanna talk\nabout mitigating threats\n\n18\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.420\nat the access layer, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.450\nRemember our access distribution core?\n\n20\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.810\nSome of the things you need to remember,\nwe could have a collapsed core we don't\n\n21\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.400\nhave to have a distribution layer or\nactually we don't have to have a core.\n\n22\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.750\nWe can just have a Large\ndistribution layer.\n\n23\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.820\nBut, nonetheless, the access layer, POE.\n\n24\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.140\nThis is our point of entry.\n\n25\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.020\nWe don't have an access list here, so\n\n26\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.480\nthis is where we're gonna\nhave to maybe queue up Wes.\n\n27\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.120\nAnyways, port security,\nRonnie, this sounds familiar.\n\n28\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.290\nWe had port security in the.\n\n29\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840\nIt's important in the ICD2 as well.\n\n30\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.930\nYou must.\n\n31\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.280\nUnderstand port security so\n\n32\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.470\nwe don't need to go over that in here\ncuz you should already have that down.\n\n33\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.450\nLets turn to Ronny and\nsee if he remembers this.\n\n34\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.730\nRonny what's the default if I turn\non switched port security inter\n\n35\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.980\non a switchboard?\n\n36\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.800\n>> If you do that the two defaults\nare going to be the maximum of\n\n37\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.220\none Mac address is can hold and then\n\n38\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.930\nthe violation is going to be shut down\n>> That's right we're punishing those\n\n39\n00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.120\nusers.\n\n40\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.750\nWe want to be careful,\nmake sure we understand those defaults,\n\n41\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.920\nthat's foundation.\n\n42\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.370\nThat's how you can pass the test,\nby understanding foundation.\n\n43\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.880\nSo let's go ahead and talk each of these.\n\n44\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.525\nWe've got port security,\nDHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection,\n\n45\n00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.120\nidentity-based networking.\n\n46\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.550\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n47\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.660\nSo, DHCP, let's go Identity\nbased networking are used\n\n48\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.320\na lot in wireless networks, but some\npeople do it on their Ethernet as well.\n\n49\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.970\nSo DHCP snooping is a layer 2 security\nfeature that helps me validate.\n\n50\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.900\nSo I have trusted ports.\n\n51\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.820\nSo it's a layer 2 security\nfeature that acts like a firewall\n\n52\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.280\nbetween untrusted hosts and\ntrusted DHCP servers.\n\n53\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.210\nThe primary function of\nthis snooping is to prevent\n\n54\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.330\nrogue DHP servers in the network.\n\n55\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.120\nAll right.\n\n56\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.160\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a quick look at that.\n\n57\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.650\nSo if I came over here to my switch, and\n\n58\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.340\nwhat you want to do is pick\nwho's your trusted port.\n\n59\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.030\nRight?\n\n60\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.950\nSo I think it's,\nhaven't done it in a while.\n\n61\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.940\nI think it's IP DHCP snoop, right?\n\n62\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.470\nThere it is, yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.500\nYou can get a little convoluted on this,\n\n64\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.380\nyou can get deep in this\nif you really want to.\n\n65\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.700\nSo I basically just enabled it.\n\n66\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.650\nRight?\nSo that's gonna do it.\n\n67\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.860\nWhat it's gonna do is build a database,\n\n68\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.600\nnow, of who's talking to who on\ntrusted and untrusted ports.\n\n69\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.987\nSo, now if I go to an interface,\nis it ip dhcp again?\n\n70\n00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:22.990\nYep.\n\n71\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.140\nSnooping.\nThere we go.\n\n72\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.950\nAnd now we can put which VLANs we're going\nto look at, which ones we're gonna trust.\n\n73\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.840\nSo we could say trust this.\n\n74\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.690\nInterface.\n\n75\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.080\nSo this is a trust interface.\n\n76\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.530\nWe know there's a DHB server on here.\n\n77\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.450\nOr we could say the other\nones are untrusted, right?\n\n78\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.820\nAnd then show IPDHC, let's see if that.\n\n79\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.790\nSnoopy, and\nthen we'll be able to see our database.\n\n80\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.110\nSo we can see I have a trusted port now,\nand then we can choose our untrusted port.\n\n81\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.130\nSo it's actually a little bit above\nthe CCNA objectives there, but here's how\n\n82\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.000\nyou guys do this, here's what I want you\nguys to do, if I had time I would do this.\n\n83\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.090\nTake two DHCP servers,\njust two Cisco routers,\n\n84\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.970\nyou already know how to build\nDHCP servers with Cisco routers.\n\n85\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.070\nMake sure you do this.\n\n86\n00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.650\nPlug them in, make one trusted and\nuntrusted, and then come in here and\n\n87\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.660\nsee that that port was blocked, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.280\nNow DAI.\n\n89\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900\nThis is my ARP, just stops ARP\npoisoning that I make ARP, right?\n\n90\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.270\nSo to be able to get this working,\n\n91\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.640\nwe need DHCP snooping enabled,\nDHCP snooping enabled, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.600\nSo this is DAI dynamic ARP inspection\nintercepts all ARP requests and\n\n93\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.590\nlooks at that data base that we built for\nthe untrusted ports.\n\n94\n00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.370\nIt verifies each intercepted packet for\na valid IP to mac address.\n\n95\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.090\nAnd makes sure, it says hey you\nwere assigned to this IP address,\n\n96\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.840\nthis stops our poisoning doesn't it now,\nidentity based networking\n\n97\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.420\na lot of times I'll use this in wireless\nbecause we're going to have them log in\n\n98\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.230\nto a radius server, and EAP Server,\nsome sort of EAP server,\n\n99\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.770\nand, but we can do this on wired\nas well as we're seeing here.\n\n100\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.460\nSo this is called 802.1X.\n\n101\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.850\nIt's relatively easy to set up,\nwe just need a triple A server.\n\n102\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.590\nAnd we can then authenticate\nour users right and\n\n103\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.000\nthen we can use our AB\nto authenticate then.\n\n104\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.550\nSo this stops someone from plugging into a\nport and just being able to and they're on\n\n105\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.430\nyour network they're on that vlan they\nget an IP address that's not gonna happen\n\n106\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.310\nuntil they authenticate through the LDAP\nthrough the 802.1x right radius.\n\n107\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.930\nAll right.\n\n108\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.660\nSo that's a pretty good one here.\n\n109\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.640\nNow external authentication.\n\n110\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.590\nThis we can use, for here's our radius,\nI need to go full screen on you, guys.\n\n111\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.990\nRadius, TACACS+ on this one.\n\n112\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.240\nNotice we have our\nauthentication services.\n\n113\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.560\nNow here's the differences you need\nto know for the exam objectives.\n\n114\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.800\nRADIUS uses UDP and is.\n\n115\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.970\nWhoops, that was a P.\n\n116\n00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.610\nUDP.\nI started writing TCP before I finished.\n\n117\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.040\nAnd TACACS is sisal proprietary and\nuses TCP.\n\n118\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.440\nSo RADIUS isn't proprietary.\n\n119\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.680\nSo a lot of people use RADIUS.\n\n120\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.280\nI mostly use RADIUS as well.\n\n121\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.330\nBut TACACS.\n\n122\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.080\nAnd the reason, let's talk about\nthe reasons between these, is because\n\n123\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.540\non the RADIUS you can't separate\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n124\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.278\nOn TACACS I can authorize.\n\n125\n00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:30.820\nyou know, networks,\n\n126\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.830\nand but authenticate using\na different authentication process.\n\n127\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.630\nWith Radius I'm not allowed to do that.\n\n128\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.830\nThat is why people use Tacacs because\nyou can break up the features of\n\n129\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.580\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n130\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.850\nWith Radius I can't and with Tacacs I can.\n\n131\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.720\nRadius is UDP and Tacacs Is TCP.\n\n132\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.710\nNow let's go ahead and\ntake a look at some configurations.\n\n133\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.920\nSo when would I use this?\n\n134\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.440\nWell, for the 2, we could use this for\na lot of things.\n\n135\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.990\nBut I have a Cisco router,\nfor example or Cisco switch.\n\n136\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.350\nNow I can go in there and\ncreate a local database.\n\n137\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.130\nRemember, we did the SSH log in local And\nwe're still gonna do that, but\n\n138\n00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.130\nwe're gonna use that as a backup.\n\n139\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.920\nSo what we'll wanna do is create\na central place for our authentication.\n\n140\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.720\nAnd that way when, let's say, an admin\nquits, we just go into the server and\n\n141\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.360\nchange the password for\nthe naval secret on one device.\n\n142\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.650\nIf you had hundreds of devices,\nsee, if I did the local database,\n\n143\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.150\nthat wouldn't scale very well, right?\n\n144\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.630\nAnd that's really what this is all about.\n\n145\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.530\nThis works very well and\n\n146\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.450\nthen what you do is you have that local\ndata still as a backup in case this fails.\n\n147\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.290\nYou create a back door.\n\n148\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.380\nIf you don't have a back door,\nI've had clients that called me and\n\n149\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.210\nsaid our admin quit, we don't know\nhow to get into the radius server,\n\n150\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.990\nwe don't have the key and\nwe can't log in, right?\n\n151\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.515\nNo backdoor so they weren't prompted for\nthe local database, right?\n\n152\n00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:53.560\nThat maybe you want that.\n\n153\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.757\nThat's pretty secure.\n\n154\n00:07:54.757 --> 00:07:58.565\nBut then, I had to go into all the devices\nand break into them by hand, right?\n\n155\n00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.583\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the configuration here.\n\n156\n00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:05.830\nAll right, so first off we have to,\nI know this is kind of hard to see.\n\n157\n00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.390\nWe want to enable the AAA new model,\nright?\n\n158\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:15.050\nSo, I'm not gonna show this when I get\nto tagx because once I turn this on,\n\n159\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.340\nit's on, right?\n\n160\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.730\nWith AAA, now here is my,\n\n161\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.880\nto avoid being locked out,\nI wanna configure a local user, right?\n\n162\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.460\nSo there's that username and password.\n\n163\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.820\nWe use this both when we did SSH and\nwhen we did the PPP authentication.\n\n164\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.200\nAll right, now I'm gonna go ahead and\ndefine my server as a RADIUS server.\n\n165\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.160\nNow two things here.\n\n166\n00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.740\nSo I'm gonna create a server,\nRADIUS server SRV, right?\n\n167\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.780\nThat's just whatever name I made up here.\n\n168\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.220\nAnd then the address,\nI'm using IP version four in this example.\n\n169\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.380\nAnd the IP address of my server and\nthen the key.\n\n170\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.839\nNow, this has to be the same key\nthat's on the RADIUS server.\n\n171\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.780\nAll right, now we're gonna create a RADIUS\ngroup, where we say AAA group server\n\n172\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.730\nradius and then add the server name,\nwhich must match here.\n\n173\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.470\nOkay, and then we're gonna go ahead and\nspecify the group to be used.\n\n174\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.490\nSo I'm gonna come down here.\n\n175\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.080\nAnd then I'm gonna say login default\ngroup RADIUS and then fall back to local.\n\n176\n00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:24.052\nOkay so we need to specify for when we\nlook at this, let's go ahead and go to my,\n\n177\n00:09:24.052 --> 00:09:25.930\nwhoops make this smaller.\n\n178\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.429\nLet me go to my router here, and\nthen we're just gonna go up to LA.\n\n179\n00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:39.140\nAnd I want to specify the host name or\nthe IP address of the server.\n\n180\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.610\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do, config t.\n\n181\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.400\nMan, I can't spell config t today.\n\n182\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.510\nWhat is up with that?\n\n183\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.330\nI've only done it for, I don't know,\n32 years or something.\n\n184\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.070\nSo.\n\n185\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.490\nAAA new, let's see what we got.\n\n186\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.430\nWe got a couple things under here,\nbut this is gonna turn it on.\n\n187\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.640\nAnd now this will disable all\nthe old commands when they mean old,\n\n188\n00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.180\nwe're talking more than a decade ago.\n\n189\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.801\nBut the new access control commands and\nfunctions.\n\n190\n00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.933\nAll right, so now I've got AAA.\n\n191\n00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:07.240\nSo accounting authorization and\nauthentication.\n\n192\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.150\nI don't know if it's that order,\nI can't remember.\n\n193\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.850\nAnyways, so let's talk about this.\n\n194\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.870\nI wanna specify the host name or\nIP address.\n\n195\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:20.540\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate my local database.\n\n196\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.050\nAll right.\n\n197\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.610\nI gotta have a backup.\n\n198\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.810\nYou may not do this.\n\n199\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.740\nI've had customers that didn't do this.\n\n200\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.725\nBut then be prepared that\nif something happens.\n\n201\n00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:29.310\n>> You're locked out?\n>> That you have to break it.\n\n202\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.920\nYeah, your admin, [LAUGH] Takes off, yeah.\n\n203\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.050\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate my RADIUS server.\n\n204\n00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:40.080\nSo we can see that we have RADIUS.\n\n205\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.430\nIt's dash server, isn't it?\n\n206\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.900\nI think I did RADIUS,\nI guess it is -server, radius -server.\n\n207\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.960\nAnd I'm just gonna call it myradiusSrv.\n\n208\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.020\nI like Srv.\n\n209\n00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.190\nIt didn't like that.\n\n210\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.218\nWhat did I do wrong here?\n\n211\n00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.600\nradius -server myradiusSrv.\n\n212\n00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:07.030\nI'm not in the right place,\nwhat happened here?\n\n213\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.710\nRADIUS server.\n\n214\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.422\nNo, no, no, I'm in the right place.\n\n215\n00:11:18.705 --> 00:11:19.205\nWhat?\n\n216\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.730\nAll right, so I was using RADIUS server,\n\n217\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.440\nwhatever your name is.\n\n218\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.100\nMy RADIUS server in this case, so.\n\n219\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.110\nAnd then I wanna put\nthe address in of my servers.\n\n220\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:41.250\nAnd that I'm gonna use IPv4,\nand 10.10.10.254 is my server.\n\n221\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.862\nAnd then I'm gonna put the key N-0,\n\n222\n00:11:45.862 --> 00:11:49.186\nlet's see, W-@-Y in.\n\n223\n00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:49.754\nHow about that?\n\n224\n00:11:49.754 --> 00:11:50.625\nDo you like that one?\n\n225\n00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:54.101\n>> I do like it, but\nyou said 10.10.10.254.\n\n226\n00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:55.110\nIs that okay?\n\n227\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.710\n>> Yeah, no, I do have that wrong.\n\n228\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.610\nHe's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.800\n>> So making a typo.\n\n230\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.370\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, 252 is my access server.\n\n231\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.395\nSo make sure you got\nyour IP address right.\n\n232\n00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:05.510\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n233\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.130\n>> It'd be nice if you could test\nit from here, like on some GUIs,\n\n234\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.050\non some security,\nthey have a test button to test,\n\n235\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.030\nhey does your authentication work\nfrom here and stuff like that.\n\n236\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.590\nThat would be nice.\n\n237\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.510\nAnd then keynote, so now the key string\nspecifies the authentication and\n\n238\n00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.400\nencryption keys that is used between\nthis and the access server, and\n\n239\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.260\nthose have to match on both devices.\n\n240\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.950\nNow we need to add the RADIUS\nserver to a server group, right?\n\n241\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.280\nSo we need to add this server group.\n\n242\n00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.980\nSo, this is going to be\nmy AAA commands isn't it?\n\n243\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.370\nSo, let's go ahead and\nadd my server group in here.\n\n244\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.733\nSo, I'm going to say,\nAAA group server RADIUS and\n\n245\n00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:44.111\nmy server is just Lammlelogin.\n\n246\n00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.490\nOkay, and then, server name.\n\n247\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.690\nWhat did I put as my server name?\n\n248\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.065\nMy-\n>> RADIUS.\n\n249\n00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:52.440\n>> Now remember, no dashes in here.\n\n250\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.660\nThey almost had me there.\n\n251\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.880\nMy RADIUS server.\n\n252\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.896\nDid I spell that right?\n\n253\n00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:59.347\nRADIUS SRV.\n\n254\n00:12:59.347 --> 00:12:59.930\nOkay, looks right.\n\n255\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.870\nAll right so those are gonna match.\n\n256\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.959\nAnd then I want to set to use my\nlocal database, that's about it.\n\n257\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:13.230\nAnd then when we get to authentication,\nyou have to pretty much type it all.\n\n258\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:21.090\nLogin default group RADIUS and\nthen back up to local if that fails.\n\n259\n00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.270\nAll right, that's it.\n\n260\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.940\nNow I can come here and try this.\n\n261\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.320\nSo I've got my RADIUS on here.\n\n262\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.538\nSo if I log out, I should be,\nlet me see if I can exist all the way out.\n\n263\n00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:34.450\nI should be prompted now, there it is.\n\n264\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.923\nI have todd.lammle.\n\n265\n00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:40.126\nNow if that doesn't work, which have\nto say password, it's gonna go back and\n\n266\n00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:42.150\nauthenticate on the local database.\n\n267\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.550\nSo if I can't get to my server, but\nit looks like I'm getting there.\n\n268\n00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:47.050\nSome day.\n\n269\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.051\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now the tacacs server,\n\n270\n00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:54.360\nwe're gonna run right into tacacs as well.\n\n271\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.370\nThere we go, boy, that was efforting.\n\n272\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.950\n>> It was.\n>> Although server is pretty\n\n273\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.560\nmuch the same thing.\n\n274\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.180\nNow when I type this in,\nit's gonna override the RADIUS, right?\n\n275\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.940\nSo the is gonna override the RADIUS.\n\n276\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.890\nIn this case here.\n\n277\n00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.410\nSo we're pretty much going\nto do the same thing here.\n\n278\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:15.750\nAnd I would practice this,\ntacx, it's not tacx plus but\n\n279\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.100\nI do need to do a config t,\nwhich I can't seem to type today.\n\n280\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.458\nLet's see if I type tacx\n>> Server\n\n281\n00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:26.472\n>> Oops, server.\n\n282\n00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:30.000\nOkay, and then I just need my address.\n\n283\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.738\nOkay, a couple things I don't have to do,\nthe database is already there,\n\n284\n00:14:35.738 --> 00:14:39.480\nAAA new model,\nthose commands are already there.\n\n285\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.940\nRight?\nSo at this point I'm just gonna\n\n286\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.490\noverride the RADIUS\ncommands with the tech x.\n\n287\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.050\nAll right.\n\n288\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.337\nSo address IPv4 10 10 10 254.\n\n289\n00:14:49.337 --> 00:14:55.664\nI put in the right IP address,\nand then key,\n\n290\n00:14:55.664 --> 00:15:00.790\nmy key is no, way, is that right?\n\n291\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.760\n>> Yes.\n\n292\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.410\n>> That's right.\n\n293\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.240\nAll right.\n\n294\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.960\nSo AAA group server.\n\n295\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.830\nLet's see if that takes tacacs, and\nthis time we use plus tacacs, okay?\n\n296\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.170\nSo, if I look like that,\nit doesn't like that.\n\n297\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:14.860\nI spelled that wrong.\n\n298\n00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.980\nServer, group, hold on a second.\n\n299\n00:15:24.748 --> 00:15:26.180\nThere we go.\n\n300\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.360\nYou have to be in the right place\nto be able to use the help screens.\n\n301\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.540\nOkay, so\nI'm just calling this tacacs, A-C-S.\n\n302\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.620\nOkay, there we go.\n\n303\n00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.380\nAnd then again, I needed to tell, oop,\n\n304\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.930\ndidn't like that, I have to create\nthat server, but no big deal.\n\n305\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.997\nAt authentication,\nnow you gotta type this whole thing out,\n\n306\n00:15:46.997 --> 00:15:49.930\nlogin default group tacacs local.\n\n307\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:57.778\nOkay, now if I logout it's going\nto log me in using tacacs now.\n\n308\n00:15:57.778 --> 00:15:59.045\nSo she can come back and\n\n309\n00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:03.257\nprompt me if I use same password which\nhopefully gets to the server, okay.\n\n310\n00:16:03.257 --> 00:16:05.126\nAll right, well that came back.\n\n311\n00:16:05.126 --> 00:16:05.985\n>> Much faster.\n\n312\n00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:07.657\n>> So TCP right?\n\n313\n00:16:07.657 --> 00:16:09.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n314\n00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.570\n>> All right, so one more thing.\n\n315\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.660\nSo let's go back over here guys.\n\n316\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.690\nSo on the TACACS here same thing and\n\n317\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.970\nremember this overrides authentication\nof the radius when I do this.\n\n318\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.370\nI wanna talk about one more thing\nin this episode and that's SNMP.\n\n319\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:31.110\nNow, SNMP has been an objective for\na while but they got a little bit deeper.\n\n320\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.529\nNothing really that serious but we haven't\nreally done much of a config before so\n\n321\n00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:36.100\nwe'll go ahead and configure it.\n\n322\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.290\nNo big deal.\n\n323\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.220\nSo SNMP, let's talk about this,\n\n324\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.900\nthey like to push on some of the details\non this so we're gonna be careful here.\n\n325\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.180\nSNMP uses a MIB,\nmanagement inform base, an agent, and\n\n326\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:56.200\na manager, a network management station.to\nhit the alerts, to hit the traps.\n\n327\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.120\nOkay, trap messages alert the manager\nto a condition on the network and\n\n328\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.840\nyou gotta be careful though,\nthere's three different versions.\n\n329\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.660\nWe're gonna talk about these.\n\n330\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.210\nProbably don't use version one today.\n\n331\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.470\nI think most people use version two but\nversion three is certainly available.\n\n332\n00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:16.320\nIf we have this running on every device\nit can cause an overload, right,\n\n333\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.360\nof a CPU on some managed devices.\n\n334\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.148\nIf you're sending what we call large\nget messages because we're saying,\n\n335\n00:17:23.148 --> 00:17:27.100\nhey give me your CPU,\ngive me your power supply information,\n\n336\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.993\ngive me your heat,\nall of this information.\n\n337\n00:17:29.993 --> 00:17:33.614\nAnd we can just be pounding this\nevery minute, these devices, and\n\n338\n00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:35.170\ncause an overload on them.\n\n339\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.490\nSo we want to be careful.\n\n340\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.340\nSo let's talk about these three versions,\nguys, and get the detail on this.\n\n341\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.080\nI'm gonna,\nwe're gonna go full screen on this.\n\n342\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.490\nSNMP has three versions,\nwith version one not being really used.\n\n343\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.470\nNow there's not a lot of difference\nbetween one and two, but\n\n344\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.200\nyou're going to realize this.\n\n345\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.774\nFirst off plaintext configuration\nwith community strings.\n\n346\n00:17:54.774 --> 00:18:00.120\nSNMP uses plaintext authentication\nwith community strings.\n\n347\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.320\nSo they use the same authentication.\n\n348\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.870\nAll right, so SNMPv1 and\nversion two use the same authentication.\n\n349\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.950\nDon't get screwed up on your objectives.\n\n350\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:14.120\nVersion three now gives me strong\nauthentication with MD5 or SHA, right.\n\n351\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.220\nNow, the version two or\nversion one gives us the GET BULK.\n\n352\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.375\nNow so what this did,\nwhat this does is to create,\n\n353\n00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:25.961\n[COUGH]\ninstead of me sending to get,\n\n354\n00:18:25.961 --> 00:18:27.530\nhey give me your power supply.\n\n355\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:32.150\nOkay, give me your heat,\ngive me your CPU cycles and so on.\n\n356\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.018\nGive me your interface statuses,\nright, one at a time.\n\n357\n00:18:35.018 --> 00:18:38.460\nSo what we can do is send a GET BULK and\nit's just one message and\n\n358\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.080\nthey send it all back at one time.\n\n359\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.910\nSo we started that with version two.\n\n360\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.120\nSo GET BULK started with version two.\n\n361\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.600\nAlso we can see how on here the GET BULK\nwe have it in four error message, right.\n\n362\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.810\nSo instead of just sending a trap,\n\n363\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.600\nwe also have an inform error\nmessage that came with version two.\n\n364\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.550\nSo really all of the features, so\nbe careful on your objectives here,\n\n365\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.977\nall the features you want\nto answer version three.\n\n366\n00:19:00.977 --> 00:19:03.960\nRight, you're gonna say, hey what is this,\nthis is awesome, it's new,\n\n367\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.715\nit's great, it's version three,\nright, pick me.\n\n368\n00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:11.650\nRight, it's not version two gave us\nmost of the features, version three then\n\n369\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.156\ngave us the authentication, right, the\nupgraded authentication, and it uses TCP.\n\n370\n00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:18.830\nSo is GET BULK supporting\nversion three at inform?\n\n371\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.570\nSure it is, but\n\n372\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.200\nit started in version two, those are the\nthings you need to remember, all right.\n\n373\n00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.510\nNow the overview SNMP manager\npolls agents on the network and\n\n374\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.792\ndisplays information, right,\nan NMS, network management station.\n\n375\n00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:33.880\nWhat is SolarWinds?\n\n376\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:40.400\nI used to use HP OpenView, there's all\nsorts of other NMS stuff out there.\n\n377\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.670\nSNMP agents, these store information,\nrespond to manager requests,\n\n378\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.900\ngenerates traps, and then the MIB\ncontains a database of objects.\n\n379\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.100\nThese are called information variables,\nand\n\n380\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.920\nthese objects are what we can\nget information on, right.\n\n381\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.640\nNow to configure it, relatively simple.\n\n382\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.750\nAnd you want to think about I can\ngo out here and create a contact.\n\n383\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.160\nAnd what happens, so\nif I'm getting information and\n\n384\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.300\nthere's a problem with it,\nthen SNMP can tell me who's the contact,\n\n385\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.240\nwhere it's at, where is this device\nthat's having problems for example.\n\n386\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.080\nSo here I can say contact, location.\n\n387\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.010\nNow there's a read only and read write.\n\n388\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.230\nThink of these as your line password,\nyour console password, and\n\n389\n00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.140\nyour enable secret, right, because now\nI can go ahead and change or rewrite.\n\n390\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.160\nI have them both the same here,\nI don't recommend that.\n\n391\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.350\nAll right, I just set them here for\nsimplicity.\n\n392\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.840\nOkay, and then who's my NMS station\nhere and then the password.\n\n393\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.580\nNSMP server host and\nthen I can do show SNMP community.\n\n394\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.080\nLet's go ahead and let's have some fun.\n\n395\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.790\nSo let's do this on,\nyou want to do this on a switch?\n\n396\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.290\n>> Sure.\n\n397\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.380\n>> Okay, so go ahead and\nplay with this guys.\n\n398\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.834\nI still can't spell config today.\n\n399\n00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:55.216\n[LAUGH] So SNMP, SNMP-server,\n\n400\n00:20:55.216 --> 00:21:00.220\nall right whoops, and then question mark.\n\n401\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.810\nAnd then we can see all our different\noptions that we can hit here.\n\n402\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.780\nSo we've got chassis ID, these are some\nof the stuff that I can put in here.\n\n403\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.117\nAnd so, at this point I'm gonna\nsay contact, Todd@Langley.com, or\n\n404\n00:21:13.117 --> 00:21:15.260\nyou can put a phone number in there.\n\n405\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.590\nWhat else we got?\n\n406\n00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:27.425\nLocation Building 4, floor 3.\n\n407\n00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:29.550\nRoom 201.\n\n408\n00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:36.030\nI was this specific at times when I\nworked at Hughes, we had 64 buildings.\n\n409\n00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.690\nAnd then just telling me what\nbuilding I'm in did nothing, right.\n\n410\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I need to know what floor it was and\n\n411\n00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.610\nthen being that these were huge buildings,\nwhat room it's in.\n\n412\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.650\nThat's helpful.\n\n413\n00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.130\nHaving the contact\ninformation is very helpful.\n\n414\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.900\nThe problem with picking\na particular person is\n\n415\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.860\nin a company like that with 30,000 users,\nthey come and go pretty quickly.\n\n416\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.999\nAll right, so now we go ahead and\nset our community strings.\n\n417\n00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:04.558\nCommunity, I think it's community, yeah?\n\n418\n00:22:04.558 --> 00:22:06.555\nCommunity string.\n\n419\n00:22:06.555 --> 00:22:07.658\nLet's just see what we got.\n\n420\n00:22:07.658 --> 00:22:08.599\nString.\n\n421\n00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:11.751\nOkay, so I'm just going to say community,\nI want to say the password, and\n\n422\n00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:13.080\nthis can be lower case.\n\n423\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.700\nAnd now it's going to be read only or\nread write.\n\n424\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.692\nNotice I can put an access list here,\nall right.\n\n425\n00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:20.902\nA little bit above the objectives to be\nhonest with you, but you can go ahead and\n\n426\n00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:22.020\nadd an access list.\n\n427\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.610\nIt's probably a good idea, right.\n\n428\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.890\nWe want a secure SMP.\n\n429\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.770\nWe're obviously being able to\ngive a lot of information, right.\n\n430\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.214\nSo in this case I'm gonna say read only.\n\n431\n00:22:30.214 --> 00:22:36.320\nAnd then I'll set this capital L emmle and\nread write.\n\n432\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.900\nNow I can go and change the MIBS, where\nread only I can only get the information.\n\n433\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.360\nWe don't people to get that either, right.\n\n434\n00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.860\nAnd then I wanna say who my host is,\nwho's my MMS station.\n\n435\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:54.449\nSo SNMP server host 10.10.10.254.\n\n436\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.726\nAnd then [COUGH]\n>> Password.\n\n437\n00:22:58.726 --> 00:23:01.910\n>> The password that's on there.\n\n438\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.860\nNow show SNMP.\n\n439\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.700\nWhoops, let's try that again.\n\n440\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.800\nShow SNMP, we'll do a question mark.\n\n441\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.810\nWe can see quite a bit of information,\ncheck this out.\n\n442\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.580\nSo I say, hey, I'm in this device.\n\n443\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.060\nWho's the contact, right?\n\n444\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.440\nSo, I should be able to have done that.\n\n445\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.120\nI always type as little as possible\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.030\n>> I am extremely lazy when it\n\n447\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.650\ncomes to typing.\n\n448\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.820\nWell you try writing 76 books and\nsee how lazy you are writing, okay, so\n\n449\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.000\nI type as little as possible.\n\n450\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.640\nMy fingers only got a few more\nkey strokes before I'm dead so.\n\n451\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.750\nAll right, so show SNMP community.\n\n452\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.800\nWe could do view user sessions,\nthe MIBs locations and so on.\n\n453\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.060\nBut we can see all our information\nhere our community strings,\n\n454\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.250\nread only, and so on.\n\n455\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.445\nSo quite a bit of information\nthat we can get from here.\n\n456\n00:23:47.445 --> 00:23:52.290\nOkay, so good enough for our SNMP.\n\n457\n00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:56.220\nRemember, read only similar to login\npassword, similar to enable secret.\n\n458\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.240\nAnd I think that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n459\n00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.730\nSo we are all set.\n\n460\n00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.250\nRonny, so, lead us on out.\n\n461\n00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.060\n>> All right, so remember what we took\na look at in this episode as we rap things\n\n462\n00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.460\nup here on the idea of basic network\nmanagement for these types of devices.\n\n463\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.440\nWe took a look at DHCP snooping, right.\n\n464\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.670\nThe ability to ensure that we don't have\nsomebody else plug in another DHCP server\n\n465\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.170\nthat will actually go ahead and\nalso hand information like that out.\n\n466\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.910\nWe also of course then talked about\nthe authentication that we can do.\n\n467\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.670\nEven though we can authenticate locally\nagainst that device's username,\n\n468\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.990\npassword, database.\n\n469\n00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.220\nWell a lot of times in\na large organization,\n\n470\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.970\nbecause it's actually going to be\nan organization that tends to grow and\n\n471\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.880\nchange a lot, we may instead choose to\nuse something like Radius or Attack Axe.\n\n472\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.030\nRemember that Radius actually uses UDP and\nAttack Axe use,\n\n473\n00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.470\nof course, TCP to help in that\ncommunication, that traffic.\n\n474\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.750\nTodd also demonstrated\nthe configurations for\n\n475\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.020\neach of those to show you how simple\nit is to actually get set up.\n\n476\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.600\nSometimes you may experience\na little bit of latency,\n\n477\n00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.600\nespecially by using radius here.\n\n478\n00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.880\nBut you actually see that it did work and\nthat we were able to see that.\n\n479\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.540\nAnd then we actually took a look at SNMP,\nright, the ability to actually\n\n480\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.220\nunderstand that this is where we can get a\nlot of information off of our devices here\n\n481\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.835\nregardless of what type\nof device that they are.\n\n482\n00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:15.640\nBut inside of the world of Cisco we\nuse this quite a bit to get a bunch of\n\n483\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.220\ninformation that we need.\n\n484\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.750\nNow in this remember there's\nthree different versions.\n\n485\n00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.170\nYou do want to pay attention\nto those three versions.\n\n486\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.740\nUsually a pretty high exam topic there.\n\n487\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.090\nAnd of course, how do you actually\nset those username and passwords, and\n\n488\n00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.640\nwhat's the difference between\nread only and read write.\n\n489\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.520\nYou'll see those types of things on the\nexam as you actually come to it as well.\n\n490\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.510\nBut remember that for the exam, again,\nspeed and accuracy is the key here.\n\n491\n00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.910\nThere's no time for\nyou to actually sit down and\n\n492\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.070\njust try and wonder sometimes whether or\nnot it's the right answer.\n\n493\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.380\nSo that means you got to get all the\nanswers correct before you get there on\n\n494\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.850\nthe exam as well.\n\n495\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.920\nAnd if any of this sounds\nchallenging to you,\n\n496\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.060\nmake sure you check out Todd's\nbook on this, especially for\n\n497\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.690\nthe new objectives that are coming out and\nget more details there as well.\n\n498\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.410\nWell that's a great place for us to go\nahead and sign off for this episode then.\n\n499\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.470\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong\n>> And I'm Todd Lanley.\n\n500\n00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.289\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCNA routing and switching content.\n\n501\n00:26:10.289 -->

00:00:19.754\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're taking a look at ICND2 content.\n\n4\n00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.244\nWe're getting ready for\nthat Cisco CCNA Routing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:24.920\nSwitching exam that Cisco's just released.\n\n6\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.613\nAnd in our studios today is gonna be Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:29.740\nTodd Lammle helping to ensure that\nwere focused on the right things.\n\n8\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.986\nThank you for being here Todd.\n\n9\n00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:32.387\n>> All right guys,\n\n10\n00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:37.500\nand as our last episode, if you were doing\nthis in order, this would be the one last.\n\n11\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.130\nAnd maybe you are, maybe you aren't.\n\n12\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.836\nBut nonetheless,\n\n13\n00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:43.889\nwe are gonna take a look at the evolution\nof intelligent networks as a CCNA sees it.\n\n14\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.231\nTrust me, this is a high level overview.\n\n15\n00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:49.560\nNow there is some detail on here for\nthe exam.\n\n16\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.269\nThat's what we're gonna hone in on, right.\n\n17\n00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.870\nSo I'm gonna go through there, I've got\na great lab for this, so it's pretty fun.\n\n18\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.100\nAnd so we're gonna finish this\noff with a bang, all right?\n\n19\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.840\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look here.\n\n20\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.250\nSo the first thing is,\nunderstand Switch Stacking, all right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460\nI don't know evolution of\nintelligence switching.\n\n22\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.520\nThis has been around for a while.\n\n23\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.340\nAnd this is a great technology,\nthough, I gotta be honest with you.\n\n24\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.480\nI have a lot of customers that use this.\n\n25\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.180\nI use this with my customers.\n\n26\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.950\nSo I come in here and\nwe take these cables and, where's my pen?\n\n27\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.637\nHere it is and we connect these up.\n\n28\n00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:23.387\nAnd we basically have kind of a master,\nand then what's nice is if you plug\n\n29\n00:01:23.387 --> 00:01:26.788\nthem in, it just auto configures\nitself and looks one big switch.\n\n30\n00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:29.374\nWe have one IP address to\nmanage the whole thing.\n\n31\n00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:33.481\nSo this is nice because instead\nof a line like the 8500s, but\n\n32\n00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:37.830\nlike the 6509s and stuff like that,\nlike we used to have to buy.\n\n33\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.840\nYou could buy these and\nscale up instead of having to spend\n\n34\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.420\nhundreds of thousands\nof dollars right away.\n\n35\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.570\nYou can spend it over time,\nregardless Cisco's gonna get your money.\n\n36\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.160\nSo anyways, StackWise provides a method\nto join multiple physical switches.\n\n37\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.070\nSo when I add switches to the stack,\n\n38\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.460\nthe master switch automatically\nconfigures the unit, right?\n\n39\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.750\nReally nice and they just show up as kinda\njust like slots, really easy to configure.\n\n40\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.550\nSo I do label them though\nas their configured and\n\n41\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.050\nI see the slots and that way when you\nhave to go out and look at something and\n\n42\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.810\nyou see a slot then we're gonna go\nahead and know which switch it is.\n\n43\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.902\nOkay so we have a single,\nwe can join up to nine units.\n\n44\n00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:17.760\nSwitch is managed in a single object and\nhas single management IP address.\n\n45\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.490\nIt's typically used to unite access\nswitches that are mounted in\n\n46\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.220\nthe same rack.\n\n47\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.140\nI couldn't imagine these not.\n\n48\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.170\nSo they provide access ports.\n\n49\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.500\nLet's take a look at\nthe configuration here.\n\n50\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.207\nSo, the access management overhead.\n\n51\n00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:36.566\nNotice that we have to manage these\nseparately is kinda what we're showing\n\n52\n00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:37.630\nhere, right?\n\n53\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.140\nAnd in this case here, we're gonna\nmake these look like as one switch.\n\n54\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.240\nWe can create an ether channel between\nthem, but reduced management overhead.\n\n55\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.960\nI guess that's part of\nthe intelligent network, right?\n\n56\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.860\nRight, we have less management.\n\n57\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.660\nThat's the whole idea,\n\n58\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.650\nhow do we manage our network with\none management interface, right?\n\n59\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.240\nAll right, so on the cloud computing.\n\n60\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.890\nNow, cloud computing in technology,\nper se, isn't necessarily new, right?\n\n61\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.040\nCentralized storage, really you're just\nmoving, to think about it in a simplistic\n\n62\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.320\nmanner, you're not using your hard drive,\nyour using someone else's hard drive.\n\n63\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.500\nBut nonetheless, you're using\nsomeone else's hard drive somewhere.\n\n64\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.010\nAll right, so basically the users\nhave some benefits here.\n\n65\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.870\nRemember, cloud computing is a general\nterm that describes the way of using\n\n66\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.560\nprocessing, storage, and networking.\n\n67\n00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.097\nEverything's virtual, so\nup until a few years ago,\n\n68\n00:03:36.097 --> 00:03:41.390\nwe had virtual hosts, virtual servers,\n\n69\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.200\npretty much everything became virtual\nexcept two things in our network.\n\n70\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.310\nAnd that's what this is changing,\nwhat we're about to get into today,\n\n71\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.780\nis we're going to virtualize our\nrouter and switchboards, right?\n\n72\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.440\nSo everything else was virtualized but\nour router and switchboards.\n\n73\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.070\nNow, I've made a living for\na long time off router and switchboards.\n\n74\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.900\nRoute reports, right?\n\n75\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.530\nWe've all made a living off of that.\n\n76\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.140\nAnd you still will, because we still\nhave to configure it the same way.\n\n77\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.620\nIt's just there are logical.\n\n78\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.718\nIt's like if you were a Microsoft\nadministrator and they went virtual,\n\n79\n00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:11.260\nyou didn't lose your job.\n\n80\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.930\nYou just didn't have the bare metal,\nit was no big deal.\n\n81\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.194\nSo the term cloud is deployment or\n\n82\n00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.650\nsomewhat new, but\nit's not a new technology.\n\n83\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.670\nNow, let's take a closer look at this.\n\n84\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.040\nLet's go fullscreen on this one.\n\n85\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.080\nSo for the exam objectives,\nyou wanna think about cloud computing and\n\n86\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.400\nits effect on enterprise network,\nit's an objective here.\n\n87\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.650\nCentralization, automation,\nvirtualization, standardization.\n\n88\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.950\nRight, so\nwe're going to centralize all this.\n\n89\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.790\nAdvantage to the cloud service builder,\nthe provider really, right?\n\n90\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.950\nAnd they want you to do all of this.\n\n91\n00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.000\nSo fail-in-place operations model,\neasier administration for them.\n\n92\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.310\nNow high utilization, so basically,\ninstead of having one CPU and\n\n93\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.370\na bunch of memory and it's being spread\nout, we can put a bunch of customers on\n\n94\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.610\ntop of it and get the highest utilization\nand this give us cost reduction.\n\n95\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.120\nSo this allows you to\ndo it less expensively\n\n96\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.730\nthan if you were doing it yourself,\nbecause their sharing this cost.\n\n97\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.430\nIt's a big party line for\nyour data center.\n\n98\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.810\nNow to the cloud user, again, they're not\nreally gonna see anything different than\n\n99\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.630\nwhen we had just centralized\nbecause we had in the 70s and\n\n100\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.620\n80s we had centralized\ncomputing mainframes, right?\n\n101\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.293\nAnd then Microsoft Novell came out and\nsaid don't do that,\n\n102\n00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:32.009\nuse distributed computing, right?\n\n103\n00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.790\nAnd then we come back and said, no,\nno, we're building server farms.\n\n104\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.330\nAgain, centralized computing, right?\n\n105\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.450\nIt's a big cycle.\n\n106\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.740\nSo we're back to that and\nnow we don't really have to worry about\n\n107\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.970\nlocal backups of the PCs or\nanything like that.\n\n108\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.950\nThey're all virtualized.\n\n109\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.930\nNothing's being stored, anyways.\n\n110\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.980\nI mean,\nI don't even- do you use Office 365?\n\n111\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.930\n>> That's exactly what we use here.\n\n112\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.440\n>> I think everyone out\nthere uses Office 365.\n\n113\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.065\nIt really is awesome.\n\n114\n00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.130\nAnd the fact is, is you pay this\nyearly fee, or monthly fee,\n\n115\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.624\nwhatever, and update and\nthat's where the future is going.\n\n116\n00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:08.880\nSo everything stored, on my laptop,\nlet me give you an example here.\n\n117\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.300\nMy laptop broke one day,\n\n118\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.108\nmy Mac stopped working,\nhard to believe a Mac stopped working.\n\n119\n00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I had a little Dell sitting around,\n\n120\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.555\nfor Dell it was a good computer.\n\n121\n00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:20.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n122\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.862\nI was like, I can't get to my customer,\nI've gotta upgrade all this stuff.\n\n123\n00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:26.059\nI've gotta put all these apps on there.\n\n124\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.340\nIt only took me about 20 minutes\nto get that ready because I\n\n125\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.350\nalready used Google Docs and Dropbox.\n\n126\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.240\nMy files weren't even local, right?\n\n127\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.250\nAnd then my apps were Office 365 and\nwhatnot.\n\n128\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.450\nAnd so it really, I was kinda surprised\nthat I was so used to spending a day or\n\n129\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.410\nwhatever restoring my laptop but\nthat's not the reality anymore is it?\n\n130\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.680\n>> No.\n>> Everything's stored,\n\n131\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.450\nI guess we're going to say in the cloud,\nmeaning i.e., someone else's hard drive,\n\n132\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.680\nnot yours, that's all.\n\n133\n00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.510\nThat's all that means.\n\n134\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.450\nNow, is there some draw backs to this?\n\n135\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.080\nYou bet.\n\n136\n00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.470\nWhen I'm on a plane,\nI can't get to my Office 365 docs, right?\n\n137\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.410\nNow, there are some that I download,\nbut for\n\n138\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.820\nthe most part I don't cuz I have so\nmany, right?\n\n139\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.890\nSo when you're offline this\nbecomes somewhat burdensome.\n\n140\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.980\nIt's the same thing with\nthe Apple Music that I have.\n\n141\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.620\nI went onto that Apple thing,\ngot on a plane.\n\n142\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.110\nAnd we get up there and\nit's fine when I'm on the plane.\n\n143\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.300\nAnd I get up there and I'm like, I can't\nlisten to music, I hate Apple, right?\n\n144\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.700\nSo it was like, nothing worse than being\non a plane for 12 hours and no music and\n\n145\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.310\nstuff like that.\n\n146\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.950\nAll right, so let's go run back in here.\n\n147\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.310\nThat's my story for the day.\n\n148\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.040\nThat's it, Ronnie,\nthat's my whole story here.\n\n149\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.930\nSo anyways.\n\n150\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.550\n>> Thanks for plugging Apple.\n\n151\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.330\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.280\nNow, obviously, I'm sitting here with\nan Apple phone, an Apple computer, and\n\n153\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.400\nan iPad here, drawing on the screen.\n\n154\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.840\nApple should be paying me for this.\n\n155\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.110\n>> True.\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n156\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.030\nAdvantage to the cloud users,\nno local backups, on demand service,\n\n157\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.710\ncentralized appearance of resources.\n\n158\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.986\nTrue, it looks like here, as long\nas you're not at 30,000 feet right?\n\n159\n00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:51.705\nNow I know that there's Internet\nup there but it's slower,\n\n160\n00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:53.850\nit is,and there's some\nthings you can't do.\n\n161\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.650\nHighly available, horizontally scaled.\n\n162\n00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.556\nNow, the cloud computing servers.\n\n163\n00:07:57.556 --> 00:07:59.198\nTake a look at this guys.\n\n164\n00:07:59.198 --> 00:08:03.632\nWe have, let's go with full screen on\nthis one, infrastructure as a service,\n\n165\n00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:06.360\nplatform as a service and\nsoftware as a service.\n\n166\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.760\nYou guys are going to have to know\nthese three and what they do.\n\n167\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.380\nSo if we look at this, infrastructure\nas a service provides only a network.\n\n168\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.900\nOkay?\n\n169\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.600\nThe platform as a service\ngives me software, so\n\n170\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.250\nit's gonna give me my Software,\n\n171\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.570\nOS and network.\n\n172\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.341\nAnd then we've got software, so\nthat was platform as a service.\n\n173\n00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:37.627\nAnd then software as a service is\ngoing to give me my applications or\n\n174\n00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:41.060\nsoftware provides ready\nto use applications.\n\n175\n00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.850\nSo you know, just basically everything and\nall the way down to networks.\n\n176\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.240\nSo, here's what providers what you to do.\n\n177\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.080\nBecause now, you're providing nothing.\n\n178\n00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.000\nWe're providing nothing now.\n\n179\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.367\nOkay, so, they are providing 100%,\n\n180\n00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:58.408\nyou just have a dumb terminal,\nyou connect into them.\n\n181\n00:08:58.408 --> 00:08:59.580\nThey have everything.\n\n182\n00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.560\nThis reminds me of, I don't know,\nGoogleDocs and Office 365.\n\n183\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.950\nRight?\nYou're providing nothing, right?\n\n184\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.200\nYou're just connecting to the network and\nthen they're providing everything to\n\n185\n00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.500\ntransport the whole thing,\nright, to get to you.\n\n186\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.130\nAll right, now in this case here,\nthink of it like this.\n\n187\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.186\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n188\n00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:26.000\nthat's how we're gonna look at this and\nwhat's wrong with Software as a service.\n\n189\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.510\nBecause I mean, I was just saying the,\ntouting the benefits of it\n\n190\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.320\nas long as you had internet access,\nwhich, it's pretty rare that I don't.\n\n191\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.668\nI've realized since I've been able,\ndoing this in the last few years with\n\n192\n00:09:36.668 --> 00:09:39.720\nGoogle Docs and Dropbox,\nand I keep no files local.\n\n193\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.671\nYou know, cause one time, well here\ncomes another story, I was flying to\n\n194\n00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:47.368\nSan Francisco and I put my laptop\nunderneath the seat in front of me and\n\n195\n00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:49.710\nI put a pillow down and put my feet up.\n\n196\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.969\nI was sleeping because I had a big day and\nI was flight fright or whatever.\n\n197\n00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:57.020\nYep and I sure got up and I left it there.\n\n198\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.180\nI remembered by the time I got out\nof the gate and I was walking away.\n\n199\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.350\nRan back in.\n\n200\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.250\nAnd it was gone, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.180\nAnd never saw it again, right?\n\n202\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.204\nAnd after that,\n\n203\n00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:11.239\nI never kept anything local because\nI had to work that whole week.\n\n204\n00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:15.150\nAnd I had my presentations on there,\nand I was going to a customer.\n\n205\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.730\nI was presenting them with\na big consulting job.\n\n206\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.580\nLost it all.\n\n207\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.727\nHad to stay up all night,\nall week, right, and\n\n208\n00:10:20.727 --> 00:10:23.814\nthen when I realized when I did this\nI don't care if I lose my laptop.\n\n209\n00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:25.999\nWell you're gonna care if you lose\nyour laptop but you get my point.\n\n210\n00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:29.471\nIf I lost my laptop, I can just go get\nanother one to log into my services and\n\n211\n00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:30.090\nI'm there.\n\n212\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.230\nSo, we do have some benefits here.\n\n213\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.820\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.270\nSo infrastructures as a service.\n\n215\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.406\nWe got CPU, disk drives, networks,\ndata centers, we have platform.\n\n216\n00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:45.477\nYou have your applications, your software\nOS, the network, and then of course,\n\n217\n00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:46.950\nyou got the more money.\n\n218\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.180\nNow let's spend some\ntime on this next one.\n\n219\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.185\nIn this, we're gonna talk about what's\n\n220\n00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:58.622\ncalled software defined Networks.\n\n221\n00:10:58.622 --> 00:11:00.752\nAll right, SDN.\n\n222\n00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:04.533\nNow, when we have the Control Plane and\nthe Data Plane so\n\n223\n00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:09.376\nthis is our typical devices day so\nthis will be at Cisco, I don't know.\n\n224\n00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:11.080\nIt could be anything.\n\n225\n00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.940\nNetgear.\nIB, it doesn't even matter.\n\n226\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.310\nMicrosoft whatever.\n\n227\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.900\nThe iOS is on this device.\n\n228\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.935\nRight?\nSo the data affording plane is responsible\n\n229\n00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.603\nfor sorting of frames and packets here.\n\n230\n00:11:22.603 --> 00:11:23.195\nAll right?\n\n231\n00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:25.461\nSo this is gonna give me my frames and\npackets here.\n\n232\n00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:36.430\nAnd the Control Plane the forwarding table\nthat the Data Plane uses to get there.\n\n233\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.330\nSo we have the IOS, right, and [COUGH]\nthen they have IOS on here, and again,\n\n234\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.851\nI'm using Cisco as an example here,\nbut the SDN architecture changes\n\n235\n00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:49.147\nthe networking paradigm\nby removing intelligence\n\n236\n00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:54.003\nfrom the individual devices and\ntransferring it to a central controller.\n\n237\n00:11:54.003 --> 00:11:55.269\nRight, right here.\n\n238\n00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:57.430\nLet me get to that slide.\n\n239\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.400\nCentral control here enabling management\nof networks through software.\n\n240\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.500\nCISCO has one and\nthat's the one we're gonna look at.\n\n241\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.080\nSo this is going to allow us to\nmanage everything, remote location.\n\n242\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.940\nLet me give you an example.\n\n243\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.100\nCISCO was updating,\nI think it was their Jabber client.\n\n244\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.620\nThey figured out they have\nto go to 3000 locations or\n\n245\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.390\nI think it was 700, I can't remember\nthe exact amount of locations.\n\n246\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.380\nBut they came up with a budget number and\nhow long it was gonna take.\n\n247\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.800\nIt was gonna take seven weeks,\n$300,000 to do this,\n\n248\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.219\nupdate this on all their campuses and\nthey did it through SCN,\n\n249\n00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:31.870\nthrough their controller and\nit took them 15 minutes and zero dollars.\n\n250\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.890\nSo that was a really good example,\nyou can actually look that one up,\n\n251\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.560\nyou just have to search for it somewhere.\n\n252\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.570\nI don't know what to search for,\nbut you have to find it.\n\n253\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:43.892\nOkay, so SDN separates the Control Plane\nof the network from the forwarding plane.\n\n254\n00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:47.300\nAll right so these then are separated, it\nautomates processes such as provision of\n\n255\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.520\nconfiguration, remediation and allowing\nfor flexible agility and scale ability.\n\n256\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.190\nOkay so now we have a view of the network\ngiving SDN controller the ability to act\n\n257\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.260\nas the brains of the network all right so\n\n258\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.210\nhere's my brains,\nwhoops let me come back here again.\n\n259\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.000\nSo I've got my brains here of the network.\n\n260\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.800\nControl error of the SDN is\nusually a software solution and\n\n261\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.090\nCisco's Is gonna be the APIC.\n\n262\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.180\nNow be careful here, there's and\nAPIC and there's and APIC-EM and\n\n263\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.290\nthat's the one we wanna use.\n\n264\n00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:23.920\nSo [COUGH] if we look here we have\na stacked layers here from the bottom up.\n\n265\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.110\nWe have the data, the control plane and\nthe application plane.\n\n266\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.820\nSo here's my APIC-EM, here's my brains.\n\n267\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.420\nIt's what we're gonna use right here.\n\n268\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.760\nSo here's my access and\nWANs and then my APIC and\n\n269\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.730\nso basically this is the data or\nforwarding plan.\n\n270\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:42.880\nAll right.\n\n271\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880\nI'll put it between here.\n\n272\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.160\nThis contains network elements.\n\n273\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.660\nSo and then the control plane\nrepresents the core of the stn so\n\n274\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.990\nthis is my APIC core.\n\n275\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.425\nit contains SDN controllers,\ncentralized control of the data plane.\n\n276\n00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.950\nAnd the application plane contains SDN\napplications that communicate their\n\n277\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.720\nnetwork requirements, so\nnow we get our network requirements here\n\n278\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:18.410\nto the controller, If I spell that right,\nand that goes to my controller.\n\n279\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.493\nSo it's a single point for network\nautomation which saves time and costs.\n\n280\n00:14:22.493 --> 00:14:26.830\nNow support for greenfield and brownfield.\n\n281\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.886\nSo support for greenfield, so what is\ngreenfield and brownfield deployments?\n\n282\n00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:32.518\nAny idea?\n\n283\n00:14:32.518 --> 00:14:33.175\n>> No.\n\n284\n00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:36.066\n>> We've kind of been using these for\na while.\n\n285\n00:14:36.066 --> 00:14:37.910\nThese are not new terms.\n\n286\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.170\nBut they actually came out before\nwe even had computers all right.\n\n287\n00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.780\nThis was what developers used\nwhen they were doing land.\n\n288\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.420\nSo greenfield means it was kinda no one's\nbeen here before, let's go ahead and\n\n289\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.390\nscrew it up.\n\n290\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.550\nSo brownfield means that someone's been\nthere before and screwed it up and\n\n291\n00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.455\nit's all screwed up and it's got problems,\n\n292\n00:14:53.455 --> 00:14:56.365\nbrownfield meaning, you know,\nthat someone's been here before,\n\n293\n00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:59.194\nalready built on it and\nwe're trying to fix it and it's polluted.\n\n294\n00:14:59.194 --> 00:15:00.800\nRight, that's where they\nthat got that name.\n\n295\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.290\nSo how many times you guys walked into\na brownfield network, where it's polluted,\n\n296\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.110\nit's broken and you gotta fix it.\n\n297\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.747\nSo, greenfield is always better.\n\n298\n00:15:08.747 --> 00:15:10.110\nGood luck with that one.\n\n299\n00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.380\nRight, it's not too easy to find\nthose greenfield developments.\n\n300\n00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.060\nAll right so before I go into there\nlet's go back into more APIC.\n\n301\n00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.300\nLet me open this up for\na second, I want to go here.\n\n302\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:27.640\nAnd I want to talk about Cisco's APIC-EM.\n\n303\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.630\nWhoops, I wrote that backwards.\n\n304\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:35.180\nOkay, many different controller\nplatforms have emerged and the Cisco,\n\n305\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.230\nnow this stands for application\n\n306\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.820\npolicy infrastructure controller\n\n307\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.576\nenterprise module, application policy\ninfrastructure controller enterprise\n\n308\n00:15:47.576 --> 00:15:53.737\nmodule.\nOkay, It's an SDN controller, For\n\n309\n00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:55.268\nenterprise networks, okay?\n\n310\n00:15:55.268 --> 00:15:57.481\nSo we're not gonna probably use this,\nIt's in our smaller networks.\n\n311\n00:15:57.481 --> 00:15:59.186\nYou could do this for fun.\n\n312\n00:15:59.186 --> 00:16:03.300\nIt's not a cheap setup, so it's a little\nbit harder to have some fun with this.\n\n313\n00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.930\nOkay, so now this simplifies and\nstreamlines the network operations and\n\n314\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.390\nreduces cost.\n\n315\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.920\nAbsolutely, they have all sorts of reasons\nhow this is going to reduce costs.\n\n316\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.190\nFrees the IT department to\nfocus on business innovation,\n\n317\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.292\ninstead of just trying to figure out how\nto expand the existing physical network.\n\n318\n00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:23.960\nAll right, so let's go back here and\ntalk about what this gives us, so\n\n319\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.350\nwhat are the benefits, these are the\nthings you need to remember for the exam.\n\n320\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.490\nSo what is the CISCO APIC-EM, the SDN\ncontroller that Cisco uses, the benefits?\n\n321\n00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.085\nOkay, so you have consistency\n\n322\n00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:45.120\nacross the enterprise network and\nit keeps downtime to a minimum.\n\n323\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.522\nSo consistency across network.\n\n324\n00:16:52.342 --> 00:16:59.262\nAutomation, in the end provisioning,\n\n325\n00:16:59.262 --> 00:17:05.576\nautomated end to end provisioning.\n\n326\n00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:11.550\nThat says provisioning at the end.\n\n327\n00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.680\nAll right, and then we've got API,\nopen end programmable network devices.\n\n328\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.024\nSo now we have an open,\ninstead of a proprietary.\n\n329\n00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:26.138\nAnd programmable.\n\n330\n00:17:27.457 --> 00:17:28.258\nNetwork devices.\n\n331\n00:17:38.403 --> 00:17:44.770\nOkay, and then we've got the support for\nnew and existing structures.\n\n332\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.150\nSo the thing is, let's come back now.\n\n333\n00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:55.940\nThe thing is about this is that it's\nhard inside a virtual environment.\n\n334\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.040\nSo here's some of the things I've seen.\n\n335\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.510\nIf you're in a virtual environment,\nthis works great.\n\n336\n00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.470\nEverything's wonderful.\n\n337\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.460\nIt's when you get to the real world.\n\n338\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.260\nAnd we're still gonna call\nit the real world, right,\n\n339\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.330\nbecause we can physically touch it.\n\n340\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.870\nWe're still having problems getting\nfrom the virtual to the real world and\n\n341\n00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.810\nvice versa, right.\n\n342\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.190\nWhen everything becomes virtual and\nit will, then it's going to be better.\n\n343\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.810\nSo should we rework on this?\n\n344\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.550\nAbsolutely.\n\n345\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.430\nShould be expanding and getting some\neducation on this and start working on it.\n\n346\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.530\nAbsolutely, and\nyou're gonna see this more and more.\n\n347\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.740\nIt's gonna take some time, right?\n\n348\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.885\nBut I still think it'll be faster\nthan our IPv6 migration has been.\n\n349\n00:18:30.885 --> 00:18:35.882\n[LAUGH] Okay, so we can use,\none of the other benefits,\n\n350\n00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:40.989\nwe can use open programmable APIs,\nas I mentioned, for\n\n351\n00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:48.528\npolicy-based management and\nsecurity through just a single controller.\n\n352\n00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:52.900\nAll right, so we have this and then let's\ntalk about some other benefits here.\n\n353\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.600\nAnd I wonder how I can clean this off.\n\n354\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.630\nSee if I go like that.\n\n355\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.370\nThere we go.\n\n356\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.950\nAnd then let me go back here.\n\n357\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.350\nAnd let's talk about some other benefits.\n\n358\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.310\nAll right, so we brought those back up.\n\n359\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:14.682\nSo Cisco's APIC-EM, so\nwe're gonna use the network,\n\n360\n00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:21.400\nInfo Information database.\n\n361\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.110\nAnd what this does is scan the network and\nprovide the inventory,\n\n362\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.730\nincluding all network devices.\n\n363\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.496\nAll right, so that's how we're gonna find\nour network device, we're gonna scan.\n\n364\n00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:36.895\nNetwork topology, Visualization,\n\n365\n00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:41.310\nand what this does is,\nlet me finish typing that.\n\n366\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.880\nAuto discovers and maps network\ndevices to a physical topology\n\n367\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.923\nwith detailed device level data,\nincluding hosts, and\n\n368\n00:19:51.923 --> 00:19:58.730\nhere we go, so zero touch deployment.\n\n369\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.130\nOkay?\nWhen the controller scanner discovers\n\n370\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.840\na new RTI device,\n\n371\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.280\nit creates a network database entry and\nautomatically configures it.\n\n372\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.290\nOkay, then you got your policy manager,\nnot done yet.\n\n373\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.590\nThere's quite a bit to this, guys.\n\n374\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.800\nPolicy manager.\n\n375\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.349\nController that translates a business\npolicy into a network device level policy.\n\n376\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.070\nYeah, this is where all your work is\ndone really, is in policy manager.\n\n377\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.970\nAnd then you have your ACL analysis.\n\n378\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:38.720\nAnd this acts as controlled management\nby querying and analyzing ACLs.\n\n379\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.170\nSo one of the things about this and,\non the objectives is,\n\n380\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:48.610\nhow can you tell if an ACL is\nstopping a certain application,\n\n381\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.690\ncertain protocol, and\nthat's my ACL analysis feature.\n\n382\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.560\nAnd it can show it.\n\n383\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.360\nNow, although I'm gonna show you this\nfeature, I'm not gonna create an ACL and\n\n384\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.980\nstop it, but so\nyou just need to remember that.\n\n385\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.180\nOkay, and then we've got lastly,\ntwo other things.\n\n386\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.225\nQoS and intelligent WANs.\n\n387\n00:21:09.225 --> 00:21:10.305\nOkay.\n\n388\n00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:17.052\nEach of these are a huge subject on\ntheir own, just to let you know that.\n\n389\n00:21:17.052 --> 00:21:19.890\nEach one of these listed here\nwould probably be their own class.\n\n390\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.180\nPolicies, QOS,\nintelligent WANs, and so on.\n\n391\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.910\nRight?\n\n392\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.521\nSo let's go back to my slides here.\n\n393\n00:21:28.521 --> 00:21:32.720\nAnd before I'm gonna use path trace,\nI'm gonna show you this in a minute.\n\n394\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.580\nAll right?\nSo we're gonna go out and do a lab here.\n\n395\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.410\nSo we can see in this example here\nApple Quicktime traffic gets blocked.\n\n396\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.680\nAnd it's gonna show me in a graphical\nrepresentation where that has stopped.\n\n397\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.830\nAnd that's my ACL analysis, isn't it?\n\n398\n00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.090\nOkay, and then one last thing before we do\nour lab, and that is the intelligent WAN,\n\n399\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.160\nall right?\n\n400\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.046\nSo we've got transport\nindependent connectivity,\n\n401\n00:21:57.046 --> 00:22:03.560\nthis provides MPLS-based DM VPN,\nwhich we've discussed.\n\n402\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.340\nThat's a Cisco-based overlay\nacross all available connectivity.\n\n403\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.800\nIntelligent path control, so\nthis is DM VPN right here,\n\n404\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.880\ntransport independent connectivity\nacross all enable connectivity.\n\n405\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.620\nIntelligent path control by\nusing Cisco performance routing.\n\n406\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.180\nNow if you see this is P little fR.\n\n407\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.800\nCisco performance routing,\nthis improves delivery across, and\n\n408\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.240\nit gives us performance policies and\npath stats.\n\n409\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:40.250\nAnd then application optimization gives us\nCisco application visibility and control.\n\n410\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.730\nAnd Cisco WAAS, WAAS,\nCisco Wide Area Application Services.\n\n411\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.540\nAnd then highly secure connectivity.\n\n412\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.050\nWhen traffic is sent\nover the public internet,\n\n413\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.530\nwe have to make sure that's secure.\n\n414\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:58.450\nAnd we can do this with VPNs, firewalls,\nnetwork segmentations, so on.\n\n415\n00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.280\nOkay?\nSo\n\n416\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.490\nthis is gonna give us\nthe security that we need.\n\n417\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.240\nSo Cisco Intelligent WANs, again,\nthere's a whole course on this.\n\n418\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.260\nThis is,\nallows us really the idea is to take low\n\n419\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.760\nspeed bandwidth for long distance links,\nwhere we can't get our broadband or\n\n420\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.680\nmetro ethernet and\nbe able to use all sorts of links and\n\n421\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.022\nbe able to deliver consistent\nWAN technologies across those.\n\n422\n00:23:25.022 --> 00:23:28.260\nAll right, let's go ahead and\njump into our lab.\n\n423\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.570\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n424\n00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.150\nWe'll finish this section up.\n\n425\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.850\nAnd one of the things I\nwanna take a look at is,\n\n426\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.670\nthe first thing I'm gonna look\nat is here's my discovery.\n\n427\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.170\nSo I can out there and\ncreate a name a do a discovery.\n\n428\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.890\nAnd then out here,\n\n429\n00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.650\nthis is gonna be my device inventory\nof the network that I found.\n\n430\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.963\nSo I can go ahead and\nclick on my very small network here.\n\n431\n00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:54.677\nAnd see my different devices that I found.\n\n432\n00:23:54.677 --> 00:23:58.610\nSo, if I click on a device, and\nwe can see how long they've been up.\n\n433\n00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.114\nLast updated time and the devices down or\nnot in their IP address.\n\n434\n00:24:03.114 --> 00:24:04.360\nAnd we can get even more information.\n\n435\n00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.089\nI'm gonna click on this and\nI'm gonna go head in and\n\n436\n00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:13.530\nsay, Campus-Court, the IP address,\nMAC address, OS version.\n\n437\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.790\nCan't change anything here,\nwe're just getting stats.\n\n438\n00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.960\nRight, it's gonna tell me ,yeah,\nI love this,\n\n439\n00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.980\nhere is a 40G interface,\n10G interface, these are nice?\n\n440\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.937\nThese are great for a home network,\ndon't you think, Ronnie?\n\n441\n00:24:24.937 --> 00:24:25.657\n10 gig?\n\n442\n00:24:25.657 --> 00:24:26.516\n40 gig?\n\n443\n00:24:26.516 --> 00:24:28.177\n>> Nice.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n444\n00:24:28.177 --> 00:24:31.940\nthese are telling me which\ninterfaces I am using and not.\n\n445\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.800\nSo I'm gonna hit the X to close this\nhere and so I can come over here and\n\n446\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.350\nlook at all my devices and see the status\nI can get information on the hardware.\n\n447\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.980\nOr I can get some more\ninformation on the platform.\n\n448\n00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.214\nSo this is a AP a 35 0 2.\n\n449\n00:24:49.214 --> 00:24:51.954\nHere is a 29 60 switch, 29 11.\n\n450\n00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:55.912\nAll right this gives me the firmware,\nthis is some pretty good stuff guys.\n\n451\n00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:59.870\nAnd so they are really trying to get\nyou to want to do this right and\n\n452\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.350\nnot do what we are doing now.\n\n453\n00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.860\nSo I can actually now come out here and\ntake a look at the configuration.\n\n454\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.210\nRight?\nYou like this?\n\n455\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.830\nThis is actually pretty cool.\n\n456\n00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.440\nSo in this case here, let me see if I can\ngo over here and get rid of this, and\n\n457\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.920\nthen I can actually change this\nwhat it does, the device role.\n\n458\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.590\nRight?\nIn this case I'm a border router.\n\n459\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.227\nWhoops, I just changed\nmyself to an unknown.\n\n460\n00:25:19.227 --> 00:25:24.160\n[LAUGH] Border router, but\nI can change this to whatever.\n\n461\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.010\nWhatever it is,\nin this case it's an access.\n\n462\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.230\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\nget rid of that.\n\n463\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.643\nAnd then I'm going to click on\ndevice inventory here, all right?\n\n464\n00:25:33.643 --> 00:25:36.720\nSo, device inventory,\nthis is the one I just did.\n\n465\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.860\nSo, these are my hosts here,\nthis should be my host now.\n\n466\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.250\nIn the device inventory we can see\nagain device name, IP addresses,\n\n467\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.910\nstatus, last time it was\nupdated in inventory and so on.\n\n468\n00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.020\nSo we got quite a bit of information here.\n\n469\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.830\nAnd these are my hosts here, so I can see,\ncan't do a lot of information here but\n\n470\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.770\nI can see my Mac address, host IP's.\n\n471\n00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.260\nWire to wireless, IP addresses.\n\n472\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.020\nInterface names.\n\n473\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.425\nI only got three hosts on here.\n\n474\n00:26:02.425 --> 00:26:06.883\nSo your network, maybe when you start off,\nwould look something like this, all right.\n\n475\n00:26:06.883 --> 00:26:10.760\nSo, we have the host inventory and\nthen I have the topology here.\n\n476\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.327\nAnd this is probably where\nI'll hang out the most, right?\n\n477\n00:26:13.327 --> 00:26:15.690\nBecause I can do quite\na bit of stuff here.\n\n478\n00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.950\nThis is my network topology.\n\n479\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.870\nAnd I can move this around.\n\n480\n00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.970\nThat's kinda nice.\n\n481\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.500\nAnd then, so\nonce I do this I can change it.\n\n482\n00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.769\nI can come up here and save it.\n\n483\n00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:31.170\nAnd I didn't really do anything, so\nI can go ahead and save it here.\n\n484\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.820\nAnd put it as Todd changes.\n\n485\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.330\nNow I can look here, and\n\n486\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.620\ncome back to my different layouts that\nI want to look at, and then load those.\n\n487\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.720\nAll right, so I can save that.\n\n488\n00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.800\nNow, [COUGH] one of the things I can do,\nlet's take a look here, so I can come in\n\n489\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.010\nhere, and I can click on this, and this is\ngonna give me information about the campus\n\n490\n00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.700\naccess switch in this point, here.\n\n491\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.830\nSo I can see it's a switching hub,\nit's role again.\n\n492\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.000\nI can change its role here.\n\n493\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.250\nTalk about device tagging, available tags,\nif I was going to do that.\n\n494\n00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.903\nIn this case, none.\n\n495\n00:27:01.903 --> 00:27:08.010\n[COUGH] All right, and\nthen what I'm connected to, right?\n\n496\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.640\nAnd then, so I can click on this,\nand it'll show me my connection.\n\n497\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.010\nSo check out what\nhappened when I did that.\n\n498\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.480\nIt showed me my connection to\nthe campus distribution switch.\n\n499\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.990\nAll right, then in this case here.\n\n500\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.680\nThis is my, so,\n\n501\n00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.220\nif you had intelligent WAN, this is\nwhere you would manage it from here.\n\n502\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.580\nOn this, right here.\n\n503\n00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.350\nI don't have an intelligent WAN.\n\n504\n00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.730\nBut notice that, you know?\n\n505\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.940\nIt's going to say hey, well,\nlet's go ahead and create one, right?\n\n506\n00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.759\nSo I can go out and\ncreate an intelligent WAN here.\n\n507\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.180\nAnd then, so all that is fine.\n\n508\n00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.390\nThis is a lot of great stuff here,\non this here,\n\n509\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.840\nif I look at here I can search,\nI can create and get information on here.\n\n510\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.190\nBut for the objectives, I want to\nwatch again, we want to watch and\n\n511\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.480\nsee a trace through here,\nand what it does.\n\n512\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.700\nSo, this is very fascinating.\n\n513\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.429\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n514\n00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.270\nSo I've already done a couple here.\n\n515\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.070\nAnd I'm gonna close this off and\nsay start a new path trace.\n\n516\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.853\nNow check this out,\nI don't actually have to know.\n\n517\n00:28:09.853 --> 00:28:14.029\nI'm gonna click on this, and\nit's gonna show me all my devices and\n\n518\n00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:18.025\nsince I don't have a lot,\nnow I could type domain up here.\n\n519\n00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:20.495\nBut in this case here,\nI'm gonna go from this wireless host.\n\n520\n00:28:20.495 --> 00:28:22.835\nWe're gonna watch the protocols\nas they go across.\n\n521\n00:28:22.835 --> 00:28:25.409\nI want to refresh this every thirty\nseconds and get statistics on it.\n\n522\n00:28:25.409 --> 00:28:29.965\nInterface stats and QOS, but\nI want to go to a destination.\n\n523\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.320\nLet's choose this branch router just\nrandomly going to pick something here and\n\n524\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.030\nwatch it go through.\n\n525\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.606\nLet's go to the core and\nthen when I pick that it says well which\n\n526\n00:28:40.606 --> 00:28:44.654\ninterface on that do you want so\ndo you want the directly\n\n527\n00:28:44.654 --> 00:28:49.236\nconnected interface the closes one or\nthe one that is routed.\n\n528\n00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:51.710\nI'm just going to pick\nthat say start trace.\n\n529\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.850\nAll right, so\nI'm picking from this wireless host.\n\n530\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.710\nAnd this is gonna take a minute or so.\n\n531\n00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.110\nSo we're gonna go through here and\nit's gonna show our trace.\n\n532\n00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.049\nIt's actually gonna be\nrelatively large here.\n\n533\n00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:05.930\nCome on, there we go.\n\n534\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.360\nI'm gonna close this and so\nwe can see this here, and\n\n535\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.070\nthen when I click on this down here,\nit's gonna take me through where I am.\n\n536\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.630\nNow let's go ahead and\ntake a closer look and\n\n537\n00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.720\nI could do something\nlike view small right.\n\n538\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.100\nSo I really didn't get all that much here,\nit wasn't a huge trace really,\n\n539\n00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:29.640\nso if there was a problem, if we did see\nan access list it would show us in here.\n\n540\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.560\nSo when I click on this it's gonna\nshow it to me in the trace down there,\n\n541\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.355\nnotice that I'm running CAPWAP tunnel\nhere because this is my wireless.\n\n542\n00:29:36.355 --> 00:29:38.470\nCAPWAP is my wireless protocol for\n\n543\n00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.580\nme to talk to the controller\nfrom the access point.\n\n544\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.990\nRight, so I came in here.\n\n545\n00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.020\nWe'll run some sort of 802.11\nin here through this CAPWAP.\n\n546\n00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.140\nAnd notice we switched.\n\n547\n00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.160\nWe only went to this course.\n\n548\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.130\nWe'll probably do another trace here,\ndidn't do very much but check this out,\n\n549\n00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.352\nthis is kind of nice.\n\n550\n00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:56.630\nI can in here and\nget my queue s stats on here.\n\n551\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.930\nSo I'm gonna come down here,\nI wanna go further down here.\n\n552\n00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.060\nI have to click up here to\nget down to the bottom.\n\n553\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.160\nWe didn't go very far.\n\n554\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.610\nReally this trace was one of\nthe smaller ones that I've seen.\n\n555\n00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.670\nSo we'll do another one.\n\n556\n00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.529\nBut notice I can see here the input rate,\nthe output packets, the queue depths.\n\n557\n00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.090\nThe bits per second and so on.\n\n558\n00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.140\nSo we can do the stats,\nwhich is kind of nice.\n\n559\n00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.827\nBut let's do this, and so I could sit\nhere and do this, and view large for one.\n\n560\n00:30:19.827 --> 00:30:21.603\nBut watch this.\n\n561\n00:30:21.603 --> 00:30:24.780\nNow I can say, well, trace it back.\n\n562\n00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.190\nRight?\nAnd so this takes a second and\n\n563\n00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.210\nthen it's gonna come back and\nshow me the reverse path.\n\n564\n00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.690\nSo it's fetching the path here.\n\n565\n00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.930\nAnd now it's gonna show me the to and\nfrom through here\n\n566\n00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.440\nas I went from this wireless host\nto that campus core and back.\n\n567\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.080\nSo let's go ahead and do another one.\n\n568\n00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.510\nSo I want to start a new pace trap.\n\n569\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.500\nLet's go from the wireless host.\n\n570\n00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.440\nAnd we'll do this and then get the stats.\n\n571\n00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.132\nAnd our destination, we'll just choose\nthe core there on this interface.\n\n572\n00:30:54.132 --> 00:30:57.240\nAll right, this should give us\na little bit further of a path here.\n\n573\n00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.079\nAnd again what you want to look for\n\n574\n00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:03.590\non this path trace is someone saying\nhey I can't get to an application.\n\n575\n00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.800\nThis is a much better way to troubleshoot.\n\n576\n00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.406\nI get a lot of customers say hey people\nare getting to this application but\n\n577\n00:31:08.406 --> 00:31:09.443\nthey can't get to this one.\n\n578\n00:31:09.443 --> 00:31:13.062\nThis is gonna give me a lot better\npicture of something like that, so\n\n579\n00:31:13.062 --> 00:31:15.991\nthis becomes really helpful\nin our environment here.\n\n580\n00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:20.331\nAll right, so I'm going to say\nhere is my wireless host and\n\n581\n00:31:20.331 --> 00:31:25.570\nthen these are all of the devices\nthat I go through to get there.\n\n582\n00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.692\nThis is a wired so\n\n583\n00:31:26.692 --> 00:31:31.271\nbasically I went from my wireless\nhost to the wireless controller.\n\n584\n00:31:31.271 --> 00:31:32.664\nAll right, so this is my campus.\n\n585\n00:31:32.664 --> 00:31:35.473\nWireless controller is at 5508, nice one.\n\n586\n00:31:35.473 --> 00:31:37.380\nNow, notice I want to show\nyou guys something here.\n\n587\n00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.600\nNotice this unknown here.\n\n588\n00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.230\nThis is NetFlow, right.\n\n589\n00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.590\nSo this is actually probably running\non this distribution switch,\n\n590\n00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.950\nwent through the NetFlow application.\n\n591\n00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.881\nAnd showed up as an unknown, cuz it's not\nreally a device, is it, it's software.\n\n592\n00:31:49.881 --> 00:31:53.216\nAll right, so in that case here,\nI can come in here and do the stats.\n\n593\n00:31:53.216 --> 00:31:57.047\nBut I wanna go ahead and reverse this.\n\n594\n00:31:57.047 --> 00:31:59.464\nAnd give it a second and\nit's gonna show me.\n\n595\n00:31:59.464 --> 00:32:02.580\nSo this is actually a pretty cool one.\n\n596\n00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.470\nSo, it actually had a problem,\nso that's kinda cool.\n\n597\n00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:10.101\nBut anyways, this is actually a really\nnice way to look at this because\n\n598\n00:32:10.101 --> 00:32:14.969\nyou're looking how did this wireless\ndevice come into my wired network,\n\n599\n00:32:14.969 --> 00:32:18.205\nwhere did it go and\nhow did it get to the Internet?\n\n600\n00:32:18.205 --> 00:32:20.671\nWell, probably this would\nbe an anchor controller and\n\n601\n00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:23.456\nthen it would go send it to the,\nif that was a guest Internet and\n\n602\n00:32:23.456 --> 00:32:25.993\nit would send it to the Internet or\nsomething like that.\n\n603\n00:32:25.993 --> 00:32:28.760\nSo we can watch the flow as this occurs.\n\n604\n00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.990\nThis is a pretty cool little thing.\n\n605\n00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.060\nSo, basically got an error here at\nthe 5508 didn't know how to get it back.\n\n606\n00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.370\nWe can probably do it again and\nmake it work.\n\n607\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.405\nSee if it can do it, maybe not.\n\n608\n00:32:39.405 --> 00:32:41.780\n[LAUGH] But it should be able to.\n\n609\n00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.860\nIt's obviously getting back, so\nit's not able to do it this time.\n\n610\n00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.840\nSo that's kinda cool, I like that.\n\n611\n00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.660\nAnd so, we'd be able to troubleshoot and\nfind out where our problem is.\n\n612\n00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.030\nBut, maybe we were doing\nthis because we're saying,\n\n613\n00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.770\nhey, the wireless device wasn't working.\n\n614\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.810\nAnd we can see that maybe the controller\nhas a configuration issue.\n\n615\n00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.780\nRight, so,\nI wouldn't be able to see that from here.\n\n616\n00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.580\nBut we can go out there and look at it.\n\n617\n00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.460\nI can't open it up.\n\n618\n00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.440\nBut I could from,\nlet's see if I can see that from here.\n\n619\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.980\nI don't think it was on here.\n\n620\n00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.530\nBut I know what I want to do.\n\n621\n00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:19.470\nI want to go back here and\nto here, and we were here.\n\n622\n00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.730\nAnd find the issues here.\n\n623\n00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.750\nAnd I wanna say check this out.\n\n624\n00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.570\nSo if I come here,\nit's not letting me view entopology.\n\n625\n00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.730\nLet me come to this one\nwhere I reversed it.\n\n626\n00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.820\nLet me reverse start new.\n\n627\n00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.064\nLet me find the one that worked.\n\n628\n00:33:35.064 --> 00:33:39.648\nHold on, I wanna show you guys something,\nand reverse this.\n\n629\n00:33:39.648 --> 00:33:44.550\nAnd then, so what we could do then is,\nI'm seeing this here.\n\n630\n00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.260\nAnd then I'm seeing my reverse path.\n\n631\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.250\nSo I wanna say,\nshow me this in the topology.\n\n632\n00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.750\nSo I'm gonna say, view this in topology.\n\n633\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.700\nAnd so now it's kinda hard to\nsee cuz it's already green, but\n\n634\n00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.190\nit says dark so here's my 5508 right?\n\n635\n00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.890\nSo now, because I was like,\nwhere's my 5508?\n\n636\n00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.920\nWhere's my problem?\n\n637\n00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.135\nWell I watched this right?\n\n638\n00:34:02.135 --> 00:34:05.272\nIt came to the distribution and\nit went to the campus core,\n\n639\n00:34:05.272 --> 00:34:07.394\ninto the 5508 which is off of here.\n\n640\n00:34:07.394 --> 00:34:11.082\nAll right, so\nat this point here I'm looking at this and\n\n641\n00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:15.960\nso this is gonna give me some more\ninformation about this 5508 right?\n\n642\n00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.838\nSo very very cool stuff.\n\n643\n00:34:18.838 --> 00:34:22.060\nSo then I'd come in here, and\ntake a look at this 5508,\n\n644\n00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.610\nobviously we need to at this point.\n\n645\n00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.450\nBut that was some cool stuff on\nhow you can find some problems and\n\n646\n00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:33.210\ntrace it through and\nthen we can see it in the topology and\n\n647\n00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.760\nwatch the path as it came and went back.\n\n648\n00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.720\nAnd we gotta find out why it\ndidn't go in there [LAUGH].\n\n649\n00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.390\nAnd we can see everyone\nwe're connected to.\n\n650\n00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.300\nSo I'm gonna run out to that controller\nand find out what's the problem with that.\n\n651\n00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.640\nBut this is a really great way\nto see a problem like this.\n\n652\n00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.100\nWhy is this wireless host not working?\n\n653\n00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.380\nWe saw it got to the controller but\nthe controller wasn't responding.\n\n654\n00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.990\n>> Well, excellent Todd.\n\n655\n00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:59.040\nThere's a lot of information here on that\nevolution of the intelligent networks.\n\n656\n00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.050\nAnd it's a bunch of new objectives that\nwe have to make sure that we understand\n\n657\n00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.520\nas we go into that CCNA routing and\nswitching exam.\n\n658\n00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.070\nSo in this episode remember that\nwhat we took a look at here today\n\n659\n00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.180\nis actually a bunch of information that\nwe have to make sure that we understand.\n\n660\n00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.470\nI wrote a few notes down to make\nsure that I've covered everything.\n\n661\n00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.970\nRemember that we want to understand\nthe ability to do stack wise, right.\n\n662\n00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.560\nHaving the ability to have multiple\nswitches where we can just add them in and\n\n663\n00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.880\nstill have a single management interface.\n\n664\n00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.120\nWell, that's really the evolution of going\nfrom managing every individual switch,\n\n665\n00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.420\nto now being able to control it, and\n\n666\n00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.970\nall we're doing is we're connecting those\ncables together instead of having to do\n\n667\n00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.350\nmultiple configurations, a master switch\nwill actually help us to do that.\n\n668\n00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.640\nWe also then took a look at\nthe idea of cloud computing.\n\n669\n00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.470\nRight, there's three different\nbasic models, right?\n\n670\n00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.620\nThe overall idea of just infrastructure\nas a service where we're\n\n671\n00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.670\nprovided our network.\n\n672\n00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.320\nThere's platform where we've provided our\nnetwork and then some basic software like\n\n673\n00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.080\nthe operating system, and then of\ncourse there's application which is\n\n674\n00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:04.200\nus not providing anything, and everybody\nelse actually providing everything for us.\n\n675\n00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.940\nAnd Todd gave us an example like\nOffice 365 or even the Google Works\n\n676\n00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.530\nstuff that's also out there and\ntheir office type of products.\n\n677\n00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.540\nAnd then of course to actually even bring\nmore control into that into the cloud.\n\n678\n00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:22.855\nCisco is what we're defining here\nas the SDN to software defined.\n\n679\n00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:24.560\n[LAUGH] Trying to remember.\n\n680\n00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.176\nSoftware defined networking, but even\nhave more control on that is that APIC.\n\n681\n00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:30.182\nThe-\n>> Yeah.\n\n682\n00:36:30.182 --> 00:36:31.325\nAPIC-EM.\n\n683\n00:36:31.325 --> 00:36:32.910\n>> APIC-EM Okay.\n\n684\n00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.270\nYeah the enterprise models.\n\n685\n00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.240\n>> Two different products.\n\n686\n00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:40.310\n>> Right, yeah, so the application\npolicy infrastructure controller and\n\n687\n00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.320\nthen Stands for the enterprise\nmodule itself, which is what\n\n688\n00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.180\nTodd was actually demonstrating in this\nlast little bit, as far as the lab goes.\n\n689\n00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.650\nNow, all this stuff, right,\nagain if you're going,\n\n690\n00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.500\nwow that was really over my head.\n\n691\n00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.130\nWell, that's why you actually have\nnot only this as a resource but\n\n692\n00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.945\nyou also have Todd's new\nbook as a resource as well.\n\n693\n00:37:00.945 --> 00:37:03.545\nThat you want to make sure that\nyou go out, and, go ahead and\n\n694\n00:37:03.545 --> 00:37:05.165\nexamine those topics again, too.\n\n695\n00:37:05.165 --> 00:37:06.215\nAnd then try and\n\n696\n00:37:06.215 --> 00:37:09.975\ndo as much as you can, especially in\ngetting familiar with this technology.\n\n697\n00:37:09.975 --> 00:37:12.545\nIf there's anything, if you're like me,\nand you're working in small to medium\n\n698\n00:37:12.545 --> 00:37:16.575\nsized networks, some of this stuff is\nreally kind of outside of our realm.\n\n699\n00:37:16.575 --> 00:37:18.825\nBut it's not that they're not gonna\nask you about it on the exam.\n\n700\n00:37:18.825 --> 00:37:21.670\nSo make sure that you go\nover this stuff again.\n\n701\n00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:26.620\nWell that brings our episode here to\nan end, and our series here to a close.\n\n702\n00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.510\nAs far as what we're actually doing, and\nso that means if you've gone through every\n\n703\n00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:35.311\nsingle one of these modules,\nyou actually have now completed the ICND\n\n704\n00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:40.570\n2 show itself, and the content, and\nyou've gone through all the modules and\n\n705\n00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.950\nTodd has actually shown is, just about\nevery single objective that's actually\n\n706\n00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.920\ngoing to be hit there so\nwe're pretty much right there at the end.\n\n707\n00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.163\nAnd that means, Todd, it's a great place\nfor us to end this episode as well.\n\n708\n00:37:51.163 --> 00:37:54.392\n>> It is, and not just about every,\nhe said just about every, no, no,\n\n709\n00:37:54.392 --> 00:37:56.640\nno I covered in depth every objective.\n\n710\n00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.480\nGo through every painstaking minute\nof this from beginning to end and\n\n711\n00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.200\nconfigure everything with me.\n\n712\n00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.222\nAnd you're gonna be set right.\n\n713\n00:38:04.222 --> 00:38:07.135\nYou want to read my book or\na book for foundation,\n\n714\n00:38:07.135 --> 00:38:11.670\nto dig more deep into more understanding\n>> Very modest of you Todd\n\n715\n00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.580\n>> Well here's the deal.\n\n716\n00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.660\nI mean the idea is that\nwe wanna be successful,\n\n717\n00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.320\nand you're not going to be successful by\njust reading anyone's book by themselves.\n\n718\n00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.260\nSo mine or Cisco Press or\nwhatever, watching a video series.\n\n719\n00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.542\nYou have to do a lot of different things.\n\n720\n00:38:23.542 --> 00:38:24.053\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n721\n00:38:24.053 --> 00:38:27.527\nI always tell people read more than one\nsource because we're all coming at it from\n\n722\n00:38:27.527 --> 00:38:30.798\na different direction and whatever,\nand you know it doesn't always fit for\n\n723\n00:38:30.798 --> 00:38:31.570\neverybody.\n\n724\n00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.218\nOne person's personality and\nhow they write.\n\n725\n00:38:34.218 --> 00:38:39.170\n>> All right, well signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n726\n00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.430\n>> And I'm Todd Lamey thank you very much.\n\n727\n00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.251\n>> Thank you for joining us for\nthis entire ICND2 series.\n\n728\n00:38:44.251 --> 00:38:50.133\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
