  "description": "This Accelerated Cisco CCNA Routing + Switching show helps candidate review their exam readiness for 200-105 exam.  It’s a fast paced and hard hitting review of every exam objective for latest CCNA 200-105 exam. The accelerated pace is helpful for those that are ready for the exam and give an in-depth review of each objective you may encounter for CCNA R+S.\nThe episodes can be used as part of building a candidate's knowledge and skills in LAN switching technologies such as trunking, VLAN trunking protocol and dealing with Switching loops along with troubleshooting. IPv4 and IPv6 routing technologies in RIPng, EIGRP and OSPF are also discussed and configured helping the candidate to understand and troubleshoot configuration and routing issues. WAN technologies, infrastructure services, and infrastructure maintenance technologies are also described and configured to help the CCNA candidate not only for the exam but also for business and production use.",

He describes the STP Root Bridge Selection and how non-root bridges decides it’s root port as well as how to decide whether ports block or forward data.   Todd also introduces the different STP standards of 802.1d, 802.1w, and 802.1s.",

OSPF is a link-state protocol that uses the Shortest Path First Algorithm to determine the best route to the destination and does more, according to Todd.  He tells us that OSPF also creates a neighbor table, topology table and routing table based on “cost” (bandwidth).  OSPF doesn’t exchange routes so much as link-states between routers, Todd says.  He also describes that routers can report different LSAs depending on whether the router is an ABR, Area Border Router or ASBR, Autonomous System Border Router.  He also shows the basic OSPF configuration styles using the ‘Router OSPF <Process-ID>’ command or per interface using ‘ip ospf <proccess-id> area<area-id>1’",
