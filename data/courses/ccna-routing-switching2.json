It’s a fast paced and hard hitting review of every exam objective for latest CCNA 200-105 exam. The accelerated pace is helpful for those that are ready for the exam and give an in-depth review of each objective you may encounter for CCNA R+S.\nThe episodes can be used as part of building a candidate's knowledge and skills in LAN switching technologies such as trunking, VLAN trunking protocol and dealing with Switching loops along with troubleshooting. IPv4 and IPv6 routing technologies in RIPng, EIGRP and OSPF are also discussed and configured helping the candidate to understand and troubleshoot configuration and routing issues. WAN technologies, infrastructure services, and infrastructure maintenance technologies are also described and configured to help the CCNA candidate not only for the exam but also for business and production use.",

you to\nthe new ICND2 content, getting ready for\n\n4\n00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:20.167\nthat CCNA routing and\nswitching exam, Exam number 200-105.\n\n5\n00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.372\nAnd here to give us some details\non it is gonna be Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:24.141\nThank you for joining us.\n\n7\n00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:26.151\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nit's great to be here and be back.\n\n8\n00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.072\nWe're gonna jump into ICND2.\n\n9\n00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:33.190\nHopefully you've gone though ICND1 and\nCCENT, and maybe even took your exam and\n\n10\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.511\nthat's under your belt.\n\n11\n00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:37.996\nOr you're looking to build some more\nfoundation before you take your CCENT,\n\n12\n00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.410\nthat's a good idea.\n\n13\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.320\nAll right, so in these episodes\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.350\nstart with deep understanding\nof switching, all right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.400\nWe're gonna do enhanced switching,\nand that includes\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.580\na deep dive into spanning tree protocol\nand rapid spanning tree protocol.\n\n17\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.620\nAlso, back on the objectives\nfrom at least six years ago\n\n18\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.014\non the CCNA is something\ncalled virtual trunk protocol.\n\n19\n00:01:00.014 --> 00:01:04.740\nSo it's back, right, and we're gonna\ngo through VTP and learn how to use\n\n20\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.400\nthat in CDP to find your bridge and to\nupdate your databases and stuff like that.\n\n21\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.550\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and have\nsome fun after we get through all those\n\n22\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.850\nepisodes, and hit something ether\nchannel where we're bundling things.\n\n23\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.009\nSo we're not using spanning tree, really,\nor we're gonna bundle our links so\n\n24\n00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.850\nspanning tree sees it as one link.\n\n25\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.209\nAnd then we're gonna hit HSRP, which\nis somewhat of a disappointment to me,\n\n26\n00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.314\nbecause we really shouldn't use HSRP\ntoday, you should be using GLBP.\n\n27\n00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.578\nBut in the new objectives\nthey came out with in 2016,\n\n28\n00:01:32.578 --> 00:01:36.185\nthey took that off when it was on before,\nand only left on HSRP.\n\n29\n00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:38.700\nAnd that's a mistake as far as I can tell.\n\n30\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.333\nBut, we're gonna go through HSRP\nin detail, we're gonna use it,\n\n31\n00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.364\nyou're gonna pass your CCNA and\nthen never use HSRP again, only use GLBP.\n\n32\n00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:48.357\nAll right, and we'll talk about that.\n\n33\n00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:52.743\nAll right, then we're gonna hit\na deep dive into EIGRP and EIGRPv6.\n\n34\n00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:54.946\nWe're gonna spend a good\namount of time on that,\n\n35\n00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:58.975\nreally understanding it's a routing\nprotocol that just always seems to work.\n\n36\n00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:02.593\nAnd unlike the next episode after that,\nOSPF E2 and OSPF E3,\n\n37\n00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:07.165\nit's a little more convoluted and we have\na little bit more work to do with OSPF,\n\n38\n00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:10.119\nand a little bit more\nfundamental understanding.\n\n39\n00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.855\nSo it is a much bigger section than\nit is on EIGRP cuz there's just so\n\n40\n00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:14.803\nmuch more to it.\n\n41\n00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.961\nAll right, so after that we're\ngonna hit troubleshooting.\n\n42\n00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:22.375\nI'm gonna go back to all our routing\nprotocols, and default routes.\n\n43\n00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:26.660\nAnd we're going to look at IP and\nIPv6 access lists,\n\n44\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.719\nboth standard and extended, right?\n\n45\n00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.564\nSo, in the CCENT only covered\nstandard access lists, but\n\n46\n00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:38.960\nnow they don't get real big into extended\naccess lists in the CCNA anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.710\nBut in the troubleshooting section,\nwe're gonna have to understand\n\n48\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.350\nextended access lists and\nbe able to troubleshoot both IP 4 and\n\n49\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.350\nIP version 6 and\nthat's kinda a new objective there.\n\n50\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.070\nThen, we're gonna go and hit, in the\ntroubleshooting section, we've got SPAN\n\n51\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.690\nand we've got service level agreements\nthat we're gonna use to troubleshoot and\n\n52\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.360\ntest our networks with, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.070\nSo then after that we're\ngonna hit wide area networks.\n\n54\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.290\nNow, the good news is,\nafter all of these years,\n\n55\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.260\nFrame Relay is no longer on a CCNA,\nthat is so long overdue.\n\n56\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.860\nSo starting in 2016 they took out the\nFrame Relay and we've got more PPP really.\n\n57\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.470\nSo we still have some serial links, right?\n\n58\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.270\nI don't see those a lot in any of\nmy customers too much anymore.\n\n59\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.230\nBut if you have serial links,\nyou can still run HTLC,\n\n60\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.080\nthat's still in the objectives,\nbut PPP, multi-link PPP.\n\n61\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.590\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nhit our tunnels,\n\n62\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.540\nwe'll top out VPN, build a GRE tunnel.\n\n63\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.020\nAnd then we're gonna end with a really\nfun lab on BGP, border gateway protocols.\n\n64\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.850\nSo that's a new objective as well.\n\n65\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.650\nAnd then we're gonna end with\nnetwork device security and\n\n66\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.230\nevolution of intelligent networks.\n\n67\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.030\nThose will be our last episodes.\n\n68\n00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.312\nThey're not nearly as long, so we start\noff with really long episodes, right?\n\n69\n00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:49.658\nWe kinda then have some fun,\nget into EIGRP,\n\n70\n00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:54.780\nget into some real heavy depth in OSPF and\ntroubleshooting, right?\n\n71\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.888\nAnd then we end up with\nsome fun new stuff, right?\n\n72\n00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:01.377\nThat's how the new ICND2 is gonna go,\nso stick around.\n\n73\n00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:04.740\nLet's head, right now,\ninto enhanced switching.\n\n74\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.507\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OSPF is a link-state protocol that uses the Shortest Path First Algorithm to determine the best route to the destination and does more, according to Todd.  He tells us that OSPF also creates a neighbor table, topology table and routing table based on “cost” (bandwidth).  OSPF doesn’t exchange routes so much as link-states between routers, Todd says.  He also describes that routers can report different LSAs depending on whether the router is an ABR, Area Border Router or ASBR, Autonomous System Border Router.  He also shows the basic OSPF configuration styles using the ‘Router OSPF <Process-ID>’ command or per interface using ‘ip ospf <proccess-id> area<area-id>1’",
