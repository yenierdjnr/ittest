  "description": "The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is the most well known Cisco certification path. It takes the general networking theory from the CCENT certification and applies it in real world scenarios. It moves beyond configuring individual devices into more complex territory often requiring the configuration of numerous devices to create a robust and optimized network. While studying for this certification, you will revisit the routing and switching topics from the CCENT in more depth as you learn about and implement the advanced features of each technology.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.781\n[SOUND] In this video, we're gonna take\na look at the Cisco CCNA Routing and\n\n2\n00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:11.681\nSwitching 200-105 exam content on ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.516\nNow, the CCNA Routing and Switching is a\ncertification that covers entry level tops\n\n4\n00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.060\nfor people who are getting\ninto the networking field.\n\n5\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.016\nPeople who wanna learn how to configure\nCisco routers, Cisco switches and\n\n6\n00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:26.052\nother basic Cisco concepts as well as\nnetworking fundamentals and theory.\n\n7\n00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:28.060\nThat makes this a great certification for\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.220\nsomebody to pursue when they're just\nstarting out in the networking world.\n\n9\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.170\nNow CCNA is a part of a larger\ncertification scheme from Cisco that\n\n10\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.180\nactually begins with the CCENT, the Cisco\nCertified Entry Network Technician.\n\n11\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.370\nAnd as a result,\n\n12\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.280\nthey expect you to have that certification\nbefore moving into the CCNA.\n\n13\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.872\nThis is the next step in your\ncertification career with Cisco.\n\n14\n00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:54.242\nAfter that, yo u move into more advanced\nthings like CCNP and CCIU, which are for\n\n15\n00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.835\npeople who are already established\nin the networking field.\n\n16\n00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:58.161\nBut let's take a look at CCNA,\n\n17\n00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.304\nbecause that's what this\ncourse is gonna be based on.\n\n18\n00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:03.361\nNow that the CCNA itself or\nthe CCNA Routing and\n\n19\n00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.125\nSwitching is the one that focuses\non routers, and switches.\n\n20\n00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.864\nThere are other CCNA's that are out\nthere that focus on security or\n\n21\n00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:14.400\nservice provider storage,\nother types of technologies like that.\n\n22\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.205\nNow, the CCNA certification is\nactually made up of two exams.\n\n23\n00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:20.919\nAnd the first exam,\nwhat Cisco calls the ICND1 or\n\n24\n00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:25.260\nInterconnecting Cisco Networking Devices\nexam.\n\n25\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.611\nThat one is what gets you the CCENT\ncertification and then you've got\n\n26\n00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:35.325\nthe ICND2 exam, which is what the 200-105\ncontent is that you're about to view.\n\n27\n00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:40.390\nNow, you can't just take the 200-105 exam.\n\n28\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.460\nIf you do,\nthat's only half the certification.\n\n29\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.410\nSo what you need to do to\nachieve the CCNA Routing and\n\n30\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.230\nSwitching certification\nis one of two things.\n\n31\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.955\nMost people opt to do the two exams.\n\n32\n00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:59.211\nThe 100-105 ICND1 exam that can do\nthe CCNT followed by the 200-105 exam,\n\n33\n00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:03.900\nwhich would then combined with\nthe CCNT get you your CCNA.\n\n34\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.470\nNow if you're already familiar\nwith Cisco equipment and\n\n35\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.200\nyou've been working with it awhile, you\ncan choose to take the consolidated exam,\n\n36\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410\nwhat they call CCNA composite.\n\n37\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.781\nIt's one exam, the 200-125 and\n\n38\n00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:23.047\nit contains test material from\nboth the ICND1 and the ICND2.\n\n39\n00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:25.161\nSo, it's basically just\ncombining it into one big test.\n\n40\n00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.054\nIt makes it where you\njust take a shorter test,\n\n41\n00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:30.510\nas opposed to having to take two tests.\n\n42\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.102\nSo that's kinda nice, but price-wise,\nit doesn't save you any money.\n\n43\n00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:36.988\nThe composite exam actually costs as much\nas the other two exams combined together.\n\n44\n00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:40.961\nSo it's not a money saving thing,\nit's really just a time saving thing.\n\n45\n00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.301\nI usually encourage people to do\nthe separate exams, cuz it allows you to\n\n46\n00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:48.030\ndivide up your study material and\nit makes life a little easier on you.\n\n47\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.150\nFor the ICND1 exam, you only need to\nknow the content from our CCNT show.\n\n48\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.041\nAnd for the 200-105, you just need\nthe content from our CCNA show,\n\n49\n00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.220\nthis one that's about to follow.\n\n50\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.360\nSo, that does kind of shrink things down\nto make it a little more manageable as\n\n51\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.680\nfar as all of your study materials.\n\n52\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.740\nNow as far as what's on the exam itself,\n\n53\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.390\nwell, the exam is made up\nof five different domains.\n\n54\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.094\nIt starts of at LAN Switching Technologies\nthat makes up a quarter of the exam, 26%.\n\n55\n00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:17.128\nSo, that focuses entirely\non Cisco switches.\n\n56\n00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:22.008\nAfter that, we get Routing Technologies\nwhich is well, obviously, going to be\n\n57\n00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:27.060\nrouters and that compiles about 29% of\nthe exam, then we got WAN Technologies.\n\n58\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.749\nNow WAN that's Wide Area Networking.\n\n59\n00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:35.401\nWAN connections are on routers, so this is\nreally an extension of a router module.\n\n60\n00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:37.889\nSo, we have a little bit more in routing.\n\n61\n00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.998\nAfter that, we move into some really\nneat things, Infrastructure Services and\n\n62\n00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:42.650\nInfrastructure Maintenance.\n\n63\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.689\nInfrastructure Services is where we\ntake those routers and switches, and\n\n64\n00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.713\nwe see what they can do beyond routing,\nand switching.\n\n65\n00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:54.247\nYou'll find where a lot of routers can\nactually be VPN servers or they can\n\n66\n00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:59.480\ndo other things in addition to just being\na router and switches are the same way.\n\n67\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.226\nSome switches can actually act like\nrouters, they can be layer three switches.\n\n68\n00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:06.439\nWe have switches that can perform quality\nof service, all sorts of really neat\n\n69\n00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.370\nfeatures and that's what we start\nto see in infrastructure services.\n\n70\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.973\nNow one of the big pitfalls we see out in\nproduction is that a lot of people learn\n\n71\n00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:17.811\nhow to set things up, but they don't learn\nhow to keep them running over long periods\n\n72\n00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:20.918\nof time and that's what\nInfrastructure Maintenance is all about.\n\n73\n00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:24.854\nOnce your deployment is done, how do\nyou keep everything running nice and\n\n74\n00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:26.610\nsmooth and moving along?\n\n75\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.681\nAnd so that's kinda last piece\nthat we cover when we jump into\n\n76\n00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:33.902\nInfrastructure Maintenance and notice how\nthis start to get a little bit smaller,\n\n77\n00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:35.426\n16%, 14% and 15%.\n\n78\n00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:39.275\nThese are topics that are important in and\nof themselves, but\n\n79\n00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:43.800\nnot as important as getting actually\nwith the switches and the routers.\n\n80\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.634\nAnd when you take a look\nat the technologies,\n\n81\n00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:49.109\nif you've already done you CCENT, you'll\nsee some of these topics are familiar that\n\n82\n00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.301\nyou've already learned about VLANs,\nfor example.\n\n83\n00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:52.913\nWell, here we go a bit further.\n\n84\n00:04:52.913 --> 00:04:55.522\nWe learn more about VLANs,\nas an advanced functionality.\n\n85\n00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:58.574\nWe learn about spanning tree protocol and\nloop protection.\n\n86\n00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:02.156\nThese are features that are built-in to\nevery Cisco switch that you just need to\n\n87\n00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:06.430\nknow how to take advantage of them,\nhow to actually use and implement them.\n\n88\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.390\nOn the routing side, under CCENT,\nyou learned about the RIP protocol.\n\n89\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.559\nHere, we learn about EIGRP and OSPF.\n\n90\n00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.369\nWe also cover some IPv6 routing.\n\n91\n00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.008\nSo again,\n\n92\n00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:21.340\nmore advanced functionality based on\nwhat we learned in the CCENT show.\n\n93\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.760\nAnother reason why you really wanna make\nsure you completed your CCENT before\n\n94\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.875\ndiving into this, so that you have\nall your foundational knowledge.\n\n95\n00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:31.165\nSo that's an example of what's\non the exam and I already said,\n\n96\n00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:32.970\nwho it was really targeted to?\n\n97\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.328\nIt's targeted to that person who's wanting\nto get started in a networking career.\n\n98\n00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:39.296\nSo maybe you've been working\nwith systems admin up until now,\n\n99\n00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:42.658\ndoing different software support and\nyou wanna move into networking or\n\n100\n00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:44.674\nmaybe you're just getting started in IT,\n\n101\n00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:48.010\nbut you've decided that this is your\npassion that you wanna get into.\n\n102\n00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.515\nThis is a great certification for that.\n\n103\n00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:53.559\nNow if you watch our series and you study\nthe materials, you go through the labs,\n\n104\n00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.850\nyou practice, you get ready and you\nfeel like you're ready to take the exam.\n\n105\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.545\nThe next step is to go and to do it.\n\n106\n00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:02.579\nAll Cisco exams are proctored\nthrough Pearson VUE.\n\n107\n00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.758\nPearson VUE is a company that has\ntesting centers all over the world.\n\n108\n00:06:05.758 --> 00:06:10.972\nSo when you're ready to take that exam,\njust go to vue.com.\n\n109\n00:06:10.972 --> 00:06:12.388\nThat's the Pearson VUE website.\n\n110\n00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:15.694\nAnd when you go to vue.com,\nyou'll see that this guy right here and\n\n111\n00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:17.608\nyou'll go up here to for test takers and\n\n112\n00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:20.810\nyou'll tell it that you need\nto go to the test taker home.\n\n113\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.403\nAnd on that page,\n\n114\n00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:23.670\nyou'll be able to tell it what type\nof exam you're wanting to take.\n\n115\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.636\nI'm just gonna type Cisco, so\nit finds Cisco Systems right there.\n\n116\n00:06:27.636 --> 00:06:33.582\nAnd now, I can jump in and I can find\nthe exam types that are available.\n\n117\n00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:36.348\nI can find test preparation and\nother news, but\n\n118\n00:06:36.348 --> 00:06:39.270\nI can also find a test center near me.\n\n119\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.100\nOnce you find your test center,\nyou can schedule the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.084\nIt's nice that you can do it right there\nin your own neighborhood instead of having\n\n121\n00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:46.394\nto go somewhere else crazy to do it.\n\n122\n00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:49.230\nYou find one right nearby,\njump over there.\n\n123\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.340\nTake the exam, pass it and\nthen move into the world of networking.\n\n124\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.834\nSo, that's about it for the CCNA.\n\n125\n00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:59.525\nLet me just kinda reiterate the important\nparts here is that you cannot get your\n\n126\n00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:03.861\nCCNA certification, unless you complete\nboth the CCENT and the CCNA and\n\n127\n00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:07.131\nit's up to you whether you\nwanna do those one at a time or\n\n128\n00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:11.150\nyou wanna do them at the same\ntime in the composite exam.\n\n129\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.330\nSo, that is an important one.\n\n130\n00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.435\nOur shows are based around\nthe individual exam,\n\n131\n00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.346\ncuz that's what make sense to most people.\n\n132\n00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:22.350\nThey do the CCENT exam first and\nthen they do the CCNA exam separate.\n\n133\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.786\nIf you do the composite, you need\nto study material from both shows.\n\n134\n00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:28.560\nJust combine them together and that's\nwhat's gonna be on the composite exam.\n\n135\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.595\nIt's a large body of knowledge and\nthat can be a little challenging for\n\n136\n00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:32.220\nsome people.\n\n137\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.720\nAfter that, go and\ntake that exam and your in business.\n\n138\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.375\nSo if this sounds like the right thing for\nyou, then you're in the right place.\n\n139\n00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.653\nStay tuned,\ncuz we've got that content coming up.\n\n140\n00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:44.023\nBut if you haven't done your CCENT,\njump over.\n\n141\n00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:46.426\nThe ITProTV library's got\nall sorts of certifications.\n\n142\n00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:50.177\nJump over to the CCENT show,\ncatch that content.\n\n143\n00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:52.165\nThat's the real place to start out.\n\n144\n00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:55.788\nIf you're just not sure about Cisco,\nmaybe you wanna learn networking,\n\n145\n00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:59.119\nbut you're not really ready to get\nmarried to a particular vendor,\n\n146\n00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:02.300\nyou could also check out\nthe CompTIA Network+ certification.\n\n147\n00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.678\nNetwork+ is vendor neutral.\n\n148\n00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:05.580\nIt covers a lot of fundamentals in theory.\n\n149\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.899\nIt's really about half the content\nthat's right here in the CCNA.\n\n150\n00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:11.194\nThere's a good bit of\noverlap between the two.\n\n151\n00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:13.348\nBut with Network+, it's vendor neutral.\n\n152\n00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:15.596\nSo, you don't have to worry\nabout being tied just to Cisco.\n\n153\n00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:19.161\nMaybe you work with Juniper equipment or\nHP, 3Com, whoever.\n\n154\n00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:22.136\nThat gives you a little bit\nmore of a broader basis.\n\n155\n00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:26.281\nOn the Cisco side though, you're learning\nthe Cisco way of doing things and\n\n156\n00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:31.100\nthey are the network leader when it comes\nto networking devices and technologies.\n\n157\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.060\nSo, it is a great company to learn from.\n\n158\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.926\nMost of the other companies out\nthere emulate what Cisco does, so\n\n159\n00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:37.917\nthat they all kind of\noperate about the same.\n\n160\n00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.833\nSo if this is the right spot for\nyou, stay tuned.\n\n161\n00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:41.956\nWe got episodes coming up.\n\n162\n00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:43.459\nIf it's not the right one,\ndefinitely check out the library.\n\n163\n00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:46.026\nWe got tons of content there\nthat are available for you.\n\n164\n00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:49.997\nI look forward to seeing you\nguys in the CCNA training.\n\n165\n00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:53.244\n[SOUND]\n\n",
