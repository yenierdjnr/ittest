  "description": "The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is the most well known Cisco certification path. It takes the general networking theory from the CCENT certification and applies it in real world scenarios. It moves beyond configuring individual devices into more complex territory often requiring the configuration of numerous devices to create a robust and optimized network. While studying for this certification, you will revisit the routing and switching topics from the CCENT in more depth as you learn about and implement the advanced features of each technology.",
