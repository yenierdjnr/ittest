Show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.950\nThis is for\nExam 200-105 as we get started here, okay?\n\n4\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.116\nIn the CCNA Routing and Switching show,\n\n5\n00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:22.014\nwe'll presume that you already have\nthe basic knowledge or your CCENT.\n\n6\n00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:26.307\nAnd that you may have already\ntaken that exam as well as you\n\n7\n00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:29.240\nare proceeding on in this course.\n\n8\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.250\nAs you do so, the foundational knowledge\nis only gonna be of help to you, okay.\n\n9\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.107\nSo let's go ahead and jump on in and take\na look at a few things that you want to\n\n10\n00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:39.941\nget prepared for\nas you are getting ready for the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.528\nSo on my screen,\nI've got this shared out for us so\n\n12\n00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:46.520\nthat we know exactly what we're\ntaking a look at for the exam itself.\n\n13\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.737\nAs you are getting ready for that exam,\nand as you finish everything up, make sure\n\n14\n00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:57.351\nyou have this exam number that we are\nlooking at, which is that 200-105 ICND2.\n\n15\n00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.418\nNow, that's the exact official\nexam name itself, and\n\n16\n00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:03.130\nalso of course, the official courseware.\n\n17\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.650\nOur show is title CCNA Routing and\nSwitching.\n\n18\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.940\nIt does actually end up,\n\n19\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.750\ncovering the material that we need to\nmake sure that we get through the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.393\nOn the exam you'll have 90 minutes,\na simulator between 55 to 65 questions.\n\n21\n00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:18.276\nThey'll never tell you how many, so\n\n22\n00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.496\nwe're gonna make sure that we\ncover every single one of the exam\n\n23\n00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:25.292\nobjectives to ensure that you have\neverything that you need to get there.\n\n24\n00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:28.578\nOkay, also of course that means\nyou'll have to sign in through\n\n25\n00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:32.000\nyour Pearson view center too,\nto make sure that you get in there.\n\n26\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.950\nIf you already signed up for\nthe CCENT exam.\n\n27\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.010\nIn doing so, you should be able to\nuse the same exact password and\n\n28\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.560\nID that you were set to do that too, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.840\nNow once you've actually got that,\nlet's take a look at just one more tab and\n\n30\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810\nwe'll come back to this\none in just a moment.\n\n31\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.170\nOn the exam pricing itself,\nwhat we're looking at of course,\n\n32\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.630\nis the idea of the associate level.\n\n33\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.966\nThat is anywhere between 165 to 325,\neach exam,\n\n34\n00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:01.299\nICND1, ICND2, those are 165 each.\n\n35\n00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.150\nIf you choose to take the combined\nexam itself, it's gonna be about $325.\n\n36\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.840\nSo there's no saving money just because\nit's one exam versus two exams,\n\n37\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.350\nyou're actually gonna end up paying,\nwell, whatever the cost is gonna be.\n\n38\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.130\nSo this in terms of US dollars.\n\n39\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.310\nMake sure you check locally where you are,\nsee what the prices are for\n\n40\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.760\nyou, and that will also help you\nto make sure that you get them.\n\n41\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.200\nOn the day of the exam, make sure\nyou show up about 15 minutes early.\n\n42\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.270\nBring the forms of ID that you need to.\n\n43\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.310\nThey'll be taking your picture once again.\n\n44\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.020\nAnd they'll of course make\nsure that you are verified\n\n45\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.220\nto who you actually are supposed to be\nbefore you go into the exam itself, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.210\nSo once you get all of that information,\nthat means you are ready then for\n\n47\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.270\nthe exam itself and you'll sit down and\nyou all, of course, sit for that exam and\n\n48\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.280\nyou'll have, again, that 90 minutes\nto complete everything that you need.\n\n49\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.740\nYou don't have time to waste on the exam,\nso even though you\n\n50\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.780\nthink that you have 55 to 65 questions,\n90 minutes, that time will fly right by.\n\n51\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.700\nSo what you wanna do of course is\ntake the most time that you can\n\n52\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.180\nduring the show that we're doing, and\n\n53\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.180\nmaster the topics that we're\nactually showing you at that point.\n\n54\n00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.230\nThe great thing is they are pretty much\nfundamental knowledge that you need and\n\n55\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.160\nwill help you not only in this,\nbut as you go on towards CCMP,\n\n56\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.740\nit will also help you out as well, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.392\nSo what are some of the topics that we'll\nbe covering inside of our show, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:31.685\nWell the easiest way to know exactly what\ntopics we'll be covering is if you go\n\n59\n00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:36.400\nback to the Cisco Learning Network,\nand you look for that exam number.\n\n60\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.685\nYou can also click on the exam topics,\nthen this is what I did\n\n61\n00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:44.750\nas I downloaded the complete list\nof topics into PDF format and\n\n62\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.970\nwe actually did go through each one of\nthese exam objectives to help us out.\n\n63\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.720\nAnd that's exactly what we'll\nbe taking a look at and doing.\n\n64\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.830\nWe broke them down into individual shows,\nthat way as we go through them,\n\n65\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.840\nwe'll be able to make sure that\nyou learn about every single topic\n\n66\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.920\nthat actually needs to be covered.\n\n67\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.370\nSo let's talk about some of the actual\nmaterial that we'll be covering.\n\n68\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.580\nSo here's the exact official copy of those\nobjectives that we're talking about.\n\n69\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.780\nSo a good quarter of the exam\nis on just LAN switching.\n\n70\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.200\nAnd we'll be hitting things\nof course like VLANs and\n\n71\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.780\nmaking sure that we understand that.\n\n72\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.572\nAs well as VLAN management with using VTP,\nokay, the VLAN trunking protocol.\n\n73\n00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.940\nSpanning tree is also a big topic for\nus too, and\n\n74\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.960\nwe'll cover the aspects\nof that as we go through.\n\n75\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.261\nAnd then of course even the idea\nof using ether channel,\n\n76\n00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:36.030\nall of that will be covered as well.\n\n77\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.990\nAs I scroll on down,\n\n78\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.730\nyou'll of course see some of the security\ninformation that we'll be covering.\n\n79\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.370\nBut we'll spend a good\nportion of the exam,\n\n80\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.030\nthe first two domain objectives, right?\n\n81\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.512\nOne covers about 25%,\nthis one covers about 30%.\n\n82\n00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:54.070\nSo altogether, this is about 51% of the\nexam is based on switching and routing.\n\n83\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.980\nAnd then in routing, we'll do a deeper\ndive than we did during our CCENT,\n\n84\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.290\nmaking sure that we can differentiate\nbetween link state and of course,\n\n85\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.820\ndistance of vector exams as well.\n\n86\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.767\nWe'll be taking a look at OSPF both for\nIPv4 and IPv6 as well as EIGRP for\n\n87\n00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:16.280\nboth, making sure that we\nunderstand how that also works.\n\n88\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.030\nWe'll be of course covering the idea\nof different WAN technologies,\n\n89\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.720\nmaking sure that we understand\nhow to configure certain\n\n90\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.960\ntypes of connections that we\nhave out to our WAN providers.\n\n91\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.220\nVerifying the type of technology\nthat's available for us.\n\n92\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.760\nSo some of it is just basic knowledge\nthat you have to get through,\n\n93\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.020\nwe'll make sure that you\nknow how to do that.\n\n94\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.927\nAnd then of course, infrastructure\nservices such as using the hot\n\n95\n00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:42.617\nstandby router protocol\nas well as QOS concepts.\n\n96\n00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:44.607\nAgain, very basic at this point, and\n\n97\n00:05:44.607 --> 00:05:48.906\nthen even traffic filtering with access\ncontrol list which is a big part.\n\n98\n00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:51.040\nUsing the APIC-EM,\n\n99\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.720\na path trace tool is another portion of\nsomething that we'll be covering as well.\n\n100\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.510\nAnd then lastly,\n\n101\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.680\ninfrastructure maintenance, making sure we\nunderstand the basics of monitoring tools.\n\n102\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.790\nThat we have available as well as\ndifferent troubleshooting tools\n\n103\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.700\nthat are out there, such as using the IP,\nthe ICMP echo-based SLAs.\n\n104\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.040\nAs well as using SPAN ports or\nport mirroring to help us out.\n\n105\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.650\nConfiguring things like triple A,\nmaking sure that we understand that.\n\n106\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.400\nDefining the idea of software defined\nnetworking in our enterprise by using,\n\n107\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.190\nof course,\ntalking about network program ability.\n\n108\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070\nAnd of course even at the end here,\n\n109\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.630\ntroubleshooting basic layer\nthree end to end connectivity.\n\n110\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.972\nAll of those different topics for\n\n111\n00:06:30.972 --> 00:06:35.600\nus will make sure that we do cover and\nthat we don't skip a single thing.\n\n112\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.490\nIt's very important that what you do as\nyou get ready for this exam, of course,\n\n113\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.880\nis to make sure that you take the time\nto master a topic before you move on.\n\n114\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.880\nSo for example,\nif you're not sure about OSPF,\n\n115\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.900\nmake sure you spend time, not only in what\nwe covered as I'm actually talking about,\n\n116\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.400\nbut spend extra time in\nreading up on it as well.\n\n117\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.910\nBecause there may be things\nthat you have a question about,\n\n118\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.890\nI didn't get around to\nevery single question.\n\n119\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.760\nMake sure you spend time in\nreading about that as well.\n\n120\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.240\nThen make sure you get that and\nthen move on to your next topic.\n\n121\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.724\nDo not just think that just because I\nhave a good enough understanding of it,\n\n122\n00:07:14.724 --> 00:07:15.784\nI should move on.\n\n123\n00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:19.410\nYou want to make sure you feel\nconfident on the day of the exam.\n\n124\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.260\nI know what I need to for OSPF, I know\nwhat I need to for EIGRP, because you\n\n125\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.130\ndo not have the time on that day to begin\nthe guess of what needs to be done.\n\n126\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.210\nSo how are we gonna make sure\nthat we help to show you\n\n127\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.910\nall the concepts that we need to?\n\n128\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.830\nThe great thing is with ITProTV,\n\n129\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.588\nwe'll also of course be using well\nour practice labs partner as well.\n\n130\n00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.850\nOur practice labs partners have\npreconfigured labs set ups for\n\n131\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.140\nus that will allow us to be able\nto do every lab that's defined,\n\n132\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.460\nalong with those exam objectives\nto help you to get through that.\n\n133\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.300\nNow the nice thing about this is\nthat we're not using any simulators.\n\n134\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.080\nEverything that is done through\npractice labs, for Cisco at least, and\n\n135\n00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.725\nI think everything else through\nthem is done on real equipment.\n\n136\n00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:09.120\nSo there is not a simulation, when we\nsay that, we're actually using a router.\n\n137\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.240\nWe're really using a router.\n\n138\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.220\nWe're not using an emulator,\nwe're not using a simulator.\n\n139\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.630\nEverything is

that way, you'll actually be able\nto do those labs on your own as well,\n\n142\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.940\nprobably even better than the way that\nI'll do them because I tend to make a
